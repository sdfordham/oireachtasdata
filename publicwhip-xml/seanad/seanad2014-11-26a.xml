    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600003#B00100"><p>I welcome the Leader's statement with regard to the debate on the banking inquiry.  We will be discussing the terms of reference today and it is good that anyone who wishes to contribute will be able to do so.  I would advise Members that a lot of work went into this at numerous meetings of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I particularly want to thank the staff who were involved in all the preparatory work that was done.  I am sure that people will have various views this afternoon, but I agree with the Leader and welcome the fact that if more people want to get in, it will be permitted.</p><p>I also thank the Leader for ensuring that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, will come here today to talk about the availability of certain medicines.  While it is only for 30 minutes, it is something, and I thank the Leader for arranging that.  I intend to raise with the Minister for Health the ongoing issue of Fampyra, the MS drug.  I am sure Members are probably sick and tired of hearing about this, but it concerns 1,500 people.  I have testimonies which I will read for the Minister this afternoon from people who have had to give up work because they cannot access this drug.  It makes absolutely no sense.  I thank the Leader, however, for arranging for the Minister for Health to be here later today.  Hopefully, following today's debate we might get some movement within the HSE and the Department.  The Minister is responsible and can move this matter along.</p><p>I welcome the Government's row-back and climb-down on discretionary medical cards.  This is important in a couple of respects.  For two years, Fine Gael and Labour told the Opposition that we were scare-mongering and that people's medical cards were not being taken off them.  We were also told there was no issue with discretionary medical cards, but the Government has now recognised that there is a major issue.  People with life-long and life-threatening illnesses, including individual medical needs, have had their cards taken off them or were being refused cards.  The announcement in this regard is welcome.</p><p>The Government, however, has been good at making health-related announcements but very bad at following through on them.  Nearly two years ago, it announced free GP care for under sixes, yet this has still not been introduced.  The Government has twice announced free GP care for the over-70s, but that is still not in operation.  I would therefore like to have specific data.  A clinical advisory panel is to be established but when will that actually occur?  If a person applies for a discretionary medical card today, I assume his or her application will go into the old system.  Will a commencement date be set for this to happen?  What preparatory work has gone into this?  Is it the case that this will be re-announced, like the free GP care for under sixes, just before the general election, whenever that is next year?</p><p>To clarify many of these points, the Leader should arrange for the Minister for Health to attend the House to deal specifically with the issue of discretionary medical cards and the Government's climb-down announcements.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was unable to answer anything last night in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, can shed some light on the situation, including a starting date for the new process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600003#B00200"><p>I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien in welcoming today's debate on the motions concerning the banking inquiry.  As he said, we have had a series of lengthy meetings at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to debate the shape and format of the motions.  I very much welcome the fact that we are now at this stage and are having this debate which, as the Leader said, is open-ended.  It will ensure anyone who wishes to speak can do so.</p><p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, of new measures concerning discretionary medical cards.  That will give people certainty and clarity on their entitlements in this regard.</p><p>I also wish to welcome an announcement in today's newspapers that the Cabinet yesterday agreed a significant change in our law on prostitution.  It is a change that I and many others in this House have been seeking for some time.  In its report last year on prostitution law, the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality unanimously recommended that the purchase of sex should be criminalised, but not the sale.  I note that today's newspaper report said this was agreed at Cabinet yesterday and would be introduced as part of an overarching sex offences code and reform of sex offences law to be introduced this week by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I commend her on undertaking this move.  This historic announcement means that Ireland is moving forward on prostitution law reform in line with reforms that are being introduced in many other countries.  They were first introduced in Sweden, then Norway and Iceland, and most recently in Canada.  In addition, the Northern Ireland Assembly has voted for this change, as has the French National Assembly.</p><p>It seems to have greater effectiveness in tackling the demand for prostitution and in ensuring a reduction in the exploitation of women, particularly migrant women who make up such a large proportion of those engaged in prostitution in Ireland.  I really welcome this move therefore.  </p><p>Finally, I wish to welcome Miriam Lord to the Public Gallery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600003#B00300"><p>The Irish tax system was mentioned yesterday and some interesting figures have been published recently in that regard.  They show that Irish companies spend 80 hours per year in organising their tax affairs, compared to Germany which spends 218 hours.  In other words, we are very efficient in our tax system and, on that basis, we are also efficient in our ability to collect tax.  We may criticise the Department of Finance a great deal and have spoken about the mandarins there, but it seems there are occasions on which we should offer congratulations.  This is good news and it is worthy of being reported.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills should make swimming lessons compulsory for schools.  I was surprised to see that 15 EU member states have introduced compulsory swimming classes for schools.  They issue a safety passport for children.  Young people aged 12 or 13 should be able to swim.  We have had 478 deaths by drowning between 2010 and 2013.  We can do something about this.  Perhaps we can influence the Minister for Education and Skills to achieve the introduction of such swimming classes in schools.  I know there would be a cost involved but if it cost &euro;5 million to introduce such a system, I would not be surprised if we could obtain sponsorship for it.  We should think of the lives that would be saved as a result of that &euro;5 million expenditure.  It would be worthwhile making swimming lessons compulsory for 12 and 13 year olds.  In that way, we could equal the standards that have been achieved in other countries.</p></speech>

No two illnesses or sets of circumstances are ever the same for those looking for a medical card.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that a person with a terminal illness is no longer required to reapply for a card.  This stipulation was beyond comprehension.  The Minister is to be commended in his far-reaching and sensible approach to this matter.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss the new criteria surrounding medical card eligibility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600004#C00200"><p>As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for justice, I rise to acknowledge and congratulate Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan on her appointment as Garda Commissioner.  It is important to note that the chief Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and many others in political and civil society also welcomed the announcement.  It was done in a very transparent and fair way and will bring a fresh approach to policing.</p><p>However, the morale of rank-and-file garda&iacute; is at an all-time low.  This is a matter I have raised before in the House.  Will the Leader convey this to the Minister for Justice and Equality?  In her reforms of the Garda, I hope morale of the force will be restored.  Respect for the force is not good and is at the lowest ebb I have seen in my lifetime.  Rank-and-file garda&iacute; were not responsible for any glitches in policing.  Their morale and authority needs to be restored, which might regenerate respect for the force in its front-line work.</p><p>Yesterday, Senator Craughwell raised the issue of funding for non-Gaeltacht islands.  There are six such islands in my constituency - Cape Clear is the only Gaeltacht island - namely, Dursey Island, Whiddy Island, Bere Island, Long Island, Hare Island and Sherkin Island.  It is ridiculous that the funding traditionally given to all these islanders will be reduced considerably or even abolished.  Many of the islands off the west Cork coast are no longer inhabited.  Two of them are in private ownership, which is a disgrace.  People are forced to leave islands because they are not getting supports.  Access to many of them can be restricted for up to ten days if winter conditions are atrocious.  Their inhabitants should be given great credit and support to continue living on these islands.  The funding for these islands, which is relatively modest, should be retained and reinforced.  Those living on these islands deserve credit for staying on them, bringing up their children on them and keeping them in our ownership.  The notion of any of the uninhabited islands being sold to private enterprise, wealthy Germans or whoever is an absolute disgrace, particularly when those who left the islands 30 or 40 years ago cannot go back to visit them because they are no-go areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600004#C00300"><p>In today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>there are three reports on housing, all of which we would agree are pertinent.  The first report, from the National Economic and Social Council, advises the Taoiseach that thousands of people will not be able to afford to buy their own homes.  It is also reported that up to one third of people will need help with their housing needs.  Effectively, the NESC report states many people will be condemned to spend the rest of their lives living in rented housing.  I have asked for debates on the private rented sector on several occasions.<br/>The second report in <i>The Irish Times</i>states that nine out of ten private rented dwellings in Dublin have failed to pass the minimum accommodation standards test.  We are condemning people to live in a rented sector that is not fit for purpose.  A debate on the rental sector is urgently required.<br/>The third report anticipates this morning&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, of a multi-billion euro strategy to deliver social housing from 2015 to 2020.  This is to be welcomed, given that those people who will not be able to afford to buy their own homes in the main will be relying on either rented housing or social housing provision.<br/>Over the past decade and a half, social housing provision has failed miserably to meet people&rsquo;s needs.  We now have 90,000 households on the housing waiting lists.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not attend the House before today&rsquo;s announcement of the social housing strategy, as I would have liked the House to have an opportunity to have an input into it.  All said, it would be good if the Minister attended the House as soon as possible to discuss the new social housing strategy.  A key message of this policy is that the State would be the primary driver in housing provision over the next several years.  That will be critical in breaking the boom-and-bust cycle we have seen in housing provision over the past decade.  Will the Leader arrange to have the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, attend the House to discuss the social housing strategy as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

It is a wonderful appointment and I commend the Government in agreeing with the independent assessment of her.  There were 40 applicants and she came to the top.  She is an extremely good officer who took on the drug barons in her time and was head of the training college in Templemore.  It is a great day for women.  It is 92 years since the force was formed and she is the first woman to become Garda Commissioner.  This House should send its best wishes to her on her appointment and her achievement.  It is a great day for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I find it extraordinary, however, that Deputy Clare Daly said that this appointment shows the old boys&rsquo; club is alive and well and that we can look forward to the continuation of the blue wall of silence.  Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan is a woman, not a member of the old boys&rsquo; club.  Women tend not to become members of the club.  Deputy Daly can keep her opinions to herself.  Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan is a role model for women, particularly for young women in the force and others who wish to join it.  It shows a woman can come to the top in any position in this country, be it in the role of President, as in the past, or Taoiseach, in the future.  We want more women in politics, in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p></speech>

He was an extraordinarily good officer who carried out tremendous work on behalf of the State.  I also send our best wishes to all garda&iacute; for their commitment to the State.  The Garda Inspectorate carried out an unfair report on Garda operations.  I can tell the House that the Garda Commissioner, Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, is a new brush who will carry out her responsibilities with great commitment.  She has already said that criticism levelled against the force during the recent unprecedented time would act as a roadmap for reform under her stewardship.  That is a good starting point.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach will join in giving best wishes to the new Commissioner, as they are now both members of the State carrying out very responsible jobs.</p></speech>

Following a public EU tendering process, the Minister announced that Stobart Air was successful in securing the tender to provide scheduled air services, subject to contracts being put in place.  This new contract will run until 31 January 2017.  Members will appreciate how important this is for tourism and business in our peripheral regions, as well as the international connectivity it gives them.</p> <p>The importance must be stressed because of the fragile state of the economy in recent times as a result of the recession.  As things have started to pick up slowly but surely, it is hugely important to continue this for the period the Minister now envisages.  I welcome it very much.</p></speech>

As the Leader acknowledged yesterday in his response, it is unacceptable that in Waterford and the south-east, 6,300 patients are waiting longer than 12 months for an out-patient appointment.  That is for an appointment just to get into the system, before there is any treatment or care.</p><p>Yesterday, we had an announcement by the Minister for Health on the review of the medical card fiasco.  It is impossible to know at this stage how that will work out.  We had the announcement from the Minister but need an opportunity to probe him on it and to find out exactly how it will impact on patients with medical cards.  There is not a Senator or Deputy who has not been lobbied by dozens of people who lost their cards for a range of reasons.  It is very important that the Minister comes to the Seanad to discuss the issue.  An amendment to the Order of Business was tabled yesterday.  While I would be slow to do that again today, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come back to the House in the next few weeks to discuss the announcement yesterday and the figures released on long waiting lists.  They are important issues.</p></speech>

Today, &euro;2.2 billion will be committed by Government to tackling the housing crisis.  We have not had a housing strategy from any Government since 1995, but today we will see for the first time a strategy to deal with the 90,000 people on housing waiting lists across the country and with those who cannot afford to buy their own houses as they have been priced out of the market.  It will also deal with people with disabilities who require special types of housing.  It is a good day for Irish people who are in need of housing.  In 2015 alone, 7,500 houses will be built.  A new scheme will be put in place to deal with the private rented sector and 1,000 currently vacant houses in local authority schemes will be put into shape and made ready for tenants by the end of 2015.</p><p>This is the first time the problem has been tackled in any strategic way since the mid-1990s.  Administrations during the Celtic tiger decided to abandon people in need of housing and to look instead to their chums and pals who were building houses in places where they were not needed and contributing to an economic crisis.  Today's announcement means a stimulus package for ordinary people.  It will put unemployed tradesmen back to work, in some cases for the first time in ten years.  It will give hope to young people by starting up new apprenticeships and help corner shops by going back to the breakfast roll man and ensuring business is done on a daily basis.  It will also assist hardware retailers, builders providers and everything else involved in housing.</p><p>With my colleague, Senator Aideen Hayden, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to attend the House next week for a full outline of the proposed strategy and programme for housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600005#D00400"><p>Once again, child care issues dominate the media.  Comments were made following the gender equality conference in Dublin in recent days at which there was severe criticism of the lack of investment in child care facilities nationally and the continuing pressure on those who are referred to as being in the squeezed middle.  Vincent Browne had problems with that definition last night on his programme, but the squeezed middle are people who are earning more money than the eligibility cap for the free child care schemes.  They must pay heavily.  While they are people in jobs with incomes, the financial demands on them mean that many women in particular are having to abandon the workplace and go home as child care costs are too great.  It is past time for the Government to look seriously at this and make a significant investment.  Liberal references are made to the Scandinavian model.  If we as a first line country like to put ourselves out there as what the Taoiseach calls &quot;the best little country in the world to do business&quot;, we must consider whether the way we handle child care issues is in any way an attractive option for anyone thinking of coming here, particularly if they are married with children.  I ask for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, to come before the House to outline a strategy for the provision and upgrading of child care facilities.<br/>Pobal, which is charged by the Government with administering the child care scheme, has issued a report from which the <i>Irish Independent </i>has derived the blazing headline that there is under-use of child care facilities nationally.  This is blatantly incorrect.  I am the chairman of the Leitrim County Childcare Committee.  We have 35 child care facilities in our county, most of which are funded in one way or another by the Government through Pobal, which has come under criticism for the high rates it is charging the Government to manage the scheme.  Pobal is now trying to cover its tail by suggesting there is an under use of child care facilities nationally when we know that people sometimes cannot get their children into cr&egrave;ches.  I said that Leitrim has 35 child care services, but the <i>Irish Independent</i>says there are only nine on the basis of a Pobal survey to which not everybody responded.  Pobal then takes its own figures out of it and produces the fantasy that there is only 77% take-up of child care places in my county when the reality is that it is nearly 100%.  In my home town, which has a state-of-the-art facility, there is a waiting list.  There is all sorts of confusion and obfuscation going on.  I would ignore the Pobal figures and urge the <i>Irish Independent</i>to look at bit deeper into what Pobal is saying.  The reality is that there is a serious need for increased investment in child care facilities to take the burden off hard-pressed families who are finding it increasingly difficult to place their children in child care.</p></speech>

I wish her hearty congratulations.  Women are well represented now across the justice system.</p><p>I will speak later in the debate on drugs, in particular Sovaldi for hepatitis C patients.  Like Senator Paschal Mooney, I ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss children growing up in Ireland.  Today, there is a conference in Croke Park on the survey on growing up in Ireland.  The survey commenced in 2007 and surveyed children aged from nine months to nine years.  Following that, it is from nine years onwards.  The results of the survey should be debated in the House with a view to implementing at least some the recommendations that have resulted.  As Wordsworth said, the child is father of the man - or mother of the woman as the case may be.  We must ensure we get our facilities right, particularly child care for working parents and parents in the home, especially single parents.  The growing up in Ireland survey shows the proportion of families that are lone-parent families who need assistance with child care and help as to how to raise children.  It is about not only helping one-parent families, but all parents to do what is best for their children.</p> <p>It is the first time the Growing Up in Ireland survey has linked with surveys done in Northern Ireland and the UK.  One gets an all-Ireland picture and can compare results.  I have asked the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to table it on the agenda.  Like the housing strategy, which was published today and which I welcome, I want to see if a strategy can be developed in this area.  We will not be able to do everything in a day, a week, a month or a year, but there should be a ten-year strategy for the implementation of a process to ensure we have good facilities, as Senator Mooney said, for children in child care and the family home.  The strategy should be all-encompassing.  I ask the Minister to come before the House for such a debate.</p></speech>

It was received in principle and I would like to know its current status.<br/>As we speak, in Buswells Hotel the Irish Migrant Rights Council is launching a ground-breaking new survey of undocumented migrants in Ireland.  We now have, for the first time, a picture of the undocumented population in Ireland.  The vast majority are working in restaurants or as cleaners, carers or childminders, and a large percentage have young children here or in their country of origin.  The research estimates that there are between 20,000 and 25,000 undocumented migrants in Ireland, including thousands of children.  The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland is calling on the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to adopt a pragmatic approach to dealing with our broken immigration system.  In response to that, civil servants from the Department of Justice and Equality had the audacity to say that this would be problematic.  This happened on the very day that the American President, Mr. Obama, received a letter from the Taoiseach commending him on his presidential orders to deliver residency in the USA for up to five million immigrants, 50,000 of whom are Irish.  It is ironic that our Minister for Justice and Equality and her office said the situation was problematic, while the Taoiseach was making headlines in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  The Taoiseach is quoted as having signed off his letter to President Obama by thanking him and expressing his appreciation for the humanity and leadership he has demonstrated.  If one thinks immigrants in Ireland are any different from Irish immigrants in the USA, one should note that they face the same problems.  We need to regularise the situation.  I table an amendment to the Order of Business, calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to update us on this critical issue.</p></speech>

I have long argued that discretionary medical cards should be afforded to all people with disabilities or life-threatening or long-term illnesses, regardless of their financial income.  While I welcome the Minister's remarks and the review that was mentioned, I also ask that he come before the House for a debate on medical cards, particularly discretionary medical cards, and the changes to the system as soon as possible.</p><p>I again ask the Leader for a debate on the allegations of sexual abuse by members of the provisional republican movement.  I called for such a debate last week.  Further troubling reports have been made in recent days regarding the movement of alleged child abusers.  The fact they were moved across the Border is worrying for people throughout the country, particularly those living in the Border regions, including my home town, which has been mentioned.  It is a matter of the utmost importance and should be debated in the House as a matter of urgency.  Deputy Gerry Adams stated that names were posted anonymously through the letterbox in his Belfast home.  I would like to know when he received that information and express my surprise that somebody could simply walk up to his house in Belfast and put something through his letterbox.  I ask that these questions be answered.</p><p>I refer to the comments made by Deputy Adams in Enniskillen on Monday.  At a time when we are trying to move on, to say that those comments were unhelpful is putting it mildly.  I ask the Leader to address these matters and have an urgent debate as a matter of priority.</p></speech>

It is long overdue.  While I welcome the allocation of &euro;2.2 billion over the next three years, I urge the Government to prioritise the homeless.  People the length and breadth of our country are becoming homeless on a weekly basis.</p><p>I ask that the Leader contact the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and ask her to intervene, at the eleventh hour, in the teachers' dispute.  As we are aware, next Tuesday 340,000 pupils in more than 730 schools the length and breadth of the country will be affected by industrial action taken by 27,000 teachers.  While I accept and acknowledge that some progress has been made by the Minister since she took office, the changes proposed by her and the Department are too much, too soon.  I urge her to re-examine the issue and not to allow a situation to develop that is similar to that of Irish Water, in which mistakes were made because there was a rush to make changes just for change's sake.  What the Minister is trying to achieve can be achieved over a longer period, and consideration can be given to the concerns of teachers and parents.  </p><p>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator White.</p></speech>

We need to do that in early January, because it will take a considerable amount of time to get plans ready.  It is important that agreement is reached.</p><p>I also welcome the move on medical cards yesterday by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.</p></speech>

She will be very good.  I find her very genuine and open, and she is a good communicator.  The force needs that open face.</p> <p>I wish her the best of luck in that role and think we should all strongly support her.</p><p>I talk to the Leader and particularly Fine Gael about the changes proposed to the Finance Bill which must be resisted, particularly in respect of the inheritance of the family farm.  Senator Michael Comiskey will have a strong interest in this issue.  As things stand, the family farm can be signed over to a son or a daughter who then qualifies for full tax relief.  If the changes announced in the 2015 budget are implemented, the heir to the farm will be required to spend more than 50% of his or her time working on the farm in order to qualify for full tax relief.  That is ludicrous.  Let us look at the reality.  Many farmers today have no choice but to work away the land to supplement their income.  In Galway and the west over 60% of farmers are part-time.  The average full-time farmer works in excess of 90 hours a week.  I would like to know what genius in the Department of Finance had this brain wave.  When the Minister proposes that the heir will have to spend more than 50% of his or her time working the land, on what is he basing his figure?  Is he basing it on the 39 hours a week a public servant works or the 90 hours a week the average farmer works?  This is full of anomalies and difficulties.  In particular, I expect Fine Gael to resist this change completely when a vote is called.  Otherwise, it will be responsible for wiping out the small farms that are unviable without an off-farm income, particularly in the west.  Get a grip and communicate the message loudly and strongly to the Minister for Finance.  A total of &euro;225,000 is a ridiculous value to put on a small holding because any amount of land will come to that figure, but that does not make it viable.</p></speech>

Housing is of core importance to the Labour Party and the Minister's initiative merits considerable acclaim.</p><p>I wish to correct yesterday's record of the debate on water services.  I wrongly attributed some comments to my good friend, Senator Sean D. Barrett.  I apologise if I caused him any offence in the matter and note that the comments were not made by him but by one of his colleagues.</p></speech>

While she is making history in being the first woman Commissioner, she has, no doubt, been appointed on merit, given her experience within the force, having come through a very open and transparent recruitment process and seen off competition from within Ireland and internationally.  She has a mammoth task ahead of her in restoring confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and morale within the force.  The reform of the justice and policing structures is now in very safe female hands, given that we have a female Minister for Justice and Equality, Attorney General, Garda Commissioner and chairperson of the new policing authority.  I have no doubt that these talented women will resolve the many weaknesses in our systems and restore confidence in the justice and policing systems.</p><p>I refer to the findings of a survey conducted by Enterprise Ireland and Deloitte and published today in advance of a meeting of CEOs of major businesses in this country.  They indicate that the level of business sentiment is rising, with 69% of the country's chief executives believing GDP will match or exceed recent predictions.  They also show that the majority of CEOs are confident that Ireland will exceed the average eurozone GDP rate in the next two to three years.  The survey reveals that CEOs believe the main challenges facing businesses in Ireland are access to working capital and staff issues.  While 35% of those surveyed said capital was their main issue, 53% cited people issues.  A total of 12% said mobility was a key issue, while 20% said the shortage of graduates was a major concern, being especially true in the areas of IT, science, engineering and mathematics.  We need to discuss this issue further with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to schedule a debate as soon as he can in order that we can discuss the ongoing work on An Action Plan for Jobs and the shortcomings business leaders see in the country.</p></speech>

The victims of this crime also face difficulties when they try to claim compensation under their insurance policies.  Petrol stretching constitutes malicious damage and should be covered by fully comprehensive insurance policies but it is not.  These policies need to cover the risks involved in order to protect consumers.  Having heard at first hand a number of my constituents' experiences, I have discovered that they have found themselves in a grossly unfair position in finding that their cars have been destroyed through no fault of their own.  The insurance companies are not stepping up to the plate, but the State also has a role to play in tackling the issue of petrol stretching and its repercussions.  It is an illegal and dangerous activity that should be dealt with to the full extent of the law.  Motorists who purchase petrol in good faith must have that faith and their property protected.  In that regard, the Minister for Justice and Equality should come to the House to discuss the issue and look at providing additional resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the fight against petrol stretching which affects a huge number of motorists in the Galway area.</p></speech>

The Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation has not read the publication fully and is treating it with cautious optimism.  I would welcome it if the Minister for Health came to the House to engage in dialogue and a debate to clarify the finer points.  The expert panel obviously listened to the people with great care and the families of the Jack &amp;amp; Jill children's Foundation.  It is particularly welcome that the issue of discretionary medical cards seems to be back on the agenda.  Speaking from our families' perspective, the fear felt by people with discretionary medical cards for children is beginning to disappear from their solar plexus in time for Christmas.  Those with no medical cards believe there may now be some hope of getting them.  I am very encouraged by the simpler formula promised by the Department.</p></speech>

I have spoken in the House before about how I believe wearing fluorescent jackets should be made mandatory for those walking or running at night.  A lady told me about an incident that had happened when she, her husband and three children were coming back from holiday.  They were driving on the motorway when a big rock was thrown from a flyover.  Their car was written off.  It was scary and, but for the grace of God, there was no loss of life.  I have conducted some research and understand the same thing happened in Spain when an entire family was wiped out.  It also happened in Great Britain.  We must do something.  If we were to have a debate, Members could come up with options or alternatives, be it CCTV cameras on flyovers or the embankment or raising the height of flyovers to stop people from throwing rocks onto a motorway.  The car of the lady in question was completely written off.  Garda&iacute; were at the scene in a short space of time, but there was nothing they could do.</p> <p>Something has to be done before there is a fatality owing to people throwing implements, rocks, etc. over the side of a flyover onto a motorway.</p></speech>

We will try to get the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on the issue.  A number of Members raised the question of medical cards.  The new enhanced assessment process takes account of the burden of an illness or a condition, which is to be welcomed.  The greater exchange of information between the medical card central assessment unit and the local office which has been lacking in the past couple of years is also to be welcomed.  People with various illnesses who hold discretionary medical cards will retain them pending the implementation of actions to improve the operation of the scheme, which is also to be welcomed.  The power of GPs to extend medical cards in difficult circumstances will be strengthened.  A number of Members, including Senators Darragh O'Brien and Mary Moran, have mentioned that people with a terminal illness who hold a medical card will no longer have their medical cards reviewed.  The review of such cases was a dreadful practice.  I will invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to address the matter.  Senator Darragh O'Brien asked for the starting date for the process, but, unfortunately, I cannot give him that information.  However, I will ask the Minister to address the matter.</p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik stated the change in the law on prostitution had been agreed to by the Cabinet and that there would be reform of sex offences.  She called on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come into the House to address the matter.  I will invite the Minister to do so.  </p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned the efficiency of the tax system.  He also made an important point that the Department of Education and Skills should address about the provision of compulsory swimming lessons for pupils.  Many schools use swimming pools in the locality to teach pupils to swim properly.  I agree with the Senator that swimming lessons should be availed of by all schools and might perhaps be made compulsorily.  As he mentioned, there would be a cost factor involved, but I will raise the matter with the Minister.  </p><p>Senator Hildegarde Naughton mentioned the need for greater humanity, especially for people with a terminal illness, where medical cards were concerned.</p><p>Senators Denis O'Donovan, Terry Leyden, C&aacute;it Keane, Michael Comiskey, Fidelma Healy Eames, Michael Mullins and others mentioned the new Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, and congratulated her on her appointment.  Senator Denis O'Donovan mentioned that morale within the Garda needed to be restored.  I know that issue will be a major priority for the new Commissioner.</p><p>The Senator also raised the question of funding for non-Gaeltacht islands, an issue raised by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell yesterday.  The issue of funding for these islands fell between the stools of several Departments, but I am confident it will be addressed in early course by the Government.</p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden mentioned three reports on housing and the private sector and called for a debate on the matter.  I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on a number of occasions to come to the House to discuss the matter.  I hope that either he or the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, will be able to come in the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan mentioned the importance of retaining the public service obligation in respect of Kerry Airport and the tourism industry.  I am sure its retention would be welcomed by everybody in County Kerry and the south-west region.</p><p>Senator David Cullinane mentioned those on waiting lists.  I will again ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the matter.  The Senator made the point that people had to wait for appointments.  That has been the position for the past year and a half; before then people received appointments but had to wait for operations.  It is only in the past year or two that there has been a system in place that allows us to know the numbers waiting to see consultants.  This information has been used to highlight the issue and I agree with the Senator that the Government must address it. </p><p>Senator Denis Landy mentioned that &euro;2.2 billion had been committed to the housing strategy.  We should await the full details of the strategy.  As I said, I will try to arrange a debate on the matter with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>Senators Paschal Mooney and C&aacute;it Keane asked for child care issues to be addressed.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to the Growing Up in Ireland strategy.  The two Senators asked for a debate on these issues to be arranged with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>Senator Mary White raised the issue of parental leave for fathers and inquired about the current status of the Bill.  The legislation is still being worked on by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection and it will be some months before we will see progress.  However, we will keep the matter under constant review.</p><p>The Senator also called for humanity and leadership to be shown in addressing the plight of undocumented migrants in Ireland.  I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the matter.  </p><p>Senator Mary Moran mentioned discretionary medical cards.  She also referred to the movement of alleged child abusers, paedophiles and rapists by the republican movement and called for a debate on the matter in the House.</p><p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson asked that the housing strategy prioritise the issue of homelessness.  It will very much be part of the strategy to be announced this morning by the relevant Minister.</p><p>The Senator also called on the Minister for Education and Skills to intervene to prevent strike action by teachers.  I disagree with the Senator that changes are being made for the sake of it.  I agree with him, however, that a longer timescale could be envisaged for implementation of the changes and assure him that I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p><p>Senator Michael Comiskey mentioned the need for early agreement on the rural development plan in the European Union.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working on the matter.</p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames mentioned the Finance Bill.  We will have ample time to discuss the Bill in the House in the coming weeks.  I can assure the Senator that points have been made by many Fine Gael Oireachtas Members in the past week or so.  I hope these matters will be addressed in the course of the debate on the Bill.</p><p>Senator Michael Mullins mentioned a survey conducted by Enterprise Ireland and Deloitte on the positive projections for the economy.  He also pointed to some deficiencies in the system which needed to be addressed.  We have tried to get the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to discuss An Action Plan for Jobs and I am glad to report that he will be here next week to address the issue.</p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins mentioned petrol stretching, an issue which has been raised by Members on several occasions.  She also mentioned the difficulties it was causing with insurance companies.  Criminals and former so-called republicans are involved in this activity which has caused grave distress for many motorists the length and breadth of the country.  The Government is doing everything possible to address the matter.  In addition to the problem of petrol stretching, there is the issue of diesel laundering.  I will try to have the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris, come to the House to outline what the Government is doing to resolve the matter.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien mentioned medical cards and called on the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the matter.  I will try to arrange such a debate.</p><p>Senator Tom Sheahan called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House.  The Minister will be here this afternoon to discuss tourism matters, but I take on board the Senator's important points about road safety and flyovers.  It is a very serious issue.</p> <p>I imagine we could bring the Minister to the House to address the matter of road safety at a later stage.</p><p>I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business as tabled.</p></speech>

I urge other Members to withdraw or remove some of the items on the Order Paper.  The Seanad Office does a good deal of work on the preparation of the Order Paper.  I urge co-operation so that motions and Bills that are no longer relevant be withdrawn by Members.<br/>This motion calls on the House to consider the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the relevant proposal of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis for the conduct of an inquiry into certain aspects of the banking crisis.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the report to the House on behalf of the CPP.<br/>In May this year the joint committee was asked by both Houses to develop a proposal for an inquiry under Part 2 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  It was asked to consider the appropriate scope and terms of reference of the inquiry, including the method of initial investigation of the inquiry subject matter; the functions and powers to be delegated to the committee to allow it to conduct the inquiry; and any other related matters the committee considered necessary.<br/>The joint committee set out several principles to guide it in the development of its proposal.  It agreed that the aims of the inquiry should be realistic and achievable.  The committee took the view that the inquiry should be capable of completion within a realistic timeframe and took account of the lifetime of the current Seanad and D&aacute;il.  The committee aimed to minimise risks as far as possible and emphasised the need for the inquiry to be cost-effective.  The committee took the view that the inquiry should have a clear purpose and be flexible within its focus and scope.<br/>Under Standing Orders adopted by the Seanad in February this year, the CPP is the committee designated to receive notice of a relevant proposal from any committee that proposes to conduct a Part 2 inquiry.  The CPP must cause the proposal to be evaluated and make a relevant report on it.  On 26 September the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis sent its relevant proposal to the CPP.<br/>The CPP met four times between 9 October and 18 November to carry out our evaluation of the relevant proposal.  In doing so we were mindful of the need to work within the parameters set out by the Act and the relevant Standing Orders.  We explored our role in this regard with officials of the Houses and with legal advisers before we set to work on considering the relevant proposal in its own right.<br/>The Chairman of the joint committee met the CPP to discuss the work the joint committee had done and to explain the principles that had informed its approach to the task.  The CPP separately took expert economic advice from Professor Karl Whelan on the framework, themes, scope and timeframe of the proposed inquiry.<br/>Having set the scene for our evaluation, the CPP then set about examining the relevant proposal in detail.  Standing Order 103I lists several specific matters that the committee was required to consider.  These are dealt with in more detail in our report, but I will set them out briefly for the House this morning.<br/>The CPP was required to consider whether the proposed Part 2 inquiry should be conducted.  We recommend that it should be conducted.  The banking crisis is perhaps the greatest issue that the State has had to confront since its establishment almost a century ago and it has had a significant impact on the lives of the people.  We believe that the people have a legitimate expectation of a comprehensive statutory examination of the causes of the crisis.  A parliamentary inquiry operating within the framework of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 is best placed to deliver this.<br/>The CPP recommends that the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis should conduct the inquiry.  Since the committee was established last May it has immersed itself in the subject matter of the inquiry to prepare the relevant proposal.  The experience and knowledge that its members have gained would allow it to hit the ground running and help ensure that the inquiry can be completed within the life and timeframe of the current Seanad and D&aacute;il.<br/>The CPP had to consider the manner in which the inquiry should be carried out.  We recommend that the inquiry should be carried out under section 7 of the Act and in the manner proposed by the joint committee.  Section 7 allows for the recording and reporting of evidence and the making of uncontested findings of fact.  It also allows for findings of fact for failure to co-operate with the inquiry.  The joint committee has set out a clear statement of purpose and a conceptual framework for the inquiry comprising two phases.  The context phase, involving technical briefings and public hearings, would frame the broad context of the inquiry.  The nexus phase, involving an investigation process and public hearings, would identify the key questions to be addressed, identify and direct the provision of evidence, analyse evidence and culminate in a final report.<br/>In its relevant proposal, the joint committee proposed terms of reference in which it specified 22 matters to be covered by the inquiry and 23 categories of persons to whom given matters relate.  The CPP considered these in some detail.  We were satisfied that they were comprehensive but recommended the addition of another important matter.  This was the role that the euro and Ireland's membership thereof may have played in the banking crisis, and the related matter of the strength of sterling relative to the euro.</p> <p>This recommendation has been incorporated in the proposed terms of reference resolution, which appears on today's Order Paper.</p><p>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges was also concerned to ensure that evidence related to the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Financial Regulator, could be taken, not only from managers and advisers but also from more junior staff.  The proposed terms of reference resolution now also caters explicitly for this concern. </p><p>Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were conscious that the joint committee was setting itself a challenging task to be completed within a tight timeframe - by 30 November 2015.  We were satisfied, however, that the proposed terms of reference are enabling rather than prescriptive and allow the joint committee to tailor the scope of its work to align it with the timeframe.  The joint committee drew the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to the fact that the Central Bank Act 1942 prohibits in some cases the disclosure of information by officials of the Central Bank.  We have recommended that the 1942 Act be amended to ensure that no such prohibition would prevent the giving of evidence to the inquiry.</p><p>On behalf of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I commend the members of the joint committee of inquiry into the banking crisis on the excellent work they have done in putting together their proposal for an inquiry.  As Leader of the House, I also thank my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who represent a wide range of opinion and political perspectives, for the careful, constructive and impartial manner in which they approached the evaluation process.  I hope Senators will be satisfied that the committee did its best to put in place the type of inquiry that can answer the questions that have required answering for some time.  I also thank the staff and legal experts who helped the committee in its work. </p><p>By supporting the motion and subsequent motions on the terms of reference and amended orders of reference of the committee, the House can ensure the work of the inquiry can get under way by Christmas.  I commend the motion to the House.  I also suggest that comments on Nos. 6 and 7 be taken, if members wish, during the course of the debate on this matter.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600010#J00200"><p>The Leader has outlined the process the Committee on Procedure and Privileges completed.  As a member of the committee, I attest to the great deal of detailed discussion and questioning in which we engaged, with the assistance of legal advice and Seanad staff.  I thank the staff involved who deserve great credit for all the work they did in producing a detailed proposal, which works in to the terms of reference that must be passed by the Seanad.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the House will support the terms of reference.</p><p>I raised concerns in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about the nature of the inquiry.  I still believe that enacting the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 would have been a better approach.  I also expressed concerns, which were minuted, with regard to the tight timeframe for concluding the joint committee's inquiry by 30 November 2015.  Completing all the investigative work, hearings and so forth by this date will be a significant challenge.  I am also concerned that the joint committee may select the areas into which it will inquire on the basis that it will not have sufficient time to address 22 separate matters. </p><p>To be fair to the Government, I accept that a referendum on the scope of parliamentary inquiries was defeated early in its term of office and this defeat complicated matters somewhat.  Nevertheless, the banking inquiry team must make clear that the proposed terms of reference are highly restrictive in nature.  I am concerned that the general public will be far from satisfied with what is being proposed in so far as the inquiry will be exceptionally restrictive as to findings of fact and the areas that can be covered.  For example, areas in which criminal proceedings and investigations are under way are excluded.  This effectively prevents investigation of most aspects of Anglo Irish Bank's role because court cases are pending in this area.  Furthermore, Cabinet confidentiality, as provided for in the Constitution, means that Ministers and others who held office at the time of the guarantee will not be able to answer questions, even if they wished to do so.  We have indicated to Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, the Chairman of the inquiry, that the joint committee must be careful about how these elements are addressed. </p><p>The Oireachtas could not produce a perfect solution.  I am more than satisfied, however, that, in the time available to us, we debated and asked a series of questions regarding the proposal presented to us.  The terms of reference we have produced are the best we could do.  I wish the joint committee well in fulfilling what will be an onerous task.</p><p>It was good that there were no dissenting voices in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and members worked together as a group.  Despite the misgivings some of us had about various matters, the committee was able to reach an agreement.  Senator Cummins referred to a specific amendment proposed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding the role played by membership of the euro and the relative strength of sterling.  This is an important issue. </p><p>I outlined some of my concerns to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Notwithstanding my concerns and however imperfect it will be, the inquiry must proceed because people want answers.  I hope they will not be disappointed as I fear the nature of the inquiry will not deliver all the answers they seek.</p><p>I fully support the motion and the other motions on the Order Paper.  The sooner the inquiry is up and running and the inquiry team is doing its job and interviewing witnesses, the better.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600010#J00300"><p>I am pleased to speak  in support of the motion on behalf of Labour Party Senators.  The Leader, Senator Cummins, outlined the decision making process of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the meetings we had from 9 October 2014 onwards to evaluate the relevant proposal and the decisions we made.  Senator Darragh O'Brien pointed to the constraints that applied in trying to devise and evaluate the proposal that was put to the committee.  All members recognised these constraints.  I agree with the Senator that these terms of reference are the best we can do.  I regret the loss of the referendum on parliamentary powers to conduct inquiries as its passing would have allowed a different type of inquiry to be constituted.  Given the constitutional parameters within which we must work, I believe this is the best result we can achieve.  It is in the interests of all of us that the inquiry proceeds as expeditiously as possible.</p><p>I have been involved in this process in my role as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I and other members of the committee as well as Senators who will be involved in the inquiry must be circumspect when contributing to this debate.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges had a constructive debate and the Leader spoke comprehensively on how we arrived at our decision, having given careful consideration to the terms of the inquiry and made changes in respect of the relative strengths of the euro, sterling and so forth.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to issues that will be excluded from the inquiry whereas I intend to focus on what will be included.  The inquiry covers a great deal and its work plan is undoubtedly challenging.  The schedule lists 22 matters under the following four headings: &quot;Context&quot;; &quot;Banking Systems and Practices&quot;; &quot;Regulatory and Supervisory Systems and Practices&quot;; and &quot;Crisis Management Systems and Policy Response&quot;.  The final heading includes the decision to provide a bank guarantee on 30 September 2008, developments in the lead-up to that decision and the decisions taken afterwards on the implementation of the guarantee.</p><p>The work plan and timeframe of the inquiry are challenging.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered the parameters of the work plan and timeframe.  As Senator Cummins stated, the Seanad staff provided great help and support and I thank all of those involved in the process.  We also took legal advice at every stage of the process, which we found extremely helpful.  We met the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, who outlined the work he envisaged the joint committee would be able to do within the timeframe provided.  As has been noted, we also took advice from Professor Karl Whelan and others. </p><p>The banking crisis and financial collapse were immensely significant and catastrophic events for this country.  Irish people deserve the best investigation we can provide in the parliamentary setting into the events surrounding the collapse and all the matters set out in schedule A of the motion.  I urge colleagues to read the motion, which provides a comprehensive list of the issues that led up to and may have caused the financial collapse.  It is in the interests of all of us to ensure an inquiry is conducted in the parliamentary setting into the causes of the banking crisis.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important paragraph in the motion is, "The subject matter of the inquiry shall be to inquire into the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis".  This is the critical issue so many people want investigated and about which they want answers put on the public record, as best we can.  People want public hearings.  It is in the interests of us all to ensure these public hearings commence as expeditiously as possible.  I have great faith in the members of the inquiry.  It is already working very well.  The preliminary committee, which was established in May, has been already working very constructively on devising a work plan and schedule.  I wish them all very well in their work and urge colleagues to support these motions and enable the committee to continue this very important work.</p></speech>

The Leader has very thoroughly described the process by which this very comprehensive document came before the House, and I commend everybody and the secretariat.  It is a challenge for the committee and we must go ahead and commence the work, to a very challenging timetable.  I was very pleased that Professor Karl Whelan is advising on the economics part, and he is meeting us later this morning to assist us further.  It was a major crisis and the ripples continue with a thousand people on the streets and the breakdown of so many institutions.  It did not happen in Canada or Australia, two countries with which we have many similarities, and we will try to learn from them.  The public needs to know the answers, as Senators Cummins, Bacik and Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said.</p><p>This is a very comprehensive framework.  I agree with the adjustment to include the euro in the terms of reference.  How did a very conservative banking system become so risk-taking?  Was it linked to the currency?  This is an important aspect of the committee's work.  As Senator Cummins said, it is very important we allow the Central Bank to participate fully because it was the regulatory body responsible.  The House can be assured that the terms of reference are fully comprehensive and thorough and I join in thanking the CPP for its work.  It has set very good terms of reference and it is up to the committee members to deliver an equally good document at the end of the inquiry.  Our thanks are due to the CPP for the thoroughness and unanimity, as Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, of this very fine document.</p></speech>

It is good to hear somebody of Senator Barrett's impartiality supporting it.  I was a member of the CPP and I join with colleagues in thanking members of the Seanad staff and legal advisers who assisted us in the process.  A very considerable amount of time was spent evaluating the proposal and while I can see why Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has misgivings, we all agree it will be a very extensive inquiry and the members of the team have drawn up a very comprehensive set of proposals.  The general public wants to find answers as to how this massive banking crisis occurred and what lessons can be learned for the future.  It is in everybody's interest that work commences as soon as possible.  It is a major job of work, and many of us on the CPP had reservations as to whether the timescale would be too tight.  It is vital that the work commence without further delays.  I wish the committee and those charged with conducting this very significant piece of work well.  I hope it will be the last time we will have to engage in such an exercise, that we never again have a situation where hardship is caused for so many people as a result of the collapse of our banking institutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600011#K00400"><p>I oppose the motion.  It is the wrong time to carry out this inquiry and Members of the Oireachtas are the wrong people to do it.  It is the wrong time because it is too late.  Putting elected representatives of the people into the difficult and dubious task of trying to answer some very complex questions to satisfy people's legitimate and understandable outrage about everything that went on regarding the banking crisis and the political, economic, social, cultural, financial and behavioural collapse that occurred on foot of it is too much for the Oireachtas to take on.</p><p>Reference has been made to the constitutional referendum on tribunals of inquiry and there have been subdued tones of regret from speakers suggesting it is a pity the referendum did not pass.  Because it did not pass, we are where we are and are doing the best we can within the limited scope of that which is constitutionally permissible.  I campaigned against the referendum because Deputies and Senators are not the right people to carry out inquiries into the conduct of other people which might lead to findings that are critical of those people's reputations.  The reasons for which I opposed the referendum are substantially the same as the reasons for which I think the banking inquiry is a complete nonsense, when one strips it down, namely, that the majority of politicians are unable to resist the tendency to partisanship and making statements that will get them attention in the media.  This is not because politicians are bad people.  We suffer from these tendencies because we depend to some extent on the oxygen of publicity to secure our reputations in the eyes of voters.  In these circumstances, it is absolutely wrong to entrust to elected Deputies and Senators the task of conducting inquiries of a serious kind, even if these inquiries come short of making findings adverse to other people's reputations.</p><p>In no sense do I disparage the tremendous abilities of some of the people who will constitute the inquiry team.  There is no finer contributor in the Oireachtas than our colleague from the independent university benches, Senator Barrett.  Although he will be a very fine and refined thinker on the inquiry, he could be so without being an elected Member of the Oireachtas.  Although there are others like him who could be just as qualified and able to participate in such an inquiry, it is not the fact that they are elected Members that makes them peculiarly fit for the task.</p><p>If there is an investigation Members of the Oireachtas could take on, it might be to consider what failures in the legislative process or failures to legislate contributed to the systemic banking crisis and the political, economic, social, cultural and financial collapse that took place on foot of it.  That would be an appropriate task for Members of the Oireachtas to take on because it relates to their duties as legislators and the future performance by legislators of their duties.  Instead of taking our cue from people in the referendum, which was to say we should stay away from inquiring into people's behaviours or weighty matters of this kind, we have sought to give a form of bread and circuses to Members of the Oireachtas, to give them some other task to do instead of strengthening the tasks they ought to have.</p> <p>Through political reform, we should work at strengthening the task of scrutinising legislation, establishing and identifying policy initiatives and bringing them forward through legislation. That is the road we should be travelling and not this one, which, as Senator O'Brien says, will not only fail to satisfy the people, but will end up being a distraction from the work Deputies and Senators ought to be doing.</p></speech>

I welcome the establishment of the inquiry.  The events it will examine have had major consequences and are still affecting citizens' everyday lives as well as political discourse in the State.  I have some concern about the delay as the inquiry only began to take shape three years into the life of the Government.  We have lost a lot of time and there is a very real chance that an election could interrupt the inquiry's work and that it might not get enough time to fulfil its mandate.  Nevertheless, there is strong public demand for the inquiry to get on with its work and I wish the chairman, members and staff well in their journey.  The agreed terms of reference allow for a very wide range of actors to be brought before the inquiry.  As has been mentioned already, the different modules will allow for a strategic and logical approach.  The task before the inquiry is large and time will be tight. It is important, therefore, that members put aside political considerations and co-operate to ensure its success.  The people demand no less than that.</p></speech>

I do not know what we hope to achieve by carrying it out.  I believe it is the wrong time, as many of the witnesses brought before it will suffer from selective amnesia and Members of the Oireachtas are the wrong people to carry out the inquiry.  It should have been carried out some time ago by the State agencies best qualified to do so.</p><p>All of the main actors involved in the collapse of the country's economy have taken to the hills - they have gone away on their yachts with their pensions - and are living the good life while the rest of us are left struggling to survive and rebuild.  Like many of my colleagues and friends, I ask why did we not see the same response to the collapse of our economy as we saw in the United States?  Why did nobody go into the plush offices of these bankers and take them out in handcuffs?  Why has nobody been charged or sent to jail?  </p><p>I believe this inquiry may very well finish up as a publicity grandstanding affair for those who want to use it in that way.  I am not for one moment questioning people's abilities but we are politicians and rely on publicity for our oxygen, as my colleague has said.  I question the suggestion that the public wants to know what happened.  The public wanted to know back in 2008 but I am not so sure it has an interest any more because people know that this inquiry will not lead to anybody being charged with anything.  What do we really hope to achieve?  I suspect this will become part of pre-election PR to allow one political party place the blame on the shoulders of another.  I am opposed to it and believe the time of the Oireachtas could be spent doing better things than this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600014#O00200"><p>I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  It is important to state the decisions on which medicines are licensed for use in Ireland and reimbursed by the taxpayer are not political or ministerial.  They are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the national drugs committee of the Health Service Executive, HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  It received an application for the inclusion of fampridine, which is marketed as Fampyra in the general medical services, GMS, and community drug schemes.  It is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with a walking disability.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for fampridine, it was unable to recommend reimbursement for the product.  I will lay this document before the Oireachtas Library today to allow Senators consider it in full.  On foot of this decision, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the list of reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  The HSE's decision is in line with that in other European countries that have also decided not to provide the drug under their public health systems.  It is open to the manufacturer, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE with new evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of the drug by offering a reduced price or both.</p><p>A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July.  The HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit has since been engaging with the company.  These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome.  Fampridine will be assessed, with a range of other applications, for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.  I assure the House that the HSE and I fully understand the concerns of patients about the availability of this drug.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for any price a drug company demands, I hope it is appreciated that the better interests of millions of taxpayers and thousands of patients require that we only reimburse the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p><p>I will also this afternoon place in the Oireachtas Library the relevant document of the commissioning board of the British National Health Service, NHS.  This document has nothing to do with me, my Department or anything in this country - it is an NHS policy statement from April 2013 based on the London New Drugs Group analysis.  That group states that &quot;in clinical trials, a statistically significant improvement in walking time was achieved in fewer than half of patients taking fampridine.  The clinical significance of this improvement, of 0.3 to 0.8 seconds to walk 25 feet compared with placebo, is questionable&quot;.  In layman's terms, the drug did not work for more than half of the patients and the other half were enabled to walk 25 feet 0.3 to 0.8 seconds more quickly than they would have had they taken a sugar tablet or a placebo.  The group goes on to state it considers the overall clinical benefit of the medicine to be marginal - it supports a recommendation to not routinely fund fampridine.  It is not a miracle drug.  The group further states fampridine is not a cost-effective use of NHS resources.  Senators will know that this is an expensive drug and I will be placing this view of the NHS in the Oireachtas Library this afternoon.</p><p>I also have a Dutch study of December 2012 by the medicinal products reimbursement committee which reaches a similar conclusion.  The Netherlands has one of the best funded health services in the world.  The study highlights the most frequent adverse effects of the drug, including urinary tract infections, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, headaches, balance disorders, paraesthesia, tremors, dyspnoea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, gastrointestinal disorders, back pain and asthenia.  The study states fampridine has a narrow therapeutic window and a relatively small increase in exposure can lead to a large increase in central nervous system, CNS, side effects such as convulsions.  It can even have a negative effect on walking.  It also states fampridine cannot be administered to patients with epilepsy and that there is a lack of data on its effects on elderly patients and those with cardiovascular disorders.  It concludes that fampridine has a lower therapeutic value than exercise or physical therapy in improving the walking ability of patients with multiple sclerosis.  The medicine is deemed to be less effective than physical therapy.  The study states there is no proven place for fampridine in therapy.  I put this study before the House today.</p><p>I am not making the decision, but I want to make it clear that, no matter what decision is made, the door is never closed to new medicines.  Even if a drug is refused several times, a manufacturer can always come back with new evidence that demonstrates its effectiveness, a reduced price or both.  The possibilities of cost and risk sharing arrangements are open too.  In such circumstances the HSE would only reimburse the drug for the small number of people for whom it worked, not those for whom it did not.</p><p>The HSE national drugs committee has the difficult job of protecting patients from the false claims and health promises of some drug companies, clinicians and advocacy groups.  The committee must also protect the taxpayer in order that resources can be used to best effect for the vast majority of patients.  Everyone in this House, including me, as Minister, has a duty to support the HSE national drugs committee in its difficult and important work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600015#P00100"><p>I thank the Minister for attending the House.  He outlined the studies from the National Health Service in the UK, from the Netherlands and from other countries that claim that Fampyra does not have a positive effect on the symptoms of MS.  While I am not a medical doctor, I have testimonies to the contrary from 15 women.  The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland, MS Ireland, informed me that up to one third of those suffering with MS have found mobility improvements after taking this drug.  Yesterday, I had an e-mail from a lady who since July has paid &euro;279 a month for the drug, &euro;2,115 in total, to enable her stay on in work.</p><p>We can argue the toss about whether the HSE or the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics believes that this drug works or does not work.  In his letter to me on 19 February, the Minister stated that while he appreciated that some might take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever price the drug companies demand, he hoped I would appreciate that the better interests of the health services require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.  I completely agree with him on this.  I never once in my correspondence to the HSE or the Department of Health, or in contributions here on the matter, stated that we should have open season, approving every drug at whatever the cost.  However, Fampyra comes to &euro;279 a month.  The evidence that I have, for what it is worth, and the testimonies from MS sufferers who have used it is that they are extremely distressed by the position on the availability of this drug on the general medical services scheme.</p><p>Since 25 July, the HSE has been in possession of a revised submission from Biogen, the drug&rsquo;s manufacturers.  It is now nearly December.  Whenever we ask the HSE when a decision will be made on this matter, no timeline is given.  If the HSE firmly believes that Fampyra is not a useful drug, then it should make the decision to that effect and inform us that is the case.  However, I argue against such a decision and urge the HSE to get off its hands - it has had the revised proposal from the drug&rsquo;s manufacturer since 25 July - to make a decision.  We are not talking about a whole hill of beans either, as the cost of the drug comes to &euro;279 a month, and this will cover 15 MS sufferers who reckon the drug works for them.</p><p>The only way I am able to get a proper answer on this is by having the Minister in the House to address the matter.  The ladies in contact with me, as well as MS Ireland, have not got that type of response from the HSE, however.  MS Ireland, I can assure the Minister, is not advocating on behalf of any drug company to make money off the back of the taxpayer.  It wants it for its members who believe and have shown that this drug has immense benefits and has improved their mobility, enabling them to be independent.  I have spoken to MS sufferers who are back to work because of taking this drug.  Others who cannot access this drug are no longer in work, unfortunately.</p><p>After these short statements today, I hope the HSE at the highest level will examine this matter and make a decision quickly on it rather than stringing people along.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600015#P00200"><p>I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for giving a comprehensive reply to this matter.  Like Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, I have been in contact with many MS sufferers for whom the drug was successful.  In one case I know, the pharmacy is providing the drug at cost to the MS sufferer.  When I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 17 June, I was advised that a new application would be submitted, which happened on 25 July.  I agree with the Minister that care has to be taken on the cost of pharmaceuticals, when one considers that in 2000 the health services paid &euro;570 million for medicines but by 2010 this had gone up to &euro;2 billion, a significant increase.  Accordingly, we can no longer write blank cheques, which appears to have been the case in the ten years to which I just referred.  We need to get value for money.</p><p>From my research into this matter, the drug works for some MS sufferers but not for others.  There is also an issue around its cost-effectiveness.  It is important that a decision is made on this soon, because the drug accommodates people and makes their lives better.  For an MS sufferer, it is a condition for life.  We must introduce any measure we can for those patients.  We must do all possible to come to an arrangement to ensure that the availability of this drug is economically viable.</p><p>I have an Adjournment matter this evening on the approval of another drug on the GMS scheme.  In this case, an application was submitted by the manufacturer to the HSE in April.  My understanding is that a decision should be made in four months but, again, none has been made.  In the case of Fampyra, every effort should be made to reach an agreement that will be economically viable for the HSE while providing benefits to those for whom this drug is suitable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600015#P00300"><p>The Minister is very familiar with the whole concept of health economics.  I do not believe for one second that medicine can be practised in an economic vacuum.  I understand that every decision made about a patient has an opportunity cost for another patient who may benefit from a treatment which is denied them because the money was spent on the first patient.  It is a question of prioritising and common sense.</p><p>On the efficacy of the drug in question, there seems to be a suggestion that because a majority of patients do not benefit from it, it does not work.  That would be an extraordinarily high bar to set for any treatment for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer.  In all of these conditions, there is an improvement in outcome when a treatment is given.  It may not apply to every patient; it may apply incrementally to some more than it does to others.</p><p>The data published by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, the independent agency which is the European equivalent of the US Food and Drug Administration, showed that in two large randomised trials, the percentage of patients who benefitted from Fampyra rose from 8% in the control group to 45% in the treatment group and, in the second study, from 9% to 43%.  In oncology, we would be cracking open the champagne if we saw differences that large.  I suppose we all look for small victories in our different areas.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, the drug has been generally available to MS sufferers.  That availability is now compromised and the State is not picking up the tab.  We know some benefit from it while others do not.  Can I suggest that we do something novel and mould-breaking with this matter, something which is being looked at in other areas, particularly in cancer treatment, namely adaptive reimbursement?  This involves essentially those who have benefited from the drug getting the &euro;3,000 per annum for it.  I do not want the Minister to take this personally but, several years ago, we had a debate in a different context where it was pointed out that the salary of the public relations adviser for the then Minister for Health would have paid for the drug for 50 patients for a year.</p><p>When it comes to prioritising spending on health care, some items are analysed on the basis of cost per year of lives saved, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and so forth.  This is the argot used routinely in health economics.  It is awfully easy to apply it selectively to drugs and not to other matters in the care of patients.</p> <p>Should we not apply the same criteria to whether a public relations department is necessary, whether a management consultant is required or how many of the 11% extra grade 8 officials who were appointed between last year and this year are justified?  How many years of life are saved from appointing those extra folk?  Their jobs are probably very necessary and I am sure they work hard, but these are the same types of criteria.  There should be an even playing field across the different areas of health spending for this.</p><p>With regard to quoting British figures, one of my patients, who shall remain nameless, tweeted today to announce it was his seventh cancer-versary.  It is the seventh year since he was diagnosed with an incurable kidney cancer.  This man has been kept alive for the last seven years through a variety of treatments, not one of which is available in the United Kingdom's National Health Service.  We should not necessarily lower the bar so low as to look at how the British approve drugs for different common diseases.  They are the worst in the world.  It is widely recognised.  The Karolinska study carried out several years ago showed that they have the worst outcomes, certainly in cancer, and these were closely correlated with poor access to cancer drugs.  If one speaks to nephrologists, cardiologists, blood pressure experts or experts in any area, they will say that, in general, once one accesses the system into diagnosis, British outcomes tend to be not that great, especially if high tech interventions or medications are necessary.</p><p>In the case of this drug, it is not a humane decision to deny it to people who are already benefitting from it.  I am not saying the Minister is inhumane, but the decision to take it from people who have had the drug is inhumane.  Second, it is bad medicine.  It is something that works in a group of people who have had the ultimate biological test.  They took it and some got better and some got worse.  Those who got better should continue to have access to it.  Also, it is bad economics.  People who are more immobile and more dependent are people who will cost more money in the long term.</p><p>Finally, I did rounds in St. Vincent's University Hospital this morning and I had to visit the emergency department.  The Minister should know that all 35 of the bays or cubicles were occupied.  There were 40 additional patients in the unit.  There was a total of 75 people in the emergency department today, 40 of whom were not in designated places but in various corridors.  It was an appalling scene.</p></speech>

This subject has been raised several times in the Seanad on the Order of Business.  In particular, Senator Darragh O'Brien has been calling for a debate on this issue for a long time and I am glad the Minister is here to discuss it.  The Minister says he does not have any input into the matter but, as Minister for Health, I am sure he has some influence somewhere along the line.</p><p>I and other Members have received e-mails and letters from people who say this drug works for them.  Of course, we will not hear from the people for whom it does not work.  If it is not working for them, they will not write to us.  The people who are writing to us are the people for whom the drug is working.  They are testament to the fact that the drug is working.  The Minister referred to a report on all the side effects the drug could cause.  I urge the Minister to get a packet of Panadol or any simple drug, because any drug carries a list of side effects.  The makers warn people that they can suffer side effects, regardless of what drug they take.  Obviously, there will be a list of side effects with Fampyra.</p><p>I travelled to Spain with my husband and he forgot his blood pressure tablets.  He went to a chemist in Spain and did not need a prescription.  He got them over the counter.  He got a year's supply of the tablet for the price of one month's supply of the tablet in Ireland.  The pricing of medication in this country is outrageous.</p></speech>

If the drug works for just under 50% of the people, as the Minister said, that is a huge percentage.  It should be available.</p><p>Are we back to the position where the cheque book is ruling the health board?  The person who can afford this drug will have the chance to walk and be mobile.  People who are stricken with MS cannot get on an airplane and fly to Spain or elsewhere to get their drugs at a cheap price.  They are grounded here because they are immobile.  If this drug helps them in any way, we should support and help them.</p><p>Last week, I tabled an Adjournment matter in the House.  The Minister was not available but he provided a reply.  The matter did not relate to a drug but to an appliance to administer a drug, the i-port Advance, for children with diabetes.  It is a simple cannula that goes into the body.  It reduces the number of injections from 120 per month to ten a month.  That is a huge reduction in the number of injections for children.  The injection takes place but it goes through the cannula and does not pierce the skin.  The piercings are reduced, not the injections.  The reply I received is the same as what the Minister told us today, that it is being considered under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  I appreciate that, but perhaps as Minister he might have some influence or input with regard to negotiating the price of the drug to reduce it to an affordable price for the State and the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600016#Q00500"><p>One of the phrases in the Minister's speech is telling.  He referred to "incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both".  When one hears that, it becomes clear that the issue is price.  Many eminent speakers in the House have referred to the fact that this drug facilitates some degree of recovery in people.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned the walking time for 25 feet.  I doubt that we are expecting people with MS to run marathons, but if we can get them on their feet it is surely a benefit.  The number of people in the country who will benefit from this drug is approximately 1,000.  That is a cost to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;4 million, which is not massive.  My colleague referred to side effects.  I am on Lipitor and there are side effects to that.  I am also on aspirin, which has side effects.  That did not stop a doctor prescribing them for me.</p><p>I ask the Minister to consider approaching the drug company.  The trial period is very short.  Within two weeks it is established whether the drug will be of benefit to a patient.  Perhaps the Minister would engage with the drug company on a cost sharing methodology that might be used so that only those people who will benefit from the drug will be funded on it.</p><p>Finally, with regard to health economics, if we can improve people's walking we can prevent situations where people find themselves in accident and emergency departments as a result of a fall.  There is a reduction in the demand for wheelchairs, wheelchair access vehicles and so forth.  There is also a reduction in the need for carers.  When the pricing for this drug is being considered, is that built into the economic model on which that depends?</p><p>I will conclude as other speakers wish to contribute.</p></speech>

Senator Darragh O'Brien has been campaigning on this issue for a long time because he has been contacted by people for whom this drug has worked.  I was contacted by a lady who lives in Dublin who has received enormous relief from this drug.  All we can do is rely on the testimonials of the people who contact us.  If there are people for whom the drug does not work, that is fine.  I am sure there are many drugs on the list that do not work for people depending on their conditions, circumstances, levels of illness and so forth.  I believe there is an overwhelming case here.</p><p>Of course, it is appropriate that the Minister cannot get involved in the micromanagement of what drugs are and are not accepted.  There is a process in place.  However, the Minister can express his wish that this would be fast-tracked and examined as a matter of urgency, and perhaps report back to the House.  Certainly it is not the Minister's responsibility to make a decision, nor should it be, but he can influence the process, if one can put it that way.</p></speech>

We have the expertise of Senator John Crown who has said no drug works in all circumstances.  We have all received testimony on individual cases.  The drug, fampridine, was approved on 23 July and patients were able to access it under the general medical card scheme.  However, two days later it was put on trial by the HSE and in November, despite people being told they would be able to use it for six months, a particular lady was told she would no longer be allowed to receive it from her pharmacist.  The pharmacist was informed not to dispense it to her and she cannot afford to pay for it.  That is both a bad process and unfair.  The circumstances of the lady in question had improved vastly because of the drug and her mobility had improved.  As she can no longer receive it, she is confined to bed.  This is a case in which the HSE promised the drug would be available for six months, but it then took it away.  Perhaps the Minister might examine the case.</p></speech>

Sometimes when these issues are debated in the media, the debates are not rational.  I am glad that the debate in this House has been.  </p><p>To respond to the remarks made by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell, this is not just about price, as we reimburse much more expensive medicines all the time; it is also about effectiveness.  </p><p>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Marie Moloney who is absolutely right in that all medicines have side effects.  In deciding which medicines are to be reimbursed one needs to take into account the side effects profile because real harm is caused by medicines all the time.  In fact, probably more people die in hospitals every year as a result of medication errors and inappropriate medications than, say, as a result of MRSA.  Therefore, the side effects profile needs to be taken into account.  It is not the case that all drugs do not have side effects; of course they do.</p><p>Senator Marie Moloney also said we needed to negotiate harder with the drug companies and she is absolutely right.  That is why the most effective approach by this Chamber is to exert pressure on the manufacturers to put pressure on the industry to reduce its prices, rather than always pressuring the taxpayer to pay more.  I hope Senators will take this into account.  </p><p>On Senator John Crown's remarks, I am sorry if I was not clear.  The reason the NHS and the London New Drugs Group - this has nothing to do with Ireland - decided not to reimburse the drug was that it worked for less than half of patients, and even for those for whom it did work, the average improvement in walking was 0.3 to 0.8 of a second, only slightly better than the rate for a placebo.  That many drugs do not work for all patients is not new, but for those whom it did work, the average improvement was minimal.  That is not to say there may not be a smaller sub-group who have responded and for whom the drug may work very well.  That is a possibility, although the evidence does not yet support it.  </p><p>I note what was said about PR advisers and take the Senator's point.  We should apply the same rules to all Government spending.  If I was to be mischievous, I might suggest we apply the same argument to the Seanad.  As somebody who actively supported its abolition, the cost of maintaining this Chamber would be better spent on the health service, but we have had that debate.  Certainly, if this Chamber wants to talk about rational spending, I will happily-----</p></speech>

Before I go into the detail of the Government's actions and future plans for the sector, I wish to highlight the significant contribution tourism has made to Ireland's economic recovery since 2011.</p><p>From a position in 2010 where overseas visitors had fallen by 16% in two years, their numbers have increased every year since 2011.  In 2013, Ireland attracted almost 7 million overseas visitors who, in turn, contributed an estimated &euro;3.3 billion to the economy.  Combining data from the domestic market and international visitors, total tourism revenue for the economy in 2013 came to &euro;5.5 billion.  Of this, &euro;1.4 billion directly benefitted the Exchequer through taxation, a very significant contribution by any benchmark.</p><p>I am pleased to report the picture for 2014 is again positive.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures released this morning show there were more than 6.5 million visits in the first ten months, an increase of 8.8% compared to the same period in 2013, representing an additional 532,000 visitors from around the world.  The growth levels are not confined to any particular geographic area but are actually shared across all international markets.  Visits from mainland Europe grew by 6.9% to 2.3 million for January to October 2014.  North America registered an increase of 14.5% representing 1.185 million visits while visits from Great Britain were up by 8%.  Visits from the rest of the world, mostly long-haul and developing markets, totalled 406,000 for the first ten months of 2014, representing an increase of 9.6% on the same period in 2013.</p><p>This growth level is particularly impressive given that 2013 was the year of The Gathering with many concerned it would be difficult to match that year's levels.  These statistics show that our exceptional tourism product continues to deliver a unique and appealing experience for visitors to Ireland.  Tourists are also heeding the advice of publications such as Cond&eacute; Nast Traveller, Rough Guide and Lonely Planet, which all recently highlighted Ireland as one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the world.</p><p>While the tourism industry itself deserves great credit for how it reacted to the economic downturn, it should be also recognised that the return to growth that has taken place in the tourism sector since 2011 was underpinned to a large degree by the Government&rsquo;s decisions and choices.</p> <p>The introduction of a special 9% VAT rate for a range of goods and services, including visitor accommodation and restaurant meals, provided an immediate boost to the competitiveness of the Irish tourist sector.  Hoteliers, restaurateurs and tourism service providers have clearly indicated the impact the lower VAT rate has had on increased trade, delivery and perception of a better value for money product, and more sustainable businesses.  It is estimated that employment in the 9% VAT categories has increased by around 30,000 since the new VAT rate was introduced.  It is important to emphasise to Senators that this tax measure was delivered in 2011 and now, more than three years later, our analysis shows it is still being fed through into lower pricing, and that lower pricing in turn is leading to the creation of large numbers of jobs and the maintenance of existing jobs.  I campaigned strongly at Cabinet for the retention of this rate and I want to acknowledge all the contributions I received from many Members of the Oireachtas on this topic.  I also acknowledge the role of bodies like the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the work they have done in highlighting the importance of this rate and how it has delivered the objectives that Government has set for us.</p><p>On another taxation issue, the air travel tax introduced by the previous Government damaged Ireland's tourism competitiveness, particularly given our island status and the importance of air travel as a means of delivering overseas visitors to Ireland.  In budget 2014 we set the rate of this tax to zero.  I am pleased to note that the major airlines responded strongly to our initiative, with a substantial growth in connectivity.  For the peak summer period of 2014, air access increased by 10% from mainland Europe, by 14% from North America and by 14% from Australia and other long-haul markets.  The relevant agencies and airports are working hard to ensure the positive momentum in this regard is maintained in the years ahead.</p><p>Looking at the various contributions to the tourism sector from Government in recent years, a particular issue this highlights is the close integration between our aviation policy and the success of our tourism sector.  Higher levels of connectivity are a direct contributor to how our tourism sector performs.  I visited one tourist attraction during the summer in my role as Minister to see how these businesses were performing.  I was told that the tourist attraction could see the direct effect of an additional route on the number of people visiting within one day of that route landing in an airport.  One of my priorities is to ensure we continue to have plans in place that maintain the existing connectivity, but look to develop it further, and to develop connectivity to other markets that will further add to the performance we have in this sector.</p><p>This increase in air capacity would not have been introduced by airlines without a compelling business case to do so.  It is clear that the quality of Ireland's tourism offering continues to resonate with international consumers.  To maintain this position, we must continue to develop our tourism offering in a way that has impact in the very crowded international marketplace.  To have an impact, new tourism initiatives must be of sufficient scale to push through the multitude of competing products and destinations.  This is the rationale behind F&aacute;ilte Ireland's move towards developing what they call &quot;brand propositions,&quot; projects of sufficient scale to be marketed overseas in their own right.  The best example of this is the Wild Atlantic Way, with which many Senators will be familiar.  This is the first major project to be developed on this basis.  It is Ireland's first long-distance touring route, stretching for 2,500 km from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  It was developed specifically for the western seaboard to address the decline in international visitors to the region.  It builds on what is distinctive and appealing about the west coast - its coastline and ocean, complemented by a deeply rooted and authentic culture and people - to give it visibility in a crowded international tourism market.  While F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided the central co-ordinating role for the Wild Atlantic Way, it would be impossible to develop a project of this magnitude without the support of the local authorities along the route.  Accordingly, I wish to formally acknowledge their contributions, for example, the work done by Sligo County Council in seeking to develop this along the route, and the work done by many local authorities in understanding that they can build strongly on the template provided by the Wild Atlantic Way.  When local authorities and local communities come together to develop an offering that is local and unique and then build that into something like the Wild Atlantic Way, it delivers an exceptionally strong overall offering from Ireland, which is why we have seen the Wild Atlantic Way deliver the kind of performance it has.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently developing a similar unifying tourism proposition for those counties in the east and south.  That brand proposition will group the cultural and heritage tourism assets and experiences of Ireland's east and south via a network of routes, trails and journeys into a new tourism experience that can be easily understood by and will appeal to overseas visitors.  It will build on the significant investment supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland using capital funding from my Department across the region, such as the Medieval Mile in Kilkenny and the Waterford Viking Triangle.  We will work to deliver a similar approach to the south and south-east of the country for next year, to build on the key insight from the Wild Atlantic Way, namely that one must develop concepts that build on what is already there within different counties and then find a way of unifying them.</p><p>While the tourism industry, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and other stakeholders are engaged in the continuous development of our tourism offering, it is the responsibility of Tourism Ireland to bring that message to potential visitors in overseas markets.  In 2014, the agency has placed a major focus on car touring holidays, highlighting in particular the Wild Atlantic Way.  Tourism Ireland has also promoted key events, including Limerick City of Culture and the Giro d'ltalia.  The agency has also capitalised on the important developments in access to Ireland that I have outlined, maximising the promotion of new, as well as existing, flights and sailings to continue to grow overseas tourism in Ireland.  Tourism Ireland will build on the opportunities presented by the new British-Irish visa scheme, which was launched last month by the Irish and British Governments.  The scheme, based on mutual recognition of each other's visas by Ireland and the UK, is an historic breakthrough between the two jurisdictions and will be initially rolled out in the key growth markets of China and India.  The scheme will build on the success of the current Irish short-stay visa waiver programme which was launched by the Government in July 2011.</p> <p>The estimated number of visits to Ireland from China and India grew from approximately 25,000 in 2009 to nearly 40,000 in 2013.  The new British-Irish visa scheme will make it even easier for those numbers to continue to grow as the hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Indian visitors to the UK each year will now be able to travel to Ireland on the same visa.</p><p>I have referred to the Wild Atlantic Way which is delivering for the west coast and the new south and east brand proposition which will be launched next year.  It would be remiss of me not to refer to what we are doing for tourism in my home city, Dublin.  Within the global tourism market, cities have the potential to be destinations complementing the wider national or regional destination, while at the same time helping to drive the sustainable long-term growth of their country or region.  Those cities that have performed most strongly include among their strengths a distinctive brand, as well as an attractive tourism proposition, rooted in a strong national proposition.  For example, Copenhagen appeals to many on the back of both its distinctively Danish and its uniquely urban characteristics.</p><p>I recently announced the establishment of a group to develop a brand identity for Dublin, to drive tourism in the capital forward and allow us to compete competitively for market share with other cities across Europe.  The group, which is being set up under F&aacute;ilte Ireland and will be known as the Grow Dublin Tourism Alliance, will be led by the chairman of Bord Bia, Michael Carey, and I thank him for undertaking this work, who will be responsible for delivering the strategy.  While recent years have shown the beginning of a recovery where tourism is concerned, Dublin is under-performing against its potential.  It has the capacity to attract even more tourists than is currently the case.  If a capital city does not fulfil its potential in terms of tourism, that has implications for the rest of the country.</p><p>Cities such as Copenhagen have shown sustained levels of growth, through initiatives such as &quot;Wonderful Copenhagen&quot;, which is a not-for-profit, public-private partnership and has seen tourism rates in that city increase by more than 8% year on year between 2008 and 2012.  There is no reason Dublin cannot do the same.  To do this, a sustainable funding model must be developed.  This will require a balance of funding from the public and private sectors, with the current rate of public sector funding being maintained and a new private sector funding stream being identified and drawn from, for which the Grow Dublin Tourism Alliance will be responsible.  I emphasise that this is not about trying to remove funding from our city or from one part of the country.  It is simply saying that when a part of the country, as is the case with Dublin, is doing well but could do better in the future with a new unified campaign to support it, it is appropriate to ask those who are involved in the industry to make a contribution to the funding of an initiative from which they will benefit.  When and if we do this, we can send a strong message to the rest of the world that Dublin is top of the list in terms of global city destinations.  My objective would be that as we get more tourists to Dublin, and it would be great if they are new tourists spending time in Dublin, it is equally important that we get them to leave Dublin to visit and sample what our country has to offer.</p><p>In the coming weeks I will publish a tourism policy statement which will prioritise investment to maximise the return from tourism in the medium to long term.  It will build on the complementary strengths of our uniquely friendly and welcoming people, the beauty and historical heritage of our country and the support and commitment of government policy.  A draft version of this strategy was published in July.  We have invited and received a large amount of inputs from all stakeholders in this sector.  The Department and I will examine those carefully and I will bring a finalised strategy to Cabinet for approval before the end of the year.  This will seek to build on the gains made in recent years and will chart a course forward.</p><p>In this context, I wish to make two points.  The first is that I understand the huge importance of balanced regional development to our economic development.  The tourism sector is a part of our economy that is uniquely placed to make a contribution to regional development.  Second, as good as the strategy will be, it will be equally important to have a group of people charged with implementing it.  Shortly after I launch the statement, I will appoint a tourism leadership group which will prepare and oversee implementation of the strategy and action plan.</p><p>I hope I have given Senators a good account of from where we have come in this vital sector, my observations on where we are doing well at present and, by outlining issues such as the contribution of aviation to this sector, the need for balanced regional economic development and my objective to identify different branded propositions for different parts of the country to build on all our country has to offer, how committed I am to ensuring that the recent years of growth are a taste of what is to come.  We all know the huge harm that was caused to the country due to having an economy that was reliant on one or two sources of growth.  The Government wishes to get the economy to a point where there are many sources of growth on which we can depend, and I am convinced tourism will be one of them.  If we continue to make the right choices, what we have seen so far will be a sign of what we can hope to achieve in the future.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Minister is shaping up quite well in his Department and I wish him well.</p><p>Tourism is a good brief to have because it continues to be a good news story.  Without being partisan, the Fianna F&aacute;il policy document, Tourism Towards 2015, to a certain extent informed much of the previous Minister's thinking on the development of tourism in this country.  It is still the blueprint for growth and I hope the Government will continue to implement the best parts of that policy.</p><p>I rarely quote statistics as they speak for themselves, but I will refer to some.  Visitor numbers are growing consistently.  Overseas visitors spent an estimated &euro;1.535 billion in the State in the first half of this year and revenue from overseas visitors grew by nearly 9%, at an additional &euro;135 million compared to the same six month period in 2013.  These are very heartening figures.  The spring figures for this year are particularly good, showing a 12.3% increase.  The chief executive of Tourism Ireland, Niall Gibbons, said that the increase in revenue is helping to boost employment around the country, with earnings in tourism and the travel sector from overseas travellers increasing 18% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year.</p><p>In addition, visitors are staying longer in the country, which is an important point.  It is something we have been pursuing for some time.  The number of nights spent in Ireland by overseas travellers increased by 13.4% in the second quarter compared to 2013, with a particular surge in the number of visitors from Great Britain.  We have always said, particularly in Kerry, that the British market is hugely important.  The numbers from North America are up by 9%.  Overall spending by overseas visitors grew by 12% in 2013 and it appears likely that it will continue to grow.  All sides of the House will welcome that and hope that it will continue.</p><p>The Gathering was clearly a huge success.  Even though the numbers have continued to grow since then, it will be difficult to replicate that through a similar project.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well with his projects in the south east, particularly in the Kilkenny-Waterford triangle.  Hopefully, something similar might recur.  The Gathering was certainly a once-off.  We know that the 1916 commemorations are approaching.  Clearly, that is a very important event in its own right and stands alone for all of us as a key iconic date in our nation's history.  We do not want to dilute that in any way but, hopefully, the programme will be also visitor-friendly and encourage people, in something akin to The Gathering, to come to Ireland to enjoy and celebrate with us, particularly in Dublin where the 1916 Rising mainly took place.</p><p>The Wild Atlantic Way project has been referred to by the Minister.  Again, I am delighted to acknowledge its success.  It has been very good for counties along the western seaboard, including my own.  Does the Minister plan to develop and broaden it?  The initial response to it has been very good with everybody, particularly hoteliers, reporting increased figures and visitors, particularly the drive sector.  </p><p>We cannot forget the rest of the country.  Clearly, the western seaboard, with its beautiful scenery, is the big attraction for visitors and the south east probably comes a close second, but there is a tranche of the country, places like Leitrim and Cavan, with very beautiful scenery.  Anyone who stood for the Seanad will be more than familiar with all the beauty in this country.  We just do not have time to admire it but I often go back to places I saw fleetingly, and it is only now that I appreciate the fantastic beauty throughout the midlands.  I suppose tackling the areas with no tourism dividend must be the Minister's next project.  Hopefully, that will happen.  </p><p>There are negatives.  A significant negative that has been reported both statistically and anecdotally is the increasing cost of hotels.  The Minister needs to address this.  Hotel prices in Ireland increased by 10% in the first half of this year.  The average hotel price in Ireland for that period was &euro;101 per night.  Dublin hotel prices increased by 15% in the first half of this year.  I am sorry to say that my county comes out of this report very badly in terms of hotel price increases.  The hotel price index, which was published in September, suggests that this trend will continue.  This is something we must monitor.  Clearly, hoteliers must make a profit but the Dublin hotels in particular are turning over numbers that are as high as they were in the boom years.  There is no problem with bed nights.  It seems to relate to trying to maximise and squeeze more profit out of it.  Everybody here will be familiar with the way hotels jack up prices when any big act is playing at the O2 or any big match is being played in the Aviva Stadium.  Hotels that would charge something like &euro;79 for bed and breakfast suddenly cost in the region of &euro;215 at the weekend just because somebody famous is in town.  That is something about which we have been complaining.  I do not know what level of control the Minister has over this but it is important.  We must provide value for money.  Those of us who have travelled in Europe and elsewhere know that it is very easy to find value for money.  There is no doubt that one can get great value in Ireland if one is prepared to wait, study and use the Internet.  However, some level of control must be introduced in Dublin and the tourist counties in high season or we will kill the goose that is laying the golden egg.  </p><p>The Minister referred to Dublin as an area where performance has not been up to scratch and I agree with him.  I live in the Minister's constituency.  I have an apartment on the north side of the quays.  I have witnessed the bedlam, crime and antisocial behaviour that is normal there, particularly on an odd weekend, and I do not know how any tourist would want to go through Temple Bar, which was built as a tourist catch-all area.  It is now a place I would advise tourists against visiting.  I have statistics on that but I will park them.  </p><p>We can be very proud of our road network.  When people talk about Fianna F&aacute;il blowing the boom, I always tell them to have a look at the roads.  I can get down to Kerry in two and a half hours without breaking the speed limit.  When I came up here seven years ago, it took me nearly three and half hours.  If one goes back further, the journey took four and a half hours.  We have a good road network and a fairly good public transport structure.  </p><p>People come to Ireland mainly for the scenery, our culture and our people because we are supposed to be the friendly Irish.  Without causing any trouble for myself, I wish to say that I like to see an Irish face behind the reception desk in a hotel, I like to see Irish waiters and I like to see Irish staff where possible.  I think front of house should be Irish because it is the Irish tradition people come to share.  </p><p>We have many festivals, including arts, racing and sports festivals of every description.  They are responsible in a major way for bringing in the big numbers.  Again, I would say to the Minister that joined-up thinking is required here.  I recently spoke in the House about something that affects my own town of Listowel.  Our annual seven-day harvest racing festival in September is a huge draw with an average of 25,000 people per day.  This is a mini Gathering for Munster.  Traditionally, people from the US and all over the world have come back for it.  This year's festival, which had huge prize money, was opposed by Horse Racing Ireland because on the same weekend the Listowel races started, Horse Racing Ireland put on a classic racing extravaganza with millions of euro in prize money in Leopardstown and The Curragh.  That is wrong.  It could be done at any other time of the year.  I can guarantee that Listowel drew three times the crowd they got with all their money.  I know racing is not the Minister's area but there should be joined-up thinking about all these festivals.  I will leave it at that.  </p></speech>

Tourism figures for last year surpassed all figures for the previous six to seven years.  As has been mentioned already, The Gathering was a wonderful success and contributed to the increased number of visitors.  A total of 3,300 communities took part in the success with festivals and home gatherings.  We were concerned that our figures would drop the year after The Gathering but I am happy to relate that Irish tourism is enjoying another excellent year, as the Minister has stated.  Our people, places and policies are delivering an exceptional experience for overseas visitors.  The friendliness of our people, the natural beauty of our island, our history, heritage and craic, and the determination of the Minister and the Government to ensure value for money for visitors have certainly contributed.</p><p>Since its formation three years and nine months ago, this Government has recognised that tourism would play a significant role in the economic recovery of this country and it has surely played such a role.  As the Minister mentioned, VAT has been reduced from 13% to 9% and this policy will continue next year.  Air travel tax was reduced to zero in last year's budget.  These are major contributions.  </p> <p>Several airlines increased the number of flights to Great Britain, mainland Europe, regional airports, the United States and Canada, to where some are now offering daily flights.  Employment in the sector increased by 17,300 jobs last year and further jobs have been created this year.  The Minister has noted that the number of 5.9 million people who visited in the first nine months of the year represents a significant increase of 9.3%.  In the period from July to September the number of overseas visitors increased by 7.9%.  In the period from January to September the number of visitors from mainland Europe increased by 7.4%, US visitor numbers increased by 13.9%, while the number from Great Britain increased by 8.9% compared to the same period last year.  There were 370,000 long haul travellers and visitors from developing markets during the same period, an increase of 10.8%.  These visitors came from the far East, including China, Japan, Australia and other far flung places.  The Government's objective for the tourism sector is to increase revenue from overseas visitors to &euro;5 billion per annum up to 2025 and increase the number of jobs by 50,000 in the same period.</p><p>The Wild Atlantic Way, a Bord F&aacute;ilte initiative, undoubtedly, increased visitor numbers to the west.  I understand F&aacute;ilte Ireland is developing a similar tourism proposition for counties in the east, south east and midlands.  I would like this initiative to be extended to the north east because at times the north east and the Border region are forgotten as far as tourism is concerned.  The Minister referred to Viking Waterford, mediaeval Kilkenny and Br&uacute; na Boinne.  I live in a mediaeval town comparable to any other mediaeval town in Europe.  It was a walled town and, like Carcassone in France, part of the wall remains today as a wonderful tourist attraction.  Work is progressing on the project which will be launched early next year.  It will help to increase the number of tourists visiting the counties involved which will I hope will include my own county of Louth.</p><p>The new British-Irish visa waiver scheme has been a tremendous success and I have no doubt it will enhance tourist numbers from the countries concerned.  I am sure the growth in visitor numbers from the United States, Great Britain and mainland Europe will continue next year and for many years to come.  The decision by the Government to retain the 9% VAT rate will allow us to offer good value, high quality holidays.  However, we need to avoid complacency and remain focused.  More importantly, we must remain competitive.  I concur with my colleagues on the benches opposite that it is difficult to comprehend why hotel prices in Dublin increase by as much as 500% or 600% for certain events.  If the local grocer and barber increased their prices from &euro;15 to &euro;75, they would not have many customers.  This is a problem for the country.  I have investigated the situation in Paris and Rome.  It also happens in these cities, but that does not mean that it is other than extortion or that it is right.</p><p>The Government will use every opportunity to identify further growth potential to ensure the tourism sector provides additional revenue and, more importantly, jobs.  In my youth fishing was a major tourism attraction in this country.  I served hundreds of visitors from Great Britain in a local pub in Carlingford and there is potential for balanced regional development in this regard.  All locations are unique and, as such, can offer something special to the discerning visitor.  There is a world market for fishing tourism.  The lakes of counties Monaghan and Cavan are underdeveloped and there are opportunities in this regard for both counties.  The Ulster Canal could enhance the tourism industry in counties Fermanagh, Monaghan and Cavan.</p><p>I cannot conclude without mentioning the many volunteers who make a significant contribution to tourism in the country.  I refer to the tidy towns and villages and those who take pride in showing them off to visitors.  They make a major contribution as visitors like to see well maintained towns and villages.  Last Monday I observed a Tidy Towns committee planting winter flowers and greenery in conditions that were so cold one would not believe it.  I thank all of those involved in the voluntary sector.  I call for balanced regional development because all areas are unique and deserve their slice of the tourism cake.  I congratulate the Minister on what he is doing.  He has a great passion for the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600023#X00200"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He outlined the picture very well for us.  </p><p>In 2010 the number of overseas visitors had fallen by 16% in two years, but it is growing once again.  The Minister has made several useful proposals to maintain this growth, including having lower VAT and PRSI rates, the visa waiver programme and improved air access.  I understand 85% of the seats on the new routes from St. John's in Newfoundland to Dublin were booked out in a matter of four or five days.  One would not have expected the route to be a huge success, but it is always welcome to have good surprises of that nature.  However, are we once again setting out to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?  </p><p>Senators on the Government side have noted that we have been here before and that previously it was appalling for the country.  Between 2000 and 2009, the proportion of people who reported Ireland as offering poor or very poor value for money as a tourist destination increased from 12% to 40%.  From what I have heard from the Government benches, I fear we may be doing the same again.  There was a massive decrease in tourism figures in the period between 2007 and 2010.  We lost approximately one quarter of visitors and 31% of revenue, according to briefing documents prepared for us on the Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2011.  I do not know what gets into people in this country that tourism becomes exceedingly bad value once it begins to revive.  It is difficult to sell a product abroad if it is bad value.  During the three years the tourism industry was falling apart, we spent &euro;162 million promoting it in 2007, &euro;179 million in 2008 and &euro;150 million in 2009, but because of overcharging and it represented bad value for money, the business did not provide a return for the Exchequer and certainly did not do itself much good.</p> <p>The key sentence in the Minister's speech is that his Dublin proposal will involve a balance of funding from the public and private sectors.  </p><p>If somebody stays in one's hotel, one gets to keep the money.  That is called capitalism in some quarters.  It is incumbent on the industry to participate with the Minister on the proposals to develop Dublin.  One cannot expect the State to do the marketing for a sector that turns out to be pretty bad value for money, when we examine what consumers have said.  We do not want to become complacent because, as I said, we have been here before.  </p><p>We have to consider whether we want this sector.  Senators opposite said they would like to see Irish people working in tourism venues, and I agree with that.  However, either we are serious about developing tourism and the people who want to work in the sector, or we accept that they want to work elsewhere and allow people from other countries, who kept tourism going in the past decade, to work in tourism.  We need to ask whether we are serious about promoting a sufficient level of training and entrepreneurship in the sector.  </p><p>I agree with the Minister on air access.  It is a topic we have discussed many times.  I welcome that Michael Cawley is assisting the Minister in developing that.  </p><p>In a speech by one of the directors of the strategic investment fund at the weekend, it was stated that the fund might invest in hotels, holiday homes, reservations systems, sport facilities and theme parks.  Again, one has to advise caution.  We invested during the boom era in hotels which lost up to 95% of their capital value.  One has to want to extend hospitality, have good food and housekeeping and have a willingness to welcome visitors.  Running tourism as a branch of the construction industry is another failed experiment that we have tried, and it is to be hoped that we do not go there again.  It is a very sophisticated industry and some of the approaches in the past were not conducive to our long-term development.</p><p>A report similar to the theme of the Minister's speech is the Dublin City Business Association report on developing Dublin.  As the Minister said, it has been losing market share.  Senator Norris and others have pointed out that a lot of the north inner city is in a pretty bad condition despite the efforts of Dublin City Council to revive O'Connell Street.  It points out that Edinburgh Castle has an income of &euro;20 million per annum, 40 times the income of Dublin Castle, which is probably a finer set of buildings.  Let us see what the task force on developing the city of Dublin as a tourism venue can accomplish.  </p><p>Involving local chambers of commerce and business groups, as the Minister intends to do, in taking on some of the marketing expenses is an extremely good idea and one that is well worth pursuing.  We had a good record at the beginning of the last decade and a very high percentage of people thought coming here was good value for money.  We lost that steadily and are now building it back up, but we could lose it again just as quickly.  </p><p>I welcome the Minister's initiatives and assure him of any support we can give on these benches, but becoming over-confident in this sphere could be very dangerous.  We made a lot of mistakes in the past, and the boom period was the harbinger of a doom period in Irish tourism from which we are now recovering.  </p><p>In terms of major events, I favour the Rugby World Cup, but the Minister's predecessor had concerns about how much we would have to pay for it.  I understand New Zealand lost money on it, and the famous case is that of Montreal, which continued to pay for the Olympics decades after the event was over.  Such events sound very good and there is a short-term boost, but we need to consider whether there is a long-term cost as the debts are paid off from the large subsidies which must be given.  It is something of which the Minister and his officials have to be particularly watchful.  They need to check whether the cost-benefit analysis is independently done.  I wish Hugo MacNeill, a fellow economist from TCD, every success in the project, but we have to check whether hosting the Rugby World Cup would cost the Exchequer, as it did in New Zealand and as the Olympic Games did in Montreal.</p><p>This is an industry in which we should be performing better.  We need to turn our promotional efforts into much better results than we did from 2007 to 2010, during which time almost &euro;500 million was spent on a industry that was in decline.  We need to insist that those involved recognise the difference between the inputs, which were extensive and expensive at the time, and the actual business generated.</p><p>Those who arrive at Rosslare Harbour have to walk about half a mile to get a train.  I do not know why we took the train station out of the Europort, which was built with a European grant.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour has been allowed to decline and very few tourists arrive there any more.  A lot of money was spent on it in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600024#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  He is particularly welcome when good news comes with him.  The figures he spoke of, and others, reflect a very healthy situation for tourism in Ireland, which is a good thing.  It is worth giving credit to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, both of which have worked incredibly hard over the past three years to rally behind the call that we needed to up our game and do something about the decline.  I pay tribute to them and their leaders, who have worked incredibly hard and have been very innovative.  </p><p>If we were looking for a fine example of innovation, it has to be the Wild Atlantic Way, because the magic it conjures on hearing its name makes one want to know more about it.  The very heart of tourism is creating something that is tantalising and attractive and draws one in, even if one is not quite sure what it is, and it is a very good example of 21st-century tourism.  We have realised it is no longer enough to say that Ireland is beautiful, which it is; rather, we need to do more to attract people to come here.</p><p>It is possibly no coincidence that there are a number of Senators here from Kerry and Sligo, because tourism is particularly important to those areas.  It is also important to the island of Ireland because, as Senator Brennan said, some areas feel left out.  The area he comes from is just as beautiful as other areas.  In Ireland we are blessed with an abundance of beautiful areas and there will always be some competition in terms of which lovely girl gets the largest piece of the cake.  Given that my lovely girl is Sligo and Leitrim, I of course want to talk about them and I would be expected to.  </p><p>We have seen a great start to the Wild Atlantic Way.  It has received significant investment and there has been a great burst of enthusiasm for it.  There is no doubt that where I live people have noted an increase in their business.  We now want to see it become more layered.  It had a great start and could afford to be brash, but it now needs to be built up more.  The ideas of signature stops and secrets were a great way to start when we had everything at our disposal.  We now have to be strategic in terms of thinking of the layers beneath.  We see that approach beginning with shipwrecks and lighthouses.  Those interested in shipwrecks can find ten of them on the Wild Atlantic Way.  A sports layer can be sold, and those interested in potholing, fishing or surfing can find such things.  We need to layer the route to allow things like food, music, culture, wildlife and history to be part of the Wild Atlantic Way.  I trust that we will see that in the future.  </p><p>While for some people the idea of a drive along the Wild Atlantic Way is appealing, RTE'S Cian McCormack had great fun when he travelled on it by bicycle earlier this year.  He brought home some of its character and characteristics.  As that wears away, we will need a second, third and fourth layer.</p> <p>Yeats 2015 will be launched next week.  It is an overarching cultural event that will reach across the country and the world but it will be rooted in Sligo.  </p><p>I hope there will be a greater emphasis of the cultural aspect of the Wild Atlantic Way.  The idea of linking poetry with the Wild Atlantic Way is very attractive, but there are many other writers and artists.  Many people travel to the west for inspiration and chose to live there because of its great landscape.  All of us who live along the west coast can cite many examples of individuals who have sought refuge or inspiration there.  It would be a very fine tribute to them and their work if we were to celebrate them as part of the Wild Atlantic Way project.  While the Minister would expect me to say this, I firmly believe there is evidence to support my suggestion.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Eireann has worked with Tourism Ireland to promote food tourism.  I also know that great food ambassadors from various counties have gone forth and visited other countries.  Food is part of people&rsquo;s creativity.  I suggest we build food trails, as has been done in various counties, but I would like to see more money invested in the sector.  Whatever else tourists do when they come to Ireland, they must eat.  When on holiday, very often people take the opportunity to enjoy foods they might not otherwise try.  This opportunity is glaringly obvious.  I would, therefore, like to see food tourism promoted more, not just on the Wild Atlantic Way but also in other areas.</p><p>I wish to address Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan's observation that front of house staff ought to be Irish because the Irish are noted and known for our friendliness.  I, respectfully, disagree with him and hope to see the new Ireland represented in businesses, hotels, sports centres and places where visitors enjoy what we have to offer.  Good training lies at the heart of this matter and it should not matter from where a person comes.  It is more important to place the emphasis on providing a friendly and warm welcome or cead mile f&aacute;ilte, rather than saying in 21st century Ireland one must be Irish to work here.  While I understood the sentiment the Senator wished to convey, I respectfully disagree with him and suggest we do something about the provision of training.  </p><p>The issue of competitiveness has been raised by various Senators on both sides of the House.  It is a serious problem, but we can never legislate for the ways people behave when they see an opportunity to make money.  Ireland operates a free market.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan used the expression that people were killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  Rather than saying people should not make money, I suggest F&aacute;ilte Ireland take the opportunity to spell things out to those involved in the business.  It would be great if it showed the evidence, as part of its various and continuing training programmes, of how one can break the model used.  In this instance, one breaks it for everyone else also.  It would be a shame if that were to happen, given the efforts made, the money invested and the belief that this country is a great place to visit.  I suggest something practical be done along these lines.</p><p>Can the Minister's Department give a lead to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland?  Its establishment and the provision of &euro;5 billion over five years are welcome.  I suggest specific emphasis be placed on small businesses operating in the tourism sector.  I am not necessarily saying they should receive more, but they should be given encouragement.  Some shape should be put on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in order that it will concentrate on that sector.  Perhaps the initiative is part of the Minister's tourism plan and, if so, I ask him to forgive me.  It would represent a terrific opportunity for the small businesses to which I refer.  I know some of those involved in counties Sligo and Leitrim have battled hard to get their small businesses up and running.  We must support those small businesses that provide cycling trails, coffee shops, opportunities to surf, go potholing or whatever else to become sustainable.  The Minister used the term &quot;authenticity&quot;, something we must retain at all costs.  If this country was to be seen as offering a smorgasbord, it would lose its attractive as a tourist destination.  I commend the huge amount of work that has been done in the sector and I look forward to further development in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600025#Z00200"><p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire freisin.  During the years we have had many debates on tourism.  Invariably, each contributor conveys a great degree of passion and we tend to emphasise the local aspect of tourism.  That tourism is diverse and that amenities are distributed throughout the country is one of its strengths.  It is important to ensure this is maintained and that marketing is not geared towards promoting large areas of population, although such areas are also entitled to benefit.  In recent years I have noticed a trend, a moving away from areas that did well in the past, but perhaps this might have something to do with policies adopted at airports.  It seems, however, that there has been a significant change in that regard.</p><p>We all seem to agree that tourism is a very important industry and that the sector has stood us well in very difficult times.  There was a hiatus for a period during the Troubles in the North, but now that we have stability, peace and progress there there is no difficulty in marketing the country.  Tourism Ireland's marketing of the island of Ireland has been a major step forward and one can sense this development when one travels abroad because one is no longer met with negativity.  </p><p>In a number of debates contributors, rightly so, have talked about the multifaceted nature of tourism.  Tourism can mean anything from incorporating the local craftsperson and food specialities to major events.  The big events are, without doubt, exceptionally important, but, on the other hand, for discerning tourists there is something very attractive about our specialities.</p><p>In recent years we have focused on cultural tourism.  As there is huge interest internationally in Irish art and culture, it is a major selling point for us.  We are told that there are 70 million people worldwide of Irish extraction, which means there is a readily available and open market for us which is virtually exclusive market.  We must, however, keep our eye on the ball in that regard.  I do not suggest we confine ourselves to that segment of the market.  About ten or 12 years ago we tended to go after what was called the floating or whizz kid tourist.  That segment is now much more competitive because every other country goes after the same business.  As the 70 million people of Irish extraction have some connection with their homeland, no matter how strong or weak, it is important to focus on that segment at all times.</p><p>The fleadh cheoil in Derry attracted 430,000 visitors, of whom 20%, or 80,000, came from outside the country, generating an income of &pound;39 million or &euro;50 million and nobody had to spend money to buy the event.  It was great to have the Minister with us at the fleadh cheoil in Sligo.  I am not blowing a trumpet for this event, but I want to make the following point.  We must always keep big home grown events in mind because, invariably, huge investment is needed.  To some extent, Senator Sean D. Barrett touched on this element.  Funding is not always the major issue but where one positions an event, activity and so on.</p> <p>One should examine the differences because tourism is about attracting people into Ireland on the basis of our difference and distinctiveness.  The people of Ireland are one of its most important tourism assets and one cannot train people with regard to c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  Much of the training I have seen runs contrary to our assets - the "yes madam, no madam" approach to training is robot-like and can turn off visitors.  Our native, natural and instinctive view of people is important and we must keep this in mind.  The characteristics that make us different are important but so too is the big issue of value for money.</p><p>It is true that Ireland was overpriced, to an extent, but this issue has been overplayed.  Many people who say prices are high do not compare like with like.  Such people compare a McDonald's restaurant with a five-star restaurant and this is not fair because five-star service and activities are strengths of the Irish tourism sector.</p><p>I wish the Minister well.  We have a great product and are well positioned so we can be confident and optimistic.  We must keep our eyes on the ball but, above all, we must be ourselves and sell and promote our distinctiveness.</p></speech>

Tourism is one of Ireland's vital economic sectors and, as others said, it stood us well in difficult times in the past.  Further, it has significant potential to play a greater role in Ireland's continuing economic renewal as it has far-reaching benefits for all areas of society.  This is felt throughout the country.<br/>The past two years have seen Ireland's stock as a tourist destination rise exponentially.  In October Ireland was named the fifth best place to travel in 2015 by the world's most influential travel publication, the<i>Lonely Planet </i>guide.  Last year saw an 11.9% increase on 2012 overseas tourist revenue figures - the total in this area for 2013 amounted to &euro;3.3 billion, excluding carrier receipts.  Combining data from the domestic market and data relating to international visitors gives total tourism revenue of around &euro;5.7 billion for 2013 - I am sure the Minister is aware of this - and some &euro;1.4 billion of this benefits the Exchequer through taxation.<br/>As Senator Brennan noted, overall trips to Ireland were up 7.2% in 2013 and the number of visitors from North America was up by an impressive 13.9%.  Meanwhile, visits from our nearest neighbour, Britain, which had slumped badly, have increased hugely.  Although visitor numbers for 2013 may be attributed, in part, to The Gathering, figures for the first ten months of this year look very good indeed - there is an upward trajectory and overall visits are up 9.3%, compared to 2013.  In fact, figures released this morning, to which Senator Brennan referred, show a 14.5% rise in the first ten months of 2014, compared to the same period last year.  The number of North American tourists visiting Ireland increased by 20.9% to an overall figure of 439,900 compared to the same period last year.  We love to see Americans come to Ireland for many reasons, not least because they are very good spenders, so they are very welcome.<br/>Tourism can help shape Ireland's image and attractiveness as a place for international companies to invest and data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, reveals that business trips to Ireland and conference activity are up 5.1%.  This is an important part of the overall figure.  The Gathering was a very clever Government initiative and the visa waiver programme, mentioned by Senator Brennan, has been also very significant, as has the reduction of the VAT rate to 9%.  I campaigned for the VAT reduction because it also has been a crucial factor in our attractiveness to tourists.  I agree with previous speakers on the competitiveness of our hotel sector as Ireland had a reputation as a poor value reputation but has managed to rid itself of this, largely.  It is regrettable that the hotel sector seems to be poor value and I agree with the other Senators who said this requires attention.  It does not take long for word to spread internationally that Ireland has become expensive again and we must not damage the overall tourism product.  Hotels in Dublin are guilty of adding on extra euros now that the economy and tourism is improving but this may be the case throughout the country.  It is a difficult area on which  we must keep an eye.<br/>Many Senators mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way and this fantastic initiative has proved very popular, not least due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been compared by the <i>Lonely Planet</i>guide to South Africa's garden route as a top global attraction.  That guide also said that quintessential Ireland is found in picturesque small towns and villages, something we all know.  With this in mind, we must ensure stricter planning regulations in small towns to prevent architectural eyesores.<br/>Exciting new enterprises by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, such as Dublin plus and culture and heritage south-east, will no doubt contribute to the continuing upward trajectory of tourism.  In spite of the highly encouraging rise in tourism figures, there are areas that could be developed, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, China, India and the Middle East.  Our agencies abroad do very good work in these markets.  We sponsored the honeymoon trip to Ireland of a couple who were well known in their homeland of China.  This was widely televised in China so it is a very clever way to promote Ireland abroad.  The territories I mentioned will be the fastest growing markets in the coming years.  The World Tourism Organisation forecasts that the Asia Pacific region will be one of the fastest growing outbound regions with an average expansion of 6.5% per year over the next 15 years.  From a purely economic point of view, it should be remembered that visitors from these markets stay twice as long and are great spenders - we like to see them coming.  They are also more likely to travel throughout the island, thus ensuring the love is shared in terms of money spent.<br/>I commend the Minister on his excellent work.</p></speech>

Cavan town recently became a beacon for the Irish tourism industry and I hope it will experience a further boost in tourism because it scooped a prestigious European visitor award.  Cavan town tied for first place as the best place for people with disabilities in the World Responsible Tourism Awards.  It was the only Irish finalist on the list and this accolade was awarded in recognition of efforts made to make the town and its environs accessible to visitors with disabilities.  Winning the award was recognition of the work undertaken in this area in the past seven years in Cavan town.  The award for best place for people with disabilities is awarded to a tourist attraction or facility that makes holiday experiences accessible and enjoyable for all, making everyone equally welcome, whatever their physical or mental challenges.  The organisers of the awards explained the category by saying that responsible tourism should be accessible to all travellers.  The focus of the category is on attractions, facilities and providers that set the standard for accessible tourism practices and serve as an example to the tourism industry.  Since an access audit in 2007, Cavan has made major efforts to become a fully accessible town.  Cavan County Council introduced various changes to the town, such as introducing by-laws to prevent street signage and furniture blocking footpaths.</p> <p>The tourist board works closely with hotels and other accommodation providers to ensure that they understand the social and economic benefits of enhancing accessibility.  This has been supported by an advisory group which comprises 13 local disability groups.  Cavan County Council has provided training for 100 people in disability awareness and 500 local businesses have been audited by the UK organisation Disabled Go with regard to accessibility within the businesses.  Cavan has already received a European Commission EDEN award for accessible tourism.  The town stands as one of the most prominent examples of what all towns can do when it comes to providing equal access to residents and tourists alike.  I take this opportunity to commend all those involved in this ongoing process.  The example Cavan Town is providing for other towns throughout the island cannot be underestimated.</p><p>The promotion of tourism acts as the storefront to promote Ireland and Irish businesses.  The brand of Ireland enhances the standing of Irish industries and products and many tourists who come and enjoy the experience return to invest in the island.  The Made in Ireland brand remains a high-quality brand throughout the globe.  However, often visitors and potential investors do not differentiate between Ireland North and South.  When tourists come to Ireland they want to experience the Ring of Kerry as much as the Giant's Causeway.  They prefer to see the history of Ireland in a holistic manner from Viking Waterford to the Rising in Dublin to the peace process in the North.  Visitors are attracted by the good work of Tourism Ireland, which seeks to promote tourism on the island of Ireland as a whole.  However, when a tourist comes to Ireland there is perhaps something disjointed between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the competing websites of Discover Ireland and Discover Northern Ireland.  This takes away from the seamless experience that tourists seek and they may not understand the separate tourism infrastructure when they are here.</p><p>One way to see this and show the problem in stark relief is when a tourist wants to stay in the Border counties.  There are competing websites to negotiate for a tourist who wishes to stay a night in Fermanagh and a night in Cavan.  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland site will ask which county the tourist wishes to visit but obviously the six northern counties are missing.  As a Cavan woman I am aware that we do not live in a coastal resort, but a visitor could be taken by surprise if she thought from looking at the menu on the website that nothing existed above Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and the peninsular part of Donegal.  This is not the first time I have raised this particular example in the Seanad, but I hope it will be one of the last.  We need to end this confusion.  There is an unnecessary duplication or division.</p><p>The potential of Irish tourism has been commented on previously.  In the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013, Ireland ranked 19th for overall travel and tourism competitiveness and seventh under the travel and tourism regulatory framework heading.  The report highlighted how travel and tourism are critical sectors of the Irish economy.  The report noted that 128 of every 1,000 jobs in the economy in 2012 were in these sectors and predicted a 2% growth in the number up to 2022.  We need to unlock further the potential of the tourism industry and we should work in closer co-operation with our colleagues in the North.</p></speech>

It is not every morning that we wake up to good news, but I certainly woke up to good news this morning from the Minister.  I gather the Minister has not yet highlighted what he has done for Donegal and Kerry by retaining the public service obligation arrangements for the regional airports.  This is vital for jobs and tourism in both areas and I thank the Minister most sincerely for it.  I have been in touch with representatives from Kerry Airport today and they are thrilled and delighted.  I assure the Minister that we appreciate it down in that neck of the woods.</p><p>The abolition of the air travel tax and the retention of the 9% VAT rate have been fantastic for tourism.  We heard more news this week from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, who told us about the roll-out of high-speed broadband, which is also vital for tourism.  Towns have rather good broadband but it is not the same in rural areas, whether Cahersiveen, Waterville or Dingle, where a person may be trying to promote bed and breakfast accommodation or a hotel.  Everything is online now.  We have online bookings and people promote bed and breakfast accommodation on websites.  It it all online and it is essential that people have high-speed and good-quality broadband for this reason.  I am very pleased with the news although it will take several years to realise.  I understand that we cannot get around to doing all of it in one go, but I urge the Minister, Deputy White, to introduce it as quickly as possible, especially for rural areas.</p><p>In places like Kerry no new industrial jobs have been announced for many years and therefore tourism and agriculture are vital.  We have to sustain and enhance what we have.  There is a great deal we can do for ourselves.  My good colleague said to me that I would get more time if I did not mention Killarney, but I told him that not mentioning Killarney in the context of tourism was like trying to eat a sugary donut without licking one's lips.</p></speech>

The work that Killarney people have put into promoting tourism has been phenomenal.  They have promoted the town, which has many natural amenities, including the lakes.  The Acting Chairman will agree with me because it is his home town as well.<br/>We have such natural beauty around Killarney and Kerry people have come together to promote it.  Hoteliers, businesspeople and Killarney Town Council, before it was abolished, unfortunately, carried out a great deal of work for tourism in the area.  Those involved are constantly promoting.  Fine websites like <i>gokerry.ie</i>and <i>destinationkillarney.ie</i>are continuously promoting what we have.<br/>Kerry has some fantastic tourism attractions such as the Killarney Golf &amp;amp; Fishing Club.  It is a fantastic facility.  When the Irish Open was held there it was broadcast throughout the world.  No amount of advertising could have brought the publicity that we got from that golf tournament.  It was fantastic.  The telephone was ringing for bookings even as the golf tournament was taking place.  In the Maharees we can go windsurfing.  Recently, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, gave us the funding to promote a greenway along the old railway track, which goes down to Cahersiveen.  This will allow us to promote cycling tours and holidays.  Someone referred to cycling as the new golf, because people are really into cycling at the moment.  It is a fantastic achievement to be able to establish this greenway along the most scenic route that one could ever see.  It is gorgeous.  I will invite all Senators to visit it when it is open.  I imagine many Senators have taken part in the Ring of Kerry charity cycle.  While it is a charity event and raises a great deal of money for charities, which is fantastic, it also brings a great many people to the county.  This is great for the hotels, guesthouses, restaurants and the local food industry.<br/>This brings me to food.  We have the best quality food in this country.  Sometimes I hear people say that if they go to Spain they can get a four-course dinner for &euro;12.  This may be so but the quality is nothing like what we have in this country.  Our food is second to none.  In such places one does not get fresh vegetables and so on; it is simply not the same.  When I go away I cannot wait to get back to have a feed of bacon and cabbage or Irish stew.  The quality of food in this country is second to none.<br/>We can do so much for ourselves.  We have the races and the writer's week in Listowel and the festival of Kerry.  There is so much going on.  It is fantastic.  The tourist season has become longer.  It is expanding because we continue to promote winter activities.  For example, let us consider Killarney again.</p></speech>

When portfolios were being handed out, the gods smiled on the Minister.  He got an excellent portfolio and a very hard-working Department of which I am very proud, as is anybody in the country.  First impressions last.  It is always exciting for me to arrive at Dublin Airport.  If I were to find fault, it is being told I would arrive at terminal 2 but arriving at terminal 1 and having to walk half a mile, or being told I am to depart from terminal 2 but finding my aircraft is in terminal 1.  I find it very annoying and I ask the Minister to talk to whoever is responsible for it.  As my colleague, Senator Barrett, said, our ferry ports are excellent, but, again, it is a route march to the nearest railway station.  We need to consider a way of transferring people there and back.  Bus services and main roads around the country are excellent.  The Minister has a lot going for him and his Department has done a huge amount of work.  The one downside of our public transport system is our railways.  Train travel is too expensive.  Senator Moloney referred to the regional airports, and the Minister is to be commended on keeping them open.  The Senator went on about Killarney a little, although it is only an island somewhere down in the south west.</p></speech>

Some time ago, when driving to Cork, I passed 15 trucks belonging to one of the main haulage companies in the country.  It is a game of mine, whenever I travel anywhere, to count the number of times I pass one of these trucks.  I cannot understand why Irish Rail has not established regional hubs from which these trucks could feed out to the local community, thereby reducing the cost of rail travel for the consumer.  The Minister might examine this.</p><p>We have some of the finest hotels in the world.  Over the past few years, in my former role as president of a union, I have been privileged to travel all over the world.  One of the issues that annoys me intensely is the way many of our hotels that have been taken over by NAMA are allowing their assets to deteriorate.  In some of the finest hotels in Ireland there is paint peeling off the wall and poor and dirty furniture.  We can do much better.  I recently booked into two hotels and when I got into bed I thought I was getting into a water bed.  They were so damp it was not funny.  I will not name the counties because I do not want people to guess where I am talking about.  We need to improve on this.  I do not necessarily subscribe to the notion that we rip people off.  In any country I have visited at any time when there has been a conference, hotel prices naturally increase.  However, we need to do something about how competitive they are with respect to those prices.</p><p>Family tourism is very important, and I wonder why we have not been able to come up with a single price ticket that covers such things as hop-on-hop-off transportation around the entire country, as well as access to cultural and heritage sites.  While one can buy a single ticket for heritage and cultural sites, if we could add transport, families coming here could budget for this aspect of their holiday and would not need to fear additional costs.</p><p>Although it is not specifically the Minister's area, I am concerned about the loss of &euro;600,000 in funding to the non-Irish-speaking islands.  Islands such as Inisbofin draw large numbers of tourists to the country, and if local development companies close down due to a lack of funding, it will be detrimental.  The Minister could step in and do something about it.  In 2007 funding was at &euro;7.7 million, but in 2010 it dropped to &euro;5.9 million.  The Minister is on the upward slope again at &euro;7 million - fair play to him for that - and he could throw another &euro;600,000 on that and give it back to the islands, which would, perhaps, allow tourism to grow there.  I commend the Minister on the work he is doing and on keeping the regional airports open.  I wish him well in his Ministry.  If there is a peach of a job in government, he has it.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing his opening remarks, as I was otherwise engaged with another portfolio in the Minister's brief, presenting the annual awards to young athletes who have represented Ireland well throughout the year.</p><p>I am delighted to contribute to the debate on tourism.  Many years ago, as a young man, I worked for Bord F&aacute;ilte in the US as a youth and educational representative.  In those days, in order to be allowed to come in at 10 a.m. and leave at 4 p.m. so I would have time to do my twice-daily training, I agreed to wear the words &quot;Discover Ireland&quot; on the front of my running shirt and &quot;It&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s green&quot; on the back.  I did my duty as an amateur athlete, not getting paid for wearing those words on my shirt, and photographs of it can be seen to this day in various magazines any time the Chairman of the Boards is ever mentioned.  While I lived in America, I was always fascinated by the affection the people there had for this great little island of ours in the North Atlantic, called the Emerald Isle.  As far as the people in the US are concerned, it is a jewel.</p></speech>

As we know, Irish tourism has gone from strength to strength year on year.  We all know how great this little island of ours is, with our vast coastline, which stretches perhaps over 3,000 km, world class surfing, inland waterways, rivers, canals, mountains, towns, cities, culture, heritage, music, sports events and the great golfers who represent Ireland all over the world.  However, our greatest trump card is our people - our charm, wit, hospitality and how we engage with others whenever we are called upon.  This is respected more outside Ireland than within.  As the Minister mentioned, tourist numbers increased by 7.2% in 2013.  During the first nine months of this year, they were 9.3% higher than the same period last year, which is great news.</p><p>I congratulate the Minister's Department on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is, perhaps, the longest defined coastal touring route in the world, stretching some 2,500 km from Donegal to Kerry.  There are many wonderful attractions along the way, with villages, towns and cities, including Galway, which is the halfway point, and there are jagged peninsulas, deserted beaches and approximately 26 offshore islands to be explored.  The Wild Atlantic Way is our version of the US Route 66.</p></speech>

If we look out the window tonight we can see it is a little foggy, as it was when I drove here from the sports awards, but the initiative to invigorate and rebrand Dublin is very welcome.  The Grow Dublin Taskforce chaired by my good friend, Michael Carey, who was recently appointed, is fantastic and I know Michael's leadership will add greatly to that initiative.  This is all about putting the visitor at the heart of the strategy.  The final report from the Grow Dublin Taskforce, Destination Dublin: A Collective Strategy for Tourism Growth to 2020, was launched in January of this year and a new plan for tourism in Dublin envisages up to 7% growth year on year, with spending expected to increase by approximately 8.6% per annum.  Spending by international visitors up to 2020 would almost double by perhaps &euro;2.5 billion, which would be a phenomenal contribution to our economy.</p><p>While we know that Dublin is performing well in terms of tourism revenue and jobs, much more needs to be done to promote Dublin and all that it can offer.  That is now under way with the taskforce.  Six out of the top ten tourist attractions in Ireland for 2013 are located here in Dublin but we need to bring together all the interests and sectors in Dublin to promote the city and the surrounding areas.  The city has many popular tourist attractions as well as some hidden gems such as back street restaurants and small, funky caf&eacute;s but what is great about Dublin is its proximity to the many beautiful spots north, south, east and west of the city, from the Dublin mountains to the sea attractions on either side of the city from Greystones to Howth.</p><p>Not only is there a focus on Dublin but also on the south and the east coasts from the north east and the Boyne Valley down to the Wexford and Waterford coastlines.  This is a living history project which will provide a balance on the east coast to the Wild Atlantic Way, and animate our country's culture and heritage.  It will be fantastic.</p><p>I want to raise one or two more issues.  I know from my experience the great work-----</p></speech>

He has an exciting portfolio at a very exciting time.  Tourism in this country is working.  The initiatives he outlined in his contribution are working.  The welcome aspect in terms of tourism marketing is that we are taking a joined-up, corporate, professional approach.  The Gathering was the first attempt at having an international corporate marketing campaign.  Until then we had Kerry promoting Kerry, Clare promoting Clare and so on but The Gathering was Ireland promoting Ireland, which was the only way to do it.</p><p>The Wild Atlantic Way is well able to compete with places such as the Camino and so on.  Again, a corporate approach was taken to that in terms of pulling together all our assets and presenting them abroad as an attractive package.  The concept of the Wild Atlantic Way is working, and the proof of that is the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience which had over 1 million visitors this year.  That is a credit to all involved but I consider the Cliffs of Moher, along with a number of other tourist attractions, as a gold plated attraction and we need to invest in the silver plated attractions.  The gold plated attraction will bring people into the vicinity but the silver plated attractions will keep them in the area.  For example, the Cliffs of Moher attracts 1 million visitors but, unfortunately for County Clare, most of them are day trippers from Limerick, Dublin or Galway.  They do not stay overnight in County Clare so in order to put together a package that is attractive for those people to stay after they have done the four hour trip to the Cliffs of Moher, we must invest in silver plated facilities.  We must ensure we have proper sports facilities, amenities and other attractions to promote, even if we need tax incentives to encourage people to build tourism-specific attractions.  </p><p>I know someone who is attempting to create a miniature fishing village and they are going through various hoops in terms of planning and so on.  That is not to do with apartment complexes, hotels or anything like that.  It is a product that is specific to tourism that would work and add to the suite of services, facilities and attractions available to tourism.</p><p>We must invest also in year-round facilities.  Our tourism season in the cities is almost a 12 months business but in rural areas, seaside resorts and so forth there is no reason we cannot extend the tourism season to eight to ten months of the year, and that will be done by effective and clever investing in weather resistant facilities.</p><p>There is a lot more I could say-----</p></speech>

The Minister is anxious to conclude, and I am anxious to facilitate him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600029#DD01200"><p>I will be very brief because I know the Minister has other engagements.  The success of our tourism product was not by accident but because of Government policy.  Consciously deciding to have a 9% VAT rate and eliminating the travel tax were policy decisions made by Government that have yielded tremendous success over recent years, and long may it continue.</p><p>Senator Conway mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way.  We were a little disappointed in Waterford that it was not continued to Waterford because we are on the Atlantic as well, but I believe there are plans to continue that from a tourism point of view.</p><p>We are having great success in promoting Waterford with the Viking Triangle but sports tourism is very important and we need to finish our sports complex at the institute of technology.  It is almost complete but we need about &euro;1.5 million to host major international events, which would be very beneficial.  In terms of the greenway, it is almost two-thirds complete but we need to complete it.  I will conclude because I know the Minister is in a hurry.</p></speech>

I will respond to the main point each Senator has made to me to conclude this debate.</p><p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his contribution.  I am always reluctant to describe any part of our economy as being a good news story because we do so at the cost of forgetting - not that Senator O'Sullivan did - how difficult things were for quite a while and not acknowledging choices that were made to get us to where we are now.  It is extremely important that we are conscious of that when we talk about tourism because a challenge we will face is looking at measures we can put in place in our economy to ensure that the kind of growth we see happening now continues at a more sustainable pace in the future.  That is something my strategy, which we will launch later in the year, will seek to address.</p> <p> I take a different view on the point made about front-of-house operations - who is behind the bars and working in cafes.  A great strength of our country is the variety of communities we have.  While I understand Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s point of view, what is more important is the training that is made available to the person and the culture within the cafe or pub that the tourist is visiting.  That is the real test of the welcome we can offer.  Everyone living here is capable of doing that and we have to support them with training to make sure that happens.</p><p>Senator Brennan spoke about the role of local communities in delivering our tourism offering, a point with which I agree.  I have been impressed by the degree to which local communities have built upon what was delivered through the Wild Atlantic Way by the Government and local authorities.  It is a significant part of the magic of what that offering is achieving.</p><p>Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan and Barrett emphasised the risk of killing the goose that laid the golden egg with pricing and competitiveness of hotels and other tourism facilities.  My message is simple.  My support for retaining the 9% VAT rate is absolutely conditional on ensuring that we continue to offer good value to tourists.  We will not accept a return to the kind of behaviour and pricing that crippled our ability to give good value to people who came to our shores in the past.</p></speech>

This investment will not come from the taxpayer but from the owners.  I accept the need for them to set prices in such a way as to make that sustainable.  The sustainability goes both ways.  There has to be pricing that is sustainable to deliver investment, but it must also be sustainable to deliver a competitive offering to tourists.  The moment I see evidence that this is stopping, my support for delivering the 9% VAT rate will be revisited.</p><p>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe on the need to layer the Wild Atlantic Way and examine how it can be developed.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; touched on the role of cultural tourism and the success of a recent fleadh in Sligo, which I was privileged to attend.  It would be ungracious of me were I not to acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s role in it.  I take a different view from his on how we offer a welcome and who is able to do that.  He warned about going after the floating tourist market.  I have been impressed by the work done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on market segmentation, analysing the various potential tourists who could come to Ireland and establishing plans to go after them.  This has underpinned the recent success in the tourism industry.</p><p>Senator Noone touched on all of the different measures implemented by the Government.  Senator Reilly referred to the accolade recently awarded to Cavan town in the World Responsible Tourism Awards.  Senator Moloney acknowledged the recent announcement on public service obligations, PSOs, for airport routes between Donegal, Kerry and Dublin.  I took the decision to support the PSOs because of the contribution that aviation connectivity makes to our ability to deliver a very strong tourism offering.  I am confident that the airports and those involved in delivering those routes will rise to the challenge.</p></speech>

I wish him the best of luck in the contribution he will make to it.  He is correct with regard to the importance of airports and the contribution they make to how a tourist first views the country.  The establishment of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport represents a massive improvement compared to what was there several years ago.  These new facilities provide a good welcome to tourists.  The airports, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, have tackled the waiting times for passport checks for arrivals at our airports.  I will raise the point made by the Senator about the journey time between the two terminals.</p><p>I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for the work he has done with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and representing Irish sport abroad.  I agree with him on the need for Dublin to examine its image.  That is why I have put in place the Grow Dublin Tourism Alliance, which Bord Bia chairman, Mr. Michael Carey, has agreed to head.  I thank him for taking on this large project, with which he will do a brilliant job.</p><p>Senator Conway hit the nail on the head on the need to join up all the various tourism initiatives that we have in place.  I am sceptical, however, about the role of targeted tax incentives for particular tourism projects because of my concerns regarding their ability to pay out in the future.  I agree with the Senator on the need to complement what he called the gold-plated attractions with other tourism attractions so they can come together to give people the opportunity to have a good visit.  We must continue to provide opportunities for extending the length of stay of tourists.</p><p>The Tidy Towns competition makes a good impact in terms of developing a community-based welcome to visitors to towns.  As Senator Cummins knows, it is not an act of God that we have a tourism sector that is performing so well.  It has happened because of the quality, leadership and stamina of those working in it, supported by the Government&rsquo;s decisions.  All of that coming together has got our tourism industry to where it is now.  The Senator also pointed to progress in the development of the Great Western Greenway, and I am confident that it will be a greater success in the future.  On the point about the Viking Triangle, I am examining how we can build on this in Waterford and neighbouring counties and market it collectively abroad in a better way than we have been able to thus far.  I am sure that when we get this in place next year it will give more support to businesses and communities in Waterford city and county.</p></speech>

An overwhelming amount of scientific evidence is available demonstrating the positive effects on our health.  Regular participation in sport can help in the prevention of several serious diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, etc.  In addition to its impact on people's physical welfare, recent evidence demonstrates that participation in sport can have therapeutic benefits and a positive impact on those suffering from depression.<br/>There are significant benefits in hosting international sports events, with which I imagine the Minister of State is familiar.  Above all, such events provide an opportunity for Irish sports fans to watch their sporting heroes compete against the world's best on their home pitch or soil.  From a tourism perspective, such events not only draw visitors but they also act as an advertising opportunity for the country to showcase all it has to offer to the prospective and discerning tourist.  The hosting of events such as the <i>Giro d'Italia</i>this year and the Irish Open golf tournament has demonstrated Ireland's capacity to successfully host large international events, welcome participants and spectators alike and ensure they have a wonderful experience during their time in the country, an experience which will, I hope, leave them keen to visit Ireland again in the future.<br/>One month ago I met eight American visitors in the hotel where I stay on a regular basis.  I asked them whether it was their first visit to Ireland.  Two of them had been here two years ago to see the University of Notre Dame play in the international football match.  They had come back with six other friends.  We should not underestimate the opportunities that can result when people happily spend a few days or a week here and then come back bringing six, eight or ten others with them.<br/>In a previous debate I saluted the volunteers of Tidy Towns committees throughout the country and the contribution they had made to tourism.  I now salute the great majority of the thousands of sports clubs in Ireland that are run entirely by volunteers.  Sports clubs account for the vast majority of volunteering in Ireland.  These volunteers allow the high level of sporting activity that takes place in Ireland to be sustained.  This activity not only has positive health benefits mentioned for the participants but also numerous social benefits through the participation of all those who participate in sport more generally, whether as supporters, managers and parents, or, in many cases, as all three.  Therefore, the work of volunteers who keep clubs going must be saluted.  I do not believe we could put a revenue price on the hours they put in, winter and summer.  Therefore, those involved are to be congratulated.<br/>This year saw 2,036 applicants under the sports capital programme, the second highest number ever.  This clearly shows the continuing demand and need for investment in sports facilities.  I was delighted when the sports capital programme was reinstated in 2012.  I commend the Minister of State for this reinstatement and acknowledge the major role he played in restoring grants after a gap of four years.  Long may they continue to be paid.  In 2011 the Minister of State was the main instigator and many thousands of sports clubs, including GAA, soccer, boxing, gun and badminton clubs, have improved their facilities as a result.  The Government has since invested over &euro;100 million under the sports capital programme, which funding has provided a major boost for clubs throughout the country from Malin Head to Mizen Head and from Carlingford, where I live, to Clifden.  The islands have also benefited.  I cannot underestimate or over-emphasise the importance of the grants to communities the length and breadth of the country.  I know that the Minister of State recognises the major benefits the programme has brought to clubs throughout the country and encourage him to continue to support the programme.  Every time I listen to him he speaks with gusto.  He is passionate about sport and improving sports facilities throughout the land.  I congratulate him in this regard and wish him continued success.</p></speech>

It is only a couple of hours since we had the pleasure of breaking some bread and congratulating the wonderful young athletes and magnificent volunteers to which Deputy Terry Brennan alluded at the national athletic awards.  </p><p>I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate.  As the Minister of State is aware, my life has been dominated by sport which is still very much my life in terms of my contribution as a coach to the development of some of the young boys and girls who take part in athletics.</p><p>Ireland is a tiny little nation, but the majority of our sports people have done us proud throughout the world for many decades.  Only the other day in the Seanad I made reference to the fifth gold medal won by young Katie Taylor at the world boxing championships in South Korea.  I made reference to the fact that a statue of her should be put up in Bray.  However, with reference to the cross which was knocked down on Carrauntoohil last week, perhaps the cross on Bray Head should be replaced with a statue of Katie Taylor to serve as inspiration for the youth of Ireland.</p><p>Our sports stars are world-renowned.  They are known by their first name - Ronnie, BOD, Sonia, Rory and P&aacute;draig.  At home we talk about Henry, the Gooch, D. J., Oh Ah and Keano.  Everyone seems to know about these wonderful sports stars and their great achievements.  They are high achievers and have been from the time they were young.  This is because of the tremendous amount of hard work they do and have done since their teens morning, noon and night and through the harsh depths and cold of winter.</p> <p>It was always done with non-stop dedication.  Any time they went through a bad patch they always sought the positive side of things.  They had the vision and ambition to succeed at the highest level.  They knew how to enjoy the thrill of victory and endure the agony of defeat and always came through on top of their game.</p><p>Sports tourism is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the tourism industry, and I understand that at the recent European summit on sports, which took place in Ireland, there was a call for the establishment of a national bid unit here.  The unit would be under the auspices of the Minister of State's Department and would give us the opportunity to attract major sporting events to Ireland, such as the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  I am not just talking about bringing sports events to Ireland; this is about making Ireland a tourist attraction.  I refer to everything from the amount of money that visitors spend here to the exposure this island gets around the world on television.</p><p>Sport is not just about winning at Croke Park, in the boxing ring or at a major international golf event.  The importance of sport is in how it impacts on society, our health and our well-being.  Sport develops social skills and confidence and increases the self-esteem of young men and women.  Sport teaches us what hard work and ethics are all about; it teaches us how to win and how to lose.  It is important to instil a good education in young sports people before and through their teenage years.  They must learn of health, well-being and the importance of nutrition.</p><p>Points for Life is a pilot programme that I initiated in Wicklow schools based on a motion passed in the Seanad a number of years ago.  Thanks to the support of the Minister of State in funding this initiative, the Department of Education and Skills implemented the programme and the evaluation was completed by the physical education, physical activity and youth sport research centre at the University of Limerick.  Unfortunately, when the results of the evaluation were published they supported what we already know: the fundamental motor skills of young people in Ireland are in very poor condition.  There was a marked improvement over the six months of the pilot programme but, unfortunately, the young boys and girls who participated are still below the 25th percentile, which is not good.</p><p>The national governing bodies are doing a phenomenal job on sports participation, and not just at elite level.  As mentioned at today's lunch, the number of recreational athletes and joggers has been increasing, particularly in the age range from 25 to 35 years and older.  This applies not only to my sport but to triathlons too, so perhaps it is only when people reach their 20s that they realise they have missed out on something.</p><p>I welcome the Sport Ireland Bill and the merger of the Irish Sports Council with the National Sports Campus Development Authority, as it will be great to bring Irish sports under one umbrella.  The Minister of State mentioned volunteers, without whom this country would be in a sorry state.  The Minister of State estimated the financial value of contributions made by volunteers to be around &euro;1 billion.</p><p>Sports capital grants always seem to benefit the three big sports: the GAA, soccer and rugby.  They get most of the funding down the line, not just grants to national governing bodies.  I am biased on this issue.  Athletics is a core subject in schools but, unfortunately, 15 counties out of 26 received no funding for athletics clubs.  In Dublin some &euro;8 million was distributed in sports capital grants, but only two athletics clubs received grants, each amounting to &euro;40,000.  Many small clubs and organisations make applications for sports capital grants but may not have the administrative capabilities of the big three organisations.  I ask the Minister of State to consider giving such organisations a support mechanism.  They apply for the grants every year and their volunteers need support.  The Minister of State has applauded such volunteers for their contributions to the country.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il supports this motion and recognises the critical role played by sport in society.  With over 1.7 million Irish adults participating regularly in sport, the State has a central role in supporting sports activity across the country through infrastructure and policy supports.  As a result of unprecedented levels of investment by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, Irish people have more opportunities to play and compete in a wider array of sports than ever before.  With over &euro;730 million allocated to more than 7,400 projects since 1998, the sports capital programme has significantly improved the quality and quantity of sports facilities in almost every village, town and city in the country.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national sports centres, and Fianna F&aacute;il believes that continued targeted investment in sport is vital to maximise the benefits that arise in the areas of health and well-being, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.</p><p>I echo the comments of Senator Eamonn Coghlan in commending the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on the work he has done since the reintroduction of the sports capital programme by this Fine Gael-led Government.  I cannot think of a better fit for the role of Minister of State with responsibility for sport than Deputy Ring.  He has done significant work in the past two years.  Because of where he is from - like me, he has lived in the snipe grass for some time - he knows the value of a shilling.  The Minister of State understands the importance of sports capital grants to clubs across the country, irrespective of national organisations that also benefit.  The big three organisations will always get the largest share - this is only proper, as they have the highest levels of participation - but I hope the Minister of State continues to try to square the circle and give money to the kinds of organisations outlined by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  Katie Taylor provides a fine example, and we are all proud of her achievements; she has put us on the world map in the sport of women's boxing.  We should consider where Ms Taylor came from.  I listened to a radio vox pop in Bray immediately after her victory in South Korea and many drew attention to where she trained.  She now has proper gym facilities, and I commend the Minister of State on ensuring this is the case, but, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan noted, many athletes involved in minority sports are not far from changing clothes behind a shed.  There are still problems with facilities and resources, and I know the Minister of State will fight hard, along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, at the Cabinet table, to secure more money in these areas.</p><p>It is extraordinary the impact that sport has.  I recently read that sport generates billions of euro across the world; this information may have emanated from the convention referred to by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  Sport permeates every aspect of life, and Ireland is a sports-mad nation.  It is extraordinary that an island the size of Ireland, with a population of around 5.5 million people, has a rugby team ranked number three in the world.  Ireland also has the GAA, the premier sporting organisation on the entire island, which connects urban and rural areas.  The late Kevin Heffernan, Heffo, started the sequence of success for Dublin in the mid-1970s.  Prior to that, Dubs, even those living around Croke Park, did not attend GAA matches, as they were regarded as culchie games.  Dubs attended soccer matches in Tolka Park and went to see the Hoops, Shamrock Rovers, in Glenmalure Park.</p> <p>An awful lot of them did not go to GAA matches.  Now look at the transformation.  Not only do they go-----</p></speech>

Maybe he went from the leafy suburbs, where he was born.  I am talking about the real Dubs.  Now look at them.  They are proudly wearing the Dublin shirt, not just at the football matches which they attend in enormous numbers, but all over the place.  There are so-called colours nights in Copper Face Jacks where one will see the Dublin shirt and all the other county shirts as well.  Many college students in Dublin go to that particular venue.  I do not want to give it too much free publicity, because the Dublin captain has already given it enough.  My daughter used to go there and she wore the Leitrim colours with great pride.  That venue hosts colours nights and all the young people there wear their county colours.  That would never have happened years ago.</p><p>I remember Ireland's wonderful success in Italia 90, which captured the imagination of the entire country.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that it was another benchmark moment when Irish people embraced the Irish soccer team, which did wonderful things for the country.  Even those who did not know or care much about soccer were impressed that Ireland was out there, within a whisper of getting to a World Cup semi-final in Italy.  I remember that in the years subsequent to 1990 the number of Italians visiting Ireland increased significantly.</p><p>An interesting fact is that when Sunderland won the FA Cup in 1973, productivity rose in the north east of England in the weeks and months following that success, such was its uniqueness.  That has happened in Ireland too.  Economic performance is not necessarily gauged by the number of international companies coming to Ireland.  It is as much gauged by the success of Ireland abroad in various sporting activities.  I have no doubt that the people of Bray and most of those in the boxing fraternity have an extra spring in their step since last Sunday, when Katie Taylor won the World Championship.  When Ireland wins the Rugby World Cup next year, we will all have a spring in our step.</p></speech>

While that does not apply to the Minister of State, it certainly is the case for some parents, who use sport as a baby-sitting service for their children and then, when their Johnny does not get picked for the team, blame the volunteer who has done all the work.  People should be less critical of the volunteers who are in every village and town in Ireland.  While there are plenty of them, there still are not enough.  As we all know, it is the same people who do all this work all the time.  The amount of time they invest in motivating young children is just unreal.  Thanks to these volunteers, we have a huge level of participation in sport, which gels together all nationalities.  Sport has no boundaries and does not recognise religion, colour, creed or status.  Indeed, we had a member of the Traveller community carrying our national flag at the Olympic Games.  This is all brought about by volunteers.<br/>Money spent on community centres, new pitches, swimming pools and so forth is money well spent.  It is far better than spending money on courthouses.  In that context, I must compliment the Minister of State on divvying out the sports capital grants in a very fair manner.  He listened to all representations made to him.  One might say he is the Santa Claus Minister of this Government, because there is nobody else delivering anything.  I recall making representations to the Minister on behalf of the gymnastics club in Ballaghaderreen, which was awarded &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 under the sports capital programme.  Were it not for that money, the club would have been shut down.  In that sense, the Minister of State is keeping structures in place.<br/>Participation in sport contributes greatly to healthy socialising, greater academic success and better character values.  In my own town of Ballaghaderreen I managed an under-14 soccer team about four years ago.  I played my small part and the team won the premiership that year.  Members of the local Traveller community were on the team, as were members of the Pakistani community, as well as local lads.  The Pakistani lad who played on the team, Sharoize Akram, is now playing minor football for Mayo, and will go on to greater things; of that there is no doubt.  He is an absolutely unreal athlete and he will end up playing senior football with Mayo.  Cian Hanley was also on that team.  He is a brother of Pearce Hanley, who plays for the Brisbane Lions.  Cian, who is just 18, has now gone out to Australia, having signed a contract with the Brisbane Lions too.  Ballaghaderreen is also home to the Connaught cricket champions.  All of this started from volunteerism.<br/>We also have a 14-year-old badminton player in Ballaghaderreen called Adam McAllister, who won a European championship match recently.  He was in the same class as my own son, whom the Minister of State met and who is a four-time world champion Irish dancer.  In the same class is a young lad called Patrick Callaghan.  Two years ago his father decided that Patrick was not getting enough exercise so he brought him out walking.  He got bored with walking after a few days so his father decided to try the golf course.  He borrowed some clubs and brought him out.  Patrick took to golf in an instant and has won both national and international competitions already.  It is reckoned that he will be the next Rory McIlroy.<br/>We also have a very successful Gaelic football club and soccer club.  I thank the Minister of State for awarding grants to both of those clubs, as well as to many other clubs in my area.  All of those clubs are run by volunteers.  There is huge participation in sport in my own town and many other towns.  It is keeping children away from PlayStations.  At this point I wish to make special mention of a man called Brian Tansey, who passed away a number of years ago.  Brian was not just a volunteer; he was an extraordinary volunteer.  He was involved with the GAA, gymnastics, the Community Games and so on.  He coached children from the age of four.  I remember bringing my then four- or five-year-old son to the GAA club for the first time.  Brian was there, coaching with the club.  I watched my young fella out on the field, like any proud dad, and hoped that he would get the ball and kick it over the bar, but he would not run or call for the ball.  He just stood there.  I asked myself &quot;Is he going to do anything?&quot;.  Brian Tansey then intercepted the ball in mid-air, went over to my son and handed it to him.  That was his first kick of a ball.  Now he is playing for the east Mayo minors and is hoping to compete for a place on the Mayo minor team.  This was all brought about by volunteerism and good volunteers.<br/>There are children out there who will say, every so often, &quot;There is nothing for us to do,&quot; but for God's sake, there is plenty for them to do.  The following is some advice from a judge who regularly dealt with young people, which was passed on by John Tapene, principal of Northland College in New Zealand:<blockquote>Always we hear the cry from teenagers, &quot;what can we do, where can we go?&quot;  My answer is this: Go home, mow the lawn, wash the windows, learn to cook, build a raft, get a job, visit the sick, study your lessons and after you've finished, read a book.  Your town does not owe you recreational facilities and your parents do not owe you fun.<br />The world does not owe you a living, you owe the world something.  You owe it your time, energy and talent so that no one will be at war, in sickness and lonely again.  In other words grow up, stop being a cry baby, get out of your dream world and develop a backbone not a wishbone.  Start behaving like a responsible person.  You are important and you are needed.  It's too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday.  Someday is now and that somebody is you!</blockquote>That is very good advice.  I thank the Minister of State and urge him to keep up the good work.  We hope that next year he will be acting like Santa Claus for the people of Roscommon again.</p></speech>

I recall on one occasion being in a taxi in Cyprus and trying to have a chat with the driver.  I asked him if he knew much about Ireland and he said that all he knew about Ireland was the Irish soccer team and Tipperary mineral water.  That shows, in a way, how much we depend on sport to promote ourselves as a people.  For a small country, we have done exceptionally well.  I look across the floor at Senator Eamon Coghlan.</p> <p>We all felt part of his great successes and victories.  We will never forget watching Ronnie Delaney crossing the finishing line in 1956.  For people of a particular age, there will always be a memory of that race.  I often think of Tommy Wade jumping against the clock on his little horse Dundrum to win the Aga Khan Trophy.  I can still remember that when he came back to Tipperary thousands of people turned out to meet him.  I remember the famous horse trainer Vincent O'Brien for whom there was a civic reception when I was chairman of Cashel Urban District Council.  He was humble and modest, yet a world figure.  I am only naming those close to me.  There is also the hammer thrower and Olympic champion Dr. Pat O'Callaghan in whose company I had the privilege to be on many occasions.  He was a modest man, yet he won a gold medal for Ireland against the world.  </p><p>When we look back, we think about the unifying effect of sport.  Those of us who have read stories about events in County Kerry, in particular the Civil War, remember that it was the GAA which brought both sides together.  This is recorded in many books and shows the unifying effect of sport at the time.  </p><p>Sport has many faces.  Members have referred to the 1,200 sports clubs in the country.  Divide that figure by 32 and we are talking about 30 to 40 clubs in every county.  That gives an idea of the extent to which people are involved.  They are underpinned by 500,000 volunteers.  The figures are huge and we possibly take them for granted.  When we have a debate such as this and look at the statistics, we realise 1.7 million people participate in sport every year.  We are talking about the whole nation; it is as simple as that.  </p><p>The importance of sport was brought home to me very strongly at the start of the recession.  People were down, confused and wondering where their lives were going.  However, it was all forgotten when an Irish team or a person's county team was playing.  This feeling did not last for the duration of the match only but for days afterwards.  It was like having an injection of life into a community.  Given its broad infrastructure, sport seems to touch everybody in some way.  That is its importance.  It affects the young, the old, the poor and the rich.  There are no politics; it has that influence for good. </p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan touched on the commitment of sports people.  In order to reach their peak, huge discipline is required.  Whether playing with a local club, on the world stage or in Croke Park, the commitment required cannot be overstated.  The physical aspect is not the only important one.  We live in an age in which we are worried about health issues and playing sport is possibly one of the best ways to have a healthy nation.  We have to remind ourselves of this.  There is another aspect to sport - it gives us role models for young people.  We often hear parents say when young people are involved in sport that it keeps them off the streets and stops them from getting bored.  It also gives them a sense of team spirit and develops character.  </p><p>We need to speak about the purse.  Nobody knows better than the Minister of State the excitement in an area when a sports grant is granted.  It is so important, be it small or big and we are all aware of it.  However, communities are not being given 100% grants, which incidentally would not be a good idea.  They will have done their homework and be able to prove to the Minister of State and the Department the viability of the proposition made.  However, the acknowledgement of the State makes a difference.  It is adding that piece of the jigsaw to develop the project.  People will buy a pitch, on which they will have to work in draining and sodding it.  They will have to erect a stand and so forth.  When I played with Cashel King Cormacs, we togged out on the side of the field in hail, rain or snow.  That was important, too, and we have all done it, but it was a different period.  We have to be proud of the progress we have made.  Only for that progress we would not have had the achievements we have had.  There was a great spirit in the old days.  If I attended a Munster final in the 1960s or 1970s and Cork and Tipperary were playing, even at a young age, the adrenaline was flowing at such a rate that one wondered if it would be possible to withstand the excitement until the Sunday night.  There was always a sense of sportsmanship.  Even if we got excited, there was never an artificial triumphalism; the opponent was always respected.  That must be part of the social asset.  However, like every other country, the country is changing and has new challenges, obstacles and outlooks, but that spirit is still necessary.  </p><p>I commend the Minister of State who I know has travelled the length and breadth of the country.  I have heard his addresses at events and agree with Senator Terry Brennan that there is a passion and a spirit in him which has to be symbolic of the spirit of sport.  We are lucky to have people like him.  It is one thing to give a grant; it is another to have a Minister of State with a deep interest in what is happening.  One hopes he will realise from this debate the admiration for his work and, above all else, the importance of helping sport, even when it is being threatened and challenged.</p></speech>

He is not here often enough.  We will have to have him here more often to speak on sports subjects, in particular.  Like music, sport transcends all barriers and is a unifying force.  I compliment the Minister of State on the restoration of sports grants.  I know the work that went into this decision and that the Minister of State had to fight his corner.  His efforts are respected the length and breadth of the country and the money is well spent.  Money spent on sport and sports clubs - irrespective of the sport involved - is money well spent.</p><p>I feel the passion in speaking about sport.  We have the Louth jersey.  We also have a Roscommon or Mayo one.  I do not know which one Senator John Kelly wears.  Tipperary is represented.

She is probably one of the best sports people ever to come out of the country.  I heard Michael Carruth speak on radio recently about the facilities for boxers.  He mentioned, as did Senator Paschal Mooney, that prior to the games in South Korea, the facilities in Bray were spartan.  They are now very good.  He said the sport of boxing was doing well under the sports capital programme.  However, he also said they would always fight their corner to get more.  Fair play to him - that is what he should be doing.  </p><p>I wish to speak about Waterford Institute of Technology.  It has a major sports complex which hosts national, interprovincial and international events.  We are only short &euro;1.5 million to complete the project which will prove to be the catalyst in attracting many sports events to Waterford and the south east.  There will also be a conference centre which will be able to cater for over 2,000 people.  This is absolutely necessary as such a centre is not currently available in the south east.  I hope the project will not fall between two stools, the Departments responsible for education and sport.</p> <p> I also wish to refer to physical education, PE, in our schools.  There is not enough emphasis on PE in primary schools in particular.  There is some emphasis on it in secondary schools but there should be far more PE in primary schools.  In that regard I note the project mentioned by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  From a health point of view it is very important that there is greater take-up of, and emphasis on, physical education.</p><p>I cannot pass up on the opportunity to compliment our volunteers in every area of sport.  I lined pitches, put up nets and, more importantly, took nets down for many years, and people everywhere are doing that day in, day out.  They are the unsung heroes of sporting clubs, be it soccer, athletics or any sport.  We are blessed to have so many of them and to have that type of volunteerism through the length and breadth of the country.</p><p>I wish the Minister of State well and I hope there will be another tranche of sports capital grants in the near future to assist clubs.  As Senator Kelly said, the &euro;7,000 that the gymnastics club in Ballaghaderreen received was as important as the &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 received by any other club elsewhere in the country.  Small grants are as important as the large ones.  When people get something they get off their backsides and put the effort into building their communities.  The grants given to sports are an investment in communities throughout the country.  I commend the Minister in that regard.</p></speech>

Having listened to my colleagues, it is clear we could continue this debate all night in view of the many different areas of sport in which we can be proud of our nation.</p><p>I commend the terrific achievement of Katie Taylor in her fifth world championship victory.  She really is the pride of the nation in all she has achieved and, I am sure, is yet to achieve.  The recent success of our rugby team against all the odds and against people's expectations was phenomenal.  Fingers crossed, let us hope the Irish soccer team can continue on course.  There has been a bit of a blip but hopefully the team can return from that and reach the European championships once again in 2016.  Soccer is my passion, particularly Dundalk FC in my home town.  When people talk about soccer everybody recalls the glorious days of 1990 and how it brought the nation together.  People nearly went bankrupt trying to get to the World Cup in Italy.  It shows how much sport unifies us as a nation and the pride we take in the success of our athletes, regardless of who the athlete is.</p><p>As a keen supporter of soccer, and particularly of my home team, and in my regular meeting with representatives of local sports clubs, I am acutely aware of the significant impact many clubs and organisations have had in local communities.  Local clubs are integral to their communities and are often a focal point for many people.  They provide a tremendous social outlet, aside from the sporting aspect.  The sports capital programme has provided considerable funding to local clubs in my area, which in turn gets re­invested in the community and provides a boost which reverberates across many groups of varying ages.  This year, 24 local sports clubs were awarded over &euro;l million in sports capital funding in County Louth, for which we are extremely grateful.  This funding went towards sports equipment, upgrades to club facilities and other necessary improvements.</p><p>Local sports clubs promote physical activity while also promoting inclusion and positively contributing to mental health.  That is another aspect we should discuss.  I recently met with representatives of Naomh Colmcille GAA club in Drogheda to discuss their mental health initiative, &quot;How Are You Feeling Today?&quot;.  This excellent initiative aims to provide activities in the local club to help maintain and develop the mental well-being and physical fitness of those who are isolated and in need in the community.  Sports clubs provide a vital and important outlet for many people in their daily lives as evidenced by this local initiative, which is replicated throughout the country.</p><p>I have been proud to support Special Olympics Ireland during my term in the Seanad.  The Minister has also been very supportive.  He attended the very emotional opening of the national games in Limerick earlier this year.  Special Olympics Ireland was delighted to have the Minister there.  It has been my great honour to raise the work of Special Olympics in the Seanad over the last few years.  This organisation is truly special.  We could continue this debate all night.  I arranged for a debate in the House on the work of Special Olympics Ireland previously.  Over 3,000 volunteers travelled to the national games in Limerick last June.  That is a testament to the athletes and the organisation.  The thousands of hours each year that volunteers provide to run this organisation is incredible.  Without volunteers events such as the very successful national games last summer would not be possible.</p><p>Events are organised throughout the year.  The next one is the Special Olympics Polar Plunge which takes place every year at the Forty Foot.  This will be the fourth one in which I will participate.  Polar plunges are taking place in different outlets throughout the country and I encourage my colleagues to take the plunge and, as they say, get freezing for the reason of supporting Special Olympics Ireland.  This evening I sent all Members an e-mail with the details.  I would appreciate any support for the Special Olympics through their participation or by spreading the word about it.</p><p>I also had the great pleasure to work closely with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and Special Olympics Ireland earlier this year to see the new Special Olympics Ireland headquarters relocated at the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown alongside the FAI, Irish Sport HQ, the Irish Institute of Sport and our finest sporting facilities.  This announcement represents a mark of equality in Irish sport overall.  I have repeatedly called on my colleagues in the Government to view Special Olympics and the area of disability as a whole, not just as a HSE or Department of Health area in the disability sector, but to have a cross-departmental focus.  I was delighted that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, allocated &euro;5 million for the new headquarters and that the many years of hard work by the Special Olympics organisation and those associated with it have been recognised.</p><p>I agree that we must continue to support our local sports clubs and organisations into the future and foster this invaluable resource in our communities.  I am probably over time, but I will conclude by mentioning my local club, Dundalk FC, which won the league for the tenth time this season after a very barren period.  We talk generally about the value of sport and how it includes people.  I wish to recount a story about somebody who is very close to me and who lives for Dundalk FC and every match.  He cannot read but can tell one exactly when Dundalk FC is playing, who is playing and what the team is.  I do not know how he does it.  This year, however, Dundalk FC also won the EA Sports Cup final and at the end of the match one of the players, who would not be much older than the chap I mentioned, ran down from the podium with his winners medal, the first medal he had ever won, and put it around my friend's neck.  He said: &quot;That is for you, buddy, because you are with us all the way.&quot;  One can talk about sport, sportsmanship and winning, but I will never forget that.  I am even getting goose pimples thinking about it now.  It was one of the proudest moments of my life, that somebody would stop and think of the little people and their supporters.  Win, lose or draw, that is the real meaning of sport.</p></speech>

As others have said, it is a Ministry for which he is very well suited and for which he has huge passion, energy and enthusiasm.  He gets this portfolio and is doing a great job.  Perhaps I am biased but I think we would all agree on that.  The Government has shown a great commitment to investment in sport even under the severe financial constraints we were under during the past number of years.  It is fair to say that the investment has seen a return, be it in the form of sports capital grants, as have been mentioned by many Senators, or efforts to attract international events and tournaments.  It is fair to say that Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government have a great track record.  As other Senators have mentioned, we seem to really punch above our weight in the area of sport, which is a very fitting pun considering Katie Taylor's success yesterday, not to mention golf, rugby and the GAA.</p><p>If we look to our work in attracting international events, we see an unparalleled track record of success to date with American football games becoming a regular fixture, the UEFA Europa League final, the upcoming games we will host during the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, the Volvo Ocean Race, golfing tournaments and our bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  I was delighted with the success of the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship bid in particular, which will see four matches being played in Ireland, and will see a benefit of somewhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million coming to Dublin and, hopefully, the entire country.  Small and savvy investments in these bidding processes have proven to be an absolutely worthwhile investment &ndash; coming at a small percentage of the &euro;6 million in consultancy fees that were spent on the ill-fated &quot;Bertie Bowl&quot; some years ago.  </p><p>We can have no doubt that sport is important to this Government.  On the investment side, we have managed to continue the sports capital grant process regularly throughout this term with our third round of sports capital grants now coming up in a few months time.  The Minister of State puts a significant amount of work into this.  </p><p>With &euro;31 million allocated in 2012 and &euro;40 million allocated in 2014, we have seen a great investment in grassroots participation in sport up and down the country.  I believe that this is something which is paying off huge dividends in terms of the development of a number of sports at grassroots level.  As such, I am glad to see further sports capital funding coming down the tracks in 2015. </p><p>Some will try to raise the issue of so-called cronyism when it comes to these grants, as no doubt the Opposition will attempt to do, but then it must consider the case of Dublin North West.  This is the only constituency in the country where Fine Gael had no parliamentary party member for the last two rounds of sports grants funding yet it received in excess of &euro;2 million and had a number of successful bids.  These sports capital grants are distributed on merit.</p><p>This motion also includes the important provision of saluting the volunteers.  Senator Kelly and other Senators mentioned the work of those who organise sporting activities across the country in a huge variety of different sports, which can be thankless in so many organisations.  I believe that this is only right and proper.  If these people charged for what they do, the reality is that our sports capital grants would have to be possibly 20 times the size of what they are now.  It is only thanks to the dedication, commitment and passion of individual volunteers that sports clubs in this country - whether they are in rowing, boxing, GAA or any number of other things &ndash; are kept going.</p><p>The next issue might be a bit off the beaten track but given that it is an issue I raise regularly, I believe it is important to raise it here.  Sport and physical activity are potentially the most effective tools we have in the fight against childhood obesity.  One in four Irish children are now overweight or obese according to research and this is a problem which is not going away anytime soon.  We need to use the tools of policy creation at our disposal to encourage sport wherever possible and this is not helped when one sees the statistics.  Last year the EU information network found that Irish primary schools offered less physical education hours than any other EU member state.  On top of this, many schools have banned running in the yard at break time, which is further curtailing children's opportunity to exercise.  While I understand individual school management authorities must have a safety statement in place in their schools, there are no general directives to ban running in the school yard yet it seems to be happening in an increasing number of schools.  Indeed, according to the National Parents Council, many parents, while understanding safety and insurance concerns, feel that banning running in the school yard should be the last possible resort.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on that or whether it is on his radar.  The idea of staggering break times should be considered as an alternative &ndash; with less congestion on playgrounds and, therefore, less likelihood of accidents.  Indeed, it could even be an opportunity to have more &quot;formalised&quot; lunch time activities with more of an exercise element to them.</p><p>Ultimately, I am very happy to contribute on this topic and I am glad to see this motion tabled.  I believe it is something that is worthy of our thoughts and that it is a field in which the Government has achieved greatly in so far.  We have invested in sport, we have invested cleverly and now we need to use sport to ensure we meet the public health challenges in the future.  Senator Kelly mentioned Mayo and certain people playing for Mayo.  I am getting confused as to whether he is representing Mayo or Roscommon.  He mentioned the Pakistani player who has now started to play for Mayo.  Perhaps we need an influx of international players down in Mayo.  Something of an extension of the gene pool might not do any harm because it might take us out of the bind in which we find ourselves where we do not reach the success we have sought for so many years down in Mayo.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I certainly welcome the motion which is, obviously, fully supported by everybody.  Any time the Minister of State comes before us to speak on sporting matters, I appreciate that he has a broad range of knowledge across the entire sporting sector.  In particular, I know that one of his first loves is the game of soccer.  In that regard, I feel obliged to use this particular motion to comment on the events arising from the YouTube video of the chief executive of the FAI.  It is over 40 years since I watched as a very young man a game on television in Dalymount Park between Brazil and an all-Ireland soccer team which for political reasons was called the Shamrock Rovers XI.  I was too young to be at the game but the Minister of State was probably there when the Brazilian soccer team, who were world champions in their prime, beat the all-island Irish team by four goals to three.  It was a magnificent footballing, sporting and indeed political occasion.  I think back as a Spurs fan to the Pat Jennings, Joe Kinnears, Pat Rices and Martin O'Neills.  These were world-class footballers playing for an all-island team.  We could all be very proud of that particular structure.  About 12 months ago, the Taoiseach expressed his view that it would be beneficial for soccer, sport, reconciliation and politics on this island if we could once again have an all-island soccer team.  I support this view and I presume the Minister of State would also support it.  How strong such a group of players would be at the World Cup and the European Football Championships.  That concept of Ireland playing together is one we must encourage.</p><p>This is why I am genuinely concerned, disappointed and upset at the song the chief executive of the FAI chose to sing.  It is, of course, correct to say that it was an unguarded moment.  It was a YouTube video.  It was not a planned choral performance but every story tells a tale.  I ask myself what sort of story was presented to the majority community in Northern Ireland.  </p> <p>What sort of presentation does it make to the people involved in soccer in Northern Ireland who, generally speaking - I am making a broad spectrum statement - come from a different divide and would have a different political background?  I ask my colleagues what would be our reaction if senior executives of the IFA in Northern Ireland were singing loyalist songs or songs remembering or honouring the Shankill butchers or the soldiers who killed so many people in Derry on Bloody Sunday?</p></speech>

However, the Minister of State, as the person responsible for sport, through his Department invests very significant funding in Irish soccer, and long may that continue.  He should make his strong displeasure known because I believe we need to have a message of reconciliation from all the sporting bodies on this island.  Soccer, the greatest game in the world from a participation perspective and a hugely popular game on both sides of the Border, has a major role to play in the reconciliation of this island.  We have the odd dispute about whether players will declare for the North or the South, but our aspiration should be, as with our rugby players, that they will declare for an all-island Ireland team.  Let us not worry about flags, anthems or emblems - I am sure we can come up with another song, if necessary.  However, we should aspire to having a Thirty-two County Irish soccer team which is all-island rather than all-Ireland.</p><p>I believe the activity during the week was not helpful in that regard.  The Minister of State cannot account for John Delaney and he can account only for his own Department, his own views and the views of the Government.  Nonetheless, on the record and in this House, the Minister of State should make his views known, as well as, hopefully, his concerns and his disappointment.  I have never met John Delaney; I just know of him and I have read some of his interviews since the incident was made known.  He is entitled to his politics, he is entitled to his ancestry and he is entitled to be proud of what his grandfather did or did not do.  However, he also has a duty as chief executive of the FAI to be extremely sensitive in regard to matters pertaining to Irish politics and, in particular, matters relating to the awful conflict which killed thousands of people on this island.  I would ask the Minister of State, if he could, to comment on that issue.</p></speech>

I know the Cathaoirleach is attempting to be helpful and I will try to kill two birds with the one stone.  The other issue I would like the Minister of State to take up with Mr. Delaney and the FAI, and to be as robust as possible on, is the shocking state of League of Ireland football.  I remember a time in the 1970s when 25,000 people were attending League of Ireland football games in Cork city, when 10,000 or 15,000 were regularly attending derby games in Cork city and, I am sure, when there were huge crowds at Dundalk, Athlone, Dalymount Park and all over the country.  We need to put in place a significant restructuring plan for soccer on this island.  While the Minister of State is not behind the door when it comes to funding Irish soccer, I ask him to ensure that a significant proportion of the funding is put into a planned redevelopment, regeneration and rebuilding of the League of Ireland.  We look for the grandfather clause and the great-grandfather clause to pick up players left, right and centre in England when we would have brilliant soccer players in our towns and villages if the structures were put in place to develop them.  That is a project which I hope the Minister of State, as a committed Minister and committed soccer fan, will take on board.</p></speech>

Senator Bradford makes some valid points.  I believe the incident on YouTube was most unfortunate and I am sure it is something Mr. Delaney greatly regrets.  It certainly has not done any favours to the soccer community.</p><p>We are here to recognise the critical role sport plays in our society and to appreciate its significant health benefits.  In welcoming the Minister of State, I want to acknowledge the contribution he has made to ensuring that, even in very difficult times, the budget for sporting activities and recreational facilities throughout our country has been safeguarded and fought hard for.  Knowing his commitment to sport at all levels and in all codes, we need to acknowledge the fine work he is doing as Minister of State with responsibility for sport.</p><p>Hopefully, we will see two further sports capital programmes in the lifetime of this Government.  In addition to providing the facilities that are badly needed throughout our communities, there are other elements to this.  It gives a real economic boost to small communities when facilities are supported by Government and it gives encouragement to those communities to drive on, to fundraise and to ensure the best possible facilities are made available.  If that encouragement from Government were not available, these developments would probably never happen in many communities.</p><p>We now have a situation throughout all our counties, including my own county where, bit by bit, each small community is getting facilities in place of which we can all be extremely proud.  It is right on a day like this that we would acknowledge our elite sportspeople, such as Katie Taylor, golfers like P&aacute;draig Harrington, Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, and all of those people who have really put our country on the map.  However, sport is about more than that.  It is about all of the young people who will never compete on the world stage or compete for their county but who go out and exercise and participate, and are proud of the levels they achieve.  It is about the people involved in the Special Olympics and all of the new Irish communities who are living among us and getting involved in playing soccer and GAA, and really adding to the sense of pride and involvement.</p><p>It is critical, when we talk about health and the fight against obesity, that we would encourage every young person to get involved in sport and exercise at some level.  Previous speakers have referred to the fact there is not enough emphasis in the primary schools on exercise and setting aside time for physical education.  The local clubs - the soccer clubs, GAA clubs and rugby clubs - are playing a major part in helping in that fight against obesity.</p><p>With regard to the volunteers who come out in all weathers at their own expense to give generously of their time, we cannot say enough to acknowledge the contribution they make to life in our communities and the time they give back.  We particularly have to acknowledge all of the well-known sports stars, of all codes, who give time to their clubs and their local communities when they have finished playing themselves.</p><p>My own county of Galway has been prominent, particularly in the GAA code.  I know we have been through a fairly lean time recently but we think back to the wonderful players of the 1960s and the three-in-a-row team that brought such distinction, as well as the great hurling team of 1980 that broke the duck after 57 years by winning an all-Ireland hurling title.</p> <p>People like the great rugby player Ciaran Fitzgerald and Noel Mannion who is from my town, Ballinasloe, and ran the length of Cardiff Arms Park to score a great try for Ireland all those years ago are involved in helping and coaching young people in Ballinasloe.</p><p>We appreciate the work the Minister of State has done and the investment he has helped communities to make to enhance and improve sports facilities.  We hope he will receive a very generous allocation in the forthcoming budget to ensure some of the projects which narrowly missed out on the last occasion - he knows about them as I have spoken to him about them - will receive some assistance to finish some of their fine work.  In a sports mad country we are proud of our achievements.  We acknowledge the wonderful international sports stars who have put the country on the map, but we also encourage and support those who compete at the lowest level in all clubs.  I again acknowledge the fantastic people who help them to be the very best they possibly can be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600038#NN00200"><p>I thank Senator Terry Brennan for tabling the motion which gives us all an opportunity to discuss the value and contribution of sport, not only to Irish society but also the economy generally and everyone who participates in or likes to watch sport.  Reference has been made to Katie Taylor's victory this week and many other events.  </p><p>The value of sport to the economy has been well documented.  The 2010 Indecon report showed that for every euro the Government invested in sport, the value to the economy was almost one and half times that amount.  It showed that the net contribution to the Exchequer was over &euro;300 million when there was an investment of just over &euro;618 million in 2008.  The figures will stand still this year, whatever amount is spent by the Government, but it is clear that there is a return on the investment made.  I understand from the Indecon report that the contribution to the economy by sport is about &euro;1.8 billion.  The report is very good because it analyses the household spend on sport - &euro;1.885 billion - and the breakdown of that figure in terms of sports clothing, sports-related publications, donations and so on.  It is useful and helpful in underlining that the money spent by the Minister of State and his Department on sport results in a net contribution to the economy generally.  From an economic point of view, it is a worthwhile investment.</p><p>The contribution to facilities through the sports capital programme has been mentioned.  I welcome the reopening of the programme.  It was the right thing to do and is benefiting areas across the country.  </p><p>The wider issue of the betting tax, how it was used and the money made available was also discussed by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the Seanad.  Some &euro;60 million was made available to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  Not all of that money comes from the betting tax; some of it is taxpayers' money.  This year, for example, about &euro;54 million was made available, a figure which will increase next year.  Approximately 50% of it came from the taxpayer and 50% from the betting tax, which will increase from 1% to 2% and result in a benefit.  While I support the funding of HRI and Bord Na gCon, when a punter places a bet online or off-line on a football match, Eamonn Coghlan running years ago or another event such as the Katie Taylor fight, the tax gathered goes straight into the horse racing or greyhound racing fund and that is not right.  A percentage of the money should be made available for sport, given to the Irish Sports Council and used to improve participation and activity levels across the board.  Sport does not just mean competing at a world level or with an inter county team.  Benefits can be derived for physical well-being and mental health.  </p><p>We have to examine participation rates.  The Irish Sports Council, through Mr. John Treacy, is the way to do this.  It has the network through the sports partnerships.  The Minister of State needs to make the case that a percentage of the money gathered from the betting tax should be ring-fenced in the Department and used to help children to become involved in some way in sport.  This would help to cut down the rate of obesity, which is endemic across Ireland.  Trinity College Dublin carried out a survey in Tallaght which found the lack of sports activities in schools was having an impact on obesity levels.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan did some excellent work in this regard.  There is a need to include sport in the junior and leaving certificate curriculums.  Unless this happens, there will not be a buy-in at primary school level.  Often teachers, because they feel they are not competent, even though they may be, do not want to buy in to engaging in physical activity at primary level.  This is an issue we have to examine as a country. </p><p>Sports drinks represent a massive multi-billion euro industry worldwide and a multi-million euro industry in Ireland.  It would better to drink water, even though we will be paying for it shortly, than Lucozade, Gatorade and other drinks.  It would also be cheaper.  As someone who participates in sport and has a background in nutrition, I know such drinks are very dangerous, as they are very high in sugar and salt and corrosive on teeth.  People believe they are beneficial, but a 500 ml bottle of Gatorade or Lucozade Sport contains about 52g of sugar.  A young or other person involved in amateur sport who does a three or four mile run and then drinks such a drink will find that the calories he or she burned during the physical activity were lower than those in the bottle.  The Minister of State should challenge the industry that is making millions of euro in selling these drinks.  Coca Cola, Mars and other multinational companies are behind such products.  They have slick marketing campaigns and need to be taken on, as young people are being exploited.</p><p>Another issue involves the protein shake and drink industry.  These products have harmful effects on people's health such as those with heart defects.  The Minister of State should also take on this industry.  The public would welcome it, as they would reduce unnecessary expenditure on drinks which are full of sugar and salt and have no benefits.  One would be far better off mixing water with a little salt and diluted orange, as one would have a far better sports drink than those which cost &euro;3 or &euro;4 in a shop.  I ask the Minister of State to take on the drinks industry and to go after some of the money in the pot raised from the betting tax.  It should be used to fund participative, rather than elite, sport.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, to the House.  It is always a great occasion when he comes to this Chamber as he is always so positive.  We are a sports mad nation.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is a Member I regularly meet in the fitness room and in regard to sport and healthy living, he practices what he preaches.  I agree with him that dealing with the industry is challenging.  We should take a partnership approach.  In fairness to him, the Minister of State has succeeded in bringing a number of sports capital grant programmes over the line, in spite of the terrible economic conditions at the time.  The Minister of State ensured there was equity and fairness across the board, that small clubs that were doing extraordinary work were recognised.  He also ensured the equitable distribution of grants across counties.  In addition, he made sure that once a programme qualified, a percentage went to each county.  I sincerely hope that he may have some additional money to invest in the programme for the new year and that it will be equally successful.</p><p>Oireachtas Members talk all the time about equality.  Sport creates equality.  Regardless of people's background, once they have a talent for running or football, they will get on a team and play.  What better way to create a society of equals than through sport?  We have a programme for elite athletes and we are all very proud of them.  We have Paralympics athletes and Special Olympics athletes of whom we are very proud.  I have spoken to the Minister of State previously about people with disabilities who are not elite athletes but have a right to participate in sport, the same as any other citizen</p></speech>

I should commend Senator Brennan for tabling this positive motion.  We have negative politics and we have seen what has happened with the water issue in the past number of weeks.  I espouse positive politics and sport is another great way of creating positive politics.  I would like to see a requirement that the clubs that get sports capital grants in the next round should ensure their facilities are accessible for people with physical disabilities.  If the infrastructure of the clubs does not meet the accessible standard that at least their coaches sign up for accessibility training and there is an honest effort to include people with physical disabilities in the community from towns and villages in the club activities.  I would like to see a programme that creates equality among people and as I have said already, sport is a great way of achieving that.  We have an opportunity to ensure that everybody who wishes to participate in sport and live a healthy life has an opportunity to do so.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that sport is the common denominator that brings everybody together.  All the Members spoke positively about sport.  I will try to answer some of the queries that were raised, but if I do not cover them all, I will return at some other stage.  Some very good points were made.  A reference was made to the betting tax and that was the reason for establishing the national lottery.  We thought the proceeds from the lotto would go to sport, but it now goes into central government.  My Department, like every other Department, must fight for its share of the money.  The sport with the highest level of betting is soccer.  The Senator is quite correct that the betting tax is going into the racing industry.  Senator Bradford and I clashed over this issue many years ago.  There should be equality.  I think if funding is going into horseracing, it should go into every other sport as well.</p></speech>

It is a long time since we had a debate on sport and I think more regular debates on sport is positive.  I will begin by addressing the twin issues of the role of sport in Ireland and the contribution made by volunteers.</p><p>As the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I am committed to increasing and developing participation and an interest in sport improving standards of performance and developing sports facilities.  All of this contributes to a healthier society and an improved overall quality of life.  I strongly believe that sport has the potential to enrich the lives of all people and we should all recognise the benefits that can be gained from being active.</p><p>This year, the sports and recreation services programme allocation increased by 28% on the allocation for 2013.  This is mainly as a result of the additional funding of &euro;11.5 million voted under the Government's stimulus programme for the sports capital programme and the allocation of &euro;13 million towards the development of the national indoor arena at the National Sports Campus in Dublin.  This is a very significant investment in Irish sport and is a strong indication of our commitment.</p><p>The Irish Sports Council will receive funding from my Department of &euro;42.5 million.  The focus of this spending is on increasing participating in sport and physical activity.  This is one of the key objectives of my Department.  I am very aware of the efforts that are being made by the governing bodies of sport in encouraging greater participation in sport.  I will continue to work with the Irish Sports Council and the new body, Sports Ireland, following the merger of the council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority to ensure that there are greater sporting opportunities for young people in the future. </p><p>The health and social benefits of sport are widely recognised.  One of the most urgent health issues in Ireland is obesity.  Research shows that 38% of Irish people are overweight and 23% are obese.  A worrying aspect is that one in four Irish children are carrying excess weight.  It is clear an increase in the participation in sport and physical activity added to diet control would greatly benefit the overall health of the country and would lower the costs to the health sector.  A healthier population would help to reduce public spending in the future.</p><p>The estimated economic cost of obesity is &euro;1.13 billion per year.  With that in mind, Healthy Ireland, a new government framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of people and to reduce the risks posed to future generations, was launched last year.  It is a whole-of-government approach and the involvement of local communities, as well as all of society is required.  One of the commitment of the Healthy Ireland framework is the development of a national physical activity plan and my Department is co-chairing a cross-sectoral working group with the Department of Health to develop this plan.  This is an example of the improved co-ordination and partnership between Departments and agencies in the area of sport and physical activity over the past number of years.  It recognises the cross-cutting nature of the sport sector in areas such as health and education.  We need to continue with this approach.  It is expected that a draft national physical activity plan will be circulated for consultation shortly with key stakeholders.</p><p>We are very luck to have a host of very talented and highly skilled sportsmen and women who are wonderful role models for our young people.  Last year was an exceptional year for high performance sport in Ireland with a record 67 medals achieved at world and European events.  To date this year, 54 medals have been achieved.  I hope the success of our sports people will inspire and encourage the younger generation to participate in sport and gain from the many benefits that sport can bring.</p><p>I am very encouraged by the latest data which show an increase in the number of people participating in sport.  Figures from the Irish Sports Monitor Report for 2013 show that participation has increased from 44.8% in 2011 to 47.2% in 2013.</p> <p>The value of participating in sport and physical activity cannot be underestimated.  Every small improvement in participation levels means better health, social and economic benefits for individuals, and for society as a whole.</p><p>As well as measuring participation in sport, the Irish Sports Monitor examines social participation in sport through volunteering, club membership and attendance at sporting events.  The 2013 report estimates that the economic value of volunteering could be over &euro;1 billion a year.  This highlights the importance of its contribution to Irish society.  Sport in Ireland would not exist without the 500,000 people who volunteer throughout the country every year.</p></speech>

Volunteers play a major role in maintaining the high level of sporting activity in Ireland, with all the associated health and social benefits, and contribute significantly to the development of elite sport in Ireland, which has done so much to enhance the international reputation of Irish sport.  Athletes in every sport can only reach their potential because of the support, encouragement and inspiration they receive from the volunteers in their clubs.  Last week I was delighted to present the National Volunteers in Sport Awards to ten people who have made outstanding voluntary contributions to sport in Ireland.  The awards celebrate the contribution of volunteers to Irish sport and have gone from strength to strength since they were first introduced in 2007, with a record number of nominations this year.</p><p>I now turn to the issue of attracting international sporting events to Ireland.  The programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland.  The hosting of major sporting events, including both sports participation and spectator sports, can provide a great showcase for Ireland and drive international visitor numbers, and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  Accordingly, the Government is supportive of the ongoing efforts of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject to an assessment of the costs and benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors.</p><p>Other important sporting events take place each year, for example, the GAA All-Ireland series, the Six Nations rugby and the Irish Open.  Where appropriate, the tourism bodies work with these and other sporting bodies to maximise the tourism benefit of events.  For example, the Irish Open has received significant support from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Giro D'ltalia and the American football match between the University of Central Florida and Penn State earlier this year are further evidence that the island of Ireland can successfully host large international events.  I was delighted to see that the FAI and Dublin City Council recently succeeded in their bid to host part of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament at the Aviva Stadium, a bid which had the strong support of the Government.  This is a fantastic opportunity to host a premier international tournament.  I am also delighted that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Golf Club is set to host the 39th Curtis Cup match in 2016, highlighting the excellence of the golfing facilities available in Ireland.</p><p>Senators will be aware that last November the Government considered a memorandum on the discussions and analysis to date on a potential bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  While the memorandum identified a number of challenges, the great potential of the event is also clear.  Hosting the Rugby World Cup on a cross-Border basis in 2023 would be a great opportunity for Northern Ireland and Ireland.  In response to the memorandum, the Government expressed strong support for the proposal and for further work to get to the stage of making a formal decision to bid.  In order to progress the matter further, we met with Arlene Foster and Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, the Ministers responsible for tourism and sport, respectively, in the Northern Ireland Executive, in Armagh on 22 January.  We agreed to establish a working group to examine some key issues further and to report back to Ministers in the summer.  The working group, chaired by Hugo MacNeill, and comprising the IRFU and relevant Government Departments from both jurisdictions, has submitted its report and its conclusions and recommendations are currently being considered.</p><p>All Members of this House are familiar with the sports capital programme, SCP.  It provides much-needed funding to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  More than 9,100 projects have benefitted from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;825 million.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  The facilities that have been funded range from small clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.  In 2012 we were pleased to make allocations totalling &euro;31 million under the 2012 round of the SCP, the first round of the programme since 2008.  The absence of an SCP between 2008 and 2012 meant that there was a huge level of demand for grants.  Consequently, we had a record number of applications in 2012 with a total of 2,170 applications.  We were delighted to be able to make changes to the programme in 2012 to make it accessible to more clubs and organisations than ever before.  These changes also contributed to the record number of applications in 2012.  We were pleased to announce a total of &euro;40.5 million earlier this year under the 2014 round of the SCP.  A total of 2,036 applications were received under the 2014 programme, the second highest number ever received.  In total, 821 of the successful allocations were to local sports clubs and organisations, with the remaining 59 allocated to regional or national projects.    </p><p>Senators will appreciate that with such high levels of demand for grants, it will never be possible to fund all applications.  Such high demand highlights the importance of the SCP.  Unfortunately, our resources can only go some of the way to meeting such a high level of demand, and we fully understand that it leaves some grantees disappointed at not receiving funding.  This continuing high level of demand for sports capital grants shows how important facilities are in providing people, both young and not so young, with more opportunities to participate in sport.  It also shows how important the SCP is in helping organisations develop modern fit-for-purpose facilities.  If we are to encourage people to participate in healthy sporting activity, it is only right that we do the best we can to assist these people in having decent facilities.  Indeed, one of the key features of the SCP is that it helps to take some of the pressure off the shoulders of sporting organisations, and the volunteers involved in those organisations, by providing much needed finance to assist in the completion of projects.  This is a concrete and real recognition of the role played by these organisations and by the volunteers involved.  It is one way of saying &quot;thank you&quot; to those people for the all the excellent work they do, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, year in and year out.</p><p>I am determined that as a society, and as a Government, we continue to demonstrate our support for the Irish sporting family, and for the countless volunteers who do a remarkable job for Irish sport and for the young people of Ireland, and we will continue to invest in facilities to help those volunteers in their excellent work.  We are a sports-mad nation, and we rightly reserve a special place in our hearts for those who excel at the highest level.  They inspire us all, they fill us with national pride, and they serve as great role models for young people.  Elite performance is one side of the coin.  The other side involves hundreds of thousands of people who will never be elite performers in their chosen sport, but who love sport, and who participate for the sheer fun involved.  Anybody who travels throughout their county at the weekend cannot help being amazed at the number of sporting events taking place at any given time.  We must continue to support those people and their activities, and that's what the SCP is all about.</p><p>In this regard, I am delighted that we were successful in receiving enough money for 2015 to launch another round of the SCP next year. </p></speech>

In reply to Senator Moran, she is quite correct that we have many sporting organisations and a high level of participation, particularly in the Special Olympics and the Paralympics.  I had the honour and pleasure of being in Greece for the Special Olympics and stood under the Irish flag.  It was the happiest day I have experienced in sport, and I never enjoyed anything like it.  Being the true sportspeople that they are, the athletes gave it 100%.  Many other Senators made contributions today and I would like to come back to the House on another occasion to go through them.  I would particularly like to thank those who were so kind in their comments.<br/>On the issue of the sports capital programme, there is one thing I would like to put on the record loud and clear.  The allocation of funding on a <i>pro rata</i>basis, a practice I introduced, has worked and I think it will become the norm for the future.  I do not think any other Minister will be able to go back again to the bad old days.  In some cases, and probably in rural Ireland, there has been disadvantage.  Dublin has been lucky.  Every valid sporting organisation in Dublin that made an application for the sports capital programme actually got funding.  We had bigger problems in rural Ireland because we had a very large number of applications but we did not have the resources and money to be able to deal with all these projects.  <br/>I have to take this opportunity to congratulate Katie Taylor.  She is a brilliant role model who will be in Irish sporting history for the rest of her life.  She is such an example to sportspeople in the way she behaves, carries herself and performs.</p></speech>

I cannot congratulate her enough.  That is why, in my first year in office as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I looked to see who had gained the most from the sports capital programme.  Was it the GAA, soccer, rugby or athletics?  I looked at the minority sports to see what I could do for them.  For boxing, I introduced a situation where, for grants of up to &euro;25,000, a short-term lease would do and the club did not have to own the property.  I did that because boxing clubs, by nature, do not have the facilities of other clubs.  Over the last three years I introduced a scheme and gave the Irish Amateur Boxing Association &euro;1.2 million in the first year, &euro;1 million in the second year and almost &euro;1 million again last year.  I let them administer that all over the country to make sure that basic facilities would be put in place for clubs for the boys, and particularly the girls, who are taking up boxing.  I am delighted that I did that.</p></speech>

I had a special scheme to set up a number of regional athletics tracks and I am delighted that they are all completed now.  That is why the numbers are up this year.  There is an increase of, I think, about 80% in the number of people joining athletics clubs, because we put the facilities in place.  I am delighted to do that.  We had the special allocation this year for P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, and last week we also had the special allocation for soccer clubs in the regions.  I will stand over that allocation.  The FAI came forward and met and selected the applicants.  I was disappointed that the Dublin media do not seem to want facilities any place else but in Dublin.  I want them in Dublin but I want them in the rest of the country as well.  The rest of the country is as entitled to have the facilities as Dublin is.</p></speech>

One of them I will not get into, but as regards the League of Ireland - I know he is passionate about this - I want to congratulate Senator Moran and Dundalk on winning the league this year.</p></speech>

They waited nearly 70 years and lost seven or nine cup finals - the hoodoo was on them in the final.  I was so happy they won the final this year because that is one hoodoo lifted.  There is one more to be lifted so that the Sam Maguire can come back to Mayo, and we hope that will be this year.</p><p>In relation to the very serious issue that was raised, I would love to see an all-Ireland soccer team.  We have an all-Ireland rugby team and a lot of all-Ireland sporting teams.  It would be great for that to happen and, although it is not under my control, it is something that should be looked at.  We are a small nation and sport is so important to us.  On the issue of the chief executive of the FAI, he did apologise, and rightly so.  His song was very unwise, and all I would say is that the funding that I have to worry about goes to grassroots boards.  The FAI does a lot of very good work here in Dublin - for example, the midnight leagues - that benefits every section of society, and the funding that I allocated has been spent very well.</p></speech>

I am delighted that the last time Mayo carried a cup across the Shannon, my grand-uncle, Paddy Moclair, was on the team.  I hope we do not have to wait as long again.  I know people are tired and have put a long day in so I will be brief.  I ask the Minister to consider bringing together education and sport.  I am mindful of one shining example of this, and that is in Kinsale, County Cork, under the directorship of principal Fergal McCarthy and his staff.  There is no sport in Kinsale Community School that is not available to students.  If a student expresses an interest in tiddlywinks they will set up a tiddlywinks club for that student.  They have equestrian sport, golf, you name it, and on top of that they are constantly winning the Young Scientist competition.  If we are going to fund sport it would be nice to consider putting some small amount of money aside for which schools could directly apply, to go into the non-mainstream sporting areas.  GAA, soccer and rugby are well catered for in most schools, but the likes of a golf club would be less common.  I know of one DEIS school that has a golf club running in north Dublin.  The Minister could do a whole lot - his energy is known far and wide and he is doing a great job. No man can cover the country as fast as he can, and Mayo is well looked after while he is in the seat.  I ask him to consider that.  I was never much involved in sport myself.  I look over at Senator Coghlan and I only wish I could walk.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State stated, we have the third best rugby team in the world and will find out next year if it is the best.  We have the infrastructure and sports facilities, North and South, required to host the prestigious World Cup.</p><p>The Minister of State also mentioned our golfers, the opportunities offered by golf and what the sport does for the country.  Our golfers are sports ambassadors the length and breadth of the world.  There is great coverage of the international events held here.</p><p>I have not mentioned Katie Taylor until now.  It must be acknowledged by one and all that her achievement is incredible.  As somebody said, it equates to retaining the World Cup four times and it was all done in a period of ten years, as the championships are held every two years.  We wish her well in her attempt to repeat her feat and perhaps she will retain her world championship before repeating her feat in London in Rio in 2016.  </p><p>On the cross-Border appeal of hosing the Rugby World Cup, I agree wholeheartedly with what the Minister of State said.  Without question, if we had had George Best, Pat Jennings, Pat Rice and Danny Blanchflower and other colleagues, we would have won the World Cup in soccer.  We must try to emulate what these sportsmen did.  As the Berlin Wall has come down, nothing is impossible.  </p><p>I again congratulate the Minister of State.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-11-26a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014112600042#RR01100"><p>I thank the Minister for State for coming to the House to deal with this Adjournment matter which concerns the medication, Selincro Nalmefene, an innovative treatment which was found to be cost effective and the subject of a positive recommendation from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics on 8 April.</p> <p>It was announced today that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, the equivalent of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, had recommended the use of Selincro for people with an alcohol dependence.  This meant that the medicine would be available to patients within 90 days.  This treatment has been recommended and proved to have a positive effect.  We are awaiting a decision on its use.</p><p>The issue was raised that if we were to introduce the drug if there would be a need to provide for the availability of appropriate psycho-social supports.  The European Medicines Agency has recommended the provision of psycho-social supports focused on treatment compliance and alcohol reduction.  General practitioners are aware of this and conscious that such supports must be put in place if we are to introduce the drug which is not suitable for everyone.  I understand the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics has assessed the cost of introducing it at between &euro;6.7 million and &euro;12 million over a five year period.  It was announced in April that the decision should be seriously considered.  I ask for clarity as to when we are likely to see that decision being made.  Will it be made the end of the year or will it take longer?  It would be helpful for everyone involved in the area to know.</p><p>There has been a huge increase in alcohol consumption.  A report has revealed that in 2010 the average Irish consumer drank 11.9 litres of pure alcohol, equivalent to 482 pints of lager, 125 bottles of wine or 45 bottles of vodka.  This highlights the fact that if a person has a drink problem and there is a drug that can assist him or her in reducing his or her alcohol consumption, its use should be carefully considered.</p></speech>

Anything to do with alcohol consumption in an Irish context is very important.  </p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are not political or ministerial; rather, they are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 which requires consideration of a range of statutory criteria prior to reimbursing any medicine, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of nalmefene in the GMS and community drug schemes.  Nalmefene, or Selincro, to give it its brand name, is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adults with an alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level, without physical withdrawal symptoms, and who do not need immediate detoxification.  The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of nalmefene and its report was published in April.  It estimated that the investment required by the taxpayer to provide access to nalmefene would be between &euro;6.7 million and &euro;12 million in the next five years, as the Senator indicated.  The advice of the NCPE to the HSE also made it clear that the introduction of nalmefene required the availability of appropriate psycho-social supports.  The availability of these supports is being considered by the mental health, health and well-being and primary care divisions of the HSE.</p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  It is appropriate for the HSE, prior to committing scarce resources, to assess whether the required supports are in place and, if not, the resources required to put such supports in place to ensure appropriate use of this medicine.  While medications such as nalmefene can be used at the individual level to impact on alcohol consumption, at a wider societal level more must be done to reduce alcohol consumption and tackle alcohol misuse.  To address this issue, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, including the drafting of a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  It is hoped to publish a general scheme of the Bill shortly.</p><p>I will endeavour to find out for the Senator the status of the application in the process and when we are likely to have a decision on it.</p></speech>

We discussed with the Minister for Health earlier how the cost of medications in the ten year period 2000 to 2010 had increased from &euro;570 million to &euro;2 billion.  We need to be conscious of this, but there would be many advantages in introducing this drug.  I also accept that back-up support would be required.</p><p>I met some people who were dealing with this matter.  They have produced a document - BRIEFcases - which will be presented to general practitioners.  It sets out how they could assist people with this problem.  It is comprehensive and lists the supports available to GPs in dealing with someone with this problem.  It would be helpful if this medication was available.  It would not help everyone, but it might help some and could help to reduce the risk for those engaging in excessive alcohol consumption.  Anything that could be done in that regard would be helpful.  </p><p>I again thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply but what everyone is looking for is a time guideline in dealing with this matter.</p></speech>

It is not indicated in the answer, but this is one of the tools in the box in treating excessive alcohol consumption.  It is not, however, the total picture.</p></speech>

They see him or her on a regular basis and it is difficult to start the conversation.  However, this drug would simply be one of the tools in the box.  I will endeavour to find out for the Senator when it is hoped to have a decision on whether the drug should be made available and how it would be paid for.</p></speech>
