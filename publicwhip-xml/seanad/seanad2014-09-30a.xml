I have selected the matters raised by Senators Cullinane, O'Neill, Burke and Daly for discussion today and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I must rule the matter raised by Senator Mooney out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in that regard.</p></speech>

Many sufferers of MS cannot access the drug which could change their lives and give them back their mobility.  I do not take issue with the Leader but I am sick to the back teeth of writing to the Department of Health on the issue.  People are losing their mobility and independence.  The cost of the drug is &euro;270 a month.  Surely to God an urgent decision could be made on it.</p><p>I wish to follow up on what my colleague, Senator Byrne, said about the unprecedented events of the past week.

It is a degradation of the Seanad.  I say to the Leader that the Taoiseach and a Minister of his party has brought the Chamber and the democratic structures of the State into disrepute.  A nomination was made up in order to ensure the individual concerned could run in the by-election.  Others will say he may have been able to do that anyway.  We will never know that because another candidate, Mr. Craughwell, withdrew his complaint to the committee on the basis of the apparent qualification of Mr. McNulty due to his being a board member of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  That is what happened.  Now we have a ballot paper that states he is a board member of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  That is who some Members across the Chamber are being asked to vote for, when that is not the case.  I put it to the House that he is not qualified on that basis.</p></speech>

We deserve answers on the issue.  Let us be fair.  The Taoiseach belatedly apologised, but I do not know what he apologised for, because the previous day he said it was a matter for the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I would not have tabled the amendment if the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, had answered any questions when she came to the House last week, but as colleagues are aware, she did not.

This is the Bill that I, together with the Labour Party Senators, introduced as a Private Member's Bill on 13 March 2013 to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act to ensure one no longer has the potential to discriminate in schools against teachers because of their sexuality or marital status.  There is great support for the principle of this Bill from all sides of the House.  The Committee Stage debate began earlier this year, in April, and it is due to resume once Government amendments have been prepared.  I hope the Leader and I can work to ensure that Committee Stage will resume and that this Bill will pass through the House before the end of this session in December.</p><p>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the national dementia strategy.  I was glad to join with members of The Alzheimer Society of Ireland outside Leinster House earlier today and I commend them on their work.  In particular, they seek to highlight the need to ensure the proper roll-out of a national dementia strategy and I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue in early course.  Finally, I commend the Start Strong organisation on its event last Thursday that I attended and at which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, spoke.  I also wish to state how glad I am that she has made a commitment to making some change in the law to ensure better provision of parental leave and paternity leave in particular.  Senator White has been hugely active on this issue and has introduced Private Members' legislation in this regard and like the section 37 amendment, I hope there also can be cross-party support for this initiative.</p></speech>

Since last Wednesday, as all Members are aware and as they just have been reminded by Senator Darragh O'Brien, there has been an ongoing public controversy about the disrespect - the Senator used the word &quot;disrepute&quot; - paid both to the arts and to the Seanad in light of John McNulty's nomination to IMMA and the Seanad by-election.  By contrast, last Wednesday the Irish arts world had much cause for positive celebration outside this Chamber because Eavan Boland, one of Ireland's most eminent poets, turned 70.  This coincided with the publication of her new collection of poems entitled <i>A Woman Without a Country</i>.  Throughout the decades, her body of work has had a profound impact on the Irish psyche and soul as she charted new territory in search of a language not voiced before and in search of a nation not fully imagined and that depicted how woman's place outside history could be transformative as well as transformed.  I believe that by way of marking the 24th Seanad's commitment to the arts, as well as to women &quot;finding a voice where they found a vision&quot;, as in the great words of Eavan Boland often quoted by the former president, Mary Robinson, I ask the Leader to bring Eavan Boland's name to the Seanad committee that decides on inviting significant public figures to this Chamber to address Members.  I expect it would be a remarkable and inspiring exchange.<br/>My second question relates to another date on the calendar, namely, 4 October 2014, when Members will mark the first anniversary of the day on which the Irish people voted in referendum to retain the Seanad.  It is my belief, as well as that of countless citizens throughout Ireland, that the people did not vote to retain the Seanad in its current form but that they voted for real reform.  Consequently, I request that the Bill published by Senator Quinn and I on Seanad reform be brought to Committee Stage as soon as possible.  This would be a fitting way to mark the anniversary of the people's vote.  Senator Quinn and I also will table amendments to ensure the Bill is capable of delivering on a core set of fundamental reforms on which we believe all parties can agree.</p> <p>We will be seeking Government time for Committee Stage on the Seanad Bill.  This would be a prime way for the Taoiseach and the Government to demonstrate respect for the people, for the Seanad and for implementing the new politics that all sides of this House agree is needed.</p></speech>

We all remember the valuable work Lord Patten did in the reform of the RUC on this island.  Those agreements provided for democracy and a free press.  I ask the Leader to take up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, the issue that we might approach the Chinese authorities to say that we would prefer that what is going on in China should not happen and that its economic success should be paralleled by the development of democracy and a free press in Hong Kong and throughout China.</p></speech>

The Commission wrote to the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, on 12 June last and, apparently, we have not participated.  What was put to the media today from the Commission is a complaint that a request was made to us on 12 June, with, as it states, normally a month to reply, and it is now 13 weeks since then.  The Commission has put the document out, and we have to participate in this.  What it states is based on the above, that the Commission is of the opinion that the contested rulings do not comply with the arms-length principle and, accordingly, the Commission is of the opinion that through these rulings the Irish authorities confer an advantage on Apple and the advantage is obtained every year, and is ongoing, when the annual tax liability is agreed upon by the tax authorities in view of that ruling.  The Americans estimated last year that the tax avoided per day by Apple in 2012 was &euro;25 million, or &euro;9 billion a year.  We have been condemned for our policies on this in the United States and, only today, in the United Kingdom.  I do not know whether this was addressed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whether we have enough economic expertise but we should not be getting into this kind of relationship with the European Commission.  We should enter into this dialogue, defend - as we have stated here on so many occasions - the 12.5% corporate tax rate and get rid of the fiscal termites who keep on undermining that rate and bringing Ireland into public odium in the United States, in the European Union and in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

Many of these staff have over 20 years' service.  They are the face of the bank.  They are the staff who open and close the branches.  They are the ones who often meet and greet customers.  I have even seen them being helpful with clients trying to use the new quick-lodge system.  I worked in that institution once upon a time and, I hasten to add, that was long before the cowboys invaded the pitch.  It is disgraceful trying to removing these staff, who have been so loyal and steadfast to the institution, who have done nothing wrong as regards banking in this country.  We should make a protest, which I intend to do, to headquarters in regard to this matter.</p></speech>

Members will be aware of the sad case of Ms Dhara Kivlehan, who, after giving birth at Sligo Regional Hospital, died in a Belfast hospital.  At the inquest last evening, an independent expert obstetrician and former master of the Rotunda stated that it was effectively a systemic and clinical failure that led, in a complex case, to her death.</p> <p>This is a case that requires a serious review by the State in how it approaches maternity services in the future.  It is worth reminding Members of the report we exposed on this side of the House which planned to downgrade maternity services in the north west to the extent that an obstetrician would not be available but that it would be a midwife-led service.  Last night underpinned the need for expert obstetrician services to be available to all the women of Ireland regardless of where they live.</p><p>At this point, the Minister must make clear his intentions.  Clearly, significant investment and additional resources are required to be put into maternity services as Ireland has the lowest number of obstetricians per patient in the OECD.  With commitments under the working time directive and the temptation of higher remuneration abroad, it seems fewer obstetrician hours will be made available in Ireland.  We are facing a crisis in ensuring further cases such as that of Dhara Kivlehan can be averted.  I hope this debate will be held soon as it is merely a matter of time, sadly, that this will happen again.  Unless the appropriate resources and strategic plan are put in place, we cannot ensure this will not happen again.</p></speech>

It is one of our foremost advocacy groups and charities doing tremendous work for people who lead a challenging life when confined and bound to a wheelchair in assisting and supporting them in living full and independent lives.  It is hard in this day and age to believe, however, that we still provide funding for the construction of public buildings, spaces, such as car parks and parks, venues and stadiums, that are not adequately wheelchair accessible or friendly.</p><p>I thought we had brought to this to an end some years ago.  Only this week, the Irish Wheelchair Association, however, published the latest draft of its best practice guidelines for wheelchair access.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to attend the House at the earliest juncture to debate this issue to ensure these guidelines are embedded in the planning code and regulations?  This will not put any additional cost on anyone building privately.  However, when we build arts centres, post offices, schools, and sports stadiums, as well as simple facilities such as public toilets in car parks, we should not suffer upon people confined to wheelchairs the further indignity or embarrassment of not being able to access, use freely or enjoy facilities that the rest of us can.  It is a simple matter to resolve and one in which we can play a part.</p><p>There are also people who still park on kerbs on footpaths and clearly designated disabled parking zones which is a further affront to those confined to wheelchairs.  There is no fine too large for someone who parks improperly like that.</p></speech>

As he knows, we passed this Bill on Second Stage way back in March last year.  Since then, there was a referendum this week last year in which the people said they did not want to support the Government&rsquo;s move to abolish the Seanad.  Nothing has happened since then that we know of.  I know the Taoiseach said he has called together a few leaders of different groups to see what could be done.  This is 12 months after the referendum, however.</p><p>Members have often heard me argue before how frustrating it is to see the length of time it takes to get something done legislatively.  Senator Zappone has proposed the Leader finds time for Committee Stage of that Bill which she introduced here over a year ago.</p> <p>I urge the Leader to find time to do so because the people of Ireland have said they want to see a Seanad that works and that is capable of doing far more than it is being allowed to do at present.  That probably requires the changes that she has proposed in her Bill, which I was happy to second.  I believe we should make these changes and I urge the Leader to arrange time for Committee Stage of the Bill so that it can come before the House very shortly.</p></speech>

I do not know whether they are Irish but what I am about to say might inform them.  Are the Senators aware that the great Bank of Ireland is doubling the interest rate it charges graduate entries to medicine when they qualify?  That is financial thuggery at its best.  In other words, it is telling graduates who want to continue studying that they will get the loan at a certain interest rate but within three months of completing the course, the rate will be doubled.  I want the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education and Skills to come into the House to address this issue.  It is not only doubling the interest rate but it is also picking rates out of the sky.  According to the Medical Independent, graduate entry medical students are buried in a ditch of debt because of this.  Some 65% of all our young doctors have left the country not only to seek better conditions and better lives but also because they cannot repay these enormous loans.</p><p>Education is the right of everybody.  We have, of course, to pay for it, and that includes graduates, but to take the 4.5% interest rate for entrants to graduate medicine and then increase it to 6%, 7% or 9%, to be repaid over ten years, chokes the graduates of this country and beggars them before they even begin.  It is financial thuggery.  Bank of Ireland is back where it began.  When I pointed out to its representatives last week that it had received &euro;3.75 billion out of a universal social charge on all of our wages, they stared blankly at me but they are quite capable of running around America after builders who owe them the millions of euro that they gave out like nuts at a circus tent and of beggaring our graduate students.  This is extremely important because parents in this country do not have the money to send children to universities in their areas and thus have to send them to other cities.  They need to borrow money not for credit but for education.  I want the Minister for Education and Skills to outline how she intends to address this issue and I am looking for an amendment to the Order of Business on that account.  It is financial thuggery.  No Senator should vote against me on the Order of Business because the issue is above politics.</p></speech>

I agree that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht should come before the House today but in reality the Taoiseach should come before the House.  Last week the Taoiseach stated that he took personal responsibility for what has become a fiasco in regard to the Seanad by-election.  If the Taoiseach was taking personal responsibility, what was he taking personal responsibility for?  When one takes responsibility for something, it means one did something wrong.  The Taoiseach should come into this House to explain to us what he did wrong.  We all know what he did wrong but he should account for himself in this House.</p><p>We also, shamefully, had a situation where the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey, hired a former Fine Gael councillor and director of Irish Water as his personal driver on a salary of &euro;665 per week.  The same individual received a gratuity payment of &euro;57,757 when he lost his council seat and received an annual fee of &euro;15,000 for his position on Irish Water.  There is a clear conflict of interest where a director of Irish Water is employed by the Minister of State with responsibility for that body to be his driver.</p> <p>What was most disturbing was the response of the former councillor to questions from the media.  When he was asked if there was a salary attached he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is anyone working for free at the moment.&rdquo;  Many people on Gateway schemes throughout the State would disagree with him.  He also said:<blockquote><br />You tell me one party out there who doesn&rsquo;t look after their own.  I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with it.</blockquote>Would the Leader stand over those remarks?  Does he see anything wrong with it?  The most disgusting thing he said, which I invite the Leader to condemn, was: &quot;We were all nearly eating out of bins three years ago.&quot;  Very few Fine Gael supporters were eating out of bins three, ten or 30 years ago.  There are many people, however, who, while they may not be eating out of bins, are in poverty and cannot afford to pay their bills.  On this day of all days for us to discuss the issue, the Leader and his party want to impose water charges and some families will have to pay up to &euro;500 once metering begins.  I ask the Leader to comment on all these issues and I will support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

While I respect the Cathaoirleach's decision, I want to tell RTE I am not letting go of the matter.  As a news broadcaster, RTE monitors everything that goes on in the House.  I intend to raise it at tomorrow morning's meeting of the Committee on Transport and Communications and I will request the support of my colleagues, which I believe will be forthcoming, in inviting RTE to come before the committee to explain its terrible decision to terminate the 252 long wave transmission.  RTE tried this some years ago but was stopped in its tracks.  Now RTE has got it in under the radar and the Minister is acquiescing in it by refusing to come into the House to give his response to this outrageous decision that will have a very adverse effect on the Irish diaspora in Britain.<br/>It is unacceptable to state that only a small percentage of people are listening.  How does RTE know?  RTE says people have other platforms, but many people, Irish and otherwise, listen in their cars, travelling throughout England.  I have received an extraordinary level of reaction to the decision from colleagues, friends and other representatives of the Irish community in Britain.  I will not let go of it.  RTE cannot and should not be allowed to do this.  As a public service broadcaster it has a responsibility to look after the Irish diaspora as much as the people on the island of Ireland.<br/>I echo Senator Barrett's comments that a very poor image of Ireland has been transmitted as a result of the European Commission's release of its letter on corporation tax and the way it is levied on multinational companies in Ireland.  I am particularly concerned about the impact this is having on Irish America and corporate America.  I remind the House that in May last year, <i>thejournal.ie</i>reported the comments by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain, who raised this in the US Senate and from whom it is alleged that all this came, that Apple negotiated a 2% rate in Ireland, far less than the State's 12.5% rate for companies.  What was significant about the letter from the Commission was that the man who was responsible for the tax affairs of Apple in 1991 in his negotiations with the Irish Revenue said the conclusions arrived at were &quot;unscientific&quot;.  If that does not ring alarm bells in the Government, I do not know what will.</p></speech>

I support her on that motion.</p><p>We have all received the ballot papers for the Seanad by-election on 10 October.  That by-election will be a test for all of us - a test of democracy in this country.  We are seeing Government politics being carried out in a way more like Beijing than a western democracy.  We are seeing abuse of public office, no free votes and job fixing.  We are seeing the very worst type of politics that none of us stood for in 2011.  Above all, this election on 10 October will be a test of the courage and resolve of Fine Gael and Labour Party Members.  It is unreasonable for the Taoiseach to expect his Deputies and Senators to follow his lead and support stroke politics by voting for Mr. McNulty.  Mr. McNulty is a victim here and his candidacy is corrupted as a result of the abuse of public office by having him put on the IMMA board.  It has been well documented and written on today by Fintan O'Toole.  He has abused six political operational principles: selflessness, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and leadership.</p></speech>

What was announced today on the extension of the period for a flat charge to nine months is welcome but it does not go near providing people with the real-time information I called for last week, whereby people would be able to assess their usage from the beginning of October to see how they are doing and what needs to change.  Considering that many families will be interested in conserving water, people may be surprised to learn the water efficiency of washing machines and dishwashers can vary greatly.  Perhaps they will not be surprised.  The most efficient washing machines use 6 litres per kilogram of clothes in comparison to the least efficient, which use 14 litres per kilogram.  Many families would consider replacing white goods such as washing machines and dishwashers with more economic models.  Would it not be an idea to provide tax relief for those who want to do so?  The Leader is aware grants are available for domestic energy saving measures such as solar panels and replacing boilers.  There should be a grant or tax relief system for people to fit rainwater tanks.  Such grants are available for farmers but not for domestic customers.</p></speech>

It is the right and honourable thing for him to do.  He was put in a terrible situation by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, who owe him and his family a complete and wholehearted apology.  He has been put through the mill unnecessarily by the type of stroke politics for which, unfortunately, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have become known in recent years.</p><p>An Bord Altranais - or the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland as it likes to call itself, although it is officially called An Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann and I do not know why it insists on using the English name when we have always used the Irish one - has decided the annual retention fee should be increased by 50%.  Unfortunately, the legislation allows it to do so without recourse to us.  We need to make a stand on this.  Nurses are among the only PAYE workers who must pay professional fees to a professional bodies.  They are not solicitors or doctors who are self-employed and can put it off against tax, or employed solicitors whose employer normally pays the society fees.  Nurses must pay it out of their own pockets.  Nurses throughout the country are going mad over this because they have suffered pay cuts and increased hours.  They are the front line of trying to provide an effective service and are under more pressure than they have ever been before.  It is neither fair nor right of An Bord Altranais to seek this increase in fees.  The Seanad should play a role in highlighting it, because nothing has been said in the D&aacute;il, and tell An Bord Altranais nurses cannot pay it and its administrative costs are too high.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Clerk of the Seanad who during the Seanad by-election has always displayed her complete and utter independence.</p></speech>

I also seek a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade following his return from the United States where he met the Vice President, Joe Biden, and the Secretary of State, John Kerry.</p> <p>The Minister's visit focused on Northern Ireland, immigration reform and Ireland-US economic matters.  His meetings were timely, as the British and Irish Governments will become involved in talks in Northern Ireland during the coming weeks.  We would like to hear from him what involvement the US Administration is likely to have in those peace talks.  In recent years, many Members of this House have spoken at length about immigration reform and the need for us to see something done in respect of the undocumented Irish, who cannot return to their home country for special occasions like weddings and funerals.  There have been many false dawns, so I would like to hear from the Minister about what progress is likely to be made during the coming months.  I also welcome today's swearing in of the new ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Kevin O'Malley.</p><p>I would like to hear from the Minister about how his discussions with the US Chamber of Commerce went regarding support for Irish companies setting up in the US and the prospect of inward investment into Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Bacik for drawing attention to the fact that I put this matter on the radar by introducing a Bill.  Last year, Senator Cummins advised me that the Government would deliver on my Bill.<br/>I wish to draw the House's attention to the fact that 2,780 women get breast cancer every year.  Although BreastCheck offers a free screening to every woman aged 50 to 64 years, women who are aged 65 to 69 years are not being screened.  This is a question of broken promises and ageism.  The programme for Government included a commitment to extend BreastCheck to the 65-69 year old age cohort.  According to the HSE's national service plan for 2012, this planned extension was to be completed before the end of that year.  I joined a protest outside Leinster House today that called on the Government to implement its promise.<br/>Ageism is an unacceptable prejudice in Irish society.  Women aged between 55 and 70 years have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than others, yet they are still being denied BreastCheck.  I am calling for parity of esteem-----</p></speech>

There are an estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish people living and working in the United States.  These people who come from every corner of this country have had their hopes raised and dashed time and again over the past number of years, including by the Kennedy-McCain Bill.  We need to make a renewed effort to work with our friends in Congress and the United States Senate to ensure meaningful immigration reform in the United States.  We are speaking in this regard of people who consider the USA their home.  They want a pathway to legalisation and to be able to pay their taxes, obtain health insurance and the certainty of knowing that when something goes wrong they can return home without the fear of not being able to return to the USA.  They also want to be able to go about their daily lives in the United States not living in dread of being deported.</p><p>I dealt with a constituent who was deported from the United States three years ago.  Despite that he had been living in the United States for a number of years and employed 12 and 13 people in a very successful business which he had set up there, he was deported.  This is an issue on which we in this country can easily take our eye off the ball.  For the people living here who have loved ones abroad illegally in the United States this is a constant worry.  I would like to hear from the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, what progress he made on this issue during his recent trip to the United States and about the Government's plans and those of our diplomatic corps in the United States in terms of engagement with members of the Congress and Senate.</p></speech>

Senator Bacik asked about Committee Stage of the employment equality Bill, and I will try to ascertain when that will be dealt with.  She also called for a debate on the national dementia strategy.  Senator Zappone spoke about Eavan Boland, and we will certainly bring the name to the Committee for Procedure and Privileges for consideration.  With regard to Committee Stage of the Bill dealing with Seanad reform, the Senator is aware that I have made a number of announcements on Seanad reform.  I will check to see if the Government wishes to proceed with that Bill and allow it in Government time.</p><p>Senator Barrett referred to the events in Hong Kong and democracy, rightly expressing his opinion in that regard.  With regard to the EU probe into Apple's dealings with Ireland, we maintain a very transparent corporate tax regime, with most companies paying effective rates very close to the top rate of 12.5%.  The Revenue Commissioners have already confirmed that Ireland does not make any special deals with individual companies and the regime is statute-based, applying to everybody.  There is nothing new in the publication from the Commission, as it is a copy of a letter sent from the European Commission to Irish authorities in June, indicating the commencement of a formal state aid investigation.  Ireland is confident there has been no breach of state aid rules in this case, and it already issued a formal response to the Commission earlier this month addressing in detail the concerns outlined in the opening position.</p><p>Senator Coghlan spoke about the plight of bank porters, and, as he rightly stated, they are on the front line for banks.  Many of the banks now want to get rid of people and we may be talking to machines more often than people when we go into banks.  I note his concern in that regard and that he will raise the matter with the bank in question.  Senator MacSharry called for a debate on maternity services and I will certainly try to facilitate that.  Senator Whelan discussed the Irish Wheelchair Association and the need for best practice.  My understanding is that building regulations would cover the issues he mentioned but we will try to ascertain the exact position.  It is very important that all the building regulations are adhered to.  Inappropriate use of disabled parking zones is a despicable practice and people fined for it deserve the loss of every euro in such instances.</p><p>I have already referred to the matter of Seanad reform, which Senator Quinn mentioned.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke of interest rates for graduate-entry medical students and sought an amendment to the Order of Business.  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills but I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business today.  Senator Cullinane discussed events concerning the Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>I read the newspapers today and some of the alleged comments attributed to the ex-councillor were unfortunate, to say the least.  I have no intention of being drawn into this matter.  However, it is very important for a Minister to be driven by a person that he or she implicitly trusts.  I have no intention of being drawn further into the matter.</p><p>Senator Mooney mentioned the termination of 252 long wave transmission.  I agreed with him, some time ago, that it is a retrograde step.  A saving of &euro;800,000 has been quoted but it will be interesting to see how he gets on when he raises this matter at an Oireachtas committee meeting in the morning.  </p><p>Senator van Turnhout raised the question of graduate entry for medical students.  Senators O'Donovan and Mullins mentioned the persecution of Christians in many areas of the world and called for a debate.  I shall try to find out for Senator O'Donovan when the sea-fisheries (amendment) Bill will come before the House.  </p><p>Senator Mullen made a number of points about the Seanad by-election and also grants for water tanks and so on which I shall bring to the attention of the relevant Minister.</p></speech>

I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health whom I am sure is aware of the matter.</p><p>Senator Mullins and Conway mentioned the visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the USA, especially regarding the undocumented Irish, and sought a debate on same.  I know the Minister intends to come to the House in the next couple of weeks to update us on the question of Syria and Iraq.  I am sure we may be able to include a report on his visit during that debate.  </p><p>Senator White mentioned paternity leave.  She brought in a very laudable Bill into the House and I am delighted that the relevant Minister intends to proceed with a Bill.  </p><p>On the issue of breast screening for women aged between 65 and 69 years, I agree totally with Senator White.  I think the Minister for Finance indicated that when finance becomes available, such screening will be one of the areas which will be attended to, and rightly so.  </p><p>Senator Moran commended the disability group in Trinity College.  She also raised the matter of petrol stretching which has been raised by a number of Members in the House over the past number of weeks.   </p></speech>

She proposes that a section of the Student Support Act 2011 shall be amended by the deletion of the phrase "pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister".  According to the briefing documents, this change is intended to reflect the transfer of PLC courses to SOLAS.</p> <p>The amendment I propose to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is that we substitute &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; for &ldquo;administered&rdquo;.  I had in mind the administration of schemes devolved to agencies, of which this is one.  In the teething problems of SUSI, we found that the fact that the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Quinn, was in charge meant that he took on board many comments made here and the operation of it in year 2 was substantially improved such that it disappeared from the political radar.  He put a person in charge in each part of the office to deal with a county.  I had a query from somebody in Wexford and it was expeditiously handled.  The purpose of the amendment is to specify that student support systems are authorised rather than administered by the Minister and it would not mean the Minister would not have a role, or that the previous Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not have a role.  I have tabled the amendment with the intention of being useful, not to cause more confusion.</p></speech>

As it currently stands, an approved institution in the further education sector is one that receives a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister for the provision of post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</p><p>Following the transfer of the administration of these courses to SOLAS after its establishment last year, for clarity I propose to remove the current reference to PLC courses as being &quot;pursuant to a scheme administered by the Minister&quot;.  As a result of the change to SOLAS, the proposed amendment would not reflect the change needed to clarify arrangements on the administration of PLC courses following the establishment of SOLAS.  While I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do, it is because of the establishment of SOLAS that we feel the language needs to be changed as we propose.</p></speech>

Students aged under 23 are assessed on their parents' incomes, and can be assessed on their own incomes only if they can prove they are estranged from their parents.  The only proof of estrangement SUSI will accept is verification from a HSE social worker or family support worker, FSW.  This is problematic because HSE social workers and FSWs will not assess people aged over 18.  Therefore, there is no route to verify estrangement from one's parents if it took place when one was over the age of 18.<br/>My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, has continuously raised the issue but it has not yet been rectified.  It leaves very vulnerable students in a precarious situation and has forced some to leave their courses if their parents do not co-operate with grant applications, given that SUSI is rigid in its application processing and vehemently sticks to its guidelines.  It is a difficult situation when a Department such as the Department of Social Protection will accept that a person resides in a particular place for the purpose of social welfare claim but not for a student grant.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand the range of information that is acceptable to verify a claim of estrangement for the purposes of a student grant.</p></speech>

Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and although they have a significant impact on individual students, each one has unique circumstances.  Having carefully considered the Senator's amendment I will not be accepting it, for the following reasons.  Section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011 already makes provision for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criteria that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.</p> <p>For example, the student grant scheme, SI 201 of 2014, makes provision in Article 21.3 to allow a dependent student to be exempt from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that the dependent student is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to the student.  This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to their parents or guardians' income or address.</p><p>The legislation allows latitude.  I know the Senator makes the point that the actual practice may be restrictive, but the Student Support Act 2011 allows latitude for specifying some additional class of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicant having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In effect the proposed amendment would replicate the provision in section 16.3 of the Student Support Act 2011.</p><p>In looking at how the student grant scheme is being administered, I will certainly consider the Senator's point to see whether we need to look at the administration.  If we are reviewing the scheme again, I would be willing to look at it at that stage.  All Members from time to time come across difficult cases where students do not qualify for grants.  I would certainly like to review the scheme at some stage, but I do not feel it is appropriate to put it into this legislation.</p></speech>

In page 10, line 2, after &ldquo;Education&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and Royal College of Surgeons&rdquo;.</blockquote>I will not be.<br/>The criteria for the university to be so designated outside Ireland but not so designated in Ireland - but located in Ireland - require that it have an international reputation and have 40% of the students from outside the European Union.  We had the Minister at the Irish Universities Association conference a few doors down the road only yesterday.  Of the people the Minister was talking to yesterday, no other institution would qualify for it.  It seems to me that it is about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, so why not put it in the title?  We had the rather strange debate the last day that only people on this side of the House were saying that this was about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and nobody on the Government side was willing to acknowledge that.  I do not know why it is a secret and it may have weakened the Bill because, as the Minister knows, doubts began to manifest themselves on this side of the House - not with me yet - as to why the body for which this legislation was primarily and probably exclusively intended within our lifetime, was not mentioned in it.<br/>The second issue is whether it needs to change its charter to become a university for some purposes outside the country but not inside it?  Should it not be referred to in its own legislation, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003?  Perhaps we will have a longer discussion on it on Report Stage, but that aspect strikes me as strange.  Senator Power expressed doubts when she said it is really a medical university.  Other people subsequently asked whether it was possible to have a university that specialises in such a narrow area.  News to my ears in those discussions was that universities need a full range of subjects and disciplines and particularly that the civilising influence on a university is its arts faculty.<br/>While it started off with my support - it seemed like a good idea but there were doubts - at least if we want to go there and do it, why is it not mentioned in the Bill?</p> <p>It would be very strange to have something implemented by a law and an Act of Parliament which does not refer at all to the body for which it is intended.  This is the purpose of the amendment.  It struck me as anomalous.  I will not push the amendment, and I will not move amendment No. 22 as I would only be repeating what I just said, which is that it is strange.</p></speech>

As this is the first time I have seen him here since his appointment, I wish him all the best in his role.  The two amendments arise from committee proceedings.  We still have a concern about companies being regarded as a legal entity and having the same rights and &quot;full and unlimited capacity&quot; as a human being.  It is one of the most striking but unremarked upon changes in the Bill and which is contained in section 38.  It gives companies the same capacity and authority as a human being.  I do not have a difficulty with the idea behind the change but I would have a concern about giving &quot;full and unlimited capacity to carry on and undertake any business or activity, do any act or enter into any transaction&quot; and having the full rights and privileges as a human being as going too far.<br/>Amendment No. 10, which is similar, states:<blockquote>In page 89, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:&quot;(2) In the case of a clash of &quot;rights and privileges&quot; a natural human being's rights and privileges would always take precedence over a company's.&quot;.</blockquote>It is difficult to determine the ultimate use that companies and directors will make of this provision.  In the US where there are similar situations, this type of right has resulted in companies claiming a breach of their human rights when they are required to allow inspections of the workplace or that their human right to free speech is infringed upon by advertising rules or that laws dealing with unfair labour practices, such as holding anti-union meetings, are contrary to their employment of their human rights.  That is a difficulty we have.  We agree with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that a human being their human rights need to be protected first and foremost above and beyond any company which would be given, as the Bill does, the same full and unlimited capacity and which would be seen then as a legal person in legal terms.  These issues have been discussed at length on Second and Committee Stages but we are not convinced that our concerns have been taken on board.  That is the reason we have resubmitted the amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The purpose of these amendments is to ensure clarity in relation to existing semi-State companies.  It is possible that the private company limited by shares model may not be an appropriate fit for existing semi-State companies.  The legislation governing them could not have foreseen the innovation of a one document constitution that this Bill, when enacted, will provide.  The schemes governing such companies are premised on them being two document companies, that is, their incorporation is governed by a memorandum and articles of association.  This amendment makes it clear also that a semi-State company, under its new guise as a DAC, will be subject to the same terms of its governing legislation as it was before it re-registered.  The associated grouped amendment No. 164 exempts semi-State bodies from having the terms "limited", "designated activity company" and so forth at the end of their names.</p></speech>

The 2001 Act provided an exemption to section 32 of the 1963 Act.  In simple terms, this allows a subsidiary, whether limited or unlimited, to hold shares in its listed parent where that subsidiary is a member of an approved stock exchange.  This permits market making in a parent's shares.</p><p>This amendment proposal maintains existing law.  It replicates section 32 of the 1963 Act as amended by section 111 of the Company Law Enforcement Act.  If the subsidiary is a member of an approved stock exchange acting in the ordinary course of its business as a professional dealer in securities, the restrictions and limitations of the acquisition of shares by a subsidiary in its holding company will not apply.  A holding company must treat such shares as treasury shares.</p></speech>

We feel it is important that companies operating in these areas are tax compliant and the amendment provides that companies making an annual return must also provide a certificate of tax compliance as part of the process.  This is to ensure no company can continue to be registered if it is not fully tax compliant.  On Committee Stage the Minister stated it might be difficult to synchronise the annual returns with tax returns and I have sympathy with this, but there is no reason why the most recent tax certificate, perhaps for the previous year, would not suffice.  It would be good practice and would give confidence to all elements in the chain of supply if people had a tax certificate.  A number of examples were given to us of contractors using subcontractors who were not tax compliant for many years, built up an exposure and eventually went out of business.  It would add value to the Bill and I ask the Minister of State to consider the issue.</p></speech>

The aim of the directive is to simplify the accounting requirements for small companies and improve the clarity and comparability of companies financial statements in the European Union.</p> <p>The new directive takes a small company or group as a starting point and imposes additional requirements on medium-sized companies and groups and even more requirements on large companies and groups as well as on public interest entities, those essentially being listed companies and banks and insurance undertakings regardless of their size or whether they are listed.  This is described as the "think small first" approach.

The function concerned is what is known as a section 26 review, namely, a review of whether accounts comply with Companies Acts.  The section 26 review was introduced in the 2003 Act and provided the supervisory authority with the novel power of requiring the ratification of the accounts of large organisations where such accounts fail in some respects to comply with the accounting requirements of the Companies Acts.  The reason for the proposed deletion of the references is that these references are now deemed to be obsolete and unsuitable for commencement.  The transparency directive has provided the supervisory authority with a more targets and effective way of dealing with companies' accounts.</p></speech>

I thank them for their hard work.  There were many positive contributions spanning across a range of issues.  Some of the issues raised were not necessarily about this legislation but we have taken note of them.  I thank Members for the collaborative approach taken to the development of the Bill.  I dealt with the Bill in committee and at all times members were supportive of the general thrust of the Bill and were genuinely trying to work on it to ensure it would be enacted.  I appreciate the time and effort of members from all parties.</p><p>It is a landmark Bill that has involved years of work.  I think it has been worked on for between ten and 12 years in the Department, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the experts in the Company Law Review Group as well.  The overall rationale for the Bill is to improve Ireland's competitive position as a location for business investment, and the objective is to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible.</p><p>I thank Members for their co-operation in the passage of the Bill.

I have said before that I think he should have been promoted before now, but it is better late than never.  I have complete confidence in Deputy English in his role as Minister of State and I am delighted about his appointment.</p><p>I congratulate all the civil servants who, together with various Ministers, worked on this complex Bill over the past 12 years.

It is the culmination of many years of hard work by politicians and public servants.  It is designed to bring company law into the 21st century, to make it easier to do business in the country, and to ensure business becomes more competitive.

There is a report that relates to the south east that I want the Minister of State to implement.</p><p>It seems a long time ago since the briefing sessions on this Bill were arranged and we were brought to a presentation in Agriculture House.  We were brought through a very lengthy PowerPoint presentation that went on for hours but it was worthwhile to have had the Bill discussed with us.  As one of the other speakers said, the previous Government also had a hand in the preparation of the Bill, as the Bill was a long time in the making.  It brings company law into the 21st century and consolidates many Acts that needed to be consolidated.  It is a very important Bill and it is a good legislation.  I am happy that we were in a position to support it.</p></speech>

Members are correct.  It is good to get the job done, but it has been a pleasure to work on this Bill and to be involved in the Committee Stage debate during its deliberation by the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation because we were able to see it progress through the committee, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p><p>It has been said that it has taken a long time for me to be appointed to ministerial office, but I am pleased I went this route because the years I spent on the Committee of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation were very important.  I know some of the Members in front of me have put a great deal of work into the Committee Stage of this Bill as well as other Bills.  The work of committees is not always recognised and it is a credit to the Members as well.</p><p>The Companies Bill 2012 is a significant body of work and, as Senator David Cullinane said, we received the English version and went through the briefing documents and attended the presentation on it.  I thank the officials who are present from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  A great deal of work went into ensuring members of all parties were brought up to speed on it and were brought on the journey of the passage of the Bill.  That helped to fast-track the passage of the Bill through all Stages in both Houses.  This is the right way to process legislation.  A great many people were involved and everybody engaged in the process of consultation.  The Company Law Review Group were very busy working on it and all Members had a full chance to be involved and took the opportunity to do so.</p><p>I am glad to be present for the debate on the Report and Final Stages of the Bill.  I again thank Members for their kind comments.  I hope we can work together again.  We will not always agree, but that is part of the process.</p><p>I confirm that the document and report that Senator David Cullinane submitted was put on the agenda of the first management meeting I attended.  We will work on it and I believe an interesting development is making progress in the south east.</p></speech>

I campaigned on this issue for many years before I came into the Seanad.  I have raised it on five separate occasions here and have tabled four Adjournment motions.  I have done so because it is important to me.  I have visited the school, Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n, Tramore, County Waterford, several times and far too many of its students are being taught in prefabs.</p><p>The school has applied for capital funding to build a new building to move the children out of prefabs.  Since July the school has worked with its design team to clarify the final stage 2(b) report for architectural planning.  All of the Department&rsquo;s queries have been answered.  Ms Noeleen Newman, the major design and construction person for the project, has assured it that the project is effectively at stage 2(b) and needs approval.  Only four other schools in the country have completed all the architectural planning stages.  This project needs to be included in a new building list as it is shovel ready and will benefit the students.  It will create jobs in the area and remove prefabs which have been used for far too long.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s position is that the earliest it can go to tender is 2018.  The school would like the Minister and the Department to bring that forward.  Are there any plans to increase the number of schools being built?  If that was the case, we would hope this school could be included.  The Government is talking about stimulus and investment and if there is, as it says, an upturn in the economy, one would hope for an increase in capital funding across all Departments.  If there is to be any increase in school building programmes, I will make sure to do my part to see that this school is included on that list.</p><p>The minor works grant has been withdrawn and the school&rsquo;s maintenance budget has been cut by &euro;10,000 with no prospect of a permanent building being provided in the short or medium term.  I will continue to track this issue and to lobby on behalf of the people who use the school, the pupils and the parents.  I welcome the fact that the application has come this far because the school is in a much better position than it was last year or two years ago.  We want the building to be built and the funding to be provided as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by over 36,000 pupils by 2016 and they are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak at around 574,000 pupils to be catered for in 2018.  This compares with some 526,422 pupils enrolled in primary schools for the 2012-13 school year.  It is vital, therefore, that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.</p><p>In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p><p>While the Department would seek to provide additional accommodation to meet demographic growth, it would also aim to ensure maximum use of existing school accommodation.  A priority, therefore, for the Department is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.</p><p>The school building project for Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n comprises a new eight classroom school with ancillary accommodation.  The project is at an advanced stage of the architectural planning process and the stage 2(b) submission was recently approved by the Department.  This was confirmed to the school by letter on 25 September last.  It was explained to the school that due to competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to authorise the project to proceed to tender at this time.  However, the project for Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n is now well placed to progress to tender and construction in the event that further funding becomes available to the Department in the future.</p><p>The Senator also referred to the restoration of the minor works grant.  The Senator will be aware that the focus under the infrastructure and capital investment programme 2012-16 is on meeting the demand for additional school places.  Consequently, there is no funding provided at this time in the 2014 capital allocation for the payment of a minor works grant.  Circular letter 0062/2013, which accompanied the publication of the minor works grant scheme last November, advised that the grant will be paid in future years only as funding permits.  The Minister is very interested in this matter and has spoken about it on several occasions. </p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on the matters raised.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State may not have the answer now but could he tell me afterwards what plans there are to build new schools and provide extra funding for new schools?  If there is no plan until 2018 that is bad news.  The pupils, parents and staff would welcome clarification so that they know exactly where they stand.</p></speech>

We are involved in a budgetary process now and will be next year.  The decision was correctly taken to put together a capital envelope for schools for 2012-16.  If it is any help to the Senator, that is progressing quite well.  It is ahead of target and provides good value for taxpayers' money.  The Minister for Education and Skills is very keen to have additional money spent on capital projects as soon as she can get her hands on it.  There is progress in that group of schools.</p><p>The aim for this school is to fight to be included in the next project.  The school is in a very good position.  It has gone through the various stages.  It is a question now of when money becomes available.  The Senator should keep raising the issue, as he has done today, to ensure that it is on the next list of projects.  I hope it will not be as far off as the Senator thinks.  That depends on circumstances, money and growth.  Recent news is good even if the Senator might not want to admit that.  I hope that will lead to there being more money available sooner than we all hoped. </p></speech>

Colaiste Pobail Osra&iacute; was established in Kilkenny as an ionad in 1991 with 13 students.  It now has 193 students and is the only Irish language second level school in County Kilkenny.  Following an inspection by the Department of Education and Skills, it was granted its own roll number.  Prior to that it had been under the remit of Kilkenny Vocational School.  The application for the next few years shows an enrolment increase of approximately 20 students per year.  The only outdoor play area at the school is a basketball court.  This is not ideal for 193 students.</p><p>The school has been located in temporary prefabricated accommodation on the site of Ormonde College, a post-leaving certificate, PLC, college, since 1995.  To date, &euro;930,000 has been spent on temporary accommodation for Colaiste Pobail Osra&iacute;, that is, &euro;137,000 per annum, since 2007 and, therefore, it makes sense to move this project on.  If some decision is not reached within the next two to three years, there will be no option but for the school to move into temporary accommodation on a more suitable site, which will incur greater expense for the Department, without an overall resolution to this problem.</p> <p>This would incur greater expense for the Department, without an overall solution to the problem.  I would appreciate a positive response from the Minister to this.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on the provision of improved accommodation for Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute;, Ormonde Road, Kilkenny.</p><p>The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Post-primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by over 19,000 pupils by 2016, as I mentioned earlier to Senator Cullinane.  They are set to continue to rise and will probably peak with around 404,000 pupils to be catered for in 2025.  This compares with some 327,320 pupils enrolled in post-primary schools for the 2012-2013 school year.  It is vital, therefore, that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.</p><p>In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p><p>Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute; operates from prefabricated premises on the grounds of Ormonde College, which is in the ownership of the Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board, ETB.  I understand that it shares woodwork, science, technology and computer facilities with Ormonde College.  I can confirm to the Senator that the Department has received an application from the school for major capital funding to provide a new school on a green field site.  Department officials visited the school earlier this year and the Department subsequently provided grant aid to the school to reconfigure existing accommodation within Ormonde College and to purchase additional temporary accommodation.  This grant will assist in providing improved accommodation for the school as well as providing accommodation for increasing pupil numbers.</p><p>The forward planning section of the Department is currently considering the demographic demand for additional school places in all areas of the country, including Kilkenny.  The accommodation needs of Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute; and how they might be met will be considered in the context of this review.  The review should occur in the timeframe envisaged by the Senator as the forward planning section has been very active analysing various counties.  I hope we can work on the report next year to get some indications on pupil numbers, demographics and required school accommodation.</p><p>In view of the financial constraints imposed by the need, outlined in the five year plan, to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential teaching accommodation to meet demographic demand, the Senator will appreciate that it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe at this time for the progression of a building project for the school.  The Department will, however, continue to liaise with Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute; regarding its accommodation needs.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position.  The analysis will be conducted in a manner that I hope the Senator finds timely.</p></speech>

The school has now been granted three rooms in Ormonde College, which means the PLC college is being squeezed for space.  It is imperative that this matter progresses because the concept of a pobail school was not taken into account at one time but there is now a growing demand for children to be taught through Irish.  There is a Gaelscoil in Kilkenny but only 50% of its students, around 25 to 30 pupils, go on to Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute; each year.  Other students come from outside areas to attend the school.  I urge the Minister of State to keep this matter on the agenda so that if a site is identified the school can proceed to apply to the Department for a new school on a green field site.</p></speech>

I will discuss this issue with the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, and her officials.  I am interested in this because the PLC area falls under my remit and I am concerned that PLC colleges are not too squeezed.  When I travel around the country I see a greater demand for PLC places and we must work on this.  I will take an active interest in this, along with the Minister, and we will give the Senator feedback.</p></speech>

I understand that in many parts of the country elderly patients who seek access to a dietician must attend a clinic in a hospital.  This costs the health service because an ambulance or taxi must be provided to take the patient to the hospital.  As a result, many nursing homes now rely on privately-employed dieticians, many of whom are employed by pharmaceutical companies.  I do not doubt that these dieticians are above board and I do not question their decisions but they tend to prescribe drink supplements, some of which are extremely expensive, that are added to the health budget.  I was surprised to learn there is no procedure whereby dieticians are employed to visit nursing homes on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to assess patients and advise as to their management.  I am seeking to reduce costs to the health service regarding care of the elderly.</p><p>I accept that existing dietician contracts cannot be changed and that what I have proposed is not currently part of a dietician's work programme.  I know that there is a recruitment embargo but in future when contracts are offered by the HSE to dieticians they should state that they may be required to visit nursing homes to give assistance.  More than 22,000 people are in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme - that is in addition to those in public nursing homes - and that is why I have raised this Adjournment matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-09-30a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014093000030#SS00600"><p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this important issue and for allowing me to address the matter.  I am answering on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is responsible for social care.</p><p>The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal care services.  The current health reform programme involves a major change process which will see a</p><p>greater integration and a streamlining of service access and provision for the public.  The staff appointed to dietician posts will be required to work as part of multi-disciplinary teams delivering a co-ordinated approach to client care.  Currently dieticians practice across health promotion, acute hospital services and primary care and interact on a daily basis with service users.  There are 129 community facilities through which the HSE provides residential care for older persons and all of these facilities have access to dietetic services.  This service recognises the fact that making healthy and nourishing food choices easily accessible to older people in residential care can help reduce the incidence of poor nutrition - both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.</p><p>The nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal, provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care in nursing homes.  The scheme covers the cost of standard components of residential care.  While access to dieticians is not covered by this scheme, older people in residential settings are entitled to be referred and assessed for HSE ancillary services and therapies.  These include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, OT, and access to dieticians - access is provided in the same way as to those who are resident in the community.</p><p>In conjunction with the development of primary care teams, specific development funding has been provided to develop services for older people in the community.  Referral protocols, direct access to diagnostics, individual care plans, discharge planning, integrated care pathways and shared care arrangements will allow for a more fully integrated primary care service.</p><p>As the HSE implements the reform programme, it continues to review the job descriptions for all posts with a focus on maximising the contribution of all professionals to the overall well-being of the public and all service users.</p></speech>

Short cuts are being taken and dieticians who are not employed by the HSE are being used by nursing homes.</p> <p>As a result, an additional cost is imposed on the HSE in real terms.  I urge the Minister to examine the matter.  While dieticians do have access to community facilities and provide support in community facilities, we should now examine the issue in the context of the fair deal scheme in order to ensure we get value for money for the service they provide.  The matter should be addressed in future contracts.</p></speech>

I must admit I have never read the contract of a dietician so I am not sure what is in it.  Many of them would be private to the individuals concerned.  However, what would seem to me to be eminently logical is where a dietician is part of a primary care team or is employed within the community, that he or she would be available to go to nursing homes and speak to relatives in the way a GP does, as suggested by Senator Burke.  The situation is different where a dietician is based in a hospital and his or her job is to work full time in the hospital.  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the HSE.</p></speech>

The matter I raise is directed to his colleague in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly.

The view is that the changes put members of the fire crew at risk.</p></speech>

I am responding to the debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It relates to the development of fire services in Ireland using the standards and norms in the policy document Keeping Communities Safe, KCS.</p><p>It is a function of each individual fire authority, under the Fire Services Act 1981, to provide a fire service in its functional area.  Kerry County Council's fire services are provided primarily through a retained staffing system with full-time officers.  Retained firefighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a fire service through a network of ten fire stations located throughout the county.</p><p>Published as national policy in February 2013, the national standards contained in KCS are in keeping with international good practice and are considered crucial to achieving consistency across fire services.  From the outset, the work undertaken has focused on the integration of national norms and standards into service planning within each fire service in the period 2013-15.</p><p>The approach in KCS is based on an area risk categorisation system which will be applied by all fire services.  That will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low-risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management, including response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area, is to correspond to the risk categorisation.  The risk categorisation process has been completed for County Kerry and appropriate risk designations for each station area in the county have been determined.</p><p>For the first time KCS sets national norms for crewing levels.  The KCS standard is that the normal crewing level on the first responding class B fire appliance is five, including an incident commander, with four personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station.  In establishing national standards and norms, the KCS document reflects widespread practice in Ireland and elsewhere for crewing levels on appliances.  A series of task analyses has been prepared to show how an initial crew of five may be used to safely undertake tasks normally associated with a range of fire scenarios.</p><p>Rather than compromising or threatening the safety of firefighters, initiatives under KCS enhance the safety of firefighting personnel.  The policy provisions are based on the systems approach and international best practice which have shown how the approaches adopted in KCS can achieve better results in terms of public safety.  Safety provisions under KCS include guidance on managing safety in fire services, and risk assessments for equipment.  They complement existing safeguards such as the national incident command system, the ancillary safety statement, breathing apparatus guidelines and a comprehensive suite of standard operating guidelines.</p><p>It is expected that fire service management will bring any proposals for significant change in fire service provision to their local authorities for consideration.  The principles of local democracy and local accountability for service provision are maintained in KCS, while the objectives of national standards for important public services such as fire services are introduced.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a point of clarification.  I accept the matter does not relate to the ministerial responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Is it the case that the final say on the proposals rests with local authorities and their members or will the county manager or CEO have the final say on the adoption of the new proposals?</p></speech>

That is provided for in section 26 of the Fire Services Act.  Proposed plans are then put forward for consideration and adoption by the relevant county council or city council.  All services are developing section 26 plans, taking account of the area risk categorisation, which requires consideration and adoption by the council.  I am afraid I do not know whether that is an executive function or a reserved function but I imagine section 26 of the Act clarifies the matter.</p></speech>
