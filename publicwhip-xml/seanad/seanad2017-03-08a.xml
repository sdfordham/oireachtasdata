The Minister of State will understand this issue well because he comes from County Clare and will probably know many seaweed harvesters and how important the industry is.

One, in particular, covered the area from County Clare to the top of Mayo.  There was serious concern at that stage about the impact that would have on the industry, the traditional harvesters and the smaller processors and their access to seaweed.  The question seems to have gone dormant in the last year or so.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We know that his Department was asking for a list of all the folios on the seashore to be made so that it could look at all those foreshore folios and see how many had pertinent seaweed harvesting rights attached to them.  We also know that people can also legally maintain their right to continue cutting seaweed if they have proof of having been involved in the industry through sales to companies, etc.</p><p>The traditional harvesters have raised this matter with me once again.  A review was to be done of the licensing regime.  Where does that stand at the moment?  Has that audit been finished?  If so, can we see a published report on that audit?  How many people actually have pertinent rights on their folios that would allow them to continue harvesting?  How many people do not?  What is the plan to implement a seaweed management programme in those areas?  What is the situation in regard applications for the harvesting of seaweed?  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.  This is an issue in Mayo as well, so I will hand over to Senator Conway-Walsh to say a few words.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, for raising this matter and I thank the Minister of State for being here.  This is an issue that we have been working on in Mayo and along the coast for the last number of years.  We are working on it from the point of view of first establishing the ownership of the foreshore, particularly where people have folios there.  Like my colleague, I would appreciate clarity, which I think is absolutely necessary, on the current situation.  People were very concerned around the sell-off of the State company and the conditions that might have been attached to that because there was not transparency around it.  This is an opportunity for us to have transparency.</p> <p>I will talk specifically on the benefits of seaweed.  There are massive benefits for local, coastal communities.  I ask the Minister of State today to instruct the local authorities along the coast, including Mayo County Council, to prioritise the production of seaweed and to conduct and support feasibility studies into what can be done with seaweed and the jobs that can be created in that area.  Sinn F&eacute;in's vision for seaweed, along the western coast in particular, is that we would have many micro-industries, small cottage industries, that could be set up using our seaweed as a natural resource.  We have experienced the giveaway of our other natural resources in terms of oil and gas.  We are not prepared to let the natural resource of seaweed be relinquished to foreign companies which will exploit it to maximise their own profits as well.</p></speech>

We are three Member of the Oireachtas from the west of Ireland so we are well aware of the importance of the west coast and the Wild Atlantic Way.  I know a company in Quilty in County Clare which has 30 people employed in seafood products and exporting to China so it is an important issue to raise.</p> <p>The role of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in regard to harvesting of seaweed is to regulate the activity in accordance with the Foreshore Act 1933.  In carrying out this task, that Department aims to ensure that the resource is managed appropriately, with the twin aims of protecting the marine environment and allowing for a sustainable level of harvesting by both individual harvesters, including those who have harvested seaweed over generations, and also by companies.</p> <p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recognises the valuable and important role that seaweed harvesting plays in the environment, culture and economy of coastal communities, particularly in counties along the western coast.  Seaweed harvesting has provided a source of income to traditional harvesters for generations.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, very clearly understands the concerns raised by both the sale of Arramara Teoranta by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2014, and the applications to harvest seaweed by companies which have been received by his Department.</p> <p>During the course of assessing these licence applications, it became clear that certain rights to harvest seaweed exist and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is in a process of assessing, with the assistance of the Attorney General, the legal interface and relationship between these traditional harvesting rights and the current applications.  Accordingly, these applications by companies are effectively on hold until the Department receives definitive legal advice from the Attorney General on this matter.</p> <p>This is a very complex legal issue.  In trying to fully establish the implications of the interaction between these existing seaweed harvesting rights and the applications for licences by companies officials of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with the Attorney General on a number of occasions to discuss this matter.</p> <p>The aim, of course, is to bring clarity to the regulatory regime applying to the harvesting of wild seaweed to all parties and especially to the question of the rights held by traditional harvesters.  It is expected that this matter will be concluded by mid-2017, or earlier if possible.  Officials from the Department have met with several applicants to explain the complexities of the situation to them.</p> <p>I to take this opportunity to assure Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Conway-Walsh that no decisions have yet been reached on the applications currently on hold in the Department.  The work is ongoing and once it is finalised my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will give definitive clarification around the rights of traditional harvesters and make a decision on the position regarding the existing applications from companies to harvest wild seaweed.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the timeline and that he hopes to have some kind of conclusion before mid-2017.  When we look internationally there are ongoing cases, for example, in Maine in the US around the exact same issue, that is, international companies coming in and seeking harvesting rights.  We know that in Canada these types of rights have been given to companies.  The concerns are still here.</p> <p>I note that the applicants have been given information about the complexities and have been engaged with but the individual harvesters have not.  I ask, as I have asked on a number of occasions going back more than a year, if the list of folios or a map of the shore could be made available to us.  Surely that was a matter for land registry, which was being done.  It was an audit by the Department of all the different folios along the shore that had pertinent rights attached to them.  Surely at this stage we could have that made available to us, rather than everybody seeking individual folios.  It is not going to affect the outcome.  It is a matter of fact that is on the record.  That work has been done by the Department.  Could the Minister of State make that available to us as Oireachtas Members?</p></speech>

At the moment there is a huge furore in Bantry Bay about a licence for harvesting seaweed.  It is <i>sub judice</i>so I will not comment further.  Does the Minister of State wish to respond?</p></speech>

Obviously, this is a very complex issue.  The Department is in the process of assessing, with the assistance of the Attorney General, the legal interface between traditional harvesting rights and the current application.  That is a very complex issue.  It has to be dealt with.  It takes time to make sure that it has the proper information.  As I said, I would hope that there will be a decision on this by mid-2017 or earlier.  It is hoped that will bring a conclusion to the situation.  I do not want to comment on it at the moment because it is ongoing and the Attorney General's office is dealing with it but it is something of concern, particularly to small-time producers or collectors of seaweed on the west coast.  They are often small-time farmers for whom this is an auxiliary income to supplement the small income they get from farming.  I would be very conscious of that.</p></speech>

We are delighted to see he has made a good recovery.  The Minister has seen the outline of my Commencement matter on the regulation of SIM cards and SIM-only, ready-to-go and pay-as-you-go phones.  Many of the larger companies have this quite well regulated.  They look for identification, proof of age and utility bills before they sell any of these.  I was surprised to learn this is not the policy of all companies and is not in legislation.  If it is, some of them are flouting it.  There has been a huge increase in cyber bullying, trolling and sexting.  They are things that are heavily prevalent among teenagers.  It is causing fundamental problems in our society.  Many garda&iacute; will say that criminals are prospering by hiding behind anonymous identities.  I am curious about that.  The Minister knows the general point.  I will not delay him because he has a busy portfolio and was here yesterday as well.  I am curious what our stance is on this.  What does the Minister see as the way forward in tightening up the regulations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030800002#C00300"><p>I thank Senator Davitt for raising a very valid question on an important issue.  From a telecommunications perspective, Ireland favours easy access by our citizens to mobile communications on the basis that such access is of benefit to society.  There is currently no Irish legal requirement to register the personal details of owners of SIM cards.  Where mobile service providers are extending a line of credit in the form of telecommunications services to bill paying customers, assurances are sought that the bills issued will be received and paid and that any relevant debt will be recoverable.  In that regard, personal data such as proof of identification and residence are collected and processed for legitimate business purposes and solely in connection with the delivery of the mobile service.  For SIM cards and prepaid phones with no line of credit being extended, no requirement for collecting personal details arises.  Although there is currently no mandatory registration system for SIM cards in Ireland, there is a voluntary registration system in place for prepaid phones which has a high take-up because of incentives offered by operators.  Customers have tended to register their details on foot of being offered commercial incentives for doing so, such as top-up credit.  My Department would only legislate in this area if there was comprehensive evidence emerging to indicate a widespread or serious problem which a policy change would rectify.  The proposal to register all customers for mobile phone services was considered previously by my Department and identified complex legal, technical, data protection and practical issues.  Such issues include the ease with which a foreign or stolen SIM card could be used, the difficulties that would be posed by verifying identity in the absence of a national identification card system and data protection issues arising from the development of a register.  It was concluded that the proposal would be of limited benefit because it would not solve the illegal or inappropriate use of mobile phones by persons determined to abuse the technology.  Furthermore it was found that data protection issues associated with the concept and the routine collection and retention of individuals' personal data information would be contrary to the Data Protection Acts 2008 and 2013.  There are no proposals to compel mobile telephone service providers to register all customers.</p> <p>As the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I continue to support the mobile industry in its work on a safe and responsible use of mobile phones.  I am aware that representative groups within the telecommunications sector are alert to the need to adopt high standards for mobile operators on parental controls for the access by minors to mobile services.  In that regard, three operators - Three Ireland, Vodafone and Meteor - have, since 2014, developed a code of practice for application in the Irish market.  The code establishes the standard which mobile operators will adhere to on issues of parental controls for minors' access to mobile services, malicious or offensive communications, spam, internet access, premium rate service and access controls for content services.  While I have overall responsibility for electronic communications policy, the Senator will appreciate that policy responsibility in respect of combatting crimes that might take advantage of or abuse electronic communications rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Policy responsibility in respect of child protection rests with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Seanad will also appreciate that prevention, detention and investigation of criminal conduct is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>There are also civil liberty issues at play here.  ComReg, as the telecommunications regulator, seeks proof of identification from its bill paying customers purely for the purposes of billing.  That is an entirely separate matter from any policy developments that might be considered in criminal justice or child protection spheres.  If the State wanted the register to identify all owners or users of mobile phones, it would be a matter for the relevant Minister.</p></speech>

It is not a simple issue to solve.  I would be the last person to trumpet any state or anything to that effect.  The Minister hit on quite a valid point when he said the three main operators have a voluntary code of practice for this.  I do not say this lightly.  We have regulation for underage drinking and we are very regimental in carrying out stings on publicans to make sure they are held to account and run good shows.  It is not right to give mobile phones or access to mobile phones to kids of any age.  It is causing serious issues in households which will become bigger problems going forward.  The Minister hit on it there.  The code of practice used by the large companies is good.  We should not hide behind regulation and privacy.  It is possible to bring in a minimum age for use of a phone.  If a parent wants to give a kid a phone and flout the regulation that is his or her own business.  A minimum age for access to a mobile phone of perhaps 14, 15 or 16 is the way forward.</p></speech>

It is a mobile device not a mobile phone.  Most of the tablets we have now also have SIM cards or are linked up to mobile phones.  My children have tablets in school.  The school has purchased them.  I was in Roscommon Community College during the week and rather than having e-books and using e-learning, the children now bring in their device, whether it is a mobile phone or a tablet, and they can link up with the services that are there.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the Senator's proposal to have a ban on the use of mobile phones at particular ages.  The only way we could do that is to have a ban on the use of the SIM card rather than the device as a result of the way technology is changing.  With the wider use of the internet, we will see a situation where very small children will have a bracelet with a SIM card in it in case they get lost.  That is the way technology is going and the way the internet is developing.  That kind of regulation will not happen but there are a number of things we can do.  We need to make parents far more aware of the issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to strengthen the legislation in this area and I am actively considering this.  The Law Reform Commission has examined this and I have already said I am exploring issues in this area.  In fact, there is a paper on the subject on my desk as I speak.</p><p>It is important to remember that we are part of the European Union.  In recent weeks, after a long period of negotiation, we successfully signed up to the EU "roam like at home" initiative, which will allow mobile telephone users in Ireland to roam right across the European Union and pay the exact same charges they would pay here in Ireland from 15 June.  That is a reciprocal arrangement.  It means any SIM card from abroad that comes here and that could be unregistered can also be used here.  We all know that people who want to avoid detection will easily find ways of doing so.  Putting in place an administrative system that registers 99.999% of SIM cards will still not deal with the criminal issue.  Powers exist to intercept telecommunications messages.  I am quite willing to examine these on a national or European basis to determine whether we need to review them to deal with criminal activity.</p><p>What we need to do is make people more aware of the risks and work with the various companies.  Gmail, for example, has an age limit for registration and it opens up quite a number of services.  There are a number of responsible companies at present.  Many more of them would like to put more formalised procedural structures in place, just as 3, Vodafone and Meteor have done in regard to their codes of practice.  In general, the device companies, operators and social media companies moving into this space are very anxious to put in place the types of child protection measures that should be in place.  That is better because, if we can achieve this, not only will it apply to Ireland, but Ireland will effectively regulate what happens in Europe.  This can apply right across the European Union and protect children no matter where they live in the Union.</p></speech>

The last thing I want is a ban on people using phones.  What we are doing is the way forward but a certain amount of regulation is required.  At present, a five-year-old child could rock up to a shop, get a SIM card and gain access to anything he or she wants.  This is not good enough.</p></speech>

His Department, under his guidance, announced last week additional funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for the provision of a number of additional air quality monitoring stations nationwide.  Through the Minister's Department, I have made a formal request to the EPA so that, as part of this programme, it will seek to install immediately a permanent air quality monitoring station at the Irish Cement plant in Mungret, Limerick.  People living in the greater Mungret-Raheen-Dooradoyle-Limerick area would like to see this station.  The Minister is probably aware that there is currently an application before Limerick City and County Council from Irish Cement seeking to put in place an alternative fuels plant on the site.  The licence for the overall site is before the EPA at present.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is providing an additional fund to the EPA for the erection of a permanent air monitoring station.  Good practice ordains that one of the sites for monitoring air quality should be at the Irish Cement site in Mungret, Limerick.  There is major concern among people living in the area.  Many have young families.  They are very reasonable people and they have concerns about the emissions from the plant.  Bearing in mind the robustness of the licensing regime of the EPA in respect of measuring air quality, I understand there is no permanent air monitoring site at the Irish Cement plant in Limerick at present.  Cement manufacturing is heavy industry so air monitoring is required immediately.  The people of the area are entitled to it.</p> <p>The Minister is putting funding in place to allow the EPA to erect the permanent air monitoring stations.  Clearly, the Irish Cement plant in Mungret should be at the front of the queue.  There have been numerous public meetings with residents in the area and the wider public in Limerick.  This has been brought to a head with the current application before Limerick City and County Council for the alternative fuel plant on the site.  As the Minister is probably aware, however, the licensing of the alternative fuel plant will have to be done by the EPA itself.  Apart from that, the licence of the overall site is currently under review in the EPA.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister has appeared before the Seanad to deal with this issue.  I ask for a commitment that he will take the matter up with the EPA and that the EPA will erect a permanent air monitoring site at the Irish Cement plant in Mungret, Limerick.</p></speech>

A number of important EU directives seek to protect our environment from the harmful effects of air pollution and maintain the quality of the air we breathe.  The current air quality standards are contained in the clean air for Europe directive of 2008 and the fourth daughter directive of the European Union.  The directives include rules governing how member states should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.  The EPA is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme in Ireland.  Under the directives, the EU member states must designate zones for managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones have been defined in the air quality standards regulations of 2011.  The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are zone A, comprising the Dublin conurbation, zone B, comprising the Cork conurbation, zone C, comprising 23 large towns with a population of more than 15,000, and zone D, the remaining area of Ireland.  Ireland currently has a network of 31 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public nearly in real time at <i>www.airquality.epa.ie</i>.  The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.  I am sure the Senator is already aware that there is one such monitoring station in County Limerick, located in the Shannon Estuary at Askeaton.</p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the current status of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland, the EPA is developing a new national ambient air quality monitoring programme under section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  This process has included a review of the adequacy of the current network for determining compliance with the European and national standards for air quality and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality.  I am not satisfied with the network of 31 monitoring stations in meeting that need.  As I mentioned, we already have a monitoring station in Askeaton in Limerick.  There is a proposed revised EPA monitoring programme.  It proposes an additional monitoring site in Limerick city and an indicative monitoring site in Abbeyfeale.  I welcome the proposed expansion of the network.  It is important to remember that this is about providing the public, in particular, with information regarding local air quality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is of particular significance given the growing evidence that air pollution is more damaging to human health than previously understood, both in terms of thresholds above which health impacts can occur and in the range of those impacts.  As I have said on numerous occasions, poor air quality in Ireland directly results in the deaths of four people every day and many more people end up presenting in hospitals, ending up on trolleys in accident and emergency departments and having long stays in hospital, so by improving air quality we can have a direct impact on the health of our nation and on the congestion we see in the regional hospital in Limerick and hospitals right across this country.  What this network is about is looking at air quality, not just from one particular plant, but right across the city of Limerick.  I refer to diesel engines, which are a huge problem in Dublin, and at other sources of pollution.  We can monitor those over time.</p><p>In regard to individual premises, there is a specific licensing regime in place which is operated and managed by the EPA and there would be specific quite rigid requirements in regard to that.  The EPA recently issued information regarding the air quality from some plants in the region of Limerick which highlighted problems with their emissions.  It may not necessarily be the one that is closest to home either.  The EPA is quite transparent in regard to this and it is quite critical of operations where they do not meet the standards required.  It puts all that into the public domain.  I have confidence in the monitoring regime the EPA has in place in regard to all the large emitters across the country but this network is not about what goes into the air but the air we breathe on a day-to-day basis.  We are quite lucky in that we meet and comply with EU standards on air quality.  However, if we look at the international World Health Organization standards, we are not meeting those.  The best way to improve our standard of air quality is to be able to monitor and measure that and see the progress over time.</p><p>I do not think we can do that with 31 stations which is why I have directed the EPA to increase the number.  It will also have a knock-on benefit of being able to give an accurate reflection in regard to pollen count.  People with allergies will be able to know, based on actual predictions, about the pollen count and the read in Ireland.  Up to now, we were basing it on projections based on data collected in the UK.</p></speech>

What is the timeframe for and the location of the Limerick city station?  It is important it deals with issues about which people have major concerns and on which they need reassurance, including the emissions from plants such as the Irish Cement plant in Mungret.  The Minister should be aware of the concern among the public.  A march is being organised by people in Limerick city this Saturday.  These people have genuine concerns.  They are reasonable people with young families living in Dooradoyle, Raheen, the Mungret area where the Irish Cement plant is located and other areas.  What is the timeframe for the permanent air quality monitoring station in Limerick city?  It should be located in an area where it would be able to detect the air quality around the Irish Cement plant and other areas as well.  I welcome the commitment that there will be a permanent EPA monitoring station in Limerick city, which currently has no station.</p></speech>

Currently, the EPA has 31 stations to try to give a read across the country, which is virtually impossible to do.  By doubling the number of stations, it will be able to give a far more accurate national read and it will be able look at locations in our cities that can best and accurately reflect what is going on in those cities.  The EPA will use a scientific formula in that regard.  It will be possible to monitor the output from all the plants in the mid-west catchment and, in the near future, to tabulate those against the reading in the two new stations and the three monitoring stations.  All of that information will be live.</p> <p>On the timeframe, I recently met board members of the EPA who outlined their proposals for upgrading the monitoring network.  I fully support these proposals and confirmed to them at that time that my Department will provide whatever funding is required.  The director general of the EPA, Ms Laura Burke, has since written to me with an estimate of the additional resources required by the agency - capital and current funding of &euro;5 million over five years, with five additional staff with specialist expertise in air quality monitoring and forecasting.  The extra resources will enable the EPA to provide extra support to local authorities in developing new capabilities in air quality monitoring and I very much welcome the proposal to expand the network and look forward to the EPA developing its capacity to meet the future air quality needs of Irish citizens.  The physical roll-out of the network is the easy part, and the EPA has been actively involved in that since my discussion with it, but the actual analysis, predictions and using that data will be the bigger challenge, which is why I have approved the additional staffing.</p> <p>On the timeline for the specific locations, very specialist equipment has to be ordered in.  The EPA is finalising its list of locations.  I have given it the go-ahead on the capital side and, from a financial point of view, there is no reason many of those stations cannot be rolled out this year but I do not know, from a logistical point of view, the timelines involved in providing power and providing network connections back.  The important thing is that once they are installed, they are live so that the public in Limerick and every other part of the country can see exactly what is happening at their particular station or a network of stations around that catchment.  I hope this can be done as quickly as possible and I will ask the EPA to come back to Senator O'Donnell with timelines on the roll out of the network, specifically the two proposed stations in County Limerick.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  He will see from the wording of my Commencement matter that I am asking him to examine options to deal with the large number of seagulls in the town of Balbriggan in north County Dublin and, indeed, in other large coastal urban areas in north County Dublin.  I am raising this issue as many residents in Balbriggan have raised this with me in the last number of months.  It is a very big problem in the town at present.  I have seen at first hand these aggressive birds attacking people.  Children and elderly people are particularly vulnerable to attack from seagulls.  Balbriggan has a population of approximately 26,000 people and many older people and children, in particular, have been attacked in recent months and years by the increase in seagulls in the town.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Traditionally, seagulls lived at sea and nested on cliffs.  Their food source was fish but as fish stocks have diminished over the years, they have moved inland to seek more non-traditional food sources.  For example, research established that in 1980 there were approximately 40 pairs of breeding seagulls in Dublin city but it is now estimated there are more than 20,000 breeding pairs in the city.  A similar study has not been conducted for north County Dublin but one can only assume that this abnormal increase has been replicated there.</p><p>There was a dump near Balbriggan called Balleally landfill, which closed in May 2012.  Seagulls had moved there from the sea seeking food and when the dump closed, they had to seek another non-traditional food source, which is why Balbriggan and other coastal towns in north County Dublin became the next hunting ground for them.  They used to scavenge at the dump but they have moved into the housing estates and businesses around Balbriggan and this is causing major problems.  This needs to be tackled urgently.  I would like the Minister of State to outline whether he has plans in this regard.  If not, will he set up some plans to deal with this because it is a big issue?</p><p>Scientists in the UK are studying the best way to deal with this and to discourage seagulls from nesting in urban areas.  They are developing lasers to deter them from nesting.  The lasers do not harm the seagulls; they frighten them and deter them from nesting.  They are forced to return to the coast and their traditional breeding and hunting grounds on the cliffs and so on.  Are there plans to use laser technology here?  Hessian sacks are given to householders and businesses in towns in Devon and Cornwall to put their rubbish in because seagulls cannot pick through the sacks.  The non-traditional food sources are diminishing in these towns and the patterns of breeding and feeding are changing for the seagulls.  Perhaps this measure could also be adopted.</p><p>Other measures have been taken such as seagull spikes and oiling of eggs.  I do not agree with them but if there are such plans, I would like the Minister of State to address them.  If something could be done about the invasion of seagulls in Balbriggan, I would appreciate it, as would the people of the town.</p></speech>

I have sympathy for the people affected.  We have a different problem in rural Ireland, particularly in the summer months, with hedge cutting on main roads.  We get a great deal of criticism for raising the issue.  However, this is also an important and serious issue, which is affecting families and children and it is a concern for people.</p> <p>I am aware from representations made to my Department of reports that problems have been encountered with seagulls on various housing estates in the Balbriggan area.  It is claimed that the seagulls, because of their numbers and habits, are giving rise to public health and safety issues in the area.  Many seagulls nest on domestic roofs and it has been reported that some parents do not let their children outdoors, especially during the summer, due to the nuisance caused by the number of seagulls and because of reported instances of gulls attacking people.  My Department  has also received letters from individuals, local schools, a residents' association and owners of business premises in the area detailing various problems with seagulls.</p> <p>Seagulls are protected under both Irish and EU law.  The population of seagulls in Ireland is not stable.  The breeding population of herring gulls, for example, has declined significantly over recent decades probably due to improvements in managing landfill sites as well as other factors.  Nonetheless, I accept that there are substantial numbers in some coastal towns and cities, including north County Dublin.  I understand that the residents in Balbriggan are looking for a solution that would require non-lethal methods such as removing nests and eggs and the installation of netting and other measures.  The granting of individual licences to residents to remove nest and eggs may not prove a feasible solution from a practical and efficiency perspective and it would be cumbersome for my Department to administer.</p> <p>We have powers under European Communities legislation to make a declaration, commonly known as the wild bird declaration, which allows the capturing and killing of some listed bird species such as magpies and crows in certain circumstances, for example, to prevent serious damage to livestock and crops and for public health reasons.  In the main, the declaration is used by landowners to protect livestock and crops and to protect ground nesting birds.  In recent years, the Department has reviewed the declaration annually before renewal on 1 May each year.  A major review is scheduled for 2018 and this will take account of all relevant factors, including perceived threats, distribution and population data available on the bird species.</p> <p>As part of this year&rsquo;s annual review of the declaration and taking account of issues identified in Balbriggan, I am willing to consider the addition of the seagull to the declaration.  As they stand, the regulations do not allow the removal of nests or eggs, as is hoped for by the residents, and any such activity would require an amendment to these regulations.  I am, however, prepared to examine making such an amendment and this is being actively looked at currently in my Department in the context of the 2017 declaration review.  While the annual declaration is generally renewed on 1 May every year, my intention is that the 2017 declaration will be completed earlier than this.</p> <p>The Minister met a number of public representatives from the area in recent weeks and conveyed to them the position which I have outlined here.  The House will understand that the role of my Department is one of conservation and protection of our flora and fauna and of habitats for wildlife.  Other than considering legislative change in the context of national and European nature laws, my Department, even if it had the resources to do so, would have no powers to actively become involved in any programme to reduce bird numbers on particular housing estates.  It is my understanding that programmes aimed at addressing seagull issues in UK coastal towns were led by the local councils, and the residents of Balbriggan have requested the assistance of Fingal County Council in addressing the seagull problem.</p></speech>

Seagull droppings contain ten times more bacteria than pollution caused by human waste and, therefore, this is an urgent health and safety issue.  One gentleman told me about his five year old grandson who was eating in his garden one summer afternoon and was attacked by a seagull and badly injured.  I appreciate the Minister of State's comments regarding the declaration and if can be speeded up, all the better.  I urge him to include Balbriggan and other coastal towns in north County Dublin.</p></speech>

I am glad to share time with him on International Women's Day.  People might laugh, but he has always supported women, as have my colleagues.</p> <p>I make reference to what Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said on radio today when he referred to the savage treatment of women and their children in mother and baby homes across the country.  He referred, in particular, to the Tuam mother and baby home and the appalling testimonies we have heard in the past few years.  I have been appalled and shocked by how the women were treated.  They were seized from their homes and dragged kicking and screaming to mother and baby homes where their children were neglected and died.  They lived with the stigma and shame for the rest of their lives.  They were not able to conduct their lives in the same manner as plenty of men who were pillars of the community and faced no consequences for their actions.  They were allowed to continue being pillars of the community.  We need to examine our treatment of the women concerned and their children.  It is not something that is in the past; they are still living among us in communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to show compassion to women who have gone through appalling atrocities, as well as to their children and grandchildren.  Many generations of people have suffered the consequences of these mother and baby homes.  We also make the connection to what is going on at present with the many women and children in direct provision, a matter which has not been addressed.  There is a dreadful lack of funding for women's refuges right across the country.  In my own constituency it is at an appalling level.  I woke up this morning to hear a mother and two children had lost their lives in Clondalkin while living in a women's refuge.  We need to find out if this refuge was overcrowded, causing the fire to spread quicker and causing these three unfortunate and beautiful people to lose their lives.  It is not good enough.  We did not treat women with respect in the past and we need to get our act together in the present.</p></speech>

Of those profits, &euro;853 million come from their online gambling outlets.  We have been talking about a gambling Bill in this House for some time.  I wonder how many children went without their dinner in order that Paddy Power could make &euro;1.5 billion, and how many households suffered in order that the Paddy Powers of this world could make such profits.  Gambling is the secret addiction that nobody knows about until all hell breaks loose.  A man came to me almost three years ago to tell me he had lost &euro;80,000 and was going home to tell his wife that day.  He used to wake up in the middle of the night and take out his iPhone in order to bet on ridiculous things.  We heard the story in the audiovisual room not so long ago about the postmaster who gambled &euro;10.9 million of the post office's money - not his own - and went to jail for it.</p> <p>While Paddy Power can make his profit, I know the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald are anxious to do something on this issue.  There are major problems with technology moving faster than legislation.  I ask the Leader to convey a request to the Minister that when we bring the gambling Bill into the House, it should be flexible enough to allow for ministerial orders to meet these challenges.  Gambling is destroying lives.  It was gambling of one sort or another that led to the collapse of the economy.  Can we please try to bring the gambling Bill in as quickly as possible?  It is absolutely disgusting to see this amount of money made in profits from gambling.</p></speech>

May they rest in peace.</p> <p>Sonas daoibh go l&eacute;ir ar L&aacute; Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan..  Happy International Women's Day to everybody here, including the men.  I congratulate all the women who participated in the recent elections in the North and all those who were elected.  From my own party, 11 women, or some 40% of successful candidates, were elected.  It is a great achievement and certainly a sign of progress.</p> <p>This is a time for us to reflect on what it means to be a woman in Ireland today.  This week, we have been reminded again of how women and their babies were treated by society, the State and religious institutions.  We would all like to think that discrimination against and marginalisation and alienation of women no longer exists.  We would like to think it is a thing of the past, that we all know better now, and that religious orders no longer have the power and control that they once had.  In saying that, I want to commend the goodness and kindness that was prevalent in many religious institutions such as hospitals and schools.  I experienced the kindness of some of those nuns in the Convent of Mercy in Belmullet, County Mayo.</p> <p>It is of grave concern to me that we as legislators are living and working through a period which, I have no doubt, will form the basis of tribunals and inquiries in the future.  This morning, I saw a young girl in her school uniform leaving for school from the hotel I was staying in last night.  In 20, 30 or 40 years' time, this girl may come back and ask us why she did not deserve a home and why she had to live in a hotel room.  She may ask us how she could have been expected to fulfil her true potential when she did not have a place to do her homework.  There may be many other questions.  She may ask why she was made to feel different, afraid and ashamed because she did not have a home like other girls and boys in the class.  I wonder what answers and legal terms we will come up with in the future to answer such questions.  The task will not fall to those whose economic policies wrecked the heart of our country, or to those who now refuse to put it right.  Are they not the people who should hang their heads in shame?</p> <p>Today, I also think of the hundreds of girls and boys who have been identified as being at risk and have not even been allocated a social worker.  When they ask why no one came to save them from neglect, abuse and fear, what will we say?  Last week, Safe Ireland told us that 5,000 requests for help have been turned away.  What will we tell those people?  Do my colleagues think we will get away with telling them we needed to pursue policies that create an ever increasing number of millionaires and billionaires, and therefore could not find the money to keep them safe?  Happy International Women's Day.</p></speech>

Women and girls with migrant backgrounds, refugee women, asylum seekers, women and girls with disabilities, lesbians, transgender and intersex women, Roma women and children, Muslims, black women, homeless women, elderly and young women - the list goes on.  There is hardly a group of women that is not on it.  Women and children with disabilities are on that list as well.  This is a massive issue.</p> <p>Anna Pel&aacute;ez, the chair of the women's committee of the European Disability Forum, is calling for the immediate ratification of the Council of Europe's Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, that is, the Istanbul convention.  That convention has implications for the convention on the rights of people with disabilities.  Dr. Edith Schratzberger-Vecsei, the president of the European Women's Lobby, addressed the issue today while marking International Women's Day.  She said we must break the silence around violence against women and girls and that we need to speak up.  She asked how much more evidence we need before decision makers will take action, and how many more women should be beaten, raped, killed, prostituted, or harassed before Europe will find it unacceptable.</p> <p>There was a Malta joint statement of 3 February this year which involved three key institutions - the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council Presidency.  They made a strong call for action to the member states, which includes little Ireland, asking them to ratify and fully implement the Istanbul convention.  Women with disabilities are two to five times more likely to be victims of violence than non-disabled women and are subject to sterilisation and abortions, often against their will.  There are 46 million women and girls with disabilities in Europe, representing 60% of the disabled population of Europe.  Some 34% of women with a health problem or disability experience physical or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The House must debate the Malta joint statement and the Istanbul convention.

Why is there still such a large pay gap between men and women for carrying out the same work?  The last real progress made was when Proinsias de Rossa introduced legislation on equal pay for equal work.  At that time, it was resisted by many in society.  Why did the Labour Party have to have its policy of gender quotas to ensure that women had an opportunity to run in elections?  That legislation was brought in during the last Government when we were in coalition with Fine Gael and it has worked to a degree.  We have seen many more women elected with very high quality and standards.  They should have been elected without gender quotas.  Why did we need to introduce that legislation in Ireland?  Why did my party have to fight for two decades for the X case legislation?  We got that legislation through with great difficulty during the last term in government.  Why did we have such a regressive amendment to the Constitution in 1983?  We are still fighting to repeal the eighth amendment, which was an amendment put down that did not trust women.  I am probably one of the few people in the House who fought and canvassed in that referendum campaign against the amendment.</p></speech>

I did not think he was old enough.  There are many "Whys" in relation to inequality and discrimination against women in the State and we must keep battling to change that.  The next major battle is to convince people about why the eighth amendment is so wrong.  I look forward to joining, hopefully, many colleagues in the House, to try to win a referendum on the eighth amendment.  For that, we must appeal to everybody.  We must be careful of our language in talking about repealing the eighth and be respectful to all sides.  I hope the referendum can be fought in the same spirit as the marriage equality referendum and that we can discuss facts, women's health and the need for people to be treated equally.</p></speech>

Following Senator Humphreys, I am very proud to have been a Member of the Oireachtas and part of the last Administration which brought in gender quotas.  It was very significant legislation and very important for women.  It was important to help them to break through that glass ceiling.</p> <p>The events of recent days and all the unfolding information in our media highlights the neglect of children in the past.  We are all horrified by that and cannot escape addressing it, remembering it, talking about it and acting to remediate it where we can.  On account of that, it also behoves us to ensure that we treasure, value and celebrate the children of today in an appropriate fashion.  We must compensate for and not repeat the ills of the past.  That is a great onus on all of us.  In that context, I address to the Leader the question of teenage discos for very young teenagers.  The Leader might ask why, but I was approached recently by a parent who spent a night by a child's bed not knowing until morning if that child would recover from an alcohol overdose at one of these teenage discos.  I am familiar on a number of fronts with the phenomenon of very young teenagers going to teenage discos.  The premises they go to may be licensed but no alcohol is served in the room reserved for the disco.  However, there is alcohol around it and an introduction to drugs around it.  There are also other issues and problems because the children do not have the necessary emotional maturity.  They are very young and they are being exploited by the money they pay to go in and in other ways.</p> <p>There should be identity cards and an age threshold.  People should not be fit to access these discos until they are 16.  They can have private things at family level or in schools.  This is a very serious matter for many parents.  I have met people with harrowing stories.  It would break one's heart to listen to them.  I note the trauma in the house after what the parent mentioned above described to me.  I ask the Leader to bring the relevant Minister to the House for a debate.  It is up to the Minister and the civil servants in the Department to come up with possible solutions.  One is identity cards and another is a minimum age for these events.  The phenomenon of very young kids going to these discos is shocking, serious and has awful implications.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss the chronic shortage and lack of GPs throughout the country.  I have been contacted by a number of people from different parts of the country who have told me stories of people moving into towns and being told that no GP was capable of taking them on.  They are all snowed under with work as things stand.  I know of a family in County Monaghan who moved to Carrickmacross and of two who moved to Monaghan town.  The families tramped around both towns trying to find a GP to take them on with no success.  The question is where these people are meant to go and what happens if one of their children or if a parent gets sick.  We cannot send them to accident and emergency departments as these are overcrowded as it is and we cannot send them to the doctor on call because that service is not set up properly for that purpose.  Without a properly functioning primary care service, we are in serious trouble.  Things have got to crisis point and it is time the Minister for Health came to the House to advise us and, indeed, the people of this country what he intends to do about the chronic shortage of GPs throughout the State.</p></speech>

That is the main story in our national newspaper today.  There are clearly many issues about An Post and the future.  We had some debate around the fringes of an amendment with the Minister yesterday but we need him to come back now.  Last week, we were told that possibly 80 rural post offices would close.  The CEO of An Post has rejected on the record an injection of &euro;56 million in cash as a result of the Kerr report.  He says it is not doable and that he cannot operate within that.  He claims the overall operation is losing a substantial amount of money and that it needs a bigger and more sustainable plan.  An Post itself has commissioned its own report from the McKinley Consulting Group which will report back to the board.  That is somewhat different from the Kerr report which was commissioned earlier.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We now hear that a survival operation must be put together.  An Post must be sustained.  However, this is all very different to the programme for Government, which I read this morning.  Page 48 sets out a new model for An Post.  There is a commitment to community hubs and a new banking system in An Post.  The Government committed to investigating the German <i>Sparkasse</i>model for the development of local banks in post offices, in addition to making them a hub for social welfare and motor tax services that would keep post offices in place in rural communities.  That was part of the Government's commitment to sustaining rural communities.  The programme for Government also referred to the establishment and further expansion of the post office network across the country.  Could the Leader arrange to have the Minister with responsibility for An Post come to the House?  All the post offices and communities around the country need to know what the Government policy is and what is the plan.  There is no better person than the Minister to come to the House.  It would be very helpful if the Leader could facilitate a debate in the Seanad on post offices.</p></speech>

A number of articles in today's newspapers are about how women are to the fore in terms of some of the top jobs.  An issue raised by my colleague, Deputy Madigan, in the D&aacute;il relates to the reference in the Constitution to a woman's place in the home and she is introducing legislation to try to get that changed.  It is 2017 and that is at odds with the reality and the many positive roles women play, and the fact that there are so many women both in this House and in the D&aacute;il as well.  I encourage all Members to support the change to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann when the legislation comes forward.</p></speech>

I understand that women staff and students are picketing NUIG today as part of an international women's strike in more than 50 countries and that issues concerning gender equality in NUIG are far from sorted and may in fact be deteriorating.  Despite lots of talk of change and new initiatives being announced at the university, it appears that the underlying issues that gave rise to a number of high profile court cases have not been adequately addressed and that things may in fact be getting worse.</p> <p>I understand that relations between senior management and the unions on resolving issues such as grading of staff, promotions, pay and working conditions have made very little progress and that the staff representatives are concerned by the lack of substantive action from the university.  Despite the appointment of a gender equality task force and a vice president for equality, the basic issues of institutional discrimination across all grades of staff remain unresolved and SIPTU reports an increasing number of women coming to the union for help.  SIPTU is now in dispute with NUIG on a number of issues, including the senior lecturer promotion scheme, which was the subject of the Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington, Equality Tribunal ruling, and which five other women are contesting before the courts.</p> <p>SIPTU did not co-operate with the gender equality task force set up by NUIG because of concerns over its independence and it has highlighted crucial flaws in the report.  It said at the time that it needed action not optics.  It is now two years since the Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington tribunal case.  It is my understanding that staff representatives believe that more than two years has been spent trying to engage with senior management in NUIG, which has frustrated efforts to seek proper resolution to issues and which fundamentally failed to acknowledge that this is a very serious issue that must be addressed properly.</p> <p>I would not be surprised if we were to see more cases of gender inequality in NUIG coming to the fore in the near future.  I will call on the president, Jim Browne, and his staff to engage in a more constructive way to ensure that his legacy is not one of having presided over widespread discrimination in a university that prides itself on research excellence in fundamental human rights.  A report was carried out by the HEA which was chaired by M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn from my home village.  I called for a debate previously on gender equality at third level.  It would be appropriate that when we are celebrating International Women's Day the Leader would give a commitment to have such a debate in the very near future.</p></speech>

I did hear the news item about the women who were killed and injured in Clondalkin, but there was an added horror when Senator Clifford-Lee indicated that it was a women's refuge.  I had not realised that at all.  It is a particularly shocking thing that women should flee from a violent environment and end up dead as a result of an electrical misadventure.  I just want to register my shock at that, and particularly on International Women's Day.  I cannot say they were women, because one adult and two children tragically died and another adult woman and child are critically ill in hospital.  That is a very sad start to International Women's Day.  I just wanted to register that, a Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

St. John's Hospital announced yesterday that it is closing 20 beds permanently on the ground floor.  My understanding is that discussions were ongoing between the hospital and the university hospitals group.  There appears to be a difference in the information being given by both sides.  I urge that both sides would re-engage in talks and that a mechanism would be found to ensure the 20 beds are opened.  If the closures are due to funding we must examine the matter.  People in Limerick and the mid-west know that one of our key problems in health care is the lack of bed capacity and it is not acceptable that 20 beds on the ground floor in St. John's Hospital are being closed.</p> <p>I already spoke to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who is inquiring into the matter.  We need people to talk to each other.  We must find out the precise circumstances.  We have been informed that 15 of the 20 beds are being closed because the hospital was unable to recruit nursing staff and now 20 beds are being closed permanently.  That is not acceptable.  I want the St. John's Hospital management and the HSE's university hospitals group to resume talks to find a solution which we can all work towards to ensure the 20 beds can be opened as quickly as possible.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is involved.  The people of Limerick deserve no less.</p></speech>

That is up to both of the individuals concerned but it would be a good thing to do.  I offer my condolences to those affected by the tragedy in Clondalkin.  Senator Humphreys mentioned that members of Dublin Fire Brigade were in Leinster House yesterday when I raised the break-up of the ambulance and emergency services.  I hope good news will emerge later today on the back of the intervention yesterday.</p> <p>I wish to raise the Donnybrook Magdalen laundry, given that it is International Women's Day.  The laundry, which is located in Dublin 4 in the capital city, is for sale for approximately &euro;3 million.  It would be a disgraceful shame were the sale to go ahead.  The State must intervene and buy the building, along with a donation from the Bon Secours order, which posted profits yesterday for last year of almost &euro;3 million and has accumulated profits over the last decade of just under &euro;100 million.  The Government must purchase the home in reparation.  On this day, let us dedicate that home to mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, show our history, how great we are and also the tragedies we have overcome, and the strength that is in mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, 51% of the population.  That project must be progressed.</p> <p>I ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to intervene and buy the property.  If we allow the development of apartments, homes and playgrounds on the site we will forget, and we cannot do that.  It would be like buying a slice of a concentration camp and allowing a development for happy families.  The families in the housing estate in Tuam are extremely uncomfortable with what is going on there and what they are living beside.  I press the Leader to ensure that women in this country are recognised.  We need a museum that tells our history.  We silently fought for our history and we made history in this country.  We must speak for those who still have no voice in this country.  I urge the Leader to bring my request to fruition.  We can never forget but we can learn.</p></speech>

I do not say the accommodation was at fault, but it raises queries about the condition of rented accommodation throughout the country.  Shortcuts are being taken because it is a landlord's market.  I recently spoke to a young person who had visited an apartment she wanted to rent only to find that the windows had been taped to keep out the draught and that it was in an appalling condition.  It is great for some to take shortcuts, but it puts the lives of others at risk.  At a time when there is a shortage of accommodation, landlords, some of whom think their only role is to collect rent, have a role to ensure their accommodation is safe and that all regulations are complied with and to ensure nobody residing in it will be at risk at any time.  It is time all local authorities and State agencies enforced the rules and regulations to make sure there is no deviation from them.  It is important that this issue be highlighted and that we move on it.</p></speech>

It is defined as an "inhuman act committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them".  I raise the issue of Israel because this is Israeli Apartheid Week.  Events are being held throughout Ireland this week.  There will be a demonstration outside Leinster House tomorrow between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and I urge Members of all parties to come and support it.  The apartheid laws in Israel are shocking, but Members do not have to take my word for it as others representing all parties have visited Israel and witnessed it at first hand, including Senators Burke and Terry Leyden.  If a Palestinian is married to an Israeli citizen, he or she is not allowed to live in the state.  There are laws on freedom of movement.  He or she does not have the right to vote or to join a political party.  We are clear that it is an apartheid state.  I am surprised that Ireland has bought &euro;14.7 million worth of arms and military components from Israel in the past decade, which is absolutely shocking.  I have called a number of times for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House for a debate on Israel.  It is appropriate that he would do so as soon as possible.  This trade in arms happened during the same period in which 9,000 Palestinians, including 2,060 children, were murdered.  For military items exported from Israel, Palestinians would have been used as human test subjects to enable such weapons to be marketed as "battle proven".  Military components exported to Israel will be used to kill and main more Palestinians and entrench the decades long military occupation.  The Government still refuses to recognise the state of Palestine.  Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have tabled a motion which we have signed.  It is time for the Government to address the fact that, unfortunately, in practice, we are supporting an apartheid state, which is absolutely wrong.  We need to support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement.  I would love to hear Fine Gael voices facing up to their responsibilities.</p></speech>

We have the Kerr report, the business development group and the post office network renewal group, yet the only news we have heard is that there is a proposal to shut down 80 post offices, which would have a particularly negative impact on rural Ireland.  I am concerned that there is a parallel universe and that An Post is using this opportunity to implement a policy it has in place to close post offices.  It needs to be called on immediately to cease its policy of unilaterally withdrawing postal and other services from rural communities where services are provided through an agency agreement and the contractor dies or becomes otherwise incapacitated.  The postmistress in Kilmovee Post Office in County Mayo died last week.  May she rest in peace.  I offer my condolences to her family.  An Post immediately shut down the post office because it had been operated on an agency basis and the postmistress had been the signatory to the contract.  Agency operators do not cost An Post anything.  For the past 12 years the Kilmovee community has provided a venue in the community centre and spent &euro;60,000 in providing the service.  It paid for the person working there and provided the venue.  It saw fit to invest its resources in providing the service in order that pensioners, some of whom live within walking distance, could walk up the road, but they will now be required to go to another post office.  Transport is an issue.  An Post is having difficulty in contemplating readvertising the agency in order that the community can make a case for the retention of the post office.  An Post is a State company.  I understand it has to examine its books, but it also performs a social function.  We need a proper debate on this function and how the company might be subsidised.  In this case, the community is subsidising the service.  Local people deserve an opportunity to retain their post office.  I call on the Minister to come to the House to outline what is happening with the post office network, in Kilmovee in particular, and whether some progress has been made.  We all appreciate the value of the post office network to which more than lip service should be paid.</p></speech>

Before I do, however, I will express my deepest sympathy to the families and friends of the victims of the tragic fire in Clondalkin.  It is a community that I was proud to get to know as mayor of South Dublin County Council.  Knowing that community, it will rally around the victims' families and friends.</p> <p>I celebrate, recognise and wish everyone a happy International Women's Day, which has been mentioned extensively.  The CEDAW's report recognised a number of positive developments in the State in recent times, for example, the Gender Recognition Act 2015 and the ratification of a number of international treaties on the rights of children, the domestic workers' convention and the Istanbul convention.  However, the UN mentioned a number of principal areas of concern and made recommendations.</p> <p>The committee regretted the discriminatory provision contained in Article 41.2 of the Constitution, which perpetuates traditional, stereotypical views of the social roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family.  It reads: "In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved."  The committee urged an amendment to that article as well as a repeal of the eighth amendment.  On this day, I send my solidarity to all women who are out in numbers in opposition to the eighth amendment.</p> <p>The report mentioned the impact of austerity measures on NGOs.  Senator Conway-Walsh and I referred to this matter in our support for women's refuges during the House's recent debate on domestic violence.</p> <p>I welcome the UN's call for the development and implementation of an appropriate rights-based health care protocol for intersex children that ensures that children and their parents are properly informed of all options to the greatest extent possible when they make decisions on medical interventions.</p> <p>It is important that we again invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to the House.  A debate on the positives and negatives outlined in the UN's report would be important.  I hope that the T&aacute;naiste can join us for that debate.

It is important that we recognise and pay tribute to women.  It is a pity that we do not have the first female President of the US.  That would have shattered a glass ceiling.  We saw what Presidents Robinson and McAleese did in Ireland.  We have seen what many female Ministers can do.  I hope that we will have a female Head of Government, Leader of the House or Cathaoirleach at some stage.  Actually, women have been the Cathaoirleach and the Leader, namely, Ms Tras Honan and Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, respectively.  I am not sure as to whether Ms Gemma Hussey was Leader, but I will stand corrected.</p><p>Thirteen Senators raised the issue of International Women's Day.  A great amount of work has been done, and much remains to be done, in attaining full equality.  It is important that we praise Senators from all political parties for their work in the pursuit of gender equality and many other issues across the gender divide.  It is an objective of everyone in politics to advance women's positions in leadership roles.  Senator Byrne mentioned a report on business, in which field there is much to be done.</p><p>It is important to recognise that gender balance is not just about benefitting women, but the benefits that they can bring to society as a whole.  We should work to achieve further progress for women in respect of the many issues that have been raised.  I will revert to those.</p><p>Senator Mark Daly raised the issue of the commission on inquiry into the treatment of Grace.  As I told some of the group leaders this morning, the intention is for that motion to be before the House tomorrow afternoon.  It was switched out of today's Order Paper.  It is important that we take the issue of Grace as a priority.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, if there is a need to expand the inquiry, then let us do that.  It is covered in the motion.  The Government is committed to establishing the commission.  We must find answers and justice and there must be responsibility and accountability for what happened.  We will debate the motion tomorrow.</p><p>Also on tomorrow's Order Paper will be statements on matters regarding the commission of investigation into what happened in the former mother and baby home in Tuam.  Senators will have the opportunity to speak on both issues.</p><p>Senator Mark Daly also mentioned the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016.  There is a divergence of views on that Bill in terms of the import of what it is trying to achieve, but we all accept that those who are responsible must be held to account.</p><p>I join Senator Clifford-Lee on the issue of domestic violence.  Senator Conway-Walsh also raised that issue.  The T&aacute;naiste has been proactive on the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016.  This links to Senator Dolan's point.  I hope that those Bills will be ratified and passed by the Oireachtas by this summer, allowing for the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence to be signed into law in 2018.  That is the T&aacute;naiste's intent.</p><p>Listening to Senator Conway-Walsh, one sometimes feels that the Government does nothing at all.  However, it is worth noting that the T&aacute;naiste has undertaken a strong campaign against domestic violence and published two Bills, funding for domestic violence services was increased in the budget and &euro;200,000 has been given from the Dormant Accounts Fund to localise the campaign.  In the city of Cork where I live, there are plans to build a new Edel House, which we would all welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure the Senator will join me in welcoming its construction, as will Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.

Craughwell referred to Paddy Power, Betfair and the gambling Bill.  I join him in calling for the introduction of legislation on online gambling, in particular.  He is correct that gambling is a secret addiction which has shattered and ruined many lives.  We must tackle the issue collectively rather than creating silos.  It is frightening to note that profits of &euro;1.5 billion have been recorded in the gambling industry.  We must ensure the gambling Bill will be proactive and not allow certain lacunae to remain.  This matter was discussed for a long time under a previous Government when I was a member of the committee with responsibility for sport and tourism.  It is important to have a debate and legislation on it.</p> <p>I answered Senator John Dolan's question on the signing of the 2018 declaration.  He is correct on the issue on which I will be pleased to have a debate because it is important that we work together on the topic of international migrants.</p> <p>Senators Kevin Humphreys and M&aacute;ire Devine raised the issue of fire service call-outs.  It was also highlighted yesterday and this morning.  I join Senator Kevin Humphreys in appealing to both sides to engage in talks.  A protest was held outside Dublin City Hall on Monday and the matter was discussed in the House yesterday and today.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides a great service for the State and the city of Dublin and saves many lives.  Its members are professional and dedicated.  Talks are necessary on whether the service should be moved to Tallaght or retained in two locations.  Let us have a discussion on what will best serve the needs of the public. </p></speech>

I know that the Senator has been proactive in his home area and the House on this matter.  I was involved in a sports organisation which ran teenage discos.  They were well policed by volunteers and no alcohol was consumed.  However, it seems the phenomenon of pre-drinking has percolated down to under-age persons.  If that is the case, we should have an alternative to teenage discos.  Senator Joe O'Reilly also referred to identification cards and the minimum age.  There is merit in the matters he raised in that regard. </p> <p>Senator Robbie Gallagher referred to the shortage of general practitioners and the importance of primary care services.  There is a shortage of doctors and we are in a competitive international market.  The Minister for Health and relevant organisations are in talks on the GP contract.  At one level, despite recent changes, rural practices are no longer viewed as viable or attractive.  We must incentivise doctors and consider other ways of addressing the problem, which returns us to the issue of the post office.  Rural areas need primary care services and post offices. </p> <p>Senators Victor Boyhan and Michelle Mulherin referred to the post office network and the report that emerged yesterday, about which Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor spoke yesterday.  The Government is committed to working with An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union to reinvigorate the postal service.  My information is that the programme for Government has not changed.  As Senator Victor Boyhan will be aware, Governments cannot close post offices as such matters are the responsibility of An Post.  Yesterday the House debated legislation dealing with the mechanism for capping the price of postal stamps.  An Post is losing money.  As part of the reinvigoration and revitalisation of rural areas, facilities and services must be provided for people who live in them.  We cannot shut down the country at the M50 or at the edge of Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  We must ensure vibrant services for people outside these hubs.  The report Mr. Bobby Kerr submitted to An Post in December 2015 is being considered by the company which has rejected the suggestion it is about to close post offices.  The Government is committed to acting on the recommendations made in the report of the post office network business development group.  Senators Victor Boyhan and Michelle Mulherin referred to the requirement to maintain a post office network in rural areas.  I hope we will not see what is set out in the report come to pass.</p> <p>I will be happy to have a debate on the legislation to which Senator Maria Byrne referred.  On International Women's Day, it is important to have a debate on the role of women.  The Constitutional Convention, of which I was a member, discussed the matter.  As Senator Diarmuid Wilson noted, gender quotas did not apply in the Seanad elections and fine women were elected on their own merit.  I congratulate and thank them for the role they play.  It is important to note that women leaders and Members of this House are doing an extraordinary job.  Senator Diarmuid Wilson referred to gender quotas.  To be fair, Senator Ivana Bacik is recognised as a representative of the Labour Party.</p></speech>

I return to my point that it is an awful pity that we do not have President Clinton here on International Women's Day.  What a signal that would have sent to the young women in the Visitors Gallery in aspiring to be the best.  I will not comment further on that issue.</p> <p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh again raised an issue related to the National University of Ireland Galway.  It is primarily a matter for the university.  In the context of the debate on gender equality in third level education and persons who are promoted or appointed or the roles of women and minorities, I will be happy to have such a debate in the House.  It is a worthwhile issue to discuss and I support the Senator's call for such a debate. </p> <p>A number of Senators referred to the issue of repealing the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  I am not sure if Senators followed the broadcasts of the proceedings of the Citizens' Assembly or read newspaper reports on last weekend's meeting of the assembly, but it was a fine example of people engaging in the democratic process.  I thank everyone who participated last Saturday and Sunday, whatever his or her views, and the members of the assembly who are deliberating on a very important issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I challenge those who criticise the Taoiseach for establishing the Citizens' Assembly to look at the work that has been done, the papers that have been presented and the questions asked and answers given last weekend.  They certainly underscored the importance of and the underlying need for the Citizens' Assembly.  It is important to state also that there is not universal support among men or women for the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I hope that when the Citizens' Assembly makes its presentation to the Government and the Oireachtas, we will have a very open debate in this House.  As the person who chaired the hearings over six days in this Chamber and a number of days at the committee on the protection of life during pregnancy legislation, I can say this is a very divisive issue.  For every person who is against there is another who is for.  We, therefore, need to tread carefully in how we speak and act whatever our viewpoint is on the issue.  Our language and the words we use are important.  On a personal level, I hope we will put the issue to the people for their consideration and a decision on it in a referendum.  It has been too long since the debate last took place in the public domain in the context of a referendum campaign.  I look forward to that happening.</p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of beds in St. John's Hospital, a matter raised yesterday on the Order of Business when my information was that some of the beds had been closed temporarily.  As far as I know, there are discussions under way between the HSE and the two hospitals.  I hope the beds will be opened.  I made the point yesterday and make it again today that there is a need to increase bed capacity in hospitals.  I hope that will be done. </p><p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine referred to the Magdalen laundry site in Donnybrook.  I am not familiar with it in the context of its proposed development, but I do share the Senator's view and agree with her about having a museum or an interpretative centre as testimony to the role women have played in Irish society.  I would be very happy to support her in that regard and work with her to see it being progressed.  It is something we should have.  I have been in a number of presidential libraries in America and think we need something like them in this country.  I am not sure about the site, but I would be happy to have a discussion with the Senator on the issue.  She is right that there is a need for a museum - I think that is the word she used - although an interpretative centre might be better. </p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of the condition of apartments.  I join him in saying there is a need to be more proactive in how we monitor and inspect living conditions in some apartments.  He referenced landlords' responsibility, but tenants also have a responsibility.  Some of the conditions I have seen recently are appalling.  One would not be happy to see anyone living in such conditions.</p><p>Senator Paul Gavan raised the issue of apartheid in Palestine.  He will be pleased to hear I met the Palestinian ambassador last week when I had a very good discussion with him.  The Senator knows what my views are on Palestine, from which I have never demurred and I do not see any reason to change my opinion today.  I will be happy to have the issue debated in the House.  I am not hiding in any way my views on Palestine and Israel, as the Senator knows well.  There is a need for a debate on the issue and recognition by the United Nations and world leaders of the state of Palestine.</p><p>Senator Fintan Warfield mentioned the UN committee's report.  I will be happy to invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss it.</p></speech>

Rud an-dearfach &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; anseo i rith Sheachtain na Gaeilge.  I commend the Minister of State and the Department on their strong commitment to the national language and their support for Seachtain na Gaeilge.  It is really important that we see funding, which has been increased in key areas, to support our Irish language over recent years.  In particular, the announcement of a grant of just more than &euro;500,000 for a common curriculum for Irish to be used in our third level institutions is extremely positive.</p><p>Is f&eacute;ile n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Seachtain na Gaeilge.

N&iacute; neart go chur le ch&eacute;ile.</p><p>A number of weeks ago in this House we spoke about the Irish language and its future.  Seachtain na Gaeilge is very much an opportunity for all of us to celebrate and to reflect on our national language.  Obviously we are very aware that we have challenges and it is difficult that many of us are no longer l&iacute;ofa as Gaeilge but the Department are currently in the process of implementing the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language.  It is really important that this will allow Irish to be a live language and to become more visible in our society, particularly as a spoken language but also in areas such as signage, literature and the arts.  </p><p>T&aacute; an Gaeilge fite fuaite in&aacute;r stair agus in&aacute;r saolta.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo le feice&aacute;il an bliain seo caite le linn tr&eacute;imhse com&oacute;raidh &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca.

Cuireadh cr&iacute;och freisin le hIonad Cult&uacute;rtha an Phiarsaigh i Ros Muc, Conamara.  Tugann an t-ionad seo aitheantas do Ph&aacute;draig Mac Piarais agus don tionchar a bh&iacute; aige ar an nGaeilge.  </p><p>T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh daoine &oacute; chuile aoisghr&uacute;pa ag glacadh p&aacute;irt in &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; i rith Sheachtain na Gaeilge agus go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh daoine &oacute;ga ag glacadh p&aacute;irt.

Timpeall na t&iacute;re, beidh imeachta&iacute; ar si&uacute;l &oacute; Chontae Ciarra&iacute; go Contae Ros Comain go Contae Dh&uacute;n na nGall agus is &eacute; an aidhm at&aacute; ag na himeachta&iacute; seo n&aacute; suim a spreagadh sa Ghaeilge do dhaoine nach raibh suim acu riamh agus chun l&iacute;on na cainte&oacute;ir&iacute; a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; de r&eacute;ir na strait&eacute;is don Ghaeilge.

There is a very engaging programme of events which has something for everybody.  It is very important that we celebrate, get involved and speak our national language.  It very much gives Irish people, not just at home but right across the world, a sense of national pride.  It is very much an opportunity for these people, who have not used Irish since school, to re-engage and to get involved with the many events taking place in every corner of the country.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire St&aacute;it as ucht bheith linn inniu.</p></speech>

Tosna&iacute;onn an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n anseo san Oireachtas agus go h&aacute;irithe leis an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.

There is a real need for a change of attitude around here if that is the case.  Admha&iacute;mid &eacute;.  </p><p>Bh&iacute; tr&aacute;th ann ina raibh s&eacute; riachtanach Gaeilge a bheith ag duine chun post a fh&aacute;il sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.

This country experienced an incredible economic recession, which started in 2008.  In conjunction with that, tourist numbers dropped.  Unfortunately, a number of punitive taxes and measures had to be introduced because we were part of the troika programme.  The previous Government came into office in 2011 and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at the time.  He initiated a number of initiatives that were enormously successful.  Everyone will remember The Gathering, an initiative back in 2012.  It was the Irish tourism fight back at that time.  It brought together all our citizens, nationally and internationally.  It engaged and involved them in a project where they could have fun while at the same time help this country get back on its feet, specifically in the area of tourism.  Hundreds of thousands of people who had Irish decent and Irish heritage came from abroad, spent time in Ireland, had a good time and helped us to kick-start our tourism economy.  It was modelled on a similar gathering called the Homecoming that operated very successfully in Scotland.  I think the Homecoming in Scotland is repeated every five years because it is seen as an enormously successful endeavour around which people can plan their trips back to their native land.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he and his officials could look at running another The Gathering in a couple of years' time.</p><p>That was coupled with some very important budgetary measures, specifically the 9% VAT rate.  The 9% VAT rate was a godsend to people in the hospitality, restaurant and hotel industries and in other areas associated with tourism in terms of giving them a bit of financial assistance and the opportunity to make their prices competitive and attractive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It did work.  It worked very successfully, to such a degree that since the 9% VAT rate was introduced it has been retained in every budget subsequently.  I will refer later to what I believe should happen to the 9% VAT rate.</p><p>Another very important initiative which was introduced approximately three budgets ago was the elimination of the travel tax.  Mr. Michael O'Leary, a business pioneer in this country, lobbied for a number of years to have the travel tax abolished.  He said that if that happened, he would commit to bringing 1 million extra passengers to this country the following year.  At the time, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, entered a gentleman's agreement with him.  He said he could see the logic in his argument and that he would eliminate the travel tax, but that Mr. O'Leary must keep his side of the bargain.  Not alone did he bring in an extra million people the following year, he brought 1.6 million, an extra 600,000 above and beyond what was promised.  The travel tax, the 9% VAT rate and The Gathering were very important incremental steps in the right direction to rebuild the tourism sector and we are beginning to enjoy the fruits of that today.</p><p>The marketing of Ireland as a tourism product internationally was never at the level it should have reached.  One saw the shamrock advertisements in certain states in America encouraging people to come to Ireland, but there was nothing real or tangible.  That changed when the concept of the Wild Atlantic Way was developed by the stakeholders and the Government.  The Wild Atlantic Way competes with the Camino and other tourism attractions in the world and it can hold its head high in terms of success.  We are only seeing the start of the success of the Wild Atlantic Way.  Similarly, as a country we are trying to develop a heritage trail in the east, which has significant potential.  The future of tourism is in a far healthier position than it was but we still have a lot of work to do.  Many towns and villages, in particular in rural areas, have natural beauty but do not have people visiting them to the extent that should happen.  Even in County Clare, where the Cliffs of Moher had 1.4 million visitors in 2016 and which one would expect to be at the pinnacle in terms of tourism, there are still towns that do not get the type of kick-back they should get from tourism.  People are running restaurants, small guest houses and hotels in such towns that still need assistance.  I call on the Minister to recommend to the Minister for Finance in next year's budget that the 9% VAT rate should be a permanent fixture for tourism.</p><p>I note with some disappointment that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has decided to weigh in on this argument.  I fully accept that working conditions in the hospitality industry sometimes fall short of the standards we expect and I salute the work of congress in fighting to ensure standards are developed, but I believe it is the role of Government to set taxation and if there is a shortfall of some hundred million euro it is the responsibility of the Government to find ways to make up that shortfall.  However, I do not agree with the removal of an incentive that is needed for what I would describe as a developing industry.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for the removal of the 9% VAT rate in the city of Dublin.  There is no doubt the hotel and hospitality sector in Dublin is booming, but that is not reflected in many parts of the country.  There may very well be precedent for a VAT rate of a different level in Dublin city, which would make up the vast majority of the &euro;640 million congress maintains has been lost to the taxpayer.</p><p>I also encourage the Minister to recommend to his Cabinet colleagues that there should be a tax incentive scheme to encourage entrepreneurs who have good ideas for the interpretation of the landscape and history of this country, whether it be through audiovisual displays in museums or in various other ways so as to offer a product that would be weather resistant, which this country needs.  Incentives should be provided for tourism entrepreneurs who have a good idea, and the capability to make it happen, that would attract people to this country and would give a better offering to those who decide to come.  The Government should act in partnership and help such people.</p><p>I urge the Minister to provide further incentives for airlines to fly more people to this country as part of the transport side of his portfolio.  We have seen what Ryanair has done and I am sure other airlines would like to establish routes into this country from areas that are not currently serviced.  The airport authorities do a reasonably good job in terms of providing a suite of packages to airlines to open up new routes, but perhaps there is something more we could do in that regard.</p><p>Overall, it is important that tourism is on the agenda of this Parliament, certainly within the Seanad.  It is an area in which there is significant potential for further growth.  I salute the Minister and his predecessors for their ten-year strategy.  It is important that we have a focused strategy and perhaps we might even make the targets a little more ambitious.  We do not have oil rigs, mines or gold in this country but we have natural beauty.  In my county we have the Cliffs of Moher and the Burren and there is beautiful scenery and fantastic history in many other counties.  That is what we need to develop.  They are our raw materials and natural resources.  I commend the Minister on coming to the House for the debate.  It shows the respect he has always had for Seanad &Eacute;ireann as a former Member.  I sincerely hope the discussion we have today will be a focused one and will inform the Minister's thinking as he prepares his plans for tourism in this country.</p></speech>

He is no stranger, but it is good to see him here.  One can judge a man by the fact that he never forgets his roots and I commend him in that regard.</p><p>Part of the reason for tabling the motion relates to Brexit.  Any hotelier or person running a bed and breakfast to whom one speaks can point to a slight dip in tourism numbers from the UK coming to this country.  That is caused by a number of factors that include uncertainty and the depreciation in sterling <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the euro.  The tourism sector is under pressure and could come increasingly under pressure.  The 9% VAT rate was originally introduced against the backdrop of the worst combination of economic factors in this country.  Currently, due to uncertainty in terms of the future, Brexit and sterling, there is a need to ensure the tourism industry is competitive.  The 9% VAT rate should have been passed on the consumer but that is not happening universally.  Even though the State has provided a lift to the tourism sector, it has not been reciprocated in all cases by tourism providers.  In most cases it has, but the Minister should examine whether the benefit has been passed on in terms of the VAT rate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As the Minister is probably aware, when someone goes into a restaurant, hotel or a bed and breakfast accommodation, they are paying a gross figure.  VAT has to be paid out of that figure.  If that VAT rate had been at 13.5% or 23% and it suddenly came down to 9%, that would make a significant difference to the net take home amount of the tourism service provider.  Rates were very depressed when the 9% rate came in.  However, as anyone who is staying in Dublin or around the country will know, rates are going up.  They are not going up consistently, but in certain hotels and restaurants, particularly the hotel sector, there have been astronomical increases in rates charged.  We live in a market economy.  However, there would be no harm in setting up a review mechanism to see how the 9% rate has worked and how it is being passed on.  We should be doing due diligence to make certain that it has worked well, as I believe it has.   We must make certain that retaining the 9% rate ensures that we have a vibrant tourism sector.  </p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to the fact that we do not have oil.  Our natural resource is slightly intangible.  We have a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  We are very, very good at tourism.  When people come to Ireland, they want to come back.  This goodwill is an intangible asset, but it is an extremely important one.  With that come jobs in hotels and restaurants, and spin-offs to all the amenities in the area.  However, while the 9% rate will allow the tourism sector continue to be competitive there cannot be exploitation by the tourism sector in what they charge consumers, both Irish visitors and people from overseas.</p><p>Can I ask the Minister to factor in forecasts-----</p></speech>

I want to support the 9% rate and I want to ensure that any competitiveness is passed back to the consumer, both the Irish person and the visitor.  I want to ensure consumers are not being exploited.  I think that is very clear.  It is a normal, basic tenet.  I want to thank Senator Humphreys for enabling me to articulate my point even further.</p> <p>The issue of small rural villages is part of this motion.  There are many rural villages in Limerick.  Anyone who has done the Seanad campaign and has travelled the length and breadth of Ireland cannot but say that we have a beautiful country.  People are not aware of many areas.  One sees the breadth of beauty in small rural villages as one goes through Ireland.  We have to ensure that when people fly into Dublin they come down the country.  In Shannon visitors are encouraged to go to Limerick and Clare, where there are very scenic views.  We should look at imaginative ways to give support to rural villages to enable them to further enhance the tourism offers they have in place for people.  </p> <p>I am very supportive of the motion.  As with anything, we must ensure that a product is giving value for money to the taxpayer whose taxes have been used on this product.  At the same time, we must ensure that we have a viable tourism industry which employs a huge number of people.  In Limerick we have the amenities of Shannon Airport, St. John's Castle, Foynes and many others.  We need a robust tourism sector, and must make certain that it remains competitive by giving it assistance if necessary.  However, that is on the condition that we do not see exploitation of that VAT rate in terms of charging exorbitant rates to consumers, be they domestic or foreign.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the motion.</p> <p>The Minister must be glad to have an opportunity to discuss a good news item like tourism.  It is a rest from his travails with some of the more difficult elements of his brief.  </p> <p>Although we have a lot to be thankful for in tourism, the Minister will know that we cannot for one moment become complacent or relax.  This is particularly so in the context of major global changes such as the Trump presidency in America and, more immediately for us, the potential consequences of Brexit on tourism income from the UK and Northern Ireland, which is such an important part of our market, as the Minister will know.</p> <p>The statistics are good.  I am sure the Minister has them to hand.  It should be noted that we had over 8 million tourists in 2015.  The visitor spend was in excess of &euro;6 billion, which is a growth of 16% on the previous year.  All the figures stack up.  Of hoteliers, 84% reported an increase in bookings last year, while 82% reported increased profitability and 39% said they had employed more full-time staff than in the previous year.  These are all very welcome statistics.  I am aware as anybody else of the lies and the damn lies and the statistics but, being from County Kerry, I have seen this myself on the ground .  I am in constant contact with people in the hospitality sector, and they are nearly all singing off the same hymn sheet.  </p> <p>People like to hide their light under a bushel sometimes.  There is a famous story about a lady who kept a guest house in a prominent tourist town in Kerry.  A Bord F&aacute;ilte inspector called to her one day to see how her season went.  She told him it was a disaster.  He found that quite shocking, as Bord F&aacute;ilte inspectors had done a few tours during the season and every time they visited the guest house it had a "Full" sign outside the door.  The lady agreed that might be true, but said the guest house had turned away far more visitors the previous year.  A little anecdote to tell the House that statistics can be hidden at times.  </p> <p>Of guest houses, 68% reported an increase in visitors, as did 57% of the bed and breakfast accommodation operators.  The bed and breakfast accommodation sector will have to be looked at, particularly in the context of Airbnb, which I will come to in a moment.  </p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh addressed developments such as The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way, the Ancient East, which have all been very successful.  The Gathering was conceived by the outgoing Brian Cowen administration, although it was delivered by the Fine Gael-led Government.  </p> <p>It might be time now for the Minister to publish a new overarching tourism policy document to reassure the industry that we have a strategy in place for dealing with Brexit.  UK and Northern Ireland visitors account for 41% of our total overseas visitor numbers, which is colossal.  The number of visitors from Britain has increased by 12% since 2012.  Everybody in the business knows that the British tourist is one of the most welcome tourists in any corner of this country because they are great spenders and they are very good people to deal with.  There is never any problem with British tourists in my neck of the woods.  We would hate to see any significant drop in intake there, either in the main season or in the off-season for angling tourism and so on.  Hopefully the Minister will be in a position to come in with some specific outline for dealing with Brexit.  </p> <p>The election of President Trump is a worry.  He is talking about a wall between America and Mexico.  This man is building a wall around America.  He will not want anyone coming in, and nor will he want anyone coming out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is quite likely that that man could impose a tax on people holidaying outside America.  He will want them all to go to Palm Springs, Lake Tahoe or somewhere like that.  That is also a worry.<br/><br/>In that context, it must be noted that the Tourism Ireland and Bord F&aacute;ilte budget was cut by &euro;25 million since 2012.  That is 17%, which is quite significant.  I would also like to alert the Minister to the great potential in the Asia-Pacific region.  This is one of the big growth areas that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has identified.  It is predicted that it could increase in the order of 6% per annum over the next ten years.  The beauty of these tourists is that because they come such a long way, they will stay longer, spend more, and they tend to see more of the country as well.  They do not all just come to Dublin and stay there.  They move around.  That type of tourism is very welcome because, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell as said, we would like to see a tourism boost for smaller villages and local regions.  So many of our tourists come to Dublin, skip down to Kilkenny and most of them come on to Kerry after that.  Why would they not?  Many never see any other part of the country, which brings me on to another concern, which is about the poor spread and regional disparity.<br/><br/>These numbers are off the top of my head.  Some 40% of tourists will stay in Dublin.  The next best is my own region in the south west which gets 17%.  After that, I think the west gets perhaps 13%.  There are regions like the midlands and, tragically, the north west, which is one of the most beautiful parts of the country, where it is around 6%.  I cannot for the life of my understand that.  I know there is a long distance, but Kerry is no farther from Dublin than parts of Donegal, so this disparity is a worry.  There is a big treasure out there.  If there was a better spread in tourist destinations, it would be better for the economy overall.<br/><br/>I would also like to note the increase in the number of German tourists, especially outside Dublin, in recent years.  They are going for the adventure-type holiday, with self-catering and such like.  That is something we will try to grow as well.<br/><br/>I have addressed the skills shortage here several times.  We are very aware of it in Kerry.  We are 6,500 chefs short of a quota.  We have very few kitchen training facilities.  I was delighted to welcome an initiative, as I am sure the Minister was, by the Gleneagle hotels group with the Institute of Technology, Tralee, to provide new university-level catering hospitality education, leading to a degree.  It will be a big boost and it will also be good for the economy of the county.<br/><br/>I support the retention of the 9% VAT rate.  I am not going to go into details about it.  I think it is a good idea.  Airbnb is presenting a problem.  It is a welcome development overall, but it is going to have to be regulated in some way sooner or later.  I will finish up with a shocking point.  Somebody asked me to try to get him a room.  It was a twin room for 18 March, the day of the rugby international after St. Patrick's Day.  All hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and guest houses anywhere close to Dublin city are booked.  The best I could get him was a room in a house in Summerhill in Dublin.  It was &euro;230 for two guys for one night in a twin room in Summerhill, which is not exactly Dublin 4, though I am not casting any aspersions on Summerhill.  That is the reality.  The hotels are really socking it on significantly when they get the opportunity, which is another day's work.<br/><br/>The best thing about tourism in Ireland is not the statistics but the people, our welcome, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  As long as we have that and our culture, heritage, beauty and beautiful scenery, we have what we need.  As the Senator said, anyone who went on the Seanad trail - except perhaps the Minister, who does not do that, and used to canvass from a <i>chaise longue</i>in Dublin 4 or something - has to hit the road and go all over the country, so we know the beauty that is in even the most isolated, unexpected places, and that is really what it is all about.</p></speech>

If one looks at the motion itself, it is broken down into six paragraphs.  We talked about recognising the economic importance of tourism.  I have no difficulty with that.  We are recognising the significant achievements in increasing the tourism numbers into Ireland given the difficulties.  I have no difficulty with that.  It goes on.</p> <p>I have a problem with the sixth point, which "calls on the Government to retain the 9% VAT rate on a multi-annual basis which will allow and encourage the tourism industry to plan ambitiously for the future".  Let us look at the history of when this was introduced.  Tourism was on the ground and there were problems.  I do not know if anyone tuned in, but I want to single out a few issues.  I note the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has sent a letter to all Senators and indeed, I think, Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann too.  It set out some reasons it would have concerns about the 9% rate.</p> <p>There was a programme this week on RTE radio which highlighted some serious issues of abuse of people and workers in the hospitality sector, who have no contract hours and are below the minimum wage.  This is widespread.  I have come across it myself in hotels in south County Dublin.  I went to the trouble of checking one yesterday.  The workers feel intimidated.  If they raise concerns about issues of pay or conditions of employment, they are frozen out with fewer hours that are not sustainable for them to live.  People who may not have their papers in order are being used.  This is also common in the sector.  That is the reality.  There is very significant abuse of workers in the hospitality sector, particularly at certain grades.  That concerns me.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell put his finger on it when he asked how we can be guaranteed that the benefits of this cut in the VAT rate are passed on to the consumer.  That question is really important.</p> <p>What analysis has the Minister or his Department done of the 9% VAT rate?  Has definitive research been done to make a strong case to continue this in next year's budget?  I would definitely be against it being a permanent arrangement.  Senator Conway talked about having a permanent arrangement.  There are many sectors in the economy that are suffering, that need subsidies and that could justifiably argue that they could use a reduction in VAT for employment prospects, the economy, regional benefits and a range of other matters.  I do not think it is acceptable or right.  There are very profitable hotels and restaurants in Munster, Leinster and all over the country.  I was in Limerick the weekend before last and I know how difficult it was to book accommodation there and eat there.  One hotel I called to was booked for four days.  That is great news.  I am celebrating that and think that is great.  It is the same if one goes to Galway.  That is a good story.  They were propped up at a time when they needed the benefits, and a case has been made.  I would like to see the cost-benefit analysis.  Where is it all going now?  At best, there could be a case of phasing this out and bringing the rate slowly back up to 23% over a two or three-year period.  I do not support retaining the 9% rate.  It is not a responsible thing to do.  It may be the easy option for people who may be coming under pressure from the hospitality, restaurant and hotels sector, but I do not think it is the right thing to do.  It should be reviewed.</p> <p>I accept all the other aspects of the motion.  Senator Conway eloquently outlined how he wanted to develop entrepreneurship and encourage development in the whole sector.  I have no difficulty with any aspect of the Government's proposed motion.  My only concern relates to the 9% rate.  We should at least be phasing it out.  Even if not today or tomorrow, there should be a plan to phase it out.  I realise that people have made plans.  It takes a while to adjust to new changes and regimes.  It should be phased out within two to three years at the most.  I do not think any strong, cogent case could be made to sustain it.</p> <p>I wanted to mention the skill sets in education.  The previous Senator spoke about it.  There is a real need to develop education and training for the hospitality and the whole food sector.  The Minister might discuss how we can develop that with his counterparts, the other Ministers with responsibility in that area.  We need buy-in from the sector, and the owners in the hotel and restaurant sector.  What are they doing, and what case can they make themselves to retain some reduction in VAT?  Having considered it all, I believe it should go.  It is just a question of when.  A reasonable approach for a Minister like Deputy Ross would be to suggest that it be totally phased out over a two to three-year period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-08a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030800002#BB00100"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I commend Senator Conway for the motion before the House.  It is important to put matters in context.  The week in which we are having this debate, Government Ministers and representatives of State agencies are travelling to the four corners of the world.  We have many important and historic monuments and buildings across the world promoting Ireland, for example, the greening of the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building.  That is to be welcomed.  We have a unique brand, as the Senator has said, in terms of hospitality, tourism and creating a unique visitor experience.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan, whom I respect greatly, has hit on the heart of the matter.  We must look beyond the capital city in terms of our outlook.  I agree that we should review the 9% rate.  Many of us will have observed the price of lunch in a pub or restaurant, or the price of a hotel room going through the roof.  We must ensure that we are getting value for money and that incentives are being passed on to the consumer.  We must go beyond the deals and packages that are available online.  When people ring up directly to make a booking, they must be able to get the same prices and availability.  It is important that we encourage those within the sector to work with everybody to ensure we have a unique visitor experience.</p> <p>I read the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, and all of us want to see those who work in hotels and restaurants being properly treated in terms of pay and conditions.  It is also important, however, that we come together collaboratively to promote our tourism industry.  Tourism has been a key factor in the recovery as visitor numbers have increased.  It is an enormous source of employment across the country, whether casual or permanent.</p> <p>In the area where I come from, namely, Cork, we suffer from being the second city, but we are also in a relationship with our good friends in County Kerry, in terms of the Lakes of Killarney, the Ring of Kerry, Muckross and so on.  It is important that Cork city and county councils and Kerry County Council come together to promote and develop the tourism strategy they have launched.  Senator O'Sullivan referenced 17.5% of visitors coming to the south west or to Cork in terms of reasonable disparity.  Kerry and Dublin do quite well but Cork needs to be seen on the map in terms of tourism.</p> <p>I refer to the Cork Convention Bureau, which had a very interesting conference this week.  Some &euro;11.5 million worth of conferences came to Cork city and county in 2016.  That is 8,500 new delegates.  I commend Seamus Heaney, the executive chairman, and his staff for the work they do.  They are doing this work despite having no convention centre.  I urge the Minister who, to be fair, has been very supportive so far, to support the request for extra money for the Cork convention centre when it comes before the Government.  This has the potential to unlock a new Cork city quarter in terms of the docklands and the urban heartland of Cork city, and would provide a badly-needed counterbalance to Dublin.  At this week's conference, Paul Gallagher of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation revealed that a 10% potential drop in UK visitors would amount to 6,000 job losses in the tourism sector.  Anecdotally, it is rumoured that there would be 7% fewer British travellers willing to take a punt - no pun intended - in travelling post Brexit.  We will face a challenge in the post-Brexit era, as Senator Boyhan said, and there will also be challenges created by the Trump era in America and the nationalism that is emerging there.  It is important that we have a strategy to deal with that.</p> <p>I welcome the decision of Norwegian Airlines to fly in and out of Cork.  I thank the Minister for the very strong role he played in that decision.  He was a very good advocate.  He did not have to do that but did so in the interests of the whole country, in offering the people of the south west, particularly in Cork, an opportunity to have a transatlantic flight from Cork Airport.  It is now the second biggest transatlantic airport in the country.  It is also imperative, however, that we have a marketing strategy around the Cork-T.F. Green Airport link.  T.F. Green Airport provides Cork with connectivity.  It is a very navigable and manageable airport which is close to Boston, New York, Cape Cod and Connecticut.  It gives people the opportunity to travel without having to worry about pre-clearance.  There are pre-clearance facilities at Cork Airport on a smaller scale than Dublin Airport which is, as we all know, continuing to grow.</p> <p>One of the impediments to tourism coming to Cork is the lack of a Cork-Limerick motorway.  We need to see that promoted and fast-tracked.  It will offer a balance to the Dublin-Belfast axis and to Dublin itself.  If we can do that we will be providing a good service to the people of the south west.  </p> <p>The motion before us is about acknowledging and recognising the importance of our tourism industry.  Those who criticise the Government should look at the coverage we will get next week across the world in the promotion of Ireland.  It is not about the Taoiseach or a Minister going; it is about what is associated with this.  It is about promoting Ireland for business, tourism and culture.  That is the brand we should be selling: the importance of Ireland Inc.  The trade missions around employment are obviously pivotal in that regard.  </p> <p>In conclusion, we need to continue to invest in our green tourism initiatives.  As Senator Conway would rightly say, the spectacular growth of the Wild Atlantic Way and the eastern gateway are all examples of this.  We need to see the consumer receiving the benefit of the 9% rate.  We have done The Gathering, the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  They are all brilliant.  The last Government used the 9% rate to create employment, to act as a catalyst to boost the economy.  Although others opposed it, it was proven to be a success.  Now we must ensure that, if the 9% rate is to remain, it benefits the tourists, whether they are indigenous or coming from afar.  </p> <p>I thank the Minister for his work in promoting Cork.  Finally, on the skills shortage, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government did a disservice to the country in the way that it let training centres for chefs and the like close.  I hope we will be able to rescue and resuscitate them as we now have skills deficits. </p></speech>

T&aacute; m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Inniu L&aacute; Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na mBan.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas agus ardmholadh a thabhairt do bheirt bhan mhisni&uacute;la a labhair ag &oacute;c&aacute;id a d'eagraigh muid i nGaillimh o&iacute;che D&eacute; Luain seo caite.</p><p>The Minister is very welcome.  Today is International Women's Day.  I would like to sincerely applaud two very brave women who spoke at a public meeting in Galway on Monday night.  They are Eva Mitchell and Kayla McCormack and they do not mind me naming them.  They have been working with me on some research we have done into the hospitality sector in Galway.  Eva and Kayla spoke at the meeting about their experiences in the hospitality industry in Galway and it is not a pretty picture.  There were also a number of other women who came forward on Monday night and spoke publicly about the mistreatment and abuse they have experienced within that industry.  It is very rare for public representatives to come across people as brave as Eva and Kayla.  They were willing to speak out, not on their own behalf but so that other people who are in vulnerable and unacceptable situations can be supported and protected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As were many others, I was generally aware of conditions in restaurants and hotels which left a lot to be desired and meeting these women spurred us into action.  I never expected the initiative we undertook would snowball into such a campaign or that we would get the level of feedback and support we have received to date.  </p><p>We looked at the abuses of people working in the hospitality industry in the Galway area and to that extent we did a survey.  We expected to get perhaps 100 respondents to the survey but over 415 people responded.  I will tell the Minister a little bit about the research we have done.  We did it because when we put out an initial statement we received very dismissive statements from the hotels and restaurateurs representative groups.  To counter those dismissive statements from the industry we felt we needed to gather more concrete evidence to back up what we were hearing anecdotally.  The survey we conducted covers a lot of the basic elements of good work practice that employees should experience and asked questions about the basic legal requirements that every employer should adhere to.  It also seeks to quantify the different types of abuse that employees in the hospitality sector in Galway experience, from whom and what, if anything, is done about it.</p><p>The responses are quite shocking and I will forward the report to the Minister.  They point to widespread abuse of workers across the industry.  They point to issues with contracts, working conditions, payments and tips, and document a wide range of verbal and physical abuse including incidents such as sexual harassment and assault, which are totally unacceptable and illegal in any workplace.  The sense of helplessness that employees feel in this industry is palpable.  The fact that so few of the incidents are reported because people are afraid of the repercussions or feel that nothing will change is extremely worrying.</p><p>I have no reason to believe that what we have documented about Galway is any different from what is happening across the country.  We have been contacted by people who said they have the same issues.  We also collected personal testimonies which paint pictures of the real human suffering experienced by workers in the hospitality sector.  One gets a sense that this is the prevalent culture and that people are expected to put up, shut up and get on with it.  That simply has to stop.  The extremely low level of trade union membership suggests that workers need to be encouraged and supported to join unions.  Sector leaders and Government must support this initiative as it is good for workers and business.  </p><p>We need to heighten the awareness among the workforce of their rights as employees and the supports and remedies available to them to have those rights vindicated.  We also need the hospitality sector and its representative organisations to accept there are serious issues that need to be addressed.  We want customers of the hospitality sector to be aware of what is happening behind the kitchen doors and to support establishments that treat their workers well.  That will be a focus of the campaign going forward.</p><p>It is simply not good enough for those in authority to promote Galway and other areas as a great place to come, where customers enjoy the best of hospitality, if it is at the ongoing expense of a low paid, vulnerable, disposable workforce, many of whom are being mistreated and exploited by their employers.  We applaud employers who treat their workers well and welcome recommendations on establishments that should be included in that cohort.  I propose we all vote with our feet and spend our hard-earned cash in hotels and restaurants that deserve our patronage.  </p><p>The campaign has been supported by a number of different groups as well.  We have unions on board and the Union of Students in Ireland, SIPTU, the Migrants Rights Centre, the Rape Crisis Network, Romanians in Ireland and other groups have come out in support of the work we are doing.  I welcome the support we have been given, particularly by Dr. Deirdre Curran and Amanda Budyzk of the department of management in NUIG.  We have been talking to the Workplace Relations Commission which is promoting good relations between employers and employees and has been providing information to us.</p><p>I will move on to some of the findings in the survey.  It was designed to provide concrete evidence of the experience of hospitality workers in Galway.  We closed the survey at 415 responses.  Most of the respondents described themselves as Irish and were between 18 and 34 years old.  About 45% were employed full time in the sector and a further 25% worked part time.  About 43% of respondents had been employed for at least a year working in the three most common areas as waiting staff, bar staff or chefs.  The survey contained questions about employment rights at work, mistreatment experienced, reporting of mistreatment and union membership.  To put it in context, recently in the jobs committee I challenged the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland on compliance with current legislation.  The Irish Hotels Federation was proud that only 34% of hotels were non-compliant with basic legal requirements.  The lack of shock at the fact that 35% were non-compliant was outstanding.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland told us it felt that 99.9% of its members were compliant with all of the legislation, which I find very hard to believe.  </p><p>In our findings, 45% of respondents were not given a written statement of terms of their employment within the first two months and 18% did not receive a regular payslip.  Regarding rest breaks, almost 60% claimed not to receive the statutory 15-minute break after four and a half hours work; 50% did not get a 30-minute break after six hours worked; and almost 50% did not receive their entitlement to nine public holidays per year.  Almost 50% did not receive 11 consecutive hours of rest between shifts; 44% of the people we spoke to reported the employer using the rota as a negative control mechanism; 34% reported the withholding of tips regularly, very often or constantly; and 28% reported being underpaid regularly, often or constantly.</p><p>Perhaps the most worrying finding in the data relates to physical and sexual abuse, harassment and negligence, with 78% of respondents reporting experiencing verbal abuse, sometimes regularly, very often or constantly in the workplace; 36% reported experiencing sexual harassment or abuse as well; and 65% of respondents experienced negligence.  Only 21 of the 415 respondents were members of a trade union and for the vast majority of transgressions, the perpetrator was someone in a position of authority over the worker, either a supervisor, manager or owner; 60% of respondents chose not to report incidents and the main reasons for non-reporting were a belief it would make no difference, fear of repercussions or lack of evidence.  These are very serious issues.</p><p>We want to work with the industry and good employers.  For parties here to close their eyes to the serious issues of abuse and mistreatment in the hospitality sector is absolutely wrong.  We are calling on the Government and all parties in the Houses to work with us to try to remedy that.</p></speech>

We have put this amendment forward because in the 300 words of the Fine Gael motion there is no mention of the words "employee" or "worker" yet we know there is a massive issue in this industry.</p> <p>University of Limerick reports on low-hours and zero-hour contracts highlighted the accommodation and hospitality industry.  Organisations like TASC have looked at the statistics of the industry and have found that of the more than 133,000 who work in the industry, 50% earn less than &euro;400 a week.  We have seen shocking revelations this week in the survey conducted by my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.</p> <p>I live in Limerick and have always pointed out that every hotel in Limerick operates on the basis of the Irish Hotels Federation template of precarious work contracts.  If people get a job in a hotel in Limerick, Galway or Dublin, they will get a contract which says the hotel cannot tell them how many hours of work they will get in a particular week.  That is the template.  It is outrageous and it is very telling that neither Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il have anything to say about workers' rights and that they have put together a motion like this and ignore that there is a problem.</p> <p>A representative of the Irish Hotels Federation appeared before the jobs committee and we asked him directly why his organisation refuses to engage with setting up a joint labour committee which would establish decent terms and conditions in the sector.  His answer was that we have the minimum wage.  Is the Minister okay with that?  Is he okay with giving a subsidy worth &euro;620 million a year to an organisation that turns its back on the industrial relations machinery of the State and point blank refuses to engage with the International Labour Organization, which has very important things to say on the tourism sector and the need for sectoral bargaining in order to protect workers because, unfortunately, they have low rates of trade union density.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I worked as a trade union official for ten years.  The worst experiences I ever had were with cases of workers in this industry, particularly women, because of the abuse, threats and intimidation, including, at times, sexual intimidation.  It is an industry that is absolutely risible in terms of standards.  I find it absolutely amazing that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are here to represent the owners of hotels.  We should know how many Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies, Senators and councillors have a stake in this industry.  I cannot think of any reason, other than their having a stake, that they are ignoring the elephant in the room, namely, the appalling working conditions in this sector.<br/><br/>ICTU has written about this issue.  Ms Patricia King, who is highly respected, says congress is strongly opposed to this measure and has repeatedly called on the Government to end the <i>de facto</i>subsidy, which costs the taxpayer some &euro;620 million per annum.  In fact, despite the huge annual subsidy from the State, employers in the sector have consistently refused to engage with the joint labour committee structures.  There is a better way forward here.  I ask the Minister to consider the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  To what do my colleagues who are present object?  To what clause in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment do they object?  All we are asking is that there be proper engagement between the trade unions and employers to set up a joint labour committee.  We are saying that, before the huge annual subsidy is agreed, the Government should at the very least insist that employers engage with trade unions to improve standards for workers and the industry.  We urge the Irish Hotels Federation and Restaurants Association of Ireland to work towards an agreement for a new joint labour committee.  Are Senators objecting to that?  Are they opposed to it?  If so, they should show me to what part of the amendment they are opposed.  If they are not opposed to it, they should vote for it.  If they do not vote for it, they are really turning their back on the approximately 130,000 people who work in the industry, namely, the people who actually create the product that has been so successful, the people at the cutting edge or the people who suffer greatly in terms of health and safety.<br/><br/>Does the Minister know the position on the health and safety of hotel employees?  Does he know that an average employee has to overturn 17 beds on his or her own?  Does he know of the chronic back conditions that result from that?  It is all in the documentation if the Minister needs to look at it.  Fine Gael did not find the need to mention the words &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;employee&quot;, however.  It is too busy congratulating the industry on its &euro;620 million gift each year and not even insisting on a standard of decency for the workers.  Frankly, it is shameful.<br/><br/>I am genuinely surprised by this because I have great respect for my colleagues, particularly Senator Martin Conway.  I generally agree with him on many issues but this motion by Fine Gael is fundamentally wrong.  I hope and believe we will have the support of the broad progressive parties and individuals in this Chamber.  It is about time that we called out the conservative parties on this.  Once again, it comes down to the &quot;c&quot; word: class.  We spent far too much time in this Chamber supporting those who had wealth and money, the owners of capital.  We spend far too little time thinking about the people who work, create the product, build the product, deal with people every day and who are dealt with appallingly.  This industry has shameful conditions and it is high time that this were acknowledged.<br/><br/>I challenge the Minister and any of my colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il to produce an example of one hotel that does not rely on precarious work contracts.  How difficult would that be?  One would find it extremely difficult.  The Irish Hotels Federation has a template; this is how it does business.  It does business by saying there is no need to put people on permanent contracts anymore, asking why the employer should make a commitment at that level.  Precarious work conditions are offered.  The beauty of precarious work conditions from the employer's perspective is that if anybody kicks up a fuss, he or she does not get any hours the following week.  The amount of fear and intimidation throughout the industry is absolutely shocking.  I speak with first-hand experience.  As my colleague said, a considerable number of allies have come to our aid in campaigning for decency, respect and proper working conditions in this industry.  I ask the Minister to consider that seriously.  I acknowledge it would be quite a move for him given his previous record with trade unions but this is far too important an issue to ignore.  On that basis, I ask all my colleagues in the Chamber to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p></speech>

Many of the arguments that were made, particularly on the Sinn F&eacute;in side, are convincing and have great merit.  I have absolutely no doubt about that.  I have reservations, however, about spooking the entire industry when targeting it for what are undoubtedly wrongs, difficulties and, if Senator Paul Gavan is correct, abuses of employees.  I find what the Senator says quite disturbing but I would like to have more concrete evidence of the widespread nature of the practices described.</p> <p>I will not accept the amendment but I find there is merit in what the Senator says.  If he can produce more evidence and send it on to me, and if it bears up to the independent scrutiny, I will consider the necessary measures that he talks about.  When these details are produced on the floor of the House, it is difficult for me to simply accept what is said without having them forensically examined in a real way.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is a constructive and moderate amendment.  When Senator Paul Gavan talks about issues of concern across the board, he is being extremely reasonable.  The language of the amendment is constructive and addresses this matter in an undoubtedly bona fide way.  I was thinking about the amendment and am not convinced about it, but not for the purpose of not accepting it.  Undoubtedly, what the Senator is doing would spook the industry.  Over the very short period of this debate, I have not been convinced, only because I do not have the evidence, that what the Senator believes to be widespread across the industry constitutes an overall abuse.  If it is widespread and the Senator can convince me of it &mdash; I am quite happy to meet him in this regard &mdash; and if the practice is a kind of disease within the industry, as he is implying, I am quite prepared to address it in a different forum or subsequently.</p> <p>I now wish to address the issue of the 9% VAT rate, which was raised by virtually everybody, including Senators Martin Conway, Kieran O'Donnell, Jerry Buttimer and Ned O'Sullivan.  The rate should not be accepted immediately without criticism.  Undoubtedly, there are one or two problems with it.  The issue raised by Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Jerry Buttimer and Martin Conway concerned whether we have commissioned any studies to determine the real impact of the reduced VAT rate and, as raised by Senator O'Donnell, whether the reduction is being passed on to the consumer.  To be fair, this issue requires further examination.  I do not know whether the reduction is being passed on.  It is difficult to know.  The rate has obviously been beneficial to the industry, particularly the smaller players in the hospitality sector, in a large number of ways.  It has been great in terms of employment.  I do not know the answer to the question but I believe we will address that.  It certainly should be addressed and the reduction should certainly be passed on to the consumer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently commissioned a new study on the impact of the VAT rate on employment and competitiveness, particularly in rural areas.  That builds on two previous studies that show the 9% VAT rate has considerable benefits.  I do not think anyone is in any doubt about that.  The question really is whether some of the hotels are gilding the lily and taking too much profit and whether some people are benefitting and do not need it any longer while others do.  It is rather difficult to differentiate and say some hotels deserve it and others do not.  A certain amount of fine tuning is required.  Perhaps the Senator is correct.  Basically, the 9% VAT rate has been a great success in terms of employment and if it needs fine tuning, that will be examined.  The Government's position on it at the moment is that it is there to stay.  To send out any signals that the VAT rate is under threat would be totally wrong, in particular in terms of Brexit, and that signal should not go out, but there is nothing wrong with examining it and doing a little bit of fine tuning.<br/><br/>Senator Ned O'Sullivan spoke about identifying the great potential of new tourism markets in terms of Brexit, which is coming up day in, day out in terms of tourism.  He will be aware of the fact of the slowdown, which is taking place in terms of British visitors.  The reduction currently is approximately 1.5% to 2% but we have only got figures for January.  The anecdotal evidence in terms of bookings is that numbers will increase.  The agencies are moving very fast to find new markets.  They are aggressively looking for further funding as well in order to move into those markets with a certain amount of clout and leverage.  They are looking for funding on the basis that some of the other State agencies have already received extra funding to cope with Brexit.  The Government will examine the requests.  In the Estimates which I am shortly due to bring before the select committee we will seek extra funding for that purpose as well.  It is something that is worthy of consideration.<br/><br/>I have probably addressed most of the issues that were raised in the House.  The tourism industry today is a very positive one.  The year 2016 was a record year for overseas tourists to Ireland, surpassing all previous records.  There were a total of 9,584,400 visits to Ireland in 2016 representing a 10.9% increase on 2015, or an additional 941,300 visits on top of last year's record.  Good growth was recorded from all our market areas and Ireland has seen its market share grow ahead of its competitors.  Based on official figures for the first nine months of 2016, we estimate that overseas tourism contributed more than &euro;4.5 billion to the Irish economy, up approximately 10% on 2015.  That helped to sustain an estimated 220,000 jobs in communities across the country.<br/><br/>I know that both tourism agencies, Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, are determined to maintain that momentum right through 2017 and into the future.  The excellent performance of 2016 comes on the back of a number of years of very steady growth.  I take this opportunity to thank all those involved in the tourism industry around the country who have had a hand in delivering this great result for Irish tourism and for the economy.<br/><br/>Tourism continues to be a priority for the Government, which has long recognised the contribution it makes and its potential to drive further economic growth.  We are well aware of the challenges that faced the tourism industry in recent times.  The combined efforts of all stakeholders - industry, the Government and the tourism agencies - are proving very successful and as a result it is very satisfying to see the growth in tourist numbers, revenue and jobs that have come about in recent years.  Of course, it is essential that such efforts continue in order to maintain our competitive position, meet growing consumer demand and stand out in a crowded international marketplace.  It is important to acknowledge the efforts of the tourism industry, which worked hard through the recent difficult times to manage costs while maintaining services and offering a high quality value for money product.<br/><br/>In terms of Government supports, the VAT cut was one of the first big jobs-oriented policy initiatives taken back in May 2011 and retained in subsequent budgets to sustain and grow employment in the sector.  In accordance with the programme for Government commitment, it is proposed to retain the 9% VAT rate as long as prices remain competitive so as to aid the sector where required, such as in times of uncertainty, namely, a post-Brexit situation.  Combined with reducing the air travel tax to zero, the temporary reduction in employers PRSI and changes to the visa regime, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to supporting this key sector.<br/><br/>Clearly, we move into 2017 in a position of some strength.  The challenge for all of us now is to maintain this growth.  There is no room for complacency, particularly given the highly competitive nature of the global travel industry and the uncertainty that exists in some markets.  Our capacity to sustain growth will depend, among other things, on Ireland maintaining its competitiveness, on effective marketing and on the continued development of attractive and compelling holiday experiences.<br/><br/>The Government's ongoing commitment to tourism was again reflected in the budget.  Despite growing demands on the public purse, the 9% VAT rate on tourism services was retained and funding of &euro;122 million was secured.  That will enable Tourism Ireland to continue its effective marketing overseas and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to continue to develop the industry on the ground.  Looking to the future, the Government tourism policy statement sets out ambitious targets to grow employment in the sector to 250,000 by 2025 by attracting 10 million overseas visitors annually and generating &euro;5 billion in associated revenue.  Specific priority measures to support sustainable growth into the future are set out in the Tourism Action Plan 2016 to 2018.<br/><br/>In common with the rest of the Government there has been deep analysis of the challenges which tourism faces because of the outcome of the UK referendum.  Even prior to the referendum result, there was a commitment in the Government's tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change that.<br/><br/>A key element of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy since 2014 has been market diversification which has seen mainland Europe become the largest contributor of overseas tourism revenue and will see the United States overtake Great Britain as the No. 2 contributor of tourism revenue in the coming years.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in mainland Europe and North America.  In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland is currently preparing its corporate plan for the period from 2017 to 2019.  This plan will <i>inter alia</i>include the agency's response to marketing Ireland in Great Britain in the new situation that has developed following the referendum.  On 23 January 2017 the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and I hosted an all-island dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector in Dundalk.  The feedback from tourism industry participants at this event reaffirmed the Government's analysis on the implications of Brexit for tourism and I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with the tourism and hospitality industry as the Brexit negotiations proceed.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that Brexit is part of a global tourism and trading landscape and in that context I, along with An Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World.  This is a cohesive, whole-of-Government strategy that builds on existing successes and sets ambitious targets for Ireland, including tourism performance.  This new strategy will deepen Ireland's economic resilience and responsiveness in the face of highly changeable global conditions and sets out a vision of Ireland as an outward-facing, globally connected hub for business, research, innovation, investment and tourism.<br/><br/>Given what we know of the challenges 2017 may bring, it will be more important than ever that we create stand-out for Ireland in our markets by rolling out inspirational Ireland destination messaging.  This essential destination sell will be supported by promotion of our iconic holiday experiences &ndash; the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin &ndash; A Breath of Fresh Air.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All three experience brands will be major themes for Tourism Ireland next year, as well as the promotion of touring holidays, city breaks, festivals, events and activities.  Work will continue with airports and airlines to encourage the creation of new routes and the expansion of existing services to the regions.  Ireland's Ancient East offers visitors a journey through 5,000 years of history in 500 miles of beautiful landscapes.  Known for its castles, myths and legends, religious sites, great houses and green landscapes, it stretches from Newgrange in the Boyne Valley in the north east, through the midlands and along Kilkenny's mediaeval mile to Waterford's Viking quarter and Cork's many cultural gems.</p><p>The Wild Atlantic Way is the longest scenic tourist route in the world.  It stretches some 1,600 miles from Donegal to Cork, taking travellers through one of the world's most dramatic coastal landscapes on the edge of Europe, which has shaped the development of its people, communities and settlement over centuries.  It offers visitors an opportunity to connect with friendly welcoming people in towns and villages along the way, to experience our heritage and culture and to enjoy our great locally grown fresh food and freshly caught seafood.</p><p>Dublin is a key tourist destination and plays a pivotal role in the visitor experience, serving as the ideal showcase for Ireland's overall offering.  The Dublin - A Breath of Fresh Air brand highlights the capital's distinctive offering, where city living thrives side-by-side with natural outdoors.  Visitors to Dublin can experience the full offering of a vibrant modern city within very easy access of the beautiful surrounding bay and mountains.</p><p>My Department and the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, are committed to strong regional dispersal in tourism.  This involves providing visitors with credible, compelling and attractive reasons to travel around the country beyond Dublin.  It also involves providing targeted business supports to assist tourism businesses to capitalise on the further development and marketing of the key experience brands.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is placing significant emphasis on assisting the tourism sector to increase the geographical spread of activity, and to lengthen the season and increase activity outside the peak summer months.  The agency has been rolling out extending the season workshops developed to assist tourism enterprises in developing and growing business by addressing issues around seasonality and regionality.</p><p>Allocations for international tourism marketing are used to ensure that Ireland maintains its share of voice in key overseas markets.  With specific regard to facilitating greater regional dispersal, in addition to general overseas marketing, the tourism agencies target overseas journalists and international travel operators to raise awareness of the new experience brands and encourage travel agents to programme Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way into their itineraries.</p><p>The motion calls on the Government to continue investment in green tourism initiatives.  Our tourism policy statement acknowledges that the quality of our environment is one of the most frequently cited reasons to visit Ireland.  In this regard, the success of the Great Western Greenway has proven inspiring for communities across the country and I will continue to argue for investment in such initiatives. </p><p>The motion also calls on the Government to establish new funding streams to assist tourism entrepreneurs.  While there are no additional resources for new funding streams in this regard this year, I am aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland already provides a range of business supports to tourism enterprises and if Senators have particular initiatives in mind - Senator Conway mentioned this in his opening address - I am happy to hear further from them on this issue.</p><p>There is a direct correlation between tourism growth and ease of getting here for visitors from key markets.  Encouraged by the Government initiatives on travel tax, we have seen very substantial expansion in direct air services to Ireland, including from long haul markets, in recent years.  There were 537,000 seats a week onto the island of Ireland in summer 2016 and already Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Lufthansa, Iberia, Norwegian Air International and many other airlines have announced transatlantic and short haul expansion for 2017.  I thank Senator Buttimer for his comments on my contribution to Norwegian Air International, but it would not have been done without prompting from him on a weekly basis in representing Cork.  I could not have gotten away with not doing so, even if I had wished to which I did not.  We anticipate further growth this year.  </p><p>Ferry services are gearing up, and there is particularly good news from Irish Ferries which has commissioned a new &euro;144 million state-of-the-art cruise ferry to come on stream in time for the 2018 season.  All of that augurs well for tourism and investment by the carriers underlines their confidence in the future of our industry.</p><p>We also have in place a programme to support co-operative marketing activity at regional airports and ports to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing air and ferry services to the regions.  In this way, the aim is to grow visits to the regions, in particular the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East, via points of entry outside Dublin.  A sum of &euro;1 million was made available to Tourism Ireland for this purpose in 2016 and again in 2017, and the tourism action plan 2016-2018 includes a specific commitment to continue the scheme until 2018.</p><p>In addition to the &euro;1 million in Exchequer funding, the airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders, including local authorities, make further contributions to the fund for routes serving their access points.  This funding is then matched by carriers for campaigns targeting consumers in the overseas regions with connectivity to Ireland's regional airports and ports.  For the 2016 tourism season, the Exchequer investment was &euro;1 million and it realised total overseas marketing activity worth &euro;2.6 million.  </p><p>I hope this gives the House an overview of the great strides made by our tourism sector which has a proven track record in creating employment throughout the country and driving growth in the economy.  Overseas visitor numbers are well up and tourists are spending more.  While this performance is very encouraging, we are determined that the growth will continue in line with the ambitious targets set out in the tourism policy People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025.  Accordingly, strong Exchequer funding commitment to the sector is essential to achieve sustainable growth into the future, in line with the policy targets.</p><p>The 2017 allocations for tourism product development will provide for continued capital investment by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the experience brands through the development of attractions and other tourism infrastructure.  The current allocations will further enhance, animate and promote these key experience brands by funding business supports, training, festivals, events and other related programmes.  The development and sustainability of Irish tourism will be further supported by funding targeted at growing high-yield event and business tourism, including supporting Ireland's bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  I look forward to lending my support to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in the future.</p><p>It is a particularly useful experience to have this debate.  I welcome the success of Irish tourism in what I can only describe as a non-political atmosphere.  I address my remarks to Sinn F&eacute;in Senators in particular, because the goodwill and the serious manner in which they have addressed this problem is worthy of recognition even if we cannot support the amendment because of a lack of full evidence.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we did not get to speak before because I would love to have shared some of the thoughts I had and discuss the points he made in his lengthy response.  I thank the Minister for the comprehensive nature of his contribution.</p> <p>I recognise from the contribution of Senator Conroy that there are some very genuine sentiments.  Many of those thoughts were also expressed in the Minister's speech.  As somebody who has lived on the west coast and in Dublin, I recognise the importance of initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  I am enthusiastic about the development of a greener approach to tourism.  The Minister expressed some very worthy sentiments.</p> <p>In the limited time we have, we need to point to the actual substance of the motion before us.  The substantial recommendation in the motion is that the 9% VAT rate for the tourism industry be renewed on a multiannual basis.  That is something I cannot support.  Given some of the input we have had from my colleague in Fine Gael, it is unfortunate that no caveats, conditions, review or question marks were added to the motion, which was an opportunity missed.</p> <p>The idea of renewing the VAT rate, a preferential measure that was introduced for the industry at a particular time and on a strategic basis, without any conditions and on a multiannual basis does not make economic, social or moral sense.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It makes sense on none of the levels that we would normally expect to be required in the consideration of a tax measure.</p><p>I know the Minister spoke about not spooking the industry.  We should also be very concerned if we send a signal to the industry that it can be complacent.  We cannot afford complacency, as Senator Ned O'Sullivan rightly said.  We cannot afford to give blanket reassurances and commitments for years to an industry which will not even give a commitment to next week's hours to many of its workers.  That is not acceptable.  We need to, even from a purely economic and sensible level, be looking at what our leverage is as a State, and how we responsibly use it and balance it when it comes to measures at budget time.</p><p>On the cost-benefit matter, we know that the cost so far, from Revenue's own figures, is &euro;2.1 billion.  That is substantial.  It was &euro;620 million per annum when we looked at last year's figures.  This is an extraordinary expense.  Maybe it will be worth it but we need to look at it.  I would respectfully suggest that gentlemen's agreements, such as we heard mentioned here today, are no substitute for cost-benefit analysis, particularly when those gentlemen's agreements come largely at the back of women workers.  We are here on International Women's Day.  We know, and I know from my work with the National Women's Council of Ireland, that the hospitality industry has been at the front-line of aggressive casualisation of work.</p><p>The Minister spoke about wishing to examine the evidence in detail.  It is not simply Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's evidence and I will not attempt to reiterate that.  The evidence is long-established.  The University of Limerick has highlighted this issue in research done for the Government under its last remit.  The Low Pay Commission has identified this pattern and concern to such a substantial level that i had to produce a special report on it, because 60% of those low-paid and insecure workers are women.  Only last week, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, highlighted the CSO figures.  Some 82.5% of women workers in the accommodation and food service industry are earning less than &euro;400 a week.  That comes with a cost, not just of revenue loss, but also the cost of family income supplement for those who are not paid adequate income, which I see as a member of the Joint Committee on Social Protection.  That is why, as a member of that committee, I could not in good conscience support a measure which did not include a requirement for decent conditions for workers and which said that it will subsidise them in two ways and subsidise industry on two levels.  That is not acceptable.</p><p>I pointed to the workers' conditions and the costs.  I want to come back to the core point, which I believe is a sentiment shared across the House.  Everybody here has spoken about spreading the benefit of tourism, whether on a regional level, to the consumer - we have seen the 15% increase in costs - and also, essentially, the employees, which is the missing piece and why I will be supporting it.  Let us also remember who the employees are.  They are the consumers of other sectors.  They are the communities that we talk about when we talk about Ireland's national heritage and communities.  We want communities which can afford to live decently, to work, to spend and to put back.</p><p>This is clearly a focus on the budget.  I remind the Minister that in our budget, he and his Department will be required to produce evidence of gender-proofing and equality-proofing of the measures in his budget.</p></speech>

We must note the good work of Tourism Ireland in recognising this hard work.  It was established as one of the &ldquo;six areas of co-operation&rdquo; under the framework of the Belfast Agreement of Good Friday 1998.  Their remit is to increase tourism to the island of Ireland and to support the North of Ireland to realise its tourism potential.  I would like to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion that calls on the Irish Hotels Federation and Restaurants Association of Ireland to immediately engage with the State's wage-setting mechanism for low paid workers in industries with low levels of trade union representation.</p><p>While we all support any measures that will support the tourism sector, we should examine the proposal to retain the sector's unique 9% VAT rate on a multi-annual basis. This should be dependent on the employers addressing the fact that the hotel and hospitality sector continues to be characterised by a high incidence of low pay and non-compliance with labour regulations.  It is important to take into account the view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which is strongly opposed to this measure and has repeatedly called on the Government to end this<i>de facto</i>subsidy, which costs the taxpayer some &euro;620 million per annum and well in excess of &euro;2.1 billion to date, according to figures from Revenue.  The subsidy to the tourism sector has to be based on evidence that the benefits have been passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices or to the thousands who work in the sector in the form of higher wages.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who work in the tourism sector.  They are the people who help make Ireland a great brand and a great place to visit. On International Woman&rsquo;s Day, I would like to recognise the contribution of the female workers in this sector and hope that their low pay and precarious work contracts are addressed as a matter of urgency.  Long may they keep up the good work and be supported by this and any future Governments.</p></speech>

I would like to compliment all working in both the tourism and hospitality sector, certainly for the fact that it brought over &euro;8 billion into the economy in 2016.  I take grave exception to what has been said to my left here today about the 9% VAT rate, as somebody who comes from the hospitality industry and who grew up in a business that was involved in the hospitality industry for over 60 years.  I grew up, worked in and was an employer in the hospitality industry in the past, and I declare my hand and say that I have no problem in saying that I no longer work within that industry, but I am aware of the employment created by the small hospitality industry.  I know Senator Gavan referred mainly to the hotels in his contribution, but we cannot tar everybody with the same brush.  It is like when people in other lines of work are talked about.  Politicians are often tarred with the one brush.  It is very unfair to tar everybody with the one brush.</p> <p>The 9% VAT rate was responsible for creating over 20,000 jobs.

Many are dependent on our tourism industry.  I know that the Minister has been responsible for promoting the Wild Atlantic Way and the Ancient East, and a previous Minister promoted The Gathering, which was really successful and brought many of our diaspora back to Ireland for many family gatherings.  It was a very successful initiative.  I know the Minister is sick of hearing me talk about the Wild Atlantic Way.  He spoke in his speech about the fact that it goes from Donegal to Cork.  It still does not include the city of Limerick, which is the main city in the mid-west region.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, announced the Shannon Estuary drive, but there is a case to be made.  Limerick has much that makes it attractive in its heritage and tourist attractions.  The Minister's Department has invested a great deal in developing things like King John's Castle and putting in high quality visitor attractions, yet we are not encouraging tourists to come to the city.  I welcome that tourism numbers and visitor numbers are up.  There was a time when one could land in Shannon Airport and be told to go to Dublin.  At least that has stopped.  I welcome that all those changes have been made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Buttimer referred to the M20, which is a huge problem with regard to connectivity.</p><p>I have discussed with the Minister in a Commencement debate the issue of spreading tourism.  A total of 82% of hotel beds in Dublin were occupied in 2015.  I am not sure what the figure is for 2016, but I believe it is a little higher.  Many flights arrive at Dublin Airport, which I know is beyond its capacity.  The Government needs to consider more initiatives to spread tourism.  We must use the hotel beds in the rest of the country.  We must bring people to rural towns and villages and other cities.  Recently I met somebody in the Westbury Hotel and two American visitors were sitting at a nearby table.  They told me the package they had bought meant they were staying in Dublin and travelling to the Cliffs of Moher for a day and going to the Ring of Kerry for another day, but they were travelling up and down from Dublin.  This does not make sense.  Some of these packages base tourists in one place.  They should spend two or three days in Dublin and then move west or north.  There must be more incentives to encourage tour groups to spread their business.</p><p>I compliment the agencies because Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are doing a lot to attract tourists.  Yesterday, the Wild Atlantic Way won an international award in China, having been voted for by more than 10 million Chinese people.  This is down to the work not only of the Department but also Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p>It is expected the Six Nations matches in Dublin against England and France will be worth more than &euro;40 million and this is nothing to be sneezed at.  My colleagues on the left speak about the 9% VAT rate not being retained, but with all these tourists coming to the country we need to have the jobs to be able to look after people throughout the hospitality sector, be it in pubs, clubs and many restaurants.  The 9% VAT rate helps the retention of jobs.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged he needs to ensure it is being passed onto the consumer.  In some cases, people are not passing it on, but many are.</p><p>Last week at a public meeting on Brexit I spoke a little about tourism.  The number of people coming to Ireland from the UK has dropped.  I am very glad the Minister will address this issue.  It is something we need to keep an eye on because it is a concern for the country.</p></speech>

I have family members and many friends who have worked in the hospitality sector.  When people started work in the sector they had an expectation they would earn enough money to be able to get a mortgage to buy a home and educate their children.  This is no longer the case.  People in the hospitality sector do not even know how many hours they will work the following week.  How can they plan to have a family, provide education for their children or have a home?  If they get married they end up on family income supplement.  How can they plan for their family's future?  If we are giving a sector a &euro;620 million subvention every year we damn well have a right to demand proper standards.</p></speech>

We needed to stimulate the market and it worked well.  We created employment.  We have moved on, and the Minister's figures have shown how well we have done.  It is time to review it.  This is why the Fine Gael motion makes no sense as it states to give it to the sector forever with no conditions.  It is total utter madness.  It reminds me of the days of the tent in Galway, where the developers were asking for more and more incentives to build more and more at higher and higher prices because everything would be rosy.  Then we went into the financial crash.  We have legislation on lobbying, which might have got it a little wrong because now people will not be able to get access to Ministers for &euro;100 for breakfast.  I wonder how many people in the hospitality sector have paid &euro;100 for breakfast to lobby Ministers to keep the 9% VAT rate in place.</p> <p>I will speak against Dublin, because it does not make sense to use the 9% rate to subsidise hotels in the Dublin area which have 82% and 92% occupancy rates.  Senators cannot get hotel rooms.  According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, in 2015 there was a 15% increase in costs in the hospitality sector in Dublin, and in 2016 it is expected to have increased by another 15%.  We are not protecting the consumers.</p> <p>To reply to Senator Conway, I fully support calls to identify ways to spread visitor numbers to towns and villages throughout Ireland.  This may not have the traditional benefits of the tourism industry but it makes sense.  Should we spend the &euro;620 million every year in a way that targets areas in the country which do not benefit from the tourism industry because it is so highly concentrated in the Dublin area?  Show me evidence.  When the Minister was on the Opposition benches he spoke constantly about moving to evidence-based decisions.  All the evidence shows workers in the hospitality sector are being exploited.  Everybody in the House knows it and everybody has some experience.  Every study has shown it.  This is evidence based.  The evidence-based approach states we do not give a 9% rate to somebody who is coining money and has jumped hotel rates through the roof.  The midlands, the west and parts of Cork are not getting a share.  They need investment.  We need to consider this on an evidence basis and ask whether we should shift investment.  Do we need to ensure that places from Dingle to Athlone to Letterkenny share in the increase in tourist numbers?  Would it be better, using an evidence-based study, to spend the money in a different way to ensure we spread the benefits of the increase in numbers in the tourism industry?</p> <p>Yes, we must be careful with regard to Brexit, and we need to compete in very difficult circumstances for the British market of which we have a large section.  I am not overly convinced that giving &euro;620 million in subsidies to the hospitality sector in the Dublin area is money well spent.  The money may be well spent by building a convention centre in Cork and creating a counterbalance to Dublin.</p> <p>The Fine Gael Senators proposing the motion stated on the one hand we should be doing this and on the other hand the measure should be up for review.  The motion does not mention a review, it mentions multiannual which means it would be given on multiannual basis.  This is a little bit daft, but I am not surprised that Fine Gael has gone a little bit daft.  The motion states it must be ensured the consumer benefits, but it includes no criteria by which the consumer would benefit.  As a matter of fact, Senator Catherine Noone did a very good price check when the measure was first introduced.  She highlighted a number of operators in the hospitality sector which did not pass on the benefits to the consumer but nothing happened to them.</p> <p>If we are to help the hospitality sector we must ensure workers are treated right.  This is not happening at present.  They do not know how many hours they will get from week to week.  They have no expectations to save for a mortgage, educate their children or have a little ambition for their families.</p> <p>Would providing the 9% rate on a multiannual basis help?  It would probably be mostly those in the greater Dublin area.  A better way to spend the money would probably be to invest the &euro;620 million outside the Dublin area to boost the tourism industry in Cork, Laois, Mullingar and all the areas which have not benefitted really well from the growth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Somebody has got somebody's ear.

I support the motion.  I commend my colleague, Senator Martin Conway, for scripting and putting together this very important motion.  We will hopefully make an important statement tonight, if we get support from the Members of the House, regarding the tourism industry and where we want to drive it.  It has been a unique driver in troubled times in the Irish State.  It has been one of our shining lights.  Since The Gathering it has been one of the key drivers in the economy.  This is due to the commitment of this Minister and previous Ministers to the tourism project.</p> <p>Staffing issues have been raised in this debate.  I come from Minane Bridge, which is eight miles from Kinsale.  The biggest problem in Kinsale today is a lack of staff.  We do not have enough staff in the tourism industry.  There are signs looking for staff in every window in one of the most successful tourism towns in Ireland.  </p> <p>It has been said today that 85% of people in the hospitality industry earn less than &euro;400.  In my opinion, most of those are part-time workers.  That is very evident in Kinsale.  That is the benefit of having a very strong tourism industry.  Teenagers going to college have the ability to get part-time work in their own locality, which is of assistance to them.  We should be proud of our tourism industry.  We should be proud of the staff and proud of the people who drove this industry forward.  </p> <p>The Wild Atlantic Way starts in Kinsale.  At the other side of Cork Harbour is the start of Ireland's Ancient East.  These are two very important projects which have brought a major economic drive into our area that has been very beneficial to both urban Cork city and rural west Cork.  I note that the Minister plans to visit west Cork and Kerry in the coming months.  He will see what it means to the communities.  The Wild Atlantic Way has delivered.  It is important for us to recognise that.</p> <p>There have to be changes made.  Things like CERT should be brought back.  There is an issue with the lack of trained staff in the hospitality industry.  We need to bring people in and start training them again.  We need to return to the CERT model and put a programme in place to ensure we have an appropriate number of trained staff coming through.  We have neither enough staff nor enough trained staff.  We need to put processes in place to get those people into the industry.</p> <p>I would like to compliment Senator Conway for his motion.  It is a very important and timely one.  Hopefully today we will put down a marker that demonstrates our views on the tourism industry.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are issues.  Nobody wants to see low-paid employees.  However, it is important that tourism continues to be invested in and improved on. </p> <p>One part of this motion suggests initiatives to spread tourists destinations around the country.  To do that, direct access is needed.  This could be done through regional airports.  I welcome the initiatives involving Norwegian Air International, and all the Minister did to secure its presence.  It is important.  Tourism is available in every village and town in this country.  It is easy and important to support the big ticket cities and towns and so on, but it is very important to go beyond that.  The alternative to low-paid jobs in some of the smaller villages and towns is to have no jobs at all.  It is about getting the balance right.  Workers must be treated to a fair living wage.  It is important to spread the numbers of tourists right around the country.  </p> <p>I agree with Senator Byrne when she spoke about the packages that are arranged and that they are sometimes not conducive to that spreading around the country.</p></speech>

I believe he said that they cannot get workers in Kinsale.  If they paid them, they would get them.  If they paid them a living wage they would get them.</p></speech>

We are subsidising this industry.</p> <p>I have no doubt whatsoever that tourism is key to the Irish economy.  I want to see the further education sector develop tourism courses.  I want to see greater training for tourism.  However, we are still back in the 1960s when it comes to treating our staff.  A lack of staff?  They will be there if they are paid.  When interviewing managers, the Marriott hotel group used to ask them which they would prioritise: profit for the hotel, greater efficiency in the running of the hotel, or a contented staff.  The person who got the job always answered "contented staff", for if one's staff are happy one's hotel will be efficient and will be profitable.  Ireland's tourist industry is creeping and crawling with casualisation.  It is not good enough that people do not know how many hours work they will have next week.</p> <p>I understand the Leas-Chathaoirleach is under pressure for time.  I appreciate being given time to speak.  I appreciate what the Minister pointed out and the work that has been done in tourism.  I compliment him for what he is doing.  Drive on, Minister.  However, as I think he has said, the 9% rate needs to be kept under review.  Perhaps we might get a national survey to complement the survey done by Sinn F&eacute;in, which is an excellent piece of work.</p></speech>

I thank all parties who spoke on the motion.</p> <p>I have no interest or no financial benefit of any kind from anyone in the hospitality industry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have never taken a political donation of any kind ever in my life.  It is important to put on the record of the House that I get no benefit either directly or indirectly.  <br/><br/>The 9% VAT rate is clearly included in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Therefore, for the lifetime of this Government, I suspect that the 9% rate will be retained.  No tax is continued <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I referred to &quot;multi-annual&quot; which, in my book, is usually for three to five years.  It is not indefinite.  As regards reviewing it, I believe that every tax should be reviewed.  I would therefore expect that the 9%, 13.5% and 21% VAT rates will be constantly reviewed.  That is a given.  I do not accept the need to specify a review because if we do not review all our tax rates annually we will have a problem.<br/><br/>I do not accept that the &euro;620 million is a subsidy.  Many people in the hospitality industry, in every town and village, benefit from the 9% VAT rate.  In fact, if that rate was not there, they probably would be out of business.  There are easy pickings in cities and other successful tourist destinations where establishments are doing well and making money.  In most rural towns, however, the owners of a pub that has survived and is providing food as well as drink might not be taking a salary from it.  If they are, it is probably based on the minimum wage.  If the 9% VAT rate goes up, I can guarantee that many such businesses will close.  They are struggling to survive as it is and have not benefited from the tourist industry's bounce.<br/><br/>I would prefer to work on a consensual basis where a motion has merit.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh knows my style in that regard, given the years we have both been Members of this House.  We have a responsibility to highlight injustices and the narrative that comes from this House should reflect that.  We should celebrate what is positive and good, but we must also ensure that the narrative emanating from here highlights where people are being blackguarded through mistreatment and injustice.<br/><br/>I have no doubt whatsoever about the sincerity of the survey in Galway because I know that Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh undertook such work with integrity, decency and honesty.  However, I agree with the Minister that if it is certified and identified as a disease throughout the industry, it will certainly have to be dealt with.  Maybe it is a Galway issue, but I suspect not.  I suspect that there probably is more abuse.  I call on people like Mr. Paul O'Brien of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and RTE's &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; to start working on this and highlight it in the same way they have highlighted abuses that occurred in other sectors of society.<br/><br/>To be honest, I did not think it was as prevalent as the survey suggests.  I am disappointed to hear that.  The Marriott motto is correct because if staff are content, they will become team players and an important component of the team structure.<br/><br/>I hope many things will come from this motion, particularly promoting tourism and ensuring that it stays at the heart of government.  Given what has been highlighted today, I sincerely hope that we will see further evidence-based research.  That is what the Government requires.  I call on the relevant appropriate bodies to undertake such research.  I will co-operate in whatever way I can in that regard. <br/><br/>It is pity that we are not in a position to accept the amendment.  I would personally like to accept it, but these things require a certain degree of evidence.  Overall, however, I am happy with the debate.  It is an important debate and we should have more discussions on issues such as tourism.  I thank people for giving their time to contribute to the debate.</p></speech>

On 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen in which it determined that fishing by Northern Irish vessels within the 0-6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of this State was not permitted by law.  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's finding that the voisinage arrangements were not invalid, but that there was insufficient provision in domestic law for them.  The Government has authorised me to present this Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in order to address the Supreme Court's findings and restore the arrangements, which have long been in existence, to provide access for fishing.</p><p>Ireland and Northern Ireland have had reciprocal fishing access arrangements for more than 50 years.  These arrangements have allowed boats from Northern Ireland to fish in coastal waters in Ireland.  They have also allowed, and continue to allow, Irish-registered fishing boats access to fish in coastal waters in Northern Ireland.  The 1964 London Fisheries Convention allowed that each coastal state could assert exclusive fishing rights within 6 nautical miles of its baselines under Article 2.  It also provided for contracting parties to allow those fishermen from another coastal state who had habitually fished within the belt to continue to do so by reason of voisinage arrangements under Article 9.  On this basis, pre-existing reciprocal arrangements were re-affirmed at the time by means of an exchange of letters in the 1960s between the UK and Ireland that allowed for vessels from Northern Ireland to fish within Ireland's 6 nautical mile zone and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>In light of the Supreme Court's judgment, fishing by Northern Irish vessels in Irish territorial waters is not currently provided for in domestic law.  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing vessels in the 0-6 nautical mile zone relying on the voisinage arrangements.  The arrangements, as noted by the courts, apply to all species of fish and are subject to such conditions as may apply at the time of fishing.</p><p>Following receipt of advice from the Attorney General's office on the application of the judgment, I notified the matter to the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Ms Michelle McIlveen, MLA.  I have been keeping her apprised of developments as appropriate.  My Department is remaining in close contact with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland on the issue and a number of meetings have been held to reaffirm the mutual understanding of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Creed:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The court&rsquo;s ruling has complicated an important area of North-South co-operation.  The access of Northern Ireland sea-fishing boats to coastal waters of the State, and <i>vice versa</i>, under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements has been one aspect of ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in the area of fisheries.  This co-operation has supported broader efforts to promote greater North-South co-operation under the 1998 British-Irish Agreement.  The North-South Ministerial Council was set up under the Agreement specifically to develop better consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland.  The North-South Ministerial Council focuses on areas of co-operation of interest to both jurisdictions, including aquaculture and marine issues.  I have had regular and positive engagement within the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council with my Northern Ireland equivalent, Michelle Mcllveen.  This kind of North-South co-operation across a range of policy areas is in the interests of the people of this island.  The Supreme Court noted in its judgment that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements are a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters.  I remain committed to continuing this co-operation on agriculture and sea-fisheries issues with our counterparts in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>The Government has approved the preparation of a legislative amendment, namely, this Bill, to address the issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment as expediently as possible.  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Bill sets out a proposed legislative amendment to address the immediate issue of providing sufficient legal provision for Northern Ireland boats to resume reciprocal fishing access under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  The Bill proposes to do this by amending section 10 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.<br/><br/>The proposed new section 10 continues to assert Ireland&rsquo;s exclusive right to fish within the exclusive fishery limits of the State by maintaining previous provisions.  It also explicitly provides for access to fish by sea-fishing boats owned and operated in Northern Ireland within zero to six nautical miles of the baseline of the State&rsquo;s exclusive fishery limits.  The Bill also contains a commencement provision which provides for an order to be made to commence the Bill if enacted.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority was set up by the Oireachtas under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 as the independent authority for,<i>inter alia</i>, the implementation of sea-fisheries legislation.  I do not have a role in regard to the performance of its functions.  The authority will be responsible for the application of the Bill if enacted and commenced.<br/><br/>While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland boats to fish, under the terms of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements, this access is subject to the same conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be legislated for is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as commencement order for the Bill.  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the <i>status quo</i>for fishing access that existed under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October.  The only difference will be that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.  The access arrangements for Northern Ireland boats will not change as a result of this Bill, Northern Ireland boats will simply regain fishing access they have had for decades under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements in the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State.  They will also continue to be subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.<br/><br/>Article 5(2) of the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation No. 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council specifically authorises member states to restrict access for fishing with certain limitations.  One such limitation is where there are existing neighbourhood arrangements between member states, such as the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  Another limitation is the access arrangements for member states, based on traditional fishing, set out in the annex to the regulation.  In keeping with this Article, the Bill will continue to exclude the sea-fishing boats of other member states from fishing within Ireland&rsquo;s zero to six nautical mile zone.  Fishing activities which have a legal basis, reliant on access arrangements to Ireland&rsquo;s six to 12 nautical mile zone in the EU Regulation 1380/2013, will not be affected by this Bill.<br/><br/>The specific access arrangements in regard to each member state are set out in annex 1 of the regulation.  These arrangements are based on traditional fishing patterns by the various member states&rsquo; sea-fishing boats.  Under the EU regulation, sea-fishing boats registered in the UK are allowed access to fish in the coastal waters of Ireland as follows: in the six to 12 nautical mile zone, from Mine Head to Hook Point, they can fish for demersal species, herring and mackerel; and in the six to 12 nautical mile zone, from Hook Point to Carlingford Lough, they can fish for demersal species, herring and mackerel, as well as nephrops and scallops.  The EU Regulation also gives Irish registered fishing boats access to areas of the UK&rsquo;s six to 12 nautical mile zone to fish for demersal stocks and nephrops.<br/><br/>The House will be mindful of the proposed departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or Brexit.  It has been suggested that continuing the long-standing <i>voisinage</i>arrangements through this Bill may weaken Ireland&rsquo;s position in any future negotiations arising from Brexit.  I cannot accept this point.  The UK has not yet invoked Article 50.  Until the UK invokes Article 50, it remains a member state of the European Union.  We can only operate on that basis for the moment and honour the commitments we have made to our neighbours through the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  Ireland, as a member state, will continue to come under the Common Fisheries Policy, and I am already engaged in an active way with the European Commission and other member sates to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s particular access arrangements and interests as part of the European Union&rsquo;s negotiations.  Should the necessity arise, it will be for the Government of the day to address issues arising from that process and to assess the  application of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements in light of developments at that time.  In the current situation, however, we must amend our legislation so that Ireland meets its obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and so that we continue to co-operate with our neighbours on this island.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The Bill puts the <i>voisinage</i>agreement, concluded by the Governments of Ireland and the UK under the London Fisheries Convention 1964, into primary legislation.  Under the <i>voisinage</i>agreement, Northern Ireland-registered fishing vessels are allowed to fish within Ireland's exclusive fisheries limits within zero to 6 nautical miles of the coast, as the Minister has highlighted, provided that Irish-registered vessels have similar reciprocal rights to fish within the exclusive fisheries limits of UK waters surrounding Northern Ireland.</p><p>The agreement has operated successfully for the past 50 years and has facilitated a number of Irish-owned vessels registered outside the jurisdiction which have territorially fished in exclusive state fishing waters.  The 1964 arrangements also symbolised the harmonious relationship between the North and South on the issue and were the culmination of the visit by the iar-Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, when he met Captain Terence O'Neill, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.  The <i>voisinage</i>agreement was formalised in an exchange of letters between the Governments of the UK and the North and South during the 1960s.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports putting the <i>voisinage</i>agreement on a statutory footing following a Supreme Court judgment last October.  The court ruled there was insufficient provision for these arrangements in domestic law.  It found that fishing by Northern Ireland vessels within the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State which was catered for under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements was not legally permissible.  Under this Bill, a person on board a foreign sea-fishing boat shall not fish or attempt to fish while the boat is within the exclusive fisheries limit of the State unless he or she is on board a sea-fishing boat owned and operated in Northern Ireland while the boat is within the area between zero and six nautical miles.</p><p>Ireland's fisheries sector is an essential part of the Irish economy.  The Irish fisheries sector employs some 11,000 persons in full-time and part-time jobs in coastal communities right around the country.  In 2016 seafood exports alone were valued at &euro;557 million and domestic sales of seafood &euro;239 million.  However, a hard Brexit presents a clear and present danger to the Irish fishing and seafood industry.  Currently, there are strong trade links between both countries.  Seafood imports from the UK in 2015 represented 65% of total imports worth &euro;148 million into the country while Irish seafood exports to the UK represented 13% of total exports or &euro;71 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Irish seafood exports to the United Kingdom constituted 13% of total exports and were valued at &euro;71 million.  <br/><br/>The Government must make fisheries a top priority in future negotiations between the European Union and United Kingdom.  It is imperative that we safeguard Irish interests relating to access to fishing grounds and quota share, including the Hague preferences, while avoiding the erection of trade barriers.  The <i>voisinage</i>agreement must also form part of future Brexit negotiations.  It has been highlighted that the intention of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangement, at all times, was that vessels would be under 75 ft. or 22 m.  If vessel size were an open-ended matter, large vessels registered in Northern Ireland could fish in the six nautical mile zone in which vessels registered in the Republic of Ireland cannot fish.  In such circumstances, these larger vessels would be exploiting the position.  It is important, therefore, that vessel lengths are taken into consideration.<br/><br/>The inshore fishing fleet sustains fishing communities nationwide and the sector comprises more than 80% of the total fishing fleet, consisting of boats of less than 12 m. in length.  In addition, inshore fishing is principally active within six nautical miles of the shore.  For this reason, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will table an amendment to safeguard inshore fisheries by tightening the current restriction on sea fishing boats to not more than 15 m. or 50 ft. in length.  The purpose is to prevent potentially super-size vessels from accessing Irish fishing waters and over-fishing at an unsustainable level in the six nautical mile zone.  We recognise, however, that for this change to take effect, full consultation with the UK authorities will be required to operationalise this condition in both jurisdictions.  We are also aware that the legislation, once passed, will come under the spotlight again during the Brexit negotiations. <br/><br/>I thank my colleague, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, for sharing with me his extensive local knowledge of this matter. </p></speech>

From the perspective of most parties, the idea of providing access to all of the waters off the Irish coast for all fishermen on this island is a welcome one.  I am sure Senators and the Minister will have seen the map I am holding, which shows UK territorial waters coloured in red.  One of the serious concerns presented by the fishing industry, representing all sizes of vessels, is that one disastrous implication of Brexit is that it will deny Irish fishermen access to these waters, as shown in the map presented to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Minister will be fully aware of this issue and I ask him to address these concerns at the conclusion of the debate.  We need to be informed of the Government's strategy towards the British Government on this issue.</p><p>One of the major issues trumpeted by Tory supporters of Brexit was that they would take control of British waters.  It is clear from the map of British waters that Irish fishing communities are justifiably fearful because they will continue to be subject to quotas and controversy will persist over trawlers from other jurisdictions fishing in Irish waters.  I was surprised, therefore, that the Minister decided to introduce this Bill in advance of the commencement of negotiations on Brexit.  This legislation is premature.</p><p>The fishermen who took the legal case that ended up in the Supreme Court have genuine concerns.  Rather than addressing their concerns, however, the Department has a history of using taxpayers' money and the strength that this affords it to fight all the way to the Supreme Court.  The underdogs in this case had to raise significant sums and face serious financial exposure to fund their case.  Their vindication in the Supreme Court was a slap in the face for the Department, whose approach was found not to be embedded in law.  </p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il, want reassurance that this legislation will not result in multinational companies or others using a loophole of residency in the North to plunder the natural resources off the coast, including off County Donegal from where I come.  Incidentally, those who took the case adjudicated in the Supreme Court secured a second victory when it was established that our fisheries are natural resources.  I acknowledge the Minister wishes to protect the livelihood of fishing communities around the Irish coast.  I and other Senators would like an all-Ireland approach to be taken to this issue.  I have no difficulty with small vessels based in County Derry, County Down or elsewhere in the North sharing the waters around the Irish coast and <i>vice versa</i>.  However, I will not tolerate major operations taking advantage of this new legislative opportunity to plunder our natural resources and destroy the livelihoods of fishermen.  </p><p>I am pleased we are only discussing Second Stage as it allows the Minister to reflect on some of the issues before Committee Stage.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Fianna F&aacute;il Party amendment.  I hope it will protect and address the concern I have articulated.  I ask the Minister to explain the reason he has moved so swiftly with this legislation, which appears to be premature, particularly given the threat Brexit poses to our fishing communities and the statement by the British Government that it will take control of UK waters.  I would like to understand what is the Government's strategy on this issue.  </p><p>The idea of all fishing communities in the Thirty-two Counties making collective use of the waters around this island is laudable.  However, if it is the case that the playing pitch is not even and fishermen in the North will have access, post-Brexit, to all UK waters, fishing communities in the Twenty-six Counties will be squeezed.  I would like assurances from the British Government on how it proposes to protect historical fishing rights.  The Minister stated he wishes to place the <i>voisinage</i>agreement on a legislative footing and continue with the <i>status quo,</i>which appears to be a laudable objective.  However, the difficulty has been that multinational companies and major operators in the fishing industry started to fish mussel beds in Irish waters and the impact on the fishermen's livelihoods here was such that they were willing to take a case all the way to the Supreme Court.  This must have required a horrendous financial outlay.  </p><p>How will the Minister ensure the legislation does not contain loopholes?  Will it provide that only small craft will be able to move back and forth, a premise to which no one will object?  The Government is offering a generous arrangement to fishermen and, arguably, to the UK Government.  What is the reciprocal agreement?  What is the British Government offering?  Has it given an undertaking to address our concerns regarding the red area on the map to which I referred?</p><p>A great deal of clarification is needed and much more work must be done before the Minister will be able to secure the support of both Houses.  The sooner this is done, the better.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-08a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030800002#OO00800"><p>There is no big mystery here.  The legislation takes an all-Ireland approach, dealing specifically with Northern Ireland without referring to Britain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It recognises the <i>voisinage</i>arrangement which has been the <i>status quo</i>since the 1960s and the reciprocal arrangement is that fishermen from the Republic will be able to exercise the same rights.  The legislation in itself will not set out the conditions, and additional measures will be required to flesh that out to ensure fishing is done in a proper and appropriate way by anybody in a Northern Irish vessel coming within the 6 km zone in Irish waters.  I agree completely that fishing should be carried on in a responsible and sustainable way.  What we are seeing here is legislation that reflects a <i>status quo</i>in circumstances where there was a gap in the law.  It addresses the long-standing tradition of co-operation between North and South in respect of fishing.  That is not to diminish any concerns about over-fishing or industrial boats doing what they should not.  That cannot be condoned.<br/><br/>While I welcome the regularisation of the position, we do not want any side issues.  The big issue here is Brexit.  A previous speaker showed us the map in that regard.  This is a very scary prospect for fishermen because we know, most of us being on the agriculture committee, that fishermen differ somewhat from farmers in that they are not so dependent on Britain for an export market.  They actually depend on British territorial waters to catch fish in the first place.  Approximately 32% of the catch by the Irish fleet comes from British territorial waters.  If a particular scenario saw the British withdraw completely from the Common Fisheries Policy, it would be an appalling vista for our fishermen who would not be able to get in and make a catch.  Coupled with that would be challenges to fisheries management and sustainability.  We already know that fisheries and our fishing stock are under challenge from climate change.  That is both our sea and inland fisheries.  The nature of fish is that they do not care too much about boundaries and territorial waters.  They swim where they will.  As such, we need international co-operation, in particular from our nearest neighbours or else the UK and Northern Irish fishermen might herald Brexit as a bonanza.  If they fail to respect environmental considerations and quotas, any bonus they get will be short lived.  There will be no fish there and we will have an even bigger problem.<br/><br/>There are many realities that must bite here and be taken into account.  I am sure the Minister will give consideration to the deliberations of the joint committee and to the evidence and testimony provided by the fishing industry and fisheries organisations.  They have serious concerns and face serious problems in respect of the industry's capacity to survive a worst-case scenario.  They should be given the assurance that the very best is being done to safeguard their interests.  A particular proposal from the joint committee related to concerns about the Hague preferences.  The committee said that if we had a proper system of quota allocation in the first place, we would not have to apply the Hague preferences.  This is something that might be addressed by the Minister in terms of how we go forward.  The Minister might speak to some of the issues around Brexit which are really serious and on which we should be concentrating to help our fishermen.</p></speech>

The Labour Party has some concerns about the proposed legislation.  From the perspective of greater clarity and public scrutiny, I am pleased we will have a Committee Stage at a later point.  The legislation could benefit from that process.  I look forward to some of our concerns being addressed or assuaged in some way during that process.</p><p>The Minister has given the House a potted history of where we have come from and where we are going now.  A gentlemen's agreement with no foundation, input or oversight from the Oireachtas was formulated in the 1950s and 1960s and is now to be given full legislative effect.  However, I have some words of warning for the Minister.  That this &quot;nod and a wink&quot; arrangement drafted many years ago suited the climate in the 1950s and 1960s does not mean it should be codified in law now.  We cannot really appreciate why this exchange of letters took place almost 60 years ago without understanding the political context of the time.  It was a classic Irish solution to an Irish problem at that moment in time.  It suited official Ireland at that time to allow Northern Irish fishing vessels to fish with impunity in Irish inshore waters.  We must remember that the State at that time maintained a constitutional claim over the Six Counties.  That claim is gone having been removed from the Constitution by popular vote almost 20 years ago.  Ireland is a very different place now and the fishing industry is very different.  The rules are different and the business is very different indeed.</p><p>The fishing industry is under considerable pressure from many angles, including the effects of substantial fishing in Irish waters by Northern Irish vessels.  In recent years, there has been very aggressive dredging of mussel beds to plunder mussel seed from Irish territorial waters.  This cannot be allowed to continue unchallenged.  It is not co-operation as characterised by some speakers, and communities are living with the consequences.  I make no apologies for saying that we should protect our natural resources in the Republic because we are answerable to the people and communities here in terms of how we do our business.  That is the Minister's job and it is my job.  It is the job of everyone in the House.</p><p>Even if we are minded to support the Bill at some point, its text appears weaker even that the terms used in the <i>voisinage</i>agreement.  The term &quot;Northern Ireland owned and operated&quot; is imprecise and there is a view at large that in its interpretation it could be exploited and abused.  It is said to be even weaker than the previous term which referred to vessels owned and operated by fishermen permanently resident in the Six Counties.  Much of the dredging done by Northern Irish vessels in the waters of the Irish Republic is carried out by vessels owned in many cases by foreign-owned firms.  Surely, codifying this arrangement in law should not be about enriching foreign investors.  Since November 2016 and arising from the Barlow judgment of the Supreme Court, it continues to be unlawful for Northern Irish vessels to fish for mussel seed in inshore waters of the Irish Republic.  I have no difficulty with that continuing to be the case.</p><p>We should move very cautiously on this.  I am glad we will have Committee Stage and that it will not be taken today because of our intervention.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which concerns me.  It is a process we introduced in the previous term and legislation always benefits from a high level of scrutiny before it is introduced in either House.  Why we are codifying the <i>voisinage</i>agreement in Irish law in advance of the commencement of Brexit negotiations and, as it were, showing our hand beats me for all of the reasons pointed out by Senator Mac Lochlainn.  If the Irish fishing industry is in difficulty now, it could very well be in even more difficulty in the future, notwithstanding the very strong work the Minister will do to defend the interests of the Irish fishing industry.</p><p>I am concerned to have heard from the IFPO that it has been formally consulted on this only in recent days.  From my experience as a Minister of State for a period of time, I know there are certain entities which might be described as &quot;statutory partners&quot; who should always be consulted in detail on important legislation like this before it emerges from the relevant Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From what I have been told, it appears to be the case that the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO, has not been consulted up to now on this impactful legislation that could ultimately end up negatively affecting coastal communities and the fishing industry which is currently under pressure. </p></speech>

Fishermen would not have gone to the Supreme Court lightly and exposed themselves to such huge costs if they were not sincerely concerned about this matter.  Unfortunately, we have a history of throwing fishermen under the bus and destroying their livelihoods.  That is not a criticism of any single party, it is just historically correct.  Fishermen did badly when Ireland joined the EEC and since then every Minister for agriculture has been trying to pull back from that and give them a livelihood.</p> <p>I come from Ringsend which was known locally as "Raytown" because ray was so plentiful and was sold for little or nothing in the village.  Ringsend College was original established as a marine school to teach local young people the skills to fish on trawlers.  That industry has been totally wiped out there now, although there are still fishermen in north and south County Dublin.  We must try to correct the situation and ensure that inshore fishermen have a livelihood.</p> <p>I am glad that because of our intervention we will get to discuss the Bill on Committee Stage, but I would have preferred to have pre-legislative scrutiny of the measure.  In that way we could have invited witnesses in to test the legislation.  The least fishermen deserve is to be heard at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage in order to ensure that we are doing the best for them.  Life is tough now for fishermen who are struggling hard to survive.  They were brave to go to the Supreme Court and challenge this.  </p> <p>Many fishermen to whom I have spoken do not think this is a good neighbour agreement, they just see themselves losing out badly as a result of it.  My party would support the Minister if he could take this Bill back for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Let us make sure that we are doing right by the fishermen all around our coasts.</p></speech>

Given the forthcoming Brexit negotiations, I feel that this legislation is premature.  As Senator Humphreys said, proper scrutiny of the Bill needs to take place.  I am afraid that the Bill is a bit shoddy.  I have heard from fishermen who feel they were not consulted.  We live on an island that has 7,500 km of coastline with a great ocean wealth around us, but in recent decades Irish fishermen have had a really bad deal.  I know that from fishermen in Dunmore East where I am from, and in the south-east region generally.  They have suffered and are still suffering hardship, and feel they are losing out.</p> <p>Every emphasis should be on ensuring that there are no loopholes in this legislation which could cost the livelihoods of families and communities involved in the fishing industry.  We are at the early stages of this Bill but I will be putting massive energy into this debate.  Fishermen need support and respect.  The Government has supported the agricultural sector but possibly at some cost to the fisheries sector.  </p> <p>The Bill is premature and I wish the Minister would hold off until the Brexit negotiations commence.  I am representing the Civil Engagement group which feels strongly about this issue.  Members of the group have asked me to express their opposition to the Bill.  The new legislation means that millions of euro worth of Irish shellfish would be taken out of Irish waters by British companies.  There has been little or no consultation with Irish fishermen on this Bill.  There is strong anger and opposition to allowing other vessels fish in our waters.  </p> <p>In the Supreme Court, Irish fishermen successfully challenged the Minister's practice of permitting some British vessels to fish inside a sea area specially designated for Irish fishing boats.  This activity was undermining Irish sovereignty and putting Irish vessels out of business.  A policy of setting aside the law and not prosecuting these British vessels was found to be an unlawful practice by a panel of six Supreme Court judges.  This new Bill once again provides for a British vessel to fish up to the shore all around our coast, and not be liable to prosecution for doing so.  There is no clarity on what vessels will avail of this new provision and no impact assessment of how this unqualified fishing will impact on the smaller national fleet that relies so heavily on the inner six-mile zone.</p> <p>Irish fishermen do not want this arrangement at all, as evidenced by presentations to that effect which have been made by various organisations to the Minister.  They opposed the arrangement when it was first put in place as an agreement not to prosecute in the 1960s and 1970s, and more recently as evidenced by the 2016 case.  They see no benefit to the taxpayer or to fishermen from this.  In fact, it will result in job losses and millions of euro in lost revenue for Ireland.</p> <p>They also say that it will be abused by large international companies that can claim a tenuous link to Northern Ireland and that will act ruthlessly in exploiting other countries' resources.  Fishermen feel they are being mistreated by our own Government for some unclear political objective.  They fully support maintaining good relations with their neighbours, but argue that this should not be at the cost of a small group of citizens who have complied with the law.  They have invested heavily, while their businesses have been ruined and their livelihoods taken away.  They have been given no explanation why the Government insists on proceeding on this basis.</p> <p>The Minister should engage with the fishermen, as Senators will do in the coming weeks, with regard to this legislation.  We will engage far more with them and hopefully we will have a more meaningful debate on Committee Stage.  However, I am not too happy with this legislation as it stands.</p></speech>

I was listening to some of the debate in my office and I agree with a lot of what has been said.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Mac Lochlainn, from Donegal on his concerns about the Bill.  I remember tabling an amendment to sea-fisheries legislation in the last Seanad concerning the penalty points system and bringing in a new regime for a carding system.  In that way, deciphering could be done between Irish and foreign vessels.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, indicated favourably that he would examine the possibility of introducing such legislation.  I thought this Bill would address some of the concerns but unfortunately it has not.  In fact, it raises concerns rather than addressing them.</p> <p>Fishermen in Donegal and elsewhere have contacted me about this Bill to express their concerns.  They went out on a limb to protect their own interests by taking a case to the Supreme Court.  A ruling was given, which prompted this Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The origin of the Bill is clearly the need to address this outstanding issue. </p><p>Irish territorial waters were defined in an agreement reached in London in 1964 and in the Common Fisheries Policy of 1973 when distances of six and 12 nautical miles were set.  This Bill relates to Irish coastal waters within six nautical miles of the coast.  It will have a particular impact on County Donegal because British vessels may, for beneficial purposes, register in the North and utilise or exploit a resource, which, under our Constitution, should be available to Irish vessels only.  I echo some of the questions that have been asked on this issue.</p><p>Brexit is a complicating factor which was also raised by previous speakers.  Analysis carried out by the British Government in the aftermath of the referendum on Brexit found that the vast majority of fishermen in small fishing communities in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  When asked to explain their reasons for doing so, they cited a desire to regain ownership of British waters.  This issue is a complicating factor for us, as it will affect fishermen in Killybegs and other ports.  I am not sure if the complexity of Brexit has been brought to bear in the Bill but I have expressed the concerns people have on this matter. </p><p>I support the amendment that will be proposed on Committee Stage.  A distinction must always be made between vessels of less than 15 m. in length and larger vessels because 80% of the Irish fleet are below 15 m. in length.  These vessels should be recognised and protected through special provisions.</p><p>I share the view of previous speakers that the Bill is premature.  What level of consultation took place with the fishing industry, including small fishermen?  Will the Bill have economic implications for the small inshore fleet?  Has a regulatory impact assessment been carried out and, if not, why not?  What will be the economic impact on the small inshore fleet of implementing this legislation?</p></speech>

Irish sea fishing boats still enjoy access to the coastal waters of Northern Ireland under the voisinage arrangements.  However, in light of a Supreme Court judgment, fishing by Northern Ireland vessels in the territorial waters of this State is not currently permitted by law.  There is an urgent need to address this matter in order to provide for reciprocity.  This is one of the critical driving forces behind the Bill because, as matters stand, boats from the Republic of Ireland can fish in Northern Irish waters, while boats from Northern Ireland cannot fish in our waters.  This is one of the reasons for the urgency in addressing this matter.</p><p>The Bill proposes to address the findings of the Supreme Court by providing a legal framework for the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  This would restore the arrangements which have provided reciprocal fishing access for fishermen in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland for more than 50 years.  Together with the associated measures to which I referred, the Bill will re-establish the <i>status quo</i>for fishing access that existed under the arrangements in place before the Supreme Court judgment of 27 October 2016.  It will also restore an important area of North-South co-operation. </p><p>I will address a number of the issues Senators raised.  Brexit was a common thread running through all the contributions.  If I have seen the map Senator Mac Lochlainn presented to the House once, I have seen it a thousand times.  Every picture speaks a thousand words and the map is the most graphic manifestation of the challenge Brexit presents.  One could ask what the connection is between Brexit and this debate.  The critical connection is that we catch 38% by volume of our entire fishing endeavour in the red zone which marks United Kingdom territorial waters.  In terms of value, however, particularly in the context of pelagic fisheries based in County Donegal, the figure is much higher than 38%.  In excess of 40% of scallops, for example, which are the second most valuable fishing resource we have, are caught by Irish vessels in UK territorial waters. </p><p>A hard Brexit involving the UK pulling up the drawbridge and taking all its territorial waters would deal a severe blow to the Irish fishing industry.  This is, therefore, a strategic matter.  Legislation can be revisited after it has passed.  It would be strategically foolish, however, to gratuitously offend by not providing for the reciprocity associated with the voisinage arrangements, while, on the other hand, trying to negotiate the best possible outcome for our fishing industry in the context of Brexit.  I have met various parties at this stage to discuss Brexit.  For example, we had highly informative sectoral dialogue with the industry and I have engaged in consultations with producer organisations, both individually and collectively, as has the Taoiseach.  I have met representatives of the fishing industry in all its manifestations, including processors.  Only this week, I met the Scottish Minister with responsibility for fisheries, which was an interesting engagement.  It struck me that the Scottish National Party would in some respects like to remain in the European Union, albeit outside of the Common Fisheries Policy, which is an interesting position.  </p></speech>

Vessels from many countries fish in the red zone marked on Senator Mac Lochlainn's map.  While we may regularly disagree at December Council meetings about what is strategically the best approach for individual industries, we have a significant common platform on Brexit and we are trying to negotiate that.</p><p>It is also strategic to recognise the connection here.  Reciprocity is the fundamental basis of the <i>voisinage</i>agreement, under which Irish fishermen can go North and Northern fishermen can come South.  Currently, however, we can go North and fish within six nautical miles of the coast, whereas fishermen from the North are legally prevented from fishing in our waters.  Prior to 27 October 2016, a reciprocal arrangement applied and we should not lightly dismiss the principle of reciprocity.</p><p>We should also be conscious of the linkage in place in the context of the deal we are trying to negotiate at EU level on Brexit.  The right thing to do is to pass legislation to provide for the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  It is an example of a partitionist mentality to describe boats owned by Irish fishermen in Northern Ireland as British boats.  In many cases, these boats have been registered by people living in the Republic for a variety of reasons.  We must see the big picture because there are many different manifestations of registration.  We must bear in mind the fundamental principle of reciprocity which allows our fishermen to go North under the same terms as Northern fishermen could come South until 27 October last.  However, Northern fishermen no longer have a legal basis for coming South, whereas Southern fishermen can still fish off the Northern coast under the arrangements in place under the London convention agreed in the 1960s.  That is the critical issue.  The amendment in Senator Paul Daly's name will be debated on Committee Stage.  </p><p>Other speakers raised issues of sustainability, mussel seed, etc.  The Marine Stewardship Council, MSC, issues a sustainability badge which retailers, in particular, seek when selling produce on the supermarket shelves.  This MSC label is sought after because it is the badge of sustainability and one which is not easy to obtain.  A significant number of players in the mussel industry have achieved authenticity in terms of sustainability.  The mussel fishery is jointly managed by the authorities in the Republic and Northern Ireland and closed and open seasons apply.  </p> Snippet Ref No: SS00100 ... Edit Snippet  |  Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Heading  |  Quick Edit   [Procedural Text] [Instruction - No]  There are assessment agencies, for example, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  Pillage of the resource is not allowed and is in no one's interests.  There is a management process.  Obviously, we are discussing more than just the mussel industry, but I appreciate that it is a significant player, given the stakes involved.  Neither we nor the authorities in Northern Ireland have an interest in having a feast and a famine.  We must manage the fishery which is an integral part of what happens in the open season, the closed season, stock assessments, etc., which is as it should be.  BIM, the Marine Institute, my Department, Northern departmental officials and forum consultations with the industry form part of that management process.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan made a point with which I disagree on agriculture being promoted at the expense of fisheries.  Over its lifetime the rural development programme will have European funding of &euro;220 million for the fishing industry.  It is a remarkable vote of confidence that, in the teeth of a challenge for it that is as significant as Brexit, the industry is stepping forward and investing in new product development, processing facilities and a range of initiatives that the programme is funding at a record level.  It is backed by the European Union and the Exchequer on a scale that has never been envisaged before and in conjunction with capital investment.  For example, there has been significant capital investment in difficult times in the six State-owned harbours from Killybegs to Castletownbere and all points in between.  That is as it should be, as these harbours are a critical part of our infrastructure.  Senator Kevin Humphreys stated the industry had been short-changed when we joined the European Union in 1972.  I have heard that point being made repeatedly.  Interestingly, the industry is multiple times larger than it was at the time in terms of the tonnage landed, the added value delivered and the jobs it supports in marginalised communities where there are not many other employment opportunities.  It is not, however, an industry without difficulties, but it has significant potential if given the proper legal and economic frameworks.  Critical to achieving that potential is quota access.  Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn raised this matter in the context of the threats posed by Brexit: access to UK territorial waters, its quota share and displacement.  Even in the teeth of these issues, the industry is still putting up its hand, for which I salute it, and stating it has confidence in its ongoing development of products, processing facilities, etc.  Securing the best possible outcome is a challenge.  If people believe the European Union and the CAP are complicated, the Common Fisheries Policy is the most miasmic tapestry one could ever imagine.  Trying to unravel it by picking out the United Kingdom poses a considerable challenge.  The United Kingdom has a strong hand, but if we negotiate Brexit collectively and in the broadest context of the EU trade environment, we can deliver the best possible outcome for the industry.  I have listened to the detail of Senators' points, but I ask Members to bear in mind the simple point of reciprocity.  We are only giving what we have received from the other side.  The Supreme Court's judgment is interesting.  Among a number of the justices who commented, Mr. Justice O'Donnell called the cross-Border approach to fisheries "an important area of cooperation between the jurisdictions."  He also stated there was "much to applaud" and that such co-operation was "arguably an implementation of the constitutional provisions which have been in place since 1999, which expressly contemplate cross-border cooperation in a number of areas."  The Good Friday Agreement specifically mentions aquaculture and fisheries as sectors in which there is potential for co-operation.  This is about bridge building and co-operation.  We have come through the sectarian head count of the election in Northern Ireland.  It is when we step outside the straitjacket and discuss issues of collective, cross-Border concern that equally are cross-community issues, for example, economic issues or concerns about an industry, that we can make progress.  At the heart of the legislation is the question of reciprocity.  The fundamental point is that are not changing anything that did not exist before 27 October.  We can debate the detail of the matter.  I take Senator Gerald Nash's point about pre-legislative scrutiny and have consulted the industry via correspondence.  We did not undertake the formal pre-legislative scrutiny process because the Bill does not change anything fundamentally that did not exist before 27 October.  We are not breaking new ground or introducing something that is substantially different.  Granted, the Bill creates a legislative framework, but it is only legislating for that which existed on a non-legislative basis.  I appreciate the Senator's wry smile, but I am open to engaging in that dialogue on Committee Stage.  At its heart, the Bill is about reciprocity.  I hope I have not missed any Senator's points, but I commend the legislation to the House.  We will have a detailed conversation on Committee Stage.Snippet Ref No: SS00200 ...
