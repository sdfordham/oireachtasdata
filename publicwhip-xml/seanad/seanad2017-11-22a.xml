    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#H00200"><p>We welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, is coming before the House to address the issues that are so much in the public eye at the moment.  Of course, she is well regarded and well respected in this House for her work as a Senator, a Deputy and a Minister, but there are questions to be answered.  This matter goes to the fundamentals of justice in the State.  That is, whether a person who acts in the public interest is protected or is persecuted by the State.  The strategy of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those who were involved in Sergeant McCabe's case was to go after him.  Their purpose was not to find the truth; they did not want the truth, they wanted to go after him.  That was meant as a lesson to others who might speak up when there is wrongdoing in the force.</p> <p>This gives rise to a problem for the State because if people who know the truth and who know that something is being done wrong and needs to be corrected do not speak out, then the wrong will continue.  We have whistleblower legislation.  Instead of protecting whistleblowers, it should be encouraging them.  However, it does not do that.  The message this affair sends from the State, the establishment and the permanent government is that people should not speak out.  Those who do speak out will end up like Sergeant McCabe.</p> <p>Hopefully, questions regarding the relevant email and who knew what and when will be answered, light will be shone upon this matter and we will find the truth.  The fact that the Garda took an adversarial approach to the hearings, rather than trying to discover what actually happened to Sergeant McCabe, recalls the Spanish Inquisition.  The T&aacute;naiste stated in the Lower House that they were not adversarial hearings but were, rather, inquisitorial in nature.  They were not.  They were the equivalent of the Spanish Inquisition.  A warped legal strategy was pursued by the Garda against Sergeant McCabe in order to silence him.  That was wrong.</p> <p>This is not just about Sergeant McCabe, however, it is also about people who know the truth.  Unfortunately, when people do not speak out, issues such as those relating to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service arise.  In that instance, 1,600 women were infected with Hepatitis C.  People knew what had happened but there were not consequences those who knew and did not act.  For those who suppressed the truth and did not act, there were no consequences.  If the Irish Blood Transfusion Service scandal happened today, nobody would go to prison.  The Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2016, which would lead to people being put in prison and against which the Minister for Justice and Equality argued in this House, has still not been progressed.  It is beyond belief that people who knew that women were being infected have not been prosecuted.</p> <p>I am glad that the T&aacute;naiste will be coming before the House later today.  I have great respect for her.  However, even the Taoiseach stated last night that Sergeant McCabe was wronged by the State on a number of occasions.  The Taoiseach used the past tense.  The email was only sent to the commission yesterday.  This is ongoing persecution of a man who should be supported, protected - at the very least - and encouraged by the State.  I thank the Leader of the House for organising the debate that will take place later.  This matter goes to the fundamentals of how the State protects those who know the truth and speak out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#H00400"><p>I agree with much of what my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, said.  We in this country have a tendency to try to bury the truth.  If that fails, we go on a witch-hunt and pursue the wrongdoers.  When it gets too close for comfort, the wrongdoers resign, take their pensions or go off and get an important job somewhere else.  Everybody then sits back and it just rolls over and over.  My office is dealing with a case whereby one particular agency that has done everything possible to stifle an investigation.  I will not mention either the case or the State agency involved, other than to say that even the investigations of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda are being frustrated by it.</p> <p>The approach that is always taken is to deny everything until it is necessary to make an admission and then go on a witch-hunt to try to find somebody to blame.  If that person is somebody at the top, the attitude is to give him or her a pension, get him or her out of there quick and then matters return to where they stood before everything began.</p> <p>Senator Norris spoke about freedom of speech yesterday.  During the relevant debate, there was some discussion of social media.  I spoke against former Senator Lorraine Higgins's Harmful and Malicious Electronic Communications Bill 2015, the purpose of which was to allow for the curtailment of social media, when she brought it before the previous Seanad.  I have some regrets in that regard.  It is no secret that I spend a fair amount of time on Twitter.  I have been personally attacked by professional people and the most outrageous lies have been told about me.  I asked for a debate on a particularly sensitive subject and I have been attacked by obstetricians, nurses and doctors, some of whom have very high public profiles.  They say the most outrageous things simply because they can do so.  They steer very close to libel, but never go over the line.</p> <p>I agree with what was said yesterday.  The organisations responsible for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and similar platforms must start taking responsibility for what is published on their pages.  I could not care less about what is said to me.  If someone was of a weak disposition or had mental health issues, these people would drive him or her to jump into the ocean.  They would drive a person to commit suicide because they can say whatever the hell they want.  We need to discuss social media in this House.  I am not sure exactly how we will bring Twitter, Facebook, etc., to heel.  These are large employers and fear is that if we try to curtail their operations, they might run out of the country.  However, the public has a right to be protected from what goes on.  To these faceless cowards and bullies on Twitter, I say, "Bring it on guys.  I'm ready for you any time you want."  I am quite willing to take these individuals on but not everybody is able to do that.  Perhaps the Leader might consider inviting the Minister for Justice and Equality to come before the House in order that we might discuss this matter with him.</p></speech>

It just so happens that it was a neighbour of mine, Mary Comber from Scanlon Park in Castleconnell, who was featured.  She is the poor lady who had to sell her jewellery in order to pay for a cataract operation that the State would not provide for her.  I want to ask the question as to how we got here.  Let us be very clear: we did not land in the situation whereby public patients are obliged to wait for years while private patients can skip queues and get the treatment they want by accident.  This is the result of long-standing Government policy.  It has been the policy of not just Fine Gael but also Fianna F&aacute;il when in government.  Both parties have always favoured private consultants and that is why we have a health system that is led by private consultants.  The system should be delivered by these people but, instead, it is led by them.</p> <p>I want to nail one particular argument that I have heard already this morning, namely, that it is just a small number of consultants who are taking advantage.  It is much more than that.  The HSE, for example, is completely remiss in not overseeing compliance.  It stopped collating statistics on the percentage of work that is done by private consultants in 2014.  Then we have the fundamental problem that the way hospitals are funded encourages them to get private consultants to do more work in order to make up the funding gaps that exist.  Of course, for the consultants, it is money in their back pockets.</p> <p>What this issue clearly demonstrates is the need to get the private sector out of our public hospital system.  We should all ensure that the latter is our policy.  We should also ensure that the shameful and long-standing situation whereby people have to wait and take second place because their wallets are not big enough no longer obtains.  I would like to hear some contrition from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.  This did not happen by accident.  They have allowed a situation to arise whereby a woman had to sell her jewellery in order to fund an operation.  It is time that Fine Gael in particular moved away from supporting the rich consultants and rediscovered a belief in public health care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->  The second issue that I want to raise today, and I wanted to raise it yesterday, is the disgraceful treatment of an Irish soccer player called Cyrus Christie at the weekend.  It is shocking that racism is still part of soccer in Ireland.  I was fortunate enough to see a young Chris Hughton play soccer in Tottenham.  In 1979, he became the first mixed-race player to represent the Republic of Ireland.  He is still a great ambassador for our country and for sport in general.</p></speech>

The problem is also widespread in our society.  I would go so far as to say that every political party in this country has members who hold racist views.  I would like a debate on racism.  It would afford us an opportunity to send a united message that people who abuse great men like Cyrus Christie have no place in sport or anywhere else in our society.</p></speech>

The first issue concerns the T&aacute;naiste and an email.  There is no doubt in my mind that when the email arrived in the Department of Justice and Equality it should have raised a red flag.  When I performed a quick search on my computer this morning I discovered that there were nearly 50 articles in the previous month about Garda Maurice McCabe.  If the email did not raise a red flag then I do not know what would.  We are quickly moving from a red flag situation to a red card for the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p>Yesterday, we suggested that the T&aacute;naiste should come to this House and I am glad to see that she will be here this evening.   For a long time I have been dissatisfied with only having statements on these issues.  I would much prefer if we adopted a question and answer format.  I would like the group leaders to consider my suggestion but with the same time constraints.</p> <p>Like my previous colleague, I want to refer to the "Prime Time" programme aired last night.  Recently we have read in the newspapers that as many as 8,500 people await cataract surgery but in one case a consultant has worked just 13 hours per week in the public system, and this is at a time when most consultants are paid a salary of between &euro;113,000 and &euro;229,000.  On a regular basis private consultants defraud the HSE by amounts ranging from &euro;14,000 to &euro;20,000.  They are only a tiny minority but the number adds up.</p> <p>In 2015, the head of the HSE said that the 80:20 split practice had become "a farce".  We have serious management issues within the HSE.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to this House for a proper debate, using a question and answer format, on the management of the HSE.  I know of a case in Waterford where a GP regularly sends patients to the local accident and emergency unit for tests because there is no access to consultants.  That situation is duplicated across the country.  We have a shortage in the number of consultants, doctors and nurses who work in our hospitals but we also have an enormous problem with HSE management.  The number of management staff has increased in huge numbers and far beyond the number of additional doctors that have been recruited for the health service.  We have a crisis in management but we have had it for a long time.  Ever since the HSE monster was created the health service has deteriorated.  I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on HSE management and on how hospitals are managed in this country. </p></speech>

A number of people from an estate in Limerick have informed me that they have been told by an independent assessor that there is pyrite in their houses.  When I contacted the Pyrite Resolution Board I was told that it does not cover the areas of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare, Meath, Offaly or South Dublin, or Dublin City Council and, therefore, cannot fix the problem.  The board's terms and conditions were set in 2013.  Pyrite is a serious problem and occurs in houses located around the country.  A number of houses in the estate in Limerick have been identified as having pyrite.  Therefore, I believe the Act needs to be amended.  I call on the Minister concerned to contact the board in order to expand its terms and conditions.</p></speech>

It reduced the number of chances to become a millionaire from six opportunities per year down to only four last year and to two commencing from August 2017.  The interest to be paid on prize bonds was reduced from 0.85% to 0.5%.  In 2016, it was 1.25%.  At present there is &euro;3 billion in prize bonds that is used by the State for essential services.  A draw for a prize of &euro;50,000 tax free takes place every week and only twice a year, in June and December, the prize is &euro;1 million tax free.  The draw should be brought into the public domain using television.  As RT&Eacute; has the national lottery, I believe TV3 should broadcast a public draw on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

We must all try to do something about the homeless situation.  I suggest that prize bonds are renamed the housing prize bonds as it would encourage people to invest their money.  People feel very helpless because as many as 3,000 children and their families are without a home in this capital.  The National Treasury Management Agency has shown little innovation.  Where has it looked outside of the box or been forward thinking?</p> <p>I recommend that we have a savings bond as opposed to a prize bond that allows people to invest and earn a reasonable rate of interest.  At present the banks nearly charge people for saving with them.  I suggest that the NTMA creates a ten-year bond that pays 1.5% or more in interest or whatever is available.</p> <p>There is goodwill and a lot of money in this country.  Someone has claimed that people may have saved as much as &euro;100 billion in different locations.  We should get that money back in the economy and use it to solve homelessness by building social housing.  The initiative would activate the construction industry.  A great many people feel helpless but luckily people love to support charities such as the Peter McVerry fund.  It would be great if people could invest their money in housing savings bonds and were paid a reasonable amount of interest.  In fact, it has almost reached the stage where banks charge people for keeping their savings.  Without doubt, we are a very wealthy country.  Let those who have the money invest in either prize bonds or savings bonds that are dedicated to alleviating homelessness and building social housing.</p></speech>

They are hunted down and targeted, and many young children are distressed and upset by this.  Several of them, including some as young as ten, have died by suicide.  We are dealing with it to some extent at the committee on children and youth affairs.</p> <p>I want to raise statements on statements, following the topic raised by Senator Humphreys.  Last week, we had statements on health, but the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, did not answer any questions posed on the recruitment and retention of staff in the health care sector.  In her reply she said she would address all points raised via email or letter but this did not happen.</p> <p>Last night, we debated Second Stage of legislation on health insurance and risk equalisation.  Given the topical nature of this issue, with regard to the programme on RT&Eacute; last night which I raised yesterday, it was surprising we had the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  I know there are issues with getting Ministers to the House but we do not get any answers to the questions raised.</p> <p>I wished to table an amendment to the health insurance legislation but I needed to do so immediately because all Stages of the Bill are being taken this week.  I asked the Minister of State to address the question regarding the levies to be introduced in the legislation and whether insurance companies are monitored with regard to hiking up premiums.  I was told this would be dealt with by email, but I did not have the time to wait for an email because I needed to table the amendment.

Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ross, might come in and outline what strategy, if any, he has to deal with the continual and worrying slide in visitor numbers from the UK to this country.  The latest CSO figures confirm the bad news and the trend which has been ongoing for more than 12 months.</p> <p>In the peak summer season, which is key for people in the tourism industry, British visitor numbers were down by more than 7.5%.  I am glad to say this was somewhat offset by an increase in visitor numbers from the rest of Europe of approximately 2%, and a significant increase in North American visitors of more than 12%.  None the less, British visitors represent a major percentage of our total visitor numbers, and studies have shown the spend of British visitors is larger in real terms than that of visitors from other countries.</p> <p>British visitors tend to go to all parts of Ireland.  They are quite intrepid and do not just focus on Kerry, Dublin or Kilkenny.  They go along the Wild Atlantic Way and the interesting walks we have in Ireland.  Almost 250,000 people work in our tourism sector.  The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation has said the Minister would want to provide an emergency fund of &euro;20 million to offset what has already taken place.  It makes a very strong case.  Will the Leader try to get a specific debate on tourism and the British angle specifically?</p></speech>

One has to respect Deputy Gerry Adams for the way in which he drew Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in away from the gun and violence, and in so doing he had the very difficult task of facing down the hard men in his own group.</p><p>Therefore, it was with some surprise and sadness I heard him refer to the late Martin McGuinness as a proud IRA man.  There is nothing much to be proud of in the IRA's record.  My friends in Sinn F&eacute;in in this House are among the best contributors to debate in the Seanad.  They are quite remarkable.  They are very hard-working, very balanced and very left wing, which I like.  For them, the future must be to distance themselves from the gun.  They are clearly capable of change.</p><p>I was sentenced to death by Sinn F&eacute;in or the provisional movement many years ago.  I ignored it.  I went round and interviewed Mr. Joe Cahill in its headquarters.  Nothing happened or, at least if it did, as Brendan Behan said, they carried out the death sentence <i>in absentia</i>.  They can change.  They were violently homophobic 30 or 40 years ago.  They were terrible.  They have changed and become among the most prominent promoters of gay rights and I salute them for this.

I am sure we will bring it to the next Ard Comhairle meeting for discussion.</p> <p>Often, when we raise housing issues, the Leader lambastes us with figures of allocations from Rebuilding Ireland and all the moneys being made available for housing.  No doubt he will probably come back today once I have finished my piece.  For me, the facts and figures on housing are how many houses have actually been built and how many people are in them.</p> <p>Reports yesterday show that since the start of 2016, local authorities have built just 430 properties, and new analysis shows that local authorities are using just a fraction of the land they own to build social housing.  It is estimated that local authorities throughout the country own more than 1,200 ha of land with the potential for almost 38,000 homes.  I am particularly perturbed that at the bottom of the league once again are Galway City Council and Galway County Council, which built zero houses in the city and county in that time, even though we have massive waiting lists and it is a big issue.  Our neighbours in Mayo are a little bit better as they built one house in that time.</p> <p>It defies logic that we have local authorities sitting on banks of serviced land with the potential to build houses.  The Leader tells us buckets of money are available but the local authorities are just not building houses.  We have people ringing our offices every day of the week distraught because they have no homes to live in and they are being put into homelessness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All the talk needs to stop and we need to see much more action.

It has started a new campaign on Traveller community accommodation, which is an absolute disgrace across the country.  We had huge fanfare on 1 March when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, recognised Traveller ethnicity and all the wonderful words around that.  However, Monday's conference, which was attended by Peter McVerry, heard harrowing stories of the appalling conditions of Travellers in substandard illegal halting sites because of a lack of accommodation from local authorities, etc.  I call for a debate on Traveller accommodation.  I note only one politician bothered to attend that campaign launch and there are no prizes for guessing who that was.</p></speech>

As was rightly said at the launch, this document is a starting point for debate and discussion on a sector that is in severe crisis.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House so that we can initiate that debate by bringing the report before the House as soon as possible.  As a number of speakers have said this morning, I would like on that occasion to have a debate as opposed to statements.  I agree with what has been said; I do not believe we get the best value out of statements especially on issues of importance.  It should be a question-and-answer session or a debate as opposed to statements.</p> <p>The irony for the tillage industry is that, as we are all aware, the drinks industry has probably been the success story of the economy in the past ten years, yet the farmers who supply the malting barley for distilling and brewing are in major crisis.  It is not that the sector is without money.  It has the money, but it is not filtering down to the base supplier.  Brexit is on the horizon, which gets plenty of air time in here, and inclement weather is very detrimental to the agriculture sector.  Irrespective of Brexit and the inclement weather, however, this is a sector in crisis.  Brexit will only compound that as has the weather over the past two years.</p> <p>We need a debate on the matter and we need to look at the possibility of diversification.  We need to look at fairness in the sector where the exorbitant amount of money made by the drinks industry is not filtering down to the suppliers.  Climate change can also be incorporated into this sector.  We have an ongoing debate on climate change.  Farmers are prepared to produce grain on the island of Ireland if they can get a price for it.  Rather than pay them the price, we are importing grain for feed and malt from as far away as Russia.  One can only imagine the carbon footprint on a tonne of grain coming from Russia to Ireland even though our farmers are prepared to produce it if they can get a reasonable price for it.</p></speech>

Sadly, their numbers are down by about 6% at the moment.  I believe the tourism authorities are very conscious of the issue.  A few weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, participated in a large-scale tourism promotion event in London with Niall Gibbons of Tourism Ireland and others.  I believe it was very successful.  It is good to hear that British visitors travel throughout the land because of connections through relatives and so on.  Killarney has many connections.  The Senator and I are familiar with Killarney House and its previous occupants, the Earls of Kenmare and Lord Castlerosse, who wrote the &quot;Londoner's Log&quot; in<i>The Sunday Express</i>.</p><p>We have many strengths to play to as regards British visitors.  I accept the Senator's point that we need to use it more and we need to be seen to do more.  I support the call for a debate in due course.</p></speech>

The provision of an Irish language Act, marriage equality, a bill of rights and funding for a legacy inquest are all British Government obligations.  Progress is only possible if her government honours those commitments.  The Sinn F&eacute;in delegation told her that direct rule is not an option and that she must look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, voted for overwhelmingly by the people, for the establishment of an intergovernmental conference involving the Irish and British Governments.</p> <p>The Leader accused me yesterday of condemning the Government.  Let me today commend the remarks of an Taoiseach yesterday in taking a strong stance on this issue and the convening of such an intergovernmental conference.</p> <p>I am sure the Leader will share my concern that the British Government intends to include a statute of limitations covering all Troubles-related incidents involving British crown forces in a new section in its consultation on the Stormont House Agreement.  Such a proposition is no part of the Stormont House Agreement.  Despite being involved for the past ten months in negotiations with British officials, Sinn F&eacute;in was never informed of this intention.  We understand that the Irish Government was also not informed until we brought it to its attention yesterday.  We told Mrs. May that this is an act of bad faith and I am sure the Leader will agree it is unacceptable.</p> <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently came to the House to discuss the North.  It would be beneficial, and it would meet a call coming from victims' organisations,  to have statements specifically related to the outstanding legacy issues in the North.</p></speech>

In April, the Minister for Justice and Equality launched a community-based CCTV system to help secure communities and assist the Garda in its work.  Under the scheme, community groups can avail of a grant of up to 60% of the total cost up to a maximum of &euro;40,000.  I am very disappointed to learn that only six applications were made in the entire country.  To my mind, that tells us very clearly that the scheme as designed is not attractive to community groups.  I have been told that the paperwork is so onerous that people are turning their backs on it.</p> <p>We are all aware of the lack of garda&iacute; in rural areas and unfortunately we are all aware of the blight of rural crime.  I understand the Minister has voiced his disappointment at the uptake.  He should look at the scheme again and relaunch it such that it is more attractive to and less onerous on community groups.  As Members know very well, CCTV can be a very useful tool to help assist the Garda in its role and to secure communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to address this issue as a matter of urgency in order that the plight of rural Ireland in terms of attacks and crime can be addressed.</p></speech>

This is the start of a conversation to ensure that the tillage industry, which has suffered greatly over the last four or five years, can re-establish itself.  Unfortunately, there has been a large decline in the acreage under tillage here, from almost 2,500 ha to an estimated 1,500 ha, which is a dramatic fall.  If we do not move now to implement the proposals set out in this report the decrease will continue.  The report comprises 35 recommendations.  It is important we do our best to implement them so that the tillage industry can be maintained.  It is more than appropriate that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would come to the House to discuss the recommendations proposed in the report.</p> <p>There is much debate in Ireland about our brand as a food nation.  One of the frightening statistics of the report published today is that only 1% of a pint goes to the farmer and the remaining 99% is spread across a number of other areas.  In other words, raw materials cover 1% and the remaining 99% goes to retailers and manufacturers.  We are selling Ireland as a brand in the food and beverage industry and so we need to ensure our raw material is maintained.  This will be a key issue for us going forward.</p> <p>The report published today is the starting point.  We need action on the core issues, be that low cost finance, Brexit, CAP requirements around farm maintenance, and so on.  All of these issues are on the table for discussion.  I believe this report is one of the most important produced by the Oireachtas in the last few years.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, on his input in that regard.  The report is an all-party report produced by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Now is the appropriate time to have the Minister come to this Chamber to discuss the 35 recommendations therein so that we can progress this issue and, hopefully, stop the tide of people moving away from tillage.</p></speech>

Today, bitcoin was the cause of two large American technology companies biting the dust.  According to the Korean police, a bitcoin ponzi-type scheme recently in operation in Korea involved an estimated fraud of $38 million.  This is only one of a few such schemes.  There are possibly 100 similar schemes in operation.  Ireland is at the cutting edge of technology, social media and finance.  It has all of the ingredients to become a hot bed of bitcoin farming and, unfortunately, fraud.  We need to play our part and immediately introduce a policy on bitcoin and its use in Ireland by the technology companies and as a method of payment throughout the country.</p></speech>

We spent many hours last week discussing the issue of binge drinking and alcohol abuse, and the terrible consequences of this for society.  Last Sunday, an advertisement was placed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>by one of Ireland's multiple retailers advertising the sale of 24, 500 ml cans, of Bulmers cider for &euro;25.  The cost to a publican in respect of the purchase of 24 cans of cider from C&amp;amp;C Gleeson, which owns Bulmers, is &euro;39.89, plus VAT at 23%, bringing the total cost to approximately &euro;49.  What is indicated in the advertisement mentioned is below-cost selling.  The advertisement also referenced Heineken and Guinness.  This offer is also available online.</p><p>I do not propose to name the retailer because it does not need any help getting people through its doors to purchase below-cost alcohol.  This is practically selling alcohol wholesale.  We have been told by the experts that there is a direct correlation between the cost of a unit of alcohol and abuse of alcohol and that people who are abusing alcohol are more likely to buy cheap alcohol.</p><p>The Department of Health officials have been charged with finding a workable solution to accommodate small shops under the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  We need to bear in mind where the real problem lies.  How can the small shop or publican ever hope to compete with what the large multiples are doing?  They cannot compete with it.  For the multiples, below-cost selling is a means of getting customers through their doors because they collect their profits elsewhere.  They will not incur any loss and ultimately they reclaim the VAT on the sales of such alcohol from the State.  There is something seriously wrong with that.  We have a very welcome provision in regard to minimum unit pricing in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  We need to stop below-cost selling for the sake of the health of our nation and for the sake of the small businesses and publicans who are selling responsibly and have a good track record.  This is a reality check as we debate this important Bill.</p></speech>

It is the multiples that are happy with the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and for good reason.  The fact that the Minister is willing to compromise in regard to the lower percentage of sales is to be welcomed.  These loss-leaders, which is effectively what they are, are drawing people in.  They are treating alcohol like any other grocery in order to bring people into their stores.  This is absolutely ludicrous.</p> <p>I also welcome Senator Craughwell's comments on social media.  As politicians, we need to stand up to that type of activity.  In regard to the consultants, it is important that we bring some balance to bear in that debate.  There are compliance and other issues that need to be addressed.  This is a minority group.  We need a balanced debate and should not get carried away in that regard.  The majority of consultants are hard-working and committed to public service.  This should be borne in mind during debate of the issue.  As I said, this is about a minority group.  I am not excusing that minority rather I am asking that we remain mindful that many consultants are hard-working.</p></speech>

One wonders if it is RT&Eacute; or the HSE that is running our health service.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Una Smith.  I agree that there are fantastic consultants in our hospital system.  Many of them are doing a really good job but at the end of the day, 44,864 public patients were not seen because of what is happening in the system and that is a serious problem.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a serious question for an Taoiseach to answer too.  Between 2014 and 2016, he was the Minister for Health.  That was where the buck stopped.  Why did he stop collection of data about the non-compliance of contracts and what was the reasoning behind it?  Did he have that information or did he delegate the responsibility?  It is fine if he delegated the responsibility but why did he suddenly stop it at that point?  If this is to be fought legally with regard to breach of contracts with individual consultants or such, then having that data is absolutely necessary.  He needs to explain that.  What is happening within the system, and the way the funding system is set up with hospitals being reliant on private practice cannot continue.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund that was advocated and championed by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is not working.  It incentivises more of this carry-on where public patients lose out all the time when private patients can be seen.  We need an absolute separation of public and private services rather than having public resources be used for private patients.</p></speech>

We talked about the 2008 hospital consultant issues.  At the time I asked who had the power to take on the consultants.  Somebody always asked me what the difference between a consultant and God was and the answer was that God does not think he is a consultant.  Consultants are powerful and make the difference between life and death.  They have a powerful vested interest.</p> <p>I was disappointed to see last night that we had not moved on.  There was an agreement that consultants would take pay increases and would limit their private practice.  I was shocked and horrified to see what was happening.  I want the Minister for Health to come here and answer this.  It is not just the Minister for Health but vested interests across the health sector.  I saw it first-hand when dealing with it seven or eight years ago, with people who put their own careers ahead of patient safety and health.  It is not right that people have to wait for an appointment and consultants are abusing their position.</p> <p>I agree that not all consultants do so but some of them give a very bad name to something that should be their vested interest and a vocation.  I will never be a consultant but there are vested interests in the public health service, not just among consultants.  Unless any Government or Minister for Health can take them on, we will have the same problems in ten or 15 years.  I was extremely disappointed and angry to see that, in 12 years, while we have moved on with many aspects, we have not moved on with this aspect.  I congratulate RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" for the sterling work it has done.</p></speech>

This is the start of what is going to happen.  I have read in the newspaper that, as part of the measures to reduce emergency room numbers, my own hospital in Carlow-Kilkenny, St. Luke's, and the hospitals in Wexford, south Tipperary and Portlaoise may be among a number of regional hospitals that will stop taking trauma patients.  It is proposed that three Dublin hospitals will do the same.  It has apparently been recommended that a new trauma unit be set up in two hospitals, one in Dublin and one in Cork.  This is unacceptable.</p> <p>We saw the issue in Waterford hospital with the cardiac unit, where one could have a heart attack from Monday to Friday but there was no cover for it at the weekends.  There was a massive meeting in Portlaoise during the week relating to its hospital, to try to save its emergency department.  This is unacceptable.  There are many such instances.  People are fighting to get appointments.  People come into my clinics to mention waiting times and they are in pain.  Now we have this proposal.  It is unacceptable for this to happen.  The HSE is looking at having two massive trauma units in Cork and Dublin, regardless of St. Luke's hospital in Kilkenny or the hospitals in Wexford, south Tipperary and Portlaoise.  The people in rural areas are disregarded.  As usual, we are totally forgotten.  It is unacceptable and I call on the Minister to come to the House today or tomorrow to clarify if this is true.</p></speech>

That is why we have new legislation.</p> <p>The Cathaoirleach mentioned that we will have statements later.  None of us wants or supports an adversarial approach by whoever is behind the strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The tribunal will establish the facts and the truth.  From my perspective, there should be and can be no witch hunt.  The only objective can be for the whole truth to be found and put on public record.  That is why we have a commission.</p> <p>As I have said before in this House, there is a need for cultural change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That can only come from within primarily, or be led from within.  There is no conspiracy at all, Senator Clifford-Lee.  Everybody wants justice for Mr. McCabe and his family.  All of us who think and speak about this should reflect on how we feel and the ongoing nightmare and trauma that they have to endure.  They deserve support from all of us.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has said that she had no hand or part in any legal strategy pursued by the former Garda Commissioner.  The Taoiseach spoke to Mr. McCabe last night and put on record again that Mr. McCabe is one of the bravest people he has met in public life, who has been wronged by the State on a number of occasions because of his bravery and willingness to shine a light into a dark place.  The Taoiseach, the Head of the Government, made those remarks.</p> <p>Senators Gavan, Humphreys, Noone, Feighan, Murnane O'Connor and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of HSE contracts and compliance.  The Minister for Health has commissioned an independent group chaired by Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir to examine the impact on the public hospital system.  We all want to see accountability and compliance.  I challenge some on the far left who criticise the amount of money being spent on our health system without recognising or acknowledging that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has secured the biggest budget for the health system ever.  I challenge Members from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party in particular to come in with their proposals.  I have not heard any suggestion or proposal from them on anything.</p></speech>

The Minister and the Government are committed to reducing waiting times and to improving access.  We all want to see compliance put in place.  That is what the Government will do, and is doing, through the HSE.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell and Devine referenced the issue of freedom of speech on social media.  I hope that we can find unanimity and unity in trying to combat that growing issue.  As Senator Devine said, it is affecting young people more and more and they may not necessarily have the coping skills or the mechanisms to deal with it.  Our former colleague, Lorraine Higgins, had a Bill in this regard.  It is important that we see how we can work to combat that issue.  I would be very happy to work with the Senators on that.</p> <p>I join with Senator Gavan in condemning the racism shown to Cyrus Christie.  It has no place in Irish sport or in sport generally.  In respect of the request for questions and answers, I remind Members that under Article 28.4.1&deg; of the Constitution, the Government is responsible to the D&aacute;il only.  In this House we have statements.  The precedent has always been to have statements in this House.

We do not have an obligation to do so and should not have to.  We have statements.  If the Senators want to have statements on statements, we can have a discussion about it, but our role is having the Minister into the House for statements.  In terms of the legislation, I am not aware of the issue Senator Devine raised with respect to her amendments but the format or the agreement with regard to the schedule was agreed at a group meeting.  If the Senator has an issue I would be happy to talk to her about it.  I certainly have not tried to have the Senator or any other Member discommoded in terms of tabling amendments to Bills during my time as Leader.  It is important that the Senator has an opportunity to do so.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of pyrite, on which I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House.  It is an important issue.  I agree with Senator Leyden with regard to the issues around prize bonds and the NTMA.  The process around who wins on the prize bonds and when the draws are made is a bit secretive.  Perhaps a new regime should be introduced in respect of how it is publicised and communicated.  We should all give consideration to the point the Senator made on the way in which prize bond money should be used.  It is about benefitting people and wider society and the Senator's suggestion regarding homelessness and the building or improving of housing merits consideration.  I would be happy to support the Senator in that.</p></speech>

I have put that request to the Department of the Taoiseach.  He is looking forward to coming to the House and having a debate with us on a variety of issues.  I hope it will be possible to have him in the House before Christmas.  We are endeavouring to confirm that and I will work through the offices of the Cathaoirleach and the Seanad in that regard.</p> <p>Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Paul Coghlan raised the issue of tourism and particularly the issue of the decline in visitor numbers from the UK.  We need to see more marketing, visibility and encouragement in respect of our friends from the UK who, as Senator O'Sullivan said, visit the whole of the island.  It is important that we work on that.</p> <p>Senator Norris made reference to the departures of Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Adams.  I think we all welcome the departure of Mr. Mugabe.  I wish Deputy Adams well in his retirement.  We will have another debate about his legacy, political leadership and so on, but I wish him well in his retirement.  His family has made huge sacrifices, as do the families of all party leaders, and he had to make huge sacrifices himself.  I commend him for his decision to step down and I wish him well on a personal level.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of housing.  I agree with him.  There is no excuse for local authorities to sit on land banks in any county or city.  The housing need in our country has to be addressed.  I will not give the Senator a whole list of figures because he will have another debate with me, but the land banks being sat on must be utilised.</p> <p>With regard to the figures the Senator quoted on social housing, I want to give him one figure which I think is important.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and his colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in sometimes put forward the narrative that no houses are being built and no money is being invested.  Rebuilding Ireland has multi-annual funding for social housing and &euro;116 million was allocated to homelessness in budget 2018.  We are building 7,900 social houses, which will be built by the end of this year.  That is the reality.  That comprises 3,800 local authority builds, 600 private sector builds, 600 voids returned to use, 900 acquisitions and 2,000 long-term leases.  That is action on housing.  We all agree that it is not happening fast enough.  There are people who are looking for housing today and we all want to see them housed.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

As a former chair of Cork City Council's committee on Travellers, I believe it is important that we understand that Travellers have housing needs which must be met.  There is an obligation and duty on all of us as political representatives to work to ensure that we house all our people, including Travellers.  I commend the group on its work.</p> <p>Senators Paul Daly and Tim Lombard raised the issue of tillage.  I commend them on their work on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and on the final report which it published.  I have not read it, as the Senators will understand, but I will be very happy to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House to debate the report.  I am a strong advocate for committee reports being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I would be very happy to have that debate as soon as possible. </p> <p>I will not have a debate with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile about the IRA in his absence.  It has a legacy which needs to be examined and our language and what we say is important.  I join with him in calling on all sides to see the Assembly re-established in the North of our country as a matter of urgency.  There is a duty on everybody to avoid direct rule from Westminster.  That is everybody, not just a group or a government but everybody.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of CCTV.  The number he mentioned is disappointing but Government is running this project for three years.  It has been allocated &euro;1 million in funding.  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grants of up to 60% of the total capital costs of CCTV projects.  There is a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.  I have been involved with a community group and have been told by the Department that officials are available to meet with, support and advise any group, whether urban or rural, in respect of applications for funding.

It is, for them, a very shocking thing and there is no remission whatever from the sentence under which they must live.  Murder is a very shocking occurrence.  It revolts every decent person in society.  I have had a nightmare once or twice in which I accidentally killed someone and tried to hide the person's body in a black plastic bag.  I remember the feeling of utter shock at the idea of taking somebody else's life.</p> <p>I also recall other situations.  I remember very well the case of Declan Flynn, who I knew but not terribly well.  He was a young gay man who was murdered in Fairview Park and the judge just let the people off, with no penalty whatever imposed.  The case sparked a revolt among the people of Ireland and very substantial marches took place.</p> <p>This is a very important Bill.  It should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage.  It is only concerned with first degree murder and people who are convicted of that offence.  We have mandatory life sentences for murder but they are never served.  According to the figures supplied to me by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, in the 1970s and 1980s the average term served by convicted murderers was seven and a half years.  That is astonishing when we think of comparable sentences for other offences.  It is very shocking.  The position has changed, however, and the average time that a person convicted of murder serves in this country now is 17 years.  However, he or she is eligible to come before a parole board after a mere seven years.  A parole board is made up of political appointees, civil servants and so on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I just do not think this is important.  This Bill will give the judge much more flexibility and allow him or her to impose the appropriate sentence.  There will be a minimal custodial period to decided upon, up or down, by the court.</p><p>Ireland is full of maximum sentences for offences that are never met.  They are on the Statute Book but they never come into operation.  Society and murder families want sentences that reflect our absolute horror and revulsion at the crime of murder because as it stands a life sentence for murder does not mean life.  The court needs to have a more defined and greater role in sentencing rather than a blanket mandatory minimum sentence.  We need greater certainty for sentencing for the offence of murder and prison sentences that are of sufficient length to deter criminal activity and express society's horror at the taking of a human life.</p><p>This Bill will introduce a regime similar to the one that already exists in the United Kingdom.  This is one model where we can follow the example of the United Kingdom to our advantage.  Under the Bill, discretion would still be available but we would be operating from a set of tariffs and only with transparent and predetermined criteria.  Minimum tariffs and sentences are critical if we are to achieve justice for the victims' families and the wider community.  </p><p>Another situation to be addressed is the question of consecutive, as opposed to concurrent, sentences.  There is a tendency now to grant concurrent sentences in a case of the murder of more than one person.  A situation that has not been referred to in the debate so far arises where somebody who has committed multiple murders is tried on only one charge.  That leaves the families of the other victims dangling.  There is no closure for them at all.  I have had a brief conversation with the families in the Gallery whose grief I greatly respect.  They made the point that there is no closure anyway for any of them.  There is never closure.  I am repeating something that has been said on many occasions - it is a life sentence for those who are left behind.  The practice of giving concurrent sentences should be re-examined.  There may be a case for it in certain situations but we need to be very careful.  If two lives have been taken, surely sentencing should reflect this.</p><p>If this Bill goes through, and I very much hope it does, judges will be able to exercise discretion for the first time when it comes to murder.  It is a very tragic and complex situation, one which this House is wise to take under consideration, and I am grateful to Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell for bringing this important matter to the attention of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I appeal to the Government not to vote this Bill down, but to allow it go to Committee Stage for further consideration.  If there are defects in the Bill, it can be amended.  The Gallery is full of the relatives of people who have been murdered.  This is a situation that Seanad &Eacute;ireann must take into account. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#Q00200"><p>I also welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this Bill and to the debate.  Many Senators have given perspectives on it.  I join Senator Norris in recognising families in the Gallery who have suffered loss due to murder.  All of us can only imagine the huge grief and loss those families have had to live with not just at the time of the horrific event, but during the very trying court cases that followed, hearing the witness statements and all that is associated with the case.  They have to live their lives after the event, knowing that the perpetrator is in prison for some time.</p> <p>When somebody is given a life sentence for first degree murder, the public and anybody who is aware of such a case expects that the sentence is served.  Even objectively, for a person not directly affected by the case but as a member of the public, it is very frustrating and worrying to discover that due to a decision of a parole board, a life sentence is shortened for whatever reason.  That is why as a Government Senator I support the general thrust of this Bill.</p> <p>When the courts have gone through detailed investigation, the jurors have made their recommendations and the judge has handed down a decision, there is a fair expectation that the sentence would be served.  When I was growing up in the 1970s, a murder appeared on all the main news bulletins, and it was spoken of at every door.  I am concerned that as a society we have become somewhat desensitised to the word "murder".  Murders happen on a weekly basis in this country.  It is of concern to me as a parent of young children that the same hurt and frustration is not being felt by society when it hears the word murder as it was in my day.  I remember hearing about the murder of a garda.  It was a very serious offence when I was growing up, and it is still a very serious offence.  The life of a garda, one of the custodians of law and order in this State, has to be protected but, in the same way, the life of a person or a citizen of this country has to be taken seriously.</p> <p>I commend Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell on introducing this Bill because it is important that we debate these issues in a public forum such as the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to discuss people's concerns when they read that someone who was sentenced to life imprisonment is out because of a parole board recommendation.</p> <p>I understand how legislation works.  This Bill may not be perfect, and I ask the officials of the Department of Justice and Equality to engage with the Senators who proposed the Bill.  If this Bill does not address their concerns, perhaps the Minister of State could bring forward other legislation that they can support and that addresses their concerns.  I understand the Government may not be supporting the Bill, but I emphasise that when a sentence is handed down by the courts of this land for a serious offence such as murder, the general expectation, after a fair trial has been heard, is that the person must serve that life sentence.  I understand that parole boards sit and there is a role for them.  My view is not right wing or ideological.  When I was a child, murder horrified me, my family and my peers.  I am sure it is the same for everybody else.  We cannot allow murder to become a lesser degree crime in the statutes of this State.  There is strong merit in the thrust of this Bill.</p></speech>

I cannot even imagine the grief and horror of their situation.  My heart goes out to them and I hope that, in time, they can bring closure to their situations.</p> <p>In his opening statement, Senator Norris referred to the horrific murder of Declan Flynn in Fairview Park.  He is right to say that it provoked a revolt and brought homophobia and the homophobic society we lived in to the fore to the point that we have passed marriage equality legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that society has moved on to a great extent and that we would never see the likes of that murder again.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will not support this Bill.  In the D&aacute;il we have brought forward the Parole Bill 2016, which is awaiting Committee Stage.  It is based on the strategic review of the penal policy in July 2014.  While conscious that the Law Reform Commission has recommended that legislation should be introduced to provide that a judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by an offender sentenced to life for murder, the review group questioned the extent to which it would be necessary to make that provision in legislation.  It is also the view of that group that the sentencing judge may, in any event, make such a recommendation.  This recommendation may guide the Parole Board, which Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing to put on a statutory basis, at the review of the prisoner's detention.</p><p>The Minimum Custodial Periods upon Conviction for Murder Bill 2017 may dramatically increase the length of time in custody for persons for persons sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, providing for a life sentence with a minimum custodial period of between 25 and 40 years.  It raises constitutional issues regarding judicial discretion and it would introduce one of the most punitive regimes in Europe.</p><p>Murder is the most serious of criminal offences, as outlined by Senator Coffey.  While this Bill purports to recognise the seriousness of the offence by establishing a minimum sentence and a minimum period of custody, it does so in a manner that will establish the State as potentially one of the most punitive in Europe, while departing in a substantial way from existing sentencing and prison policy.  The Bill will, in effect, create a hierarchy of murder offences, to which a minimum period of custody of either 40, 30 or 25 years will apply, depending on the circumstances relating to the offence.  For example, the offence where the victim is a child would fall within the most serious category offence.  Within this category is also the offence involving more than one victim of an act or arson.  It is unclear why this is limited to acts of arson and not the murder of multiple victims by other means.  Murders involving the use of weapons would fall under a further category subjected to a minimum of 30 years in custody.  Other murders not in this category would attract a minimum sentence of 25 years in custody.</p><p>There is judicial discretion to reduce the minimum sentences relating to the 25 year custody period.  This, however, is restricted in regard to the more serious categories and the 40 year period may not be reduced below 30 years.  The 30 year minimum period can only be lowered to a minimum of 25 years.  Legal advisers have examined the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and have noted previous legal opinion that material before the court shows clear support that prison sentences should be reviewed no later than 25 years after the imposition of a life sentence, with custodial, periodic reviews thereafter.  Section 1 of the Bill is clear that a minimum custodial period will be the minimum number of years' imprisonment a person will serve before being considered for release.  Any sentence, therefore, of greater than 25 years imposed under this Bill could not be reviewed at the 25 year mark.</p><p>A further difficulty with the Bill is the impact on the role of the Parole Board.  Currently, a judge imposes a life sentence on a person convicted of murder without specifying the period to be served.  The Parole Board is then responsible for reviewing the sentence and making recommendations around the release.  It will do so having regard to the nature and gravity of the offence.  Under the Bill, however, the court is required in determining the period to be served to consider the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender, as well as any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  This is established sentencing practice and in circumstances where the court determines that the sentence takes into account these factors it is unclear how a period of detention beyond that sentence could be supported and what role, if any, the Parole Board would actually serve.</p><p>An alternative way to achieve the aims of the Bill would be to proceed with the establishment of a parole board on a statutory basis.   In sentencing an offender for murder the court would continue to impose the mandatory life sentence and the Parole Board could then set out the minimum period to be served by persons convicted of murder who can be considered for release by the Parole Board.  Fianna F&aacute;il has published a Bill in this regard.  It is before the D&aacute;il and is awaiting Committee Stage.  The gravity and nature of the offence could then be considered by the Parole Board.</p><p>There does not appear to have been any consultation with stakeholders, especially the Judiciary, in drafting this Bill.  This is of concern to the Fianna F&aacute;il Group.  The legal advice states that a change of this significance would require consultation with the Judiciary and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot support this Bill today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#R00200"><p>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donnell for bringing this legislation before the house, and her passion in making this case on behalf of people who have lost a friend or loved one.  I welcome and commend the families and their representatives for coming forward and making the case that our judicial system, as it stands, is not adequately dealing with sentencing for murder.</p> <p>At the moment, a murder conviction in Ireland carries a mandatory life sentence.  Many convictions, however, result in early release with the average custodial sentence coming to 17.5 years.  It is important to remember that after release, that person can be recalled to prison at any time if they violate certain conditions.  The life sentence does carry for the rest of the person&rsquo;s life.  The issue is what proportion of that time should be spent in prison.</p> <p>As it stands, this timeframe is determined based on a number of factors relating to the specific circumstances of the case.  In presenting this Bill Senator O&rsquo;Donnell has made an important point that the uncertainty over these factors and the corresponding length of the sentence can put a huge degree of stress on families.  We should always keep that in mind.  This issue was raised by the Law Reform Commission review in 2013, when it recommended that a court should have the capacity to recommend a minimum term to be served.  This is an important legal context to the Bill, and we should take this recommendation seriously.</p> <p>There are aspects of the Bill that raise serious concern.  The minimum sentence would be set at either 25, 30 or 40 years, which seems quite severe.  It has been suggested that this would be one of the most punitive measures in Europe.  The UK has set the limits at 15, 25 and 30 years, for example.  I would like to see further debate as to why the lower limit of 25 years was chosen.  As was mentioned during the debate in February, the 2013 Law Reform Commission review suggested that a judge could recommend a minimum sentence, which would then be taken into account by the Parole Board.</p> <p>In general, as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, my outlook on criminal justice matters is to emphasise rehabilitation.  That is in no way to diminish the heartbreak suffered by victims in particular cases, but to ensure that we take a balanced approach that considers the wider impact on Irish society and considers the specific features of the case at hand.  With careful consideration we can reconcile the principle of rehabilitative justice with the rights of victims of serious crime.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has been helpful in providing this perspective and has said that it is resolutely against mandatory sentencing, that it is a blunt instrument that always results in unequal justice and that there is scant evidence, national or international, that mandatory sentencing is effective in reducing crime.  This evidence base concerns me, and I think we would need to see further debate on that specific point.  Similarly, I am concerned that mandatory sentencing could see an increase in the prison population, as has happened in the US, or more guilty pleas to avoid minimum custodial periods.</p> <p>I welcome the aspect of the Bill which seeks to bring clarity on the operation of parole boards.  Currently, the question of release is removed from the judge&rsquo;s hands and is handed over to a Parole Board after seven years of the sentence.  Concerns have been raised about the transparency of these decisions and the stress this has caused grieving families.  I would like to see discussion on how we can bring greater transparency to this process.  For example, it was raised in February that non-statutory sentencing guidelines could be outlined for the Parole Board to take into consideration.</p> <p>While I have concerns over the severity of the Bill, it raises several important questions about our judicial system and highlights areas for consideration and reform, such as the decision to begin parole hearings after seven years and the transparency around any decisions made.  These areas could be considered in greater detail on Committee Stage, where amendments can be tabled and the finer points can be outlined and altered.</p> <p>I commend Senator Colm Burke's point that while he was opposed to the Bill when first presented, having listened to the debate and the proposals made, he did not want to close the door on it immediately.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, made the same point that consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage could see it improved or provide an impetus for Government policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with him on this and support the Bill going forward to Committee Stage for detailed analysis and scrutiny.</p></speech>

I always find the Minister of State to be very accommodating and he made a very practical suggestion today that the Bill be sent to the justice committee.  I know that pre-legislative scrutiny has increased but it is disappointing that that committee has not yet dealt with the matter.</p> <p>Senators Norris and Clifford-Lee spoke about Declan Flynn, whose murder set off a whole new revolution in the gay community.  We should all go back, meanwhile, to Senator Coffey's point about murder.  I always remember the case of a person who was killed in a house up at the top of Spur Hill back when I was a child.  We were afraid to go to bed for nearly six months afterwards, so abnormal and horrific was the event.  I can have no idea of the sense of loss, pain and frustration endured by the families sitting in the Gallery today.  Like all of us, however, they have expectations that justice be served.  This Bill is very important and I hope we do not see it disappear into the ether today.  The Government is opposing it and I understand the reasons for that.  There is huge merit in what Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is bringing forward here.</p></speech>

We all agree that victims of crime and their families deserve to be supported and deserve justice.  Senator Coffey used the word "desensitised". I say that we cannot make this normal.  Notwithstanding rehabilitation and restorative justice, there must be intent in what we do and an understanding of the consequences.  I hope we can find a mechanism to avoid the Bill getting lost, be that by referring it back to the committee, perhaps, or having it redrafted.  I hope that we will not have to do that but I understand the Minister of State's position on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#S01800"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to the House and wish him well in his role.  I have not had occasion to speak in the House when he was here in the past.  I wish him continued success.  I also join the Leader in welcoming the victims' families in the Gallery.  Our hearts go out to them, they are very welcome here and we absolutely understand where they are coming from on this issue.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on bringing forward this legislation, which is greatly to her credit.  Members bringing forward legislation like this is exactly what an active and successful Oireachtas Chamber should be about.  I agree with the Leader that this Bill and its worthy content should not be lost; it should become part of the debate.  I understand that both the Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality are carrying out ongoing work on this matter and this Bill should be part of that equation.</p> <p>This Bill, if I have understood it correctly, would establish minimum custodial sentences from the very start, that is from the day of the judgment, of 40, 30 or 25 years in the most serious categories.  We currently have a life sentence with the potential for parole which tends to be granted after 18 or 20 years.  Having heard Senator Black's contribution on my way in, I feel that we must leave sufficient flexibility in the system and I say this with the greatest of respect to my good friend and colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  The current system dictates a minimum life sentence, amounting to life or virtually life in most cases, but there has to be flexibility in the system to allow for rehabilitation, restorative justice, and personal and psychiatric development programmes.</p> <p>Murder is a horrific crime and nobody is suggesting otherwise.  I do think, however, that we have to leave within the system the potential for rehabilitation and for the restoration of the person, though I understand that it must be very hard for the families in the Gallery to get their head around such a concept.  Without getting overly sanctimonious or righteous, it is inherent in our Christian ethos that the potential for redemption should always be possible for every human being in every scenario.  Believing in the redemptive potential for every human being is part of what we are. </p> <p>The current system dictates a custodial life sentence for murder and then that the person serves 18 or 20 years.  The potential is there for a rehabilitative and restorative programme.  A certain flexibility has to be left in the system.  Having said that, as Senator Buttimer said, there is potential to incorporate and to examine some of the concepts contained in the Bill.  There may in some instances be anecdotal evidence to the contrary but I am not personally aware of many if any instances of what is popularly understood to be unfortunately early releases.  I fully understand Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's concerns over this, but I am concerned that we not build too much rigidity into the system.</p> <p>Let us take, for example, the first and very serious category, namely, the 40-year sentence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That effectively in most instances would mean the potential for release would never exist for that person.  Senator O'Donnell's categories could be looked at with regard to further refinement, but the second category is a 30-year sentence and this is similar.  The third category of 25 years is quite close to the current situation and it is not that different to what exists.  There may be too many rigidities in the Bill.  It may stave off the potential for rehabilitation.</p><p>I was interested in Senator Black's point.  I am not sure of her evidence, and I am not aware of the evidence around it, but it was an interesting point.  It is one I can relate to and see sense in.  This is the point Senator Black made that there is no evidence that completely mandatory sentencing necessarily has any beneficial effect on crime figures.  There is no evidence it has any benefit for the individual.</p><p>We have absolute empathy with the people in the Gallery.  Our hearts go out to them.  The crime of murder is a horror that is contrary to everything the best of the human condition stands for.  I understand there must be very long custodial sentences, that there must be a statutory protection of such a thing and there never can be any degree of discretion that would allow premature release of people.</p><p>Having said that, within the system there must be the potential for redemption, restoration and rehabilitation.  What we must achieve is a marriage of these three objectives.  To some degree, it is my humble contention, the present process probably best marries the three but it could well be open to modification.  In this debate, Senator O'Donnell's Bill is very helpful.  Senator Buttimer got it right when he said we should not lose the objectives of the Bill in the debate.  Perhaps it is a conservative instinct, but I do not yet have evidence, anecdotally, empirically or at any level, to suggest to me that the present system, with all its faults, is not working reasonably well.</p></speech>

In my time in the Seanad I do not think a Bill has ever come in on Second Stage that was flawless or did not need extensions, enlargement, pr&eacute;cising, discussion or communication.  I am presenting this to Senators and asking the House to allow it go to Committee Stage where all of these concerns can be dealt with, of which there are many and I am very aware of this.</p> <p>The thrust of the Bill is that there would be minimum disapproval for the taking of a life and, exactly what Senator Coffey said, that it just does not become another kind of crime.  It is the taking of a life, which can never be got back and a conviction for the taking of that life with purpose and not accidentally.  That is what the thrust of the Bill is about, and the Judiciary, starting at, we will say, 25 years, could decide, depending on the case, whether that sentence was to be 26, 27, 30 or 40 years.  That is the thrust of the Bill, and all the makey-up other stuff is not relevant.  It is not relevant for Fianna F&aacute;il to come in here and read out a speech - I am surprised at the Senator - about another Bill, which had nothing to do with mine-----</p></speech>

It is 17 years or less.  There are also technicalities with regard to looking for parole after seven years.  Ask the families in the Gallery, about whom we are all so empathetic but we will not go past the glass panel.  I am very passionate about it because I do not want to see it cut off at the pass.</p> <p>Yesterday, I said that in this House there is a pathology of territory and not a pathology of ideas.  That is what happens in here.  People come with their territory, and out comes the territory as a force and we have to answer the territory and not the idea.  I know there are a lot of flaws in the Bill and I am aware of that.  I am very aware of it, but that is no reason it should not go to Committee Stage and all those flaws be aired and changed.  It is not in competition with the Lower House and it is not in competition with any other Bill.

I understand if someone wants revenge he or she should dig two graves.  We learned that in Northern Ireland for 40 years.  I am not a "hang 'em high" merchant, but there has to be a minimum disapproval of the taking of a life purposely as first-degree murder.  There are so many families, brothers, sisters, mothers and cousins living that appalling tragedy every day, and I want it discussed.  That is all I want, to get the Bill to Committee Stage and not cut it off at the pass.  It is not, Senator Lee, and I say this in my passion, it is not in competition with your Bill.</p></speech>

The fair treatment of customers is a key requirement of the financial services regulatory framework and of the Central Bank consumer protection code.  The code requires all residential mortgage lenders to act honestly and fairly in the best interests of their customers and not to mislead customers about the products they provide.  It also requires lenders to make a full disclosure of all relevant information to a consumer in a way that seeks to inform the consumer and enable him or her to make an informed decision before entering into or changing a loan or other financial services agreement.  However, it has now clearly been demonstrated that mortgage lenders have significantly failed in their regulatory or contractual responsibilities to many of their tracker mortgage borrowers.</p> <p>The Central Bank has long warned lenders of their duty to act in the best interests of their customers when recommending that a borrower switch from a tracker mortgage to another type of mortgage product.  The Central Bank specifically provided in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears that mortgage lenders must not, except where it would be in the interest of the borrower, require a borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type as part of an alternative repayment arrangement to address a mortgage difficulty.  Over time, the Central Bank identified and pursued a number of tracker-related issues with some lenders.  These included issues ranging from a lack of transparency for the borrower, a failure to fully inform customers of the consequences of switching from a tracker mortgage, the application of incorrect tracker rates and a failure to afford customers their contractual entitlements to specified tracker interest rates.  Separately, individual tracker-related complaints were also presented to the Financial Services Ombudsman and that office was making determinations on the cases, some of which were also coming before the courts.  In addition, due in part to these developments, the matter was coming to greater public attention more generally.  In total, the Central Bank identified in the region of 7,100 mortgage accounts where tracker failure was identified and in respect of which mortgage borrowers were adversely impacted upon prior to the commencement of the bank&rsquo;s industry-wide tracker mortgage examination.</p> <p>Having regard to these developments, and to Central Bank concerns that there may be other tracker-related issues that could be impacting upon other consumer borrowers across the system, the Central Bank announced in October 2015 that it had commenced a broader, industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage-related issues.  This systems-wide review was intended to cover, among other things, transparency of communications with, and contractual rights of, tracker mortgage borrowers.  This examination has turned out to be the largest review ever carried out by the Central Bank on its consumer protection side.  It covered 15 mortgage lenders that may have sold tracker mortgage products to consumer borrowers from the time they commenced selling tracker mortgages until December 2015.  As such, it covered banks and other regulated mortgage lenders and also lenders that are no longer providing new mortgage credit.  It also covered mortgages that have been redeemed or borrowers whose tracker mortgage has been transferred to another creditor.  The industry-wide examination required all lenders to examine the extent to which they had been meeting their contractual obligations to their tracker mortgage customers or their compliance with their obligations under the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection code and other consumer protection regulatory requirements.</p> <p>Under the initial phase of the industry-wide examination, the Central Bank required lenders to put in place governance structures and systems to conduct a comprehensive examination.  The second phase of the examination involved an extensive internal review of mortgage books to identify mortgage borrowers who were impacted by banks&rsquo; failings.  This phase was due to be finalised at the end of September.  In its latest update on progress on the tracker mortgage examination, as published last month, the Central Bank indicated that 13,000 affected mortgage borrowers had so far been identified, although it was also noted that this number was expected to increase.  In particular, the Central Bank noted that it is continuing to challenge lenders on the number of affected customers.  As Senators are now aware, on 9 November last, Bank of Ireland accepted that it had a further 6,000 affected tracker mortgage accounts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is in addition to the 4,300 it had earlier accepted arising from the Central Bank examination and the previous 2,100 accounts identified prior to the industry-wide examination.  These 6,000 additional accounts are groups of customers that the Central Bank has identified as having been impacted but which Bank of Ireland had previously disputed.  KBC is another bank which has recently said that it is continuing to engage with the Central Bank on the identification of impacted customers.  The Central Bank has stated that the number of impacted accounts as of the end September will increase in light of the recent announcement by Bank of Ireland and that it may increase further as it continues to challenge mortgage lenders.<br/><br/>The two other phases of the Central Bank examination cover the calculation and the payment of redress and compensation for impacted customers.  When the Central Bank published its update report last month, payments amounting to &euro;120 million had been paid to 3,300 impacted customers, as identified from the recent industry-wide examination.  This is additional to the &euro;43 million in compensation and redress paid for impacted cases identified before the commencement of the Central Bank industry-wide examination.  <br/><br/>When the Minister for Finance met the chief executives of the five main banks at the end of October he made it very clear to them that all affected customers are to be identified and that the wrong is to be put right through the payment of appropriate redress and compensation without any further undue delay.  Following on from those meetings, the banks also committed to the following.  AIB is to pay redress and compensation to over 4,100 of its customers before the end of this year; Bank of Ireland is to pay redress and compensation to the 4,300 of its customers that they accepted had been impacted at that point - as indicated above.  Since then Bank of Ireland has accepted that a further 6,000 mortgage accounts have also been impacted and payments in respect of these accounts is now also to start before the end of 2017.<br/><br/>PTSB is to pay redress and compensation to almost 2,000 customers before the end of this year and Ulster Bank is to pay redress and compensation to 1,000 customers before the end of this year and to the bulk of its remaining impacted borrowers in early 2018.  KBC also said that all its customers so far identified as having been impacted have been or are in the process of being contacted and that redress and compensation payments have commenced.  The payment of redress and compensation to impacted borrowers without any further delay is now a key requirement as it will be a practical reflection of the regret that banks are now expressing for the harm they have inflicted on their impacted borrowers.  <br/><br/>The payment of redress and compensation serves two different functions.  Redress is intended to return the borrower to the position he or she would have been in if the harm had not occurred.  In effect, the banks are giving back money that was wrongly taken from the borrower.  Compensation is additional payment and it is intended to reflect the detriment to the borrower which arose from being put on the incorrect interest rate.  While the Central Bank cannot formally require lenders to implement uniform redress and compensation programmes, it nevertheless has repeatedly challenged lenders on their proposals.  The tracker examination framework clearly set out the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectations that appropriate redress and compensation is to be provided to impacted borrowers.  Lenders are also to categorise impacted customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered and to ensure that compensation is proportionate to the level of harm which was incurred.  The types of detriment identified range from overcharging due to the application of incorrect interest rates, which at the lower end of the scale may have only been a small difference and for a short period of time, to failure to return a borrower to a tracker rate after a period where the interest rate was fixed and up to cases of more significant harm, such as a loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  A higher level of compensation would be expected in cases were a severe level of harm has been inflicted on a customer.<br/><br/>Some people have said that a uniform redress and compensation approach to the payment of compensation should be put in place by the Central Bank for all banks.  A uniform redress and compensation approach could fail to address an individual&rsquo;s particular circumstances adequately as personal circumstances and experiences will differ.  A uniform redress approach could also mean that it would become the <i>de facto</i>maximum level of payment across the system and that it could prevent or inhibit lenders from putting in place a somewhat more generous package for its their impacted borrowers.  Overall the approach to compensation adopted by the Central Bank is the one which is available to it under the existing law, which places the onus on lenders <br/><br/>to produce schemes for their own affected customers.  However, the Central Bank reserves the right to challenge lenders in particular cases if it considers it necessary or appropriate to do so.  The principles for redress set out by the Central Bank also provide for the general upfront payment of redress and compensation to all impacted borrowers.  This upfront payment, however, does not preclude or prevent the borrower from appealing the level or any aspect of compensation if he or she does not consider that it is appropriate to the harm that was inflicted in his or her particular case.  Regardless of the outcome of an appeal, the initial payment cannot be reduced.<br/><br/>Two types of appeals panels are to be set up by each lender as part of the tracker framework process.  The first is intended to deal with the more serious cases of harm and the panel membership is fully made up of members independent of the lender.  The second appeals panel is intended to hear cases where the level of harm is not as serious and the majority of the members on this panel are also independent of the lender.  Impacted borrowers also have the further right to appeal their case or circumstances to the statutory independent Financial Services Ombudsman or to the courts.  It is worth repeating that a fundamental element of the redress and compensation process is that the upfront payment which is made by a lender cannot be reduced by any subsequent appeal that may be made by the borrower, either to the appeals process under the tracker examination framework or ultimately the ombudsman or the courts.<br/><br/>The approach to the payment of redress and compensation is designed to deliver the most efficient process in the interests of impacted borrowers.  Upfront compensation frameworks are determined by lenders, although subject to Central Bank challenge, and provide for the making of payments as quickly as possible.  The detailed appeals process allows borrowers to take the matter further without risk to them if they consider that the level of the upfront payment is not appropriate in their particular case.  This appeals process then allows the individual borrower to set out his or her individual circumstances and to set out in detail the full harm which was imposed on him or her by the lender and, consequently, why a higher level of payment is appropriate in that case.<br/><br/>On enforcement, it will also be important to hold the banks to account for their actions.  The existing supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank are strong and should be used to punish wrongdoing where supported by evidence.  Thus far, the Central Bank has imposed a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million on Springboard Mortgages Limited for serious failings in its obligations to its tracker mortgage customers.  The Central Bank is also pursuing enforcement investigations regarding Permanent TSB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.<br/><br/>The Central Bank is also liaising with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant statutory bodies, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and it has statutory reporting obligations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or another relevant statutory agencies where information obtained by it at any stage prior to, during, or after an investigation, gives rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence may have been committed.  The Central Bank takes its reporting obligations, as provided for under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, very seriously and complies with them on an ongoing basis as appropriate.  The Central Bank has met An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has discussed at a high level what it has seen and while it has not made a formal statutory section 33AK report of suspicions to other relevant agencies it is keeping the matter under constant review.  The Central Bank has also engaged with the Financial Services Ombudsman with regard to the welcome amendments to the time periods for customers to make complaints to the ombudsman pursuant to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Act 2017.  This legislation now extends the time limits for long-term financial services beyond six years to permit complaints to the ombudsman within three years of the customer becoming aware of the cause of complaint.<br/><br/>The Government will be monitoring the progress and outcome of this important Central Bank examination very carefully and it has concluded that follow up actions will be pursued if the main banks do not meet the updated commitments made to the Minister for Finance.  I look forward to an update being provided by the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance in mid-December.  However, it is clear at this point that some tracker mortgage customers have been treated disgracefully by mortgage lenders and many borrowers have incurred considerable loss; in particular where they have directly or indirectly lost their homes due to this harmful action by lenders.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I assure the House that the Government is fully aware of the seriousness of this matter and it wishes to have adequate redress and compensation provided to impacted customers as quickly as possible.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#X00500"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I understand that we are a bit constrained by other business.  I will try to be as brief as I can.  I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I also thank the Leader.  I called on him to arrange a debate in the Seanad on tracker mortgages during the Order of Business at one point.  All of us here, or certainly a very significant number of us including Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Rose Conway-Walsh and indeed, previously, the Minister of State, were discussing this issue in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach as far back as last December and earlier.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of tracker mortgages today.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the thousands of customers who have been denied their contractual right to return to the tracker mortgage rates and the customers who were put on incorrect tracker rates.  Bank of Ireland recently announced that a further 6,000 customers were affected by the scandal on top of the 13,000 customers identified by the Central Bank examination, as reported in October.  It is frustrating that these were contested accounts which Bank of Ireland did not originally want to admit to, although it has now put its hands up and said that these customers are to be included and were treated incorrectly by the bank.  </p> <p>On 25 October Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a motion in the D&aacute;il calling on the banks to fully identify all customers affected by the scandal, to instantly restore all affected customers to their appropriate rates, and to pay redress and compensation to all victims without further delay.  It called on the banks to provide adequate housing to those who have lost their homes.  It is important that we remember some people lost their homes as a result of being put on the wrong rate and of being dealt with inappropriately and not in accordance with their original contracts.  It also called on the Government to consider introducing wide-ranging legislation to tackle the regulatory issue, including legalising class action suits and empowering the Financial Services Ombudsman to decide on compensation and redress levels.  The motion also calls on the Government to threaten to vote against the board of directors in each of the banks in which the State still has a shareholding.  </p> <p>The Minister met the banks on 23 and 24 October and they released statements on 25 October in respect of their individual examinations.  It is still unclear what the Minister said to the banks on this issue.  If enforcement orders by the Central Bank are the only outcome of this examination it will not be a satisfactory result.  We need personal accountability and a solid explanation as to why 11 institutions acted in precisely the same manner in respect of the scandal.  It is fairly difficult to believe that there was not some element of collusion or cartel-like behaviour in what was going on.  How could every bank have made the same mistake with their customers in respect of the same type of product?</p> <p>In early October 2017 the Central Bank published its second update before the Minister's meeting with the banks.  According to the Central Bank, the number of customers affected stood at 13,000 at that point although, as we know, the figure is set to increase.  With the 6,000 extra customers of Bank of Ireland, we are already very close to 20,000.  It is likely that figure will rise further.</p> <p>It is concerning that there appears to be a contest taking place between some of the banks and the Central Bank, in which banks are arguing that some customers should not be recognised as having been treated badly.  As we saw Bank of Ireland contested 6,000 customers.  When these customers were announced last month it doubled the number of affected accounts.  On 19 October, Central Bank figures appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  It is galling to learn that the banks unofficially threatened the Central Bank with legal action.  This is despite all that has transpired with this scandal and the fact that the Irish taxpayer bailed out these banks.</p> <p>The findings from the Central Bank update are as follows.  It believes that two lenders have failed to properly identify affected customers; the lenders&rsquo; initial proposals for redress and compensation fell well short of the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectations and they had to be pressurised consistently to bring them up to an acceptable level; two lenders did not complete phase 2 in a comprehensive manner on time and have much more work to do; the number of customers and tenants who lost their home stands at at least 102 and is set to rise further; the Central Bank imposed enforcement fines on Springboard Mortgages last year; and the Central Bank has commenced enforcement investigations against both Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank.  </p> <p>This scandal is completely unacceptable from the banks yet no credible explanation has been provided as to why this happened in all of the banks at around the same time and in the same way.  Despite the banks acknowledging the scandal, they have been incredibly slow to rectify it.  Only 40 of the 3,500 Ulster Bank mortgage holders have gotten their money back while KBC have yet to even contact some of its customers and to comply with phase 2.  KBC confirmed that it missed the Central Bank's deadline to the committee of which I am Vice Chairman.</p> <p>Padraic Kissane, a financial consultant who represents many of the victims affected, appeared before the committee.  He believes the figure will be much higher in the end, perhaps closer to 30,000, but it remains to be seen if this turns out to be the case.  The Governor of the Central Bank indicated that the total number could be at least 20,000.  Either way, a very significant number of households, families and individuals have been affected by this.</p> <p>The effect on mortgage holders' lives is incalculable and in many cases no amount of compensation will be enough to fully come to terms with the pain and suffering caused.  As we said, some have lost their homes and many have lost their lives.  The stress and suffering that has been added by the banks refusing to take responsibility is shocking.  A homeowner, Thomas Ryan, came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and told us that he suffered a stroke at the age of 47 and that his wife had a nervous breakdown.  They contend that this was a direct result of what happened to them.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has long been calling for the banks to take responsibility.  If the boot was on the other foot the banks would be tracking customers down for every last cent.  Why is it that the banks must be dragged kicking and screaming to pay back this money?  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has worked well in exposing much of the issue.  As I have mentioned, we have been questioning the banks very thoroughly and they will be before the committee again in January.  Some banks are taking the matter more seriously than others but the fact remains that money was wrongfully taken from customers and now needs to be paid back once and for all, and quickly.  The priority must be to ensure that those affected will receive restitution as quickly as possible and that the Central Bank moves through the various stages of its process to ensure customers will be treated fairly.  We will certainly do our job as committee members in interrogating and dealing with the banks.</p> <p>I appreciate that we are having the debate.  I thank the Minister of State for being here and I again thank the committee for its work.  There are switchers, however, who have not been contacted yet - people who switched mortgages and with whom the banks have not dealt.  The banks say they do not know who they are or where they are.  An individual contacted me after seeing me in the committee and said that his compensation, before redress, will be at least &euro;200,000.  That is an enormous amount of money for an individual to be without.  He has suffered and his family have suffered.  It is a very important issue and I am glad we are discussing it today.</p></speech>

My colleague has covered most of the things I wished to say.  One concern I have is that we seem to be talking more about Ned Kelly than the respectable banks the Minister of State and I once knew.  I am quite concerned that somewhere along the line these gangsters must have come together and agreed that they would all apply the same principle on tracker mortgages to their customers.  There is an internal process for the banks to identify affected customers.  My understanding of the instruction is that internal process is not just to be independent of the bank, but that there is to be no conflict of interest, either actual or perceived.  If one considers an actual conflict of interest, one would assume that the internal process is not to be carried out by some accountancy or consultancy firm which has worked for the bank before.  What about work such firms might take on the future, however?  What about the promise of a big contract at the end of the process?</p> <p>I want to see people who overpaid on their mortgages get the money they overpaid returned right now.  I do not want to see them get their compensation now because I want the courts to rule on compensation where court cases are running.  They can set the benchmark for compensation, not the banks.  We have seen the way these crooks have treated their customers.  There are people who have struggled to maintain homes while these mortgages were being overpaid and my fear is that the carrot of a quick few bob now might settle their claims much more quickly than if they were given the option to take their cases before the courts.  As we do not have not have class actions in this country, let us get a couple of court cases under our belts and see what the courts deem to be a proper level of compensation.  Then let us benchmark claims to that.  Let us not allow the banks to negotiate with the ordinary individual who has been struggling for some years while the banks have been screwing them having given them the wrong mortgage rate.</p> <p>On the collusion element, I want to know why An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not in every single bank now.  Why is the Director of Corporate Enforcement not looking at the directors of these banks?  There are people on these boards to represent the public interest.  Where are they?  What have they got to say on this?  Why have they not been hauled in to explain the situation to the Minister instead of bringing in the CEOs?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With the best will in the world, the Department of Finance does a good job.  These CEOs have treated this country in an appalling way.  They lied in 2008 when this country was going down the tubes.  They tried to convince the Minister that everything was fine.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, sat on the banking inquiry and he gave it his attention every single day.  He was there all the time, as were Senator O'Donnell and others, and they have to be commended on the amount of work put into it.  The Minister of State knows more about how these banks behave than any of us.  We need to be in there and to see exactly how banks define who is owed money.  We need to see what companies are assisting them and if there is a conflict of interest, whether perceived or actual, we need to remove companies from the process.  Very few companies in this country are big enough to do the type of work we are talking about and I fear that they have all worked for the banks at some stage in the past.  I will not delay this debate because I know we have to try to finish things, but that is what I would like the Minister of State to take on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#Y00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I commend the great work he does in the area of banking.  I want to deal with where we are now and what we can do.  The banks are being dragged, kicking and screaming, into addressing the tracker mortgage issue.  Something that brought that to the fore was four witnesses coming before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, who were compelling.  The Minister met with the banks and the banks largely committed to have compensation and redress under way before the end of the year.  Does the Minister of State have any update on where it stands at this moment?  When does he expect to meet the banks before the end of the year to find out precisely where we stand?</p> <p>At the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs yesterday, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, asked Commissioner Vestager about cartels with regard to interest rates in Ireland.  It is high-time that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission looked into that issue.  There is a view among the public that a cartel operates between the main banks.  That has to be investigated.  The competition authority or, as it is now called, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, is the authority to do it.  It has stated previously that the mortgage market in Ireland is dysfunctional.  It owes it to people, considering the rates they are paying, to look at the matter.  The Government has indicated that legislation for white-collar crime is coming in and that needs to be expedited.</p> <p>I heard both the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, mention the possibility of class action legislation.  We need to look at that.  We cannot allow the banks to behave in the way that they have with tracker mortgages.  I meet people on a regular basis in the Limerick constituency.  A lady contacted me in the past two weeks after she was visited by an individual on behalf of a bank, who had a letter, at 6 o'clock on a Friday evening when she was on her own in the house.  She was petrified.  That is not on.  This person arrived to drop in something for her former partner and she rang me in a panic.  I had to put her in touch with a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, who could make contact with the bank to bring some sort of reason to the matter.</p> <p>It now looks, from investigations, as if people who were on tracker mortgages agreed to go to a fixed rate on the basis that they would return to a tracker rate.  There now also appears to be a category where people were on trackers and were put on variable rates without even being told by the banks.  This was done by all the banks.  It has to be asked why this was done.  The banks cannot be above the law.  In some cases, it could make a difference on an average mortgage of approximately &euro;200,000 of approximately &euro;4,000 a year in mortgage repayments with regard to how banks fiddled with interest rates.  We need to have closure and people are entitled to payments of compensation and redress.</p> <p>The intervention by the Minister should not have been necessary but I felt it was appropriate at the time, and I think a further intervention will be needed.  When does the Minister of State expect that will happen?  Every person with a tracker mortgage is an individual with a family who is under pressure from the banks.  Is it not quite ironic that these same people, the taxpayers, bailed out the banks in the years after 2008 while, at the same time, these banks were ripping them off with high interest rates?  It is a bit like going into a show or nightclub where one has to pay going in the front door and again when leaving.  It is incredible that the banks think they can get away with it.  Their approach and mentality is like that for whatever reason.  In 2008, in either the committee that dealt with finance or economic and monetary affairs, I asked for the banks to come in because there was no lending to small and medium-sized enterprises.  That was in July 2008 and all the banks said things were fine.  The only one to cry that day was Richie Boucher, who said the banks had a problem.  The banks then came and took taxpayers' money and are now ripping them off again.  We need to bring closure to this and ensure that it never happens again.</p></speech>

As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I found it very frustrating to try to get positive results for those customers affected by the tracker mortgage scandals.  The growth in the number of those affected was particularly annoying.  Those banks claim that it took them time to identify all those who were removed or denied and not informed of their entitlement to a tracker mortgage.  I know the matter of people's entitlement to a tracker mortgage would be of interest with regard the case that was recently brought against Permanent TSB by O'Dwyer Solicitors in Ballymun.  That case was settled for a substantially larger amount than was originally offered.  The basis of it was that people were wrongly not allowed to avail of a tracker mortgage.</p> <p>Many people are in that situation and perhaps the Minister of State can clarify the position for us.  If a bank was offering a tracker mortgage or had one on its books over a period and somebody went to it for a mortgage but was not offered the tracker mortgage option, does that person have a case to bring under the Central Bank review?  That is hugely important.  If that is the position, which is how I would read this case against Permanent TSB, then the numbers will increase substantially.</p> <p>We have been contacted by many customers who are blue in the face from contacting their banks to ask to be included in the redress scheme and the banks are still doing the bare minimum and not listening to their own customers.  Will the Minister of State clarify what a client can expect if a bank refuses to put a client's file under review or to get his or her file in the first instance?  Where would that person go and how can we help him or her?  I highlight the work of my colleagues, Deputies Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire and Pearse Doherty, who recently presented the multi-party actions Bill to the D&aacute;il.  That Bill would allow class actions to be taken by people such as those who have suffered in the tracker mortgage scandal.  This class action move is hugely important.  Many people are financially constrained because of the tracker mortgage issue and other issues who cannot afford to take action themselves, so the class action provision is needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Has the Government made any moves to ensure that individual responsibility is taken for what was done?  Has the Minister stated clearly to the heads of the banks that action will be taken against individuals found to be responsible?  I note what the Minister of State said in regard to enforcement.  Credit is due to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for pushing for action in that regard.  I am travelling to Iceland next week, where I hope to discuss the circumstances whereby dozens of bankers in that country were sent to prison for their wrongdoing within the banking system.  Unfortunately, we all know Ireland does not do prosecution of white-collar crime.  People can only wait to see whether enforcement will finally happen in this instance.</p><p>There is much the Government could have done already in order to encourage action by the banks.  The Minister could, for example, have objected to the reappointment of the CEO of Bank of Ireland, in which the Government is a majority shareholder.  He could have sacked the boards of Permanent TSB and Allied Irish Banks.  I do sometimes empathise with the Government in all this, especially when Fianna F&aacute;il makes lots of allegations and suggestions.</p></speech>

However, I am deeply disappointed that we are having this type of debate yet again.  It is not the first time the Oireachtas has had to examine disgraceful and reckless behaviour on the part of banks in this country.  It is difficult to believe that we are in the same position again and, in this instance, the scale and impact of the wrongdoing is absolutely shocking.  As of September last, some 13,000 mortgage holders had been denied their right to a tracker rate or had been moved onto the wrong rate, which cost them a fortune.  Many of these customers were unable to meet their repayments, with the most recent figures showing that 102 people lost their properties.  In 23 of those cases, the person's home was involved.  How many of those people are now homeless?  How many woke up this morning in the cold and the lashing rain?  It is contemptible that banks' pursuit of profit could place people in this situation.</p> <p>It is important, when considering the hardships inflicted on these people, to bear in mind that we are not dealing with circumstances where individuals lost their jobs or sources of income during the recession, as happened to so many in the past decade.  What happened in these cases was purely the fault of the banks.  Moreover, these were not some random accidents or isolated incidents.  This particular practice happened across several independent banks over a number of years and, as such, appears to have become a systematic problem.  That is a serious indictment of the attitude taken by banks to customers and also of the culture and ethos within those institutions.  One wonders whether the people involved have any heart at all, or any compassion or empathy.  Their behaviour has been disgraceful.</p> <p>My focus in respect of issues of this nature is always on the families and individuals affected.  We should never lose sight of the pain, hardship and distress this has caused.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach heard testimony from a man who, under intense pressure as a consequence of the actions of his bank, had a stroke at the age of 47.  These types of stories should shame us.  As legislators, we must consider what it feels like to lose one's home, the place where one spends cherished moments with family.  To lose that home, not because one's income has dropped or a job has been lost but because one's bank illegally raised the repayment rate on one's mortgage such that it was impossible to cover the payments, amounts to a grave injustice.  The human suffering, particularly the mental health impact, must not be forgotten.  I commend the people who came forward to seek redress for this mistreatment.  That took courage and persistence in light of how long this has been going on.  They did not have the capacity for a class action suit but they pushed forward regardless.  It can be difficult at the best of times to go toe to toe with a bank or financial institution in order to highlight an injustice and have it set to rights.  The complexity of the issues in this instance makes it more difficult still.  When one is inundated with legal letters, for example, it is incredibly hard to find the time and space needed to get out from under the pressure of the financial difficulties one is experiencing and make one's case.</p> <p>A large number of the people affected have not received the moneys owing to them.  I call on the Government and the banks involved to rectify this as a matter of urgency.  For some people it could mean the difference between skipping a meal or not.  That is the seriousness of what we are dealing with here.  However, it is not enough simply to give the money back and say "Sorry".  People have lost their homes and I am concerned that the redress schemes touted fall short of what is expected and what is being proposed by the Central Bank.  We are all sick of situations like this whereby we are forced to debate the actions of banks in pursuit of profit and the ruin this has meant for ordinary people.  We need to learn from this case and put robust controls in place to ensure it does not happen in future.  That should be the key lesson from our last serious banking crisis and this latest scandal.  We must deal with the way our banks are governed and the capacity of the Central Bank and the Government to regulate them.  It is not good enough to keep saying that we must change the culture.  As legislators, the onus is on us to act to make that happen.  Given this latest scandal and those that have gone before it, I do not see how people can have any confidence in the State's ability to deal with reckless banking and financial institutions.  People  feel disempowered and, unless we act quickly, that will not change.  I urge the Government to take every step needed to correct that situation.</p></speech>

I have been talking to people about tracker mortgage issues since before I became a Minister of State.  We have all dealt with people facing these types of difficulties.  There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, somebody who was overcharged but who was capable of making the overcharged payment without it affecting him or her in a significant material way and, on the other hand, people who ended up losing their homes as a result of being overcharged.  My view is that the people who were seriously injured by the actions of the banks should be compensated by a country mile more than those who were not severely impacted.</p> <p>The Government does not regulate the banks; the Central Bank does so on behalf of the State.  Several Senators asked whether the overcharging was systematic.  We know that 10% of accounts were affected.  If it was a systematic practice, one would expect the number of accounts affected to be much higher.  I do not know how we got to the point that a nice, even 10% of customers were affected, but we are looking into that.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised a point that is very difficult to answer when she referred to the customers who went into contracts with their banks after the latter had failed to offer them a tracker rate on their mortgages.  That is the nub of the matter under discussion.  Having not been offered trackers, if they chose to enter contracts on a variable or fixed rate, should they then be entitled to compensation?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know the answer to that.</p></speech>

I think that will be decided by the courts.  It is most likely to expand to the superior courts from the original O'Dwyer case.  However, I do not know for certain.  Natural justice is always an issue.  If someone was happy to accept a variable rate at that stage, was told about a tracker and chose - with an informed mind - not to get one, should he or she be entitled to the compensation?  I do not know.  I think all those in this Chamber would have different opinions on that.</p> <p>Iceland was used as an example.  The population of Iceland is 300,000; the population of Wicklow and Wexford is equivalent.  The population of Ireland is 4.7 million.  Our population is multiple times the size of Iceland's, so comparing Iceland and Ireland in this regard is not really comparing like with like.</p> <p>Class actions are an option for the Government.  We have not reached any conclusions in that regard.  As of the end of September, there were 13,000 cases.  Representatives from five banks met the Minister for Finance and committed offers being made in respect of 12,000 cases.  It is very important that those offers be made.  If people choose not to accept offers, that is up to them.  However, offers will be made and the Central Bank will have oversight of the process.  We do not want a one-size-fits-all approach because we feel that some individuals might fall through the cracks.  Some people may be much more impacted upon or injured than others.  We do not want to see those round pegs being squeezed into square holes.  We want the process to be fair and legitimate.  First will come redress, which will involve customers betting their money back, and second will be compensation.  We want this to be fair and reasonable and ensure that the injured people are fairly treated.</p> <p>Regarding class actions and a dysfunctional market, I previously served as a Member of the D&aacute;il between 2007 and 2011.  In that period, we all said that there was not enough competition.  We brought in competition and that really made a mess of things.  Let us be honest about it.  Older, established institutions such as Bank of Ireland, which previously had not lent money for mortgages easily, suddenly went into a space that they had never occupied before because they were chasing their competitors.  National Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland, Ireland, came in and offered tracker mortgages at rates that were not sustainable.  They have since exited the market.  However, the other banks remain.  The issue we have now is whether we have a dysfunctional market.  We do not have a dysfunctional market; we have an expensive market because we do not have enough competition.  The problem is that when competition comes in, goes after market share and undercuts existing financial institutions, there is a price war.  Price wars never work out well.  Someone gets the benefit of entering early, someone gets the market share up but, eventually, there must be a sustainable product, whether a mortgage or any version of any product on the shelf of any institution.</p> <p>Is there a cartel when it comes to competition?  That is a matter for the European Commissioner for Competition.  She is pretty good at slapping us with fines, so perhaps she could look into that.</p> <p>Matters relating to the ODCE, the Garda and the Central Bank are for those institutions; they do not concern the Department of Finance.  The Central Bank is investigating and engaging in a deep dive into the financial institutions' activities.  If any information that requires to be passed on to the ODCE or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is identified, that will be a matter for the Central Bank.  I support the Central Bank 100%.  If wrongdoing is identified, we must ensure that the institutions of this State pursue it.  God knows, if someone robbed a supermarket or a bank, he or she would be pursued, and rightly so.  The same standard applies to any other wrongdoing, whether it involves white-collar crime or crime of any other type.</p> <p>If I did not reply in respect of particular issues, I apologise.</p></speech>

I recall that in October of last year the Government accepted a motion tabled in this House which called for the setting up of a judicial council and the publication of a Bill which would provide for it.  This is important and long-awaited legislation and I look forward to hearing the comments of Senators on it.  It has had a somewhat tangled history, and many hands have made a contribution to its making.  However, it would be remiss of me if, at the outset of this debate, I did not single out for special appreciation the contribution made by the former Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, since the start of this work.  Her commitment to this project was beyond question.  Her vision and energy were very much in evidence on more than one occasion in the course of the debate leading up to the introduction of the Bill this afternoon.</p> <p>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the setting up of a judicial council.  It has long been recognised that the absence of such a judicial council in Ireland is somewhat out of step with other countries which share our value system, including those countries which have a similar legal background and tradition.  Indeed, this absence has been the subject of critical comment by the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption, commonly referred to as GRECO.  Judicial councils are generally seen as having an important role to play in safeguarding the independence of judiciaries.  They also provide a vehicle for addressing matters such as further education and training, as well as matters pertaining to discipline.  In keeping with this approach, the Bill affirms the independence of the proposed judicial council and provides that one of its key functions will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions.  In addition, the Bill institutes a complaints regime for judges, which will address instances of misconduct which do not warrant the invocation of Article 35.4.1&deg; of the Constitution.  As Members know, that article relates to the removal of a judge from office for stated misbehaviour or for incapacity.</p> <p>The Judiciary is one of the fundamental pillars of our democracy and its independence is guaranteed by our Constitution.  However, the fact that it represents a separate branch of Government does not mean that it is in any way separate from the society which supports it and which it, in turn, supports.  The Bill before the House has a delicate balance to maintain.  That is why I look forward to hearing the views of Senators in the course of the debate this afternoon.</p> <p>The Bill must respect the independence of the Judiciary, which is essential if our citizens are to have confidence in the free and impartial administration of justice in the State.  However, that independence is not a privilege for the individual judge in his or her court, rather it is a protection for the individual rights and freedoms of our citizens under our laws.  It follows that independence on the one hand must be balanced by accountability on the other.  The fact that justice is, for the most part, administered in public is one aspect of accountability.  The ability to appeal a particular judgment is another.  However, the accountability gap which has existed heretofore, and which this Bill proposes to address, relates to the absence of a mechanism for dealing with complaints about judicial misconduct which would not require an intervention under our Constitution.</p> <p>Before dealing with the content of the Bill, I wish to raise two matters which have recently been in the public eye - the need for the so-called secrecy provisions in the Bill to be removed, and the need to establish a public register of pecuniary interest for members of the Judiciary.  Regarding the secrecy provisions, I have had the opportunity to review the Bill since becoming Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is fair to say that some of the provisions intended to protect the confidentiality of the complaints process do not sit well with current understandings of accountability or transparency.  I am considering, therefore, the nature of amendments which might be made to these provisions.</p> <p>With regard to a register of interests, there are not many models in the common law world upon which we can draw in putting such a register in place.  While many jurisdictions have seen debates about the need or otherwise for a register of interest for judges, very few have as yet decided to go down that path.  Nonetheless, I can see that such a register may have a function in maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process, and I will explore options in that regard.  My preliminary thinking is that the Oireachtas should have a role in setting out the broad parameters informing the creation of a register, but the operational aspects should be embedded in the structure of the judicial council itself.  In this way, we would recognise the balance which needs to be struck between the two branches of Government.  While acknowledging the need for greater openness concerning pecuniary matters, we would also acknowledge the independence with which judges are vested by virtue of their constitutional office.  This is a matter to which I hope we can return on Committee Stage.</p> <p>Turning to the Bill itself, I wish to refer to its main provisions.  Part 1 deals with matters of a general nature such as definitions and repeals.  One of the most important definitions is that of judicial misconduct.  In broad terms, this means conduct which constitutes a departure from acknowledged standards of judicial conduct and brings the administration of justice into disrepute.  It is specified that standards in this context should have regard to certain principles, which are essentially those commonly referred to as the Bangalore principles of judicial conduct.  These principles were adopted at a round table meeting of chief justices held in the Peace Palace in the Hague in November 2002 and endorsed by member states of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 2003.</p> <p>Part 2 of the Bill concerns the council itself and provides for its setting up.  In addition to the function of promoting and maintaining excellence in judges' exercise of their judicial junctions, to which I have already referred, the council will also be tasked with promoting and maintaining high standards of conduct among judges; the efficient and effective use of judicial resources; continuing education of judges; respect for the independence of the Judiciary; and public confidence in the Judiciary and the administration of justice.  The council will consist of all members of the Judiciary.  It is anticipated that it will generally meet on an annual basis, with the Chief Justice acting as its chairperson.</p> <p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with the board of the council and its committees.  However, it does not deal with the judicial conduct committee, which is covered in Part 5.  The board will be responsible for the performance of the council's functions on a day-to-day basis.  It will be chaired by the Chief Justice and will include among its members the president of each of the courts, five judges elected from each of the courts, and one judge who will be co-opted from each of the courts on a rota basis.  Provision is made for the Chief Justice and the presidents to nominate a replacement judge to act in their stead.  The board will hold a minimum of four meetings per year and will establish committees to assist it in its work from time to time.  Under this Part, the council is also obliged to establish a judicial studies committee, a sentencing information committee and judicial support committees.</p> <p>The judicial studies committee will have a role in facilitating the continuing education of judges and in the training of judges.  This will be broader than the role now undertaken by the current committee of the same name concerning matters of education and training.  The sentencing information committee will be involved in the collation and dissemination of sentencing information, and will also have a research function.  It will take on, albeit in an expanded way, the role currently carried out by the steering committee of the Irish sentencing information system, which has been in existence now for a number of years.  The judicial support committees will be available to advise each of the courts, and to assist the council in the performance of its functions concerning their particular court.  It will be possible for the judicial council to appoint persons who are not judges to be members of both the judicial studies committee and the sentencing information committee. </p> <p>Part 4 of the Bill deals with staffing and funding issues.  Provision is made for the appointment of a secretary to the council, who would also act as registrar of the judicial conduct committee.  Funding for the council will be provided via the Department of Justice and Equality Vote, and the council will be required to prepare an annual report of its activities, which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Part 5 is a core element of the Bill.  It creates the formal structures which will, for the first time, provide a delivery mechanism to allow for the investigation of complaints of judicial misconduct which fall outside the current constitutional framework.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I have already referred to Article 35 of the Constitution, which provides that a judge of the superior courts shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his or her removal.  This constitutional process has been extended by statute to the question of removal and dismissal of Circuit Court and District Court judges.  Otherwise, with the exception of statutory provisions dealing with investigating and reprimanding judges of the District Court, there is no means of investigating or dealing with allegations of judicial misconduct to which Article 35 of the Constitution would not apply.</p><p>Many in this House will be aware of the history of the Bill.  However, in order to contextualise the complaints provision in particular, I would recall for Senators the fact that the genesis of those provisions lies in the report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics, which was established in 1999 and which reported in the year 2000.  That committee concluded that the existing structures for dealing with concerns about judicial misconduct were inadequate and that formal structures should be put in place to deal with misconduct which would not justify the invocation of the formal Oireachtas procedure.  The type of misconduct instanced included discourtesy, prejudice, demonstrated insensitivity to the feelings of litigants, witnesses, members of the public or anybody engaged in the services of the courts.</p><p>At the heart of Part 5 is the provision relating to the establishment of the judicial conduct committee.  The function of that committee will be to promote and maintain high standards of conduct.  Given the importance of this function, I think it would be helpful to Senators if I set out some of the ways in which the Bill envisages this function will be carried out in day-to-day practice.  The committee will consider complaints and refer them for resolution by informal means for investigation.  It will prepare and submit draft guidelines to the board concerning judicial conduct and ethics within 12 months of its establishment, with a view to their adoption by the council.  Furthermore, it may provide advice and recommendations to an individual judge, or to judges generally, on judicial conduct and ethics.</p><p>The committee will have 13 members.  It will be chaired by the Chief Justice and it will include the presidents of all of the courts.  It will be possible for these judges to nominate another judge to perform their functions from time to time.  There will also be three elected judges on the committee.  Finally, five lay members will be appointed by the Government following on from a selection process that will take place under the aegis of the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>In keeping with the need for transparency in respect of the investigation of complaints, the committee will be required to publish the procedures which are to be followed in the making, the investigation and the determination of complaints.  In broad terms, the process will be as follows.  The registrar applying the criteria set out in the legislation will determine whether a complaint is admissible.  If the complaint is deemed to be inadmissible, it will be open to the complainant to have that determination reviewed by the complaints review committee.  That committee will consist of three members of the judicial conduct committee - two judges and a layperson.  The complaints regime will only apply to judicial misconduct that will be alleged to occur after the regime enters into force.  In order to introduce certain efficiencies into the process, provision is being made for the possibility that a judge may consent to being reprimanded by the judicial conduct committee, either before a complaint is investigated or while it is being investigated by a panel of inquiry.</p><p>There are also provisions which address what will happen in the event that a complainant or, indeed, a judge fails to co-operate with a panel of inquiry.  Furthermore, it will be open to the judicial conduct committee to investigate judicial misconduct even where no complaint has been received or where a complaint has been withdrawn.  The rationale for these provisions is that it is clearly not in the public interest that a clear sense of judicial misconduct should go without process or without investigation simply because no complaint has been made.  The actual investigation of a complaint will be carried out by a panel of inquiry.  The panels of inquiry would have three members - two judges and one layperson.  The latter will be drawn from a nominated group of individuals recommended to the Government by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>Special provision has been made to deal with two separate scenarios.  The first concerns the possibility that the alleged judicial misconduct may be related to the health of the judge concerned.  The second relates to the interface between the conduct regime proposed by the Bill and Article 35.4.1o of the Constitution.  The effect of the latter provision is that if an investigation discloses that the matter under investigation is of such gravity as would warrant the tabling of a motion under Article 35.4.1o, any subsequent action becomes a matter for the Legislature and not for the committee.  This affirms the prerogative of the Legislature in respect of this matter, a prerogative which is given explicit recognition by way of a statement in the legislation that nothing in it should be construed as affecting the power of the Oireachtas to remove a judge from office under the law.</p><p>Once the investigation of a complaint has been completed, a panel of inquiry will submit a report to the judicial conduct committee setting out its findings.  Prior to that submission, both the judge and the complainant will be provided with a copy of the report and given the opportunity to make submissions if they believe that fair procedures have not, in the circumstances, been observed.  Where a panel of inquiry finds that an allegation in a complaint has been proved, the recommendations for the reprimand of the judge concerned may include the issuing of advice, a recommendation as to the pursuit of a specified course of action, such as attendance at a training course and the issuing of an admonishment.</p><p>I recognise that somewhat antiquated terms, such as the "issuing of advice" or "the issuing of an admonishment", may not sound serious or, indeed, punitive to modern ears but I am sure that Senators, lawyers and constitutional experts in the Chamber will agree that these may be considered quite serious sanctions for a judge in the context of the authority and, indeed, having regard to the independence of that important office.  It should also be borne in mind that this Bill does not displace the constitutional role of the Oireachtas nor, indeed, its powers under Article 35.4.1o to remove a judge from office for stated misbehaviour or to remove a judge from office in the event of him or her being incapacitated.  Furthermore, additional recommendations directed towards safeguarding the administration of justice are also possible.</p><p>It will be open to the judicial conduct committee to accept - with or without any modification - a recommendation made to it by a panel of inquiry.  It will be also open to it to reject such a recommendation.  In any event, prior to the committee issuing its determination, both the judge and the complainant will be given an opportunity to make submissions regarding the recommendations included in the report and, where necessary, an oral hearing may be required to be held.</p><p>A final provision to which I wish to draw the attention of Senator relates to the annual report which the judicial conduct committee will be required to produce.  The Bill sets out an extensive range of statistical data which must be included in that annual report.  This will provide a useful perspective on the work of the committee.  It will also provide a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed complaints regime.</p><p>I thank Senators for their attention.  I want to hear their observations on the Bill.  As a result of its centrality, I have spent some time dealing with the complaints regime that the Bill will establish.  However, it is right to recall and place on record the fact that we are particularly fortunate to have a Judiciary which is extremely well regarded in terms of its perceived independence and its integrity.  This is reflected in the fact that Ireland has consistently received very high rankings in this area in successive global competitiveness reports from the World Economic Forum and from the EU justice scoreboard.  It is very important that we bear this in mind as we debate the Bill.  We need to have a full understanding of the special position of judges in our country, our courts and under our Constitution.  The Bill achieves the appropriate level of balance between independence, on the one hand, and accountability, on the other.</p><p>I thank Senators for their attention and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

As the Minister has outlined, the country has been very well served by the Judiciary and that has been internationally recognised.  The establishment of a judicial council by the Bill will ensure continued public confidence in judicial integrity.  Fianna F&aacute;il has long called for the introduction of a procedure for investigating allegations of judicial misconduct.  The public currently has no formal procedure through which to make a complaint against a member of the Judiciary.  I ask the Minister to clarify in his closing remarks whether it is open to members of the public to make a complaint to the president of the court of which a judge is a member.  Has he any statistics in respect of the number of complaints that the presidents receive in that regard?</p><p>In 2010, the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, published a scheme for a judicial council Bill.  It sought to establish a judicial council to investigate allegations of judicial misconduct and provide options for dealing with misconduct where the nature of the misconduct warranted investigation and action but was not sufficiently serious to call for the removal of the judge from office.  Much like the Bill before the House today, the council was to be an independent body charged with the promotion of excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions.  The 2011 Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a judicial council.  Regrettably, like so many other promises in that programme for Government, that was not delivered upon.  However, I am glad a similar Bill is now before the House.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes that one major flaw in the Bill is that it provides for inquiries into the misconduct of judges to be held in private under section 55 and that reprimanded judges will not be named.  Fianna F&aacute;il will table amendments to remove that secrecy.  If a judge is reprimanded, the public is entitled to be informed of his or her identity.  The goal of the Bill, which is to improve public confidence in the administration of justice, is undermined if the identity of judges who are sanctioned is kept secret.</p><p>The Bill includes provision for the establishment of a sentencing information committee to collate information on sentences imposed by the courts and to share that information with judges and other persons.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes in the need for improving consistency in criminal sentencing and is committed to achieving that.  It introduced the Judicial Sentencing Commission Bill in 2013 which sought to support judges in their decision making while maintaining their independence.  While the Bill before the House today goes some way to improving consistency in sentencing, we believe that we should proceed with our judicial sentencing Bill as the proposals in the Judicial Council Bill do not go far enough.</p><p>From my own experience in court as a defendant and a witness, I was very impressed by the workload the Judiciary in the District Court deals with on a daily basis.  In my experience as a defendant in minor cases such as speeding and as a witness in some other cases in that court, they do so very professionally and humanely and are very overworked.</p><p>All Members are familiar with the term "if it is not broken, do not fix it" but there has been an attempt by some members of Government who do not have direct responsibility for the appointment of judges to interfere in that process.  As both the Minister and I have said, the country has been well served by the Judiciary.  The appointment of judges should remain the constitutional function of the Government and the process that is in place is sufficient and should be left alone.</p><p>There are other issues I would like to be dealt with but they are not up for debate today.  As I raised with the Minister's predecessor, the retirement age of a judge of the District Court is 65, although they are entitled to apply on a yearly basis for extensions up to the age of 70.  That is demeaning to them and they should be entitled to retire at 70, the age at which judges of the other courts may retire.  That age should be raised to 72 for all judges because it takes a number of years to build up the expertise needed to become a judge and if a person is appointed in his or her 60s it gives them very limited time to exercise that function.  That should be considered.  It is not relevant to today's Bill but it should be discussed further down the road.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is very happy to support the Bill and we look forward to the Minister's closing remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#DD00200"><p>I warmly welcome the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to the House and do so in particular because he is carrying the Bill under his arm.  As Senator Wilson said, others have stood in the Minister's place and failed to deliver on this matter.  I occupied his position for five years.  Prior to my being Minister for Justice it was the desire of the Judiciary to have a judicial council established by law.  While I was in office, the situation was slightly different in that I was taking all the initiative and at times it felt as if I was playing handball against a haystack.  Happily, several people have now brought about this particular departure in law, which I welcome.  I also welcome and hope that the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature are singing from the same hymn sheet in respect of what can and cannot be done and what should and should not be done.</p> <p>I echo what Senator Wilson said regarding our Judiciary being generally and almost universally of a very high quality.  We have been very well served by them.  Their appointments have generally been wise and appropriate.  I echo his sentiment that recent experience shows that very good appointments can be made without the introduction of a very elaborate judicial appointments advisory board.  The cost of the board, estimated at &euro;1 million per annum, seems to be a waste.  The real issue is excellence of choice by the Cabinet, excellence of advice by the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality as to who the best people are who come through whatever filtration system there is and courage on the part of the Government to appoint people on the basis of merit, whatever their political leanings or whether they have any political leanings at all.</p> <p>I welcome what the Minister said about the terms of the Bill.  I particularly welcome his remarks about revisiting section 55(5) which appears to provide for a general regime of secrecy in regard to the manner in which the judicial conduct committee would carry out its functions.  I do not believe the majority of judges want that stipulation even if some expressed a desire for it at an earlier stage.  It is misguided and most people feel it should not be countenanced.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the other hand, the Judiciary is in a weak position and it must be protected from malicious, vicious attacks on it and there is, in the Bill, a screening mechanism to ensure that people do not bring complaints and have them adjudicated in public just simply in a kamikaze effort to destroy or impugn a person's reputation by having the opportunity under privilege to attack him or her.  I believe this is right.<br/><br/>Some people may say that admonishment is not much of a sanction, but we do have to remember, as the Minister said, that the ultimate sanction is vested in these Houses, and that is the sanction of removal under the Constitution.  Admonishment may sound somewhat Victorian as a term of criticism, but no judge would lightly disregard a public admonishment from a State council composed of a majority of his or her colleagues on the Bench.  Short of removing a judge, it is hard to know what to do that would go beyond admonishment.  Nobody is suggesting there should be a system of fines, and that would be, in my view, a very strange thing to do.<br/><br/>The Minister mentioned the question of a register of interests, and that is something about which I have had some worries.  I fully accept what the Minister is feeling his way towards, which is some kind of private register that would be internalised into the process of a judicial council.  The post of being a Superior Court judge, and I will deal with this for the time being, is not all that attractive today.  If one had to lay bare what land or property one owned or what one's means were, in my view it would make people who had any substantial assets reluctant to start announcing what they were.  It is an inhibition to those people who do have substantial assets going into politics that they have their private affairs raked over as to what they do or do not own.  A lot of people who have wealth would avoid going into politics because they would see it as one area of their privacy which would be interfered with.  It has always struck me that probably the greater issue for many judges is to whom they owe money rather than by whom they are owed money or what property they own.  If one is indebted for &euro;3 million to a particular bank should one hear a case involving that bank?  Is that not much more of a worry?  I only mention this to point out the difficulty.  I do not suggest that every judge has to register his or her debts to function on the bench.  I think that is excessive.<br/><br/>I also want to mention the wording of section 58, which refers to accepting a &quot;reprimand&quot;, and section 63(5), which uses the term &quot;admonishment&quot;.  I presume they are intended to be more or less the same thing.  If they are, it would be a good idea if we decided one way or the other in the legislation to opt between &quot;reprimand&quot; or &quot;admonishment&quot; as the name of the declaratory criticism sanction we are dealing with.<br/><br/>The definition in the Bill of judicial misconduct set out in section 2 could perhaps be looked at again.  It states judicial misconduct:</p><blockquote>means conduct (whether an act or omission) by a judge, whether in the execution of his or her office or otherwise, and whether generally or on a particular occasion, that -(a) constitutes a departure from acknowledged standards of judicial conduct, such standards to have regard to the principles of judicial conduct referred to in section 7(1)(b) and 30(2)</blockquote><p>The only thing I would say about it is the phrase &quot;acknowledged standards&quot; seems to be a little vague.  There should be generally accepted standards as well as those laid down in any code of conduct.  There could be arguments about what is or is not an acknowledged standard.  The phrase &quot;generally accepted standards of judicial conduct&quot; might be more objective than &quot;acknowledged standards&quot;.<br/><br/>With these few remarks, I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill through.  I regret it took so long for it to be put before the Houses.  Subject to the Minister's points about revisiting some of the sections of the Bill with a view to their improvement, given that these Houses sometimes have a dearth of legislative activity to carry out, this Bill should get fair wind in its sails and be put through with expedition, because there are mishaps in politics and it would be a tragedy if, after getting the Bill to this Stage, anything were to stop it going any further.</p></speech>

I apologise for being slightly late.  Senator Conway was to deal with this matter and he was delayed so I apologise on his behalf also.  I welcome that the Minister has brought forward this Bill.  Like my colleagues, I would also set out that over the past 90 years the Judiciary has served us well and has enjoyed total independence from the Oireachtas and the Government of the day.  It has arrived at very fair decisions in its dealing with the public, whether in family law, criminal law or in any other area.  There are times when we need to look and see what changes need to be brought about.  The Minister has come forward with the Bill, setting out what those changes should be.</p> <p>Regarding the courts system, there are checks and balances in our Constitution, in that the Government can be held to account through the courts system.  Likewise, within the courts there are various appeals processes, whereby in the lower courts one can appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court, cases initially tried in the Circuit Court can be appealed to the High Court on circuit, and matters in the High Court can go to the Court of Appeal.  We introduced amending legislation in this regard in recent years.</p> <p>The judicial council is something that, as Senator McDowell has outlined, has been sought by the Judiciary for some time.  It is welcome that we are bringing it forward.  I agree with Senator McDowell on the judicial appointments advisory board.  I am just concerned about the cost of it, in particular when I look back over the years regarding the fair and appropriate manner people have been appointed to the Bench, no matter who has been in government.  As I have said, all of the judges down through the years have served us well and have enjoyed that independence without interference from the Government.</p> <p>I have a concern about the complaints procedure as set out in the Bill.  I believe there need to be checks and balances.  Whether a case is about a dispute between neighbours or family law, no one will be totally satisfied.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I recently spoke to a colleague about a family law case that has gone on for over 16 years in which a lay litigant has used all sorts of mechanisms within the court system to prolong a matter.  Every member of the Judiciary operated in a very fair and appropriate manner and gave considerable leeway to the lay litigant.  The problem is that the process has now taken a long time to deal with.  That is because the judges felt they needed to give that space to the lay litigant.  It is about having checks and balances.  Nobody could complain about any of the decisions, but the problem for the person on the other side was that delay in the process.  The members of the Judiciary are very concerned that a matter coming before the courts is dealt with in a speedy and timely manner.  A decision needs to be reached and it should not be allowed to drag on <i>ad infinitum</i>.<br/><br/>The Court of Appeal was put in place due to a delay of over four years in having matters dealt with in the Supreme Court.  I understand that a list is now building up in the Court of Appeal, which removes one of the advantages of setting it up.  Hopefully that will also resolve itself.<br/><br/>Overall the Bill is welcome.  The issue regarding the judicial appointments advisory board should be reconsidered.  While going through the Bill in this House or in the D&aacute;il, serious consideration should be given to that issue.  Why do we need to introduce it at this stage given that there will be a cost factor?  If the process that has been there for some time needs to be strengthened, so be it.  I am not clear if we need to introduce the amendments that are now proposed.<br/><br/>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I thank the Department of Justice and Equality officials for their work.  Careful consideration should be given to the amendments.</p></speech>

Mar an gc&eacute;anna le roinnt de na cainteoir&iacute; go dt&iacute; seo, t&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta an Bille seo a fheice&aacute;il ag teacht &oacute;s &aacute;r gcomhair inniu.  I welcome the Minister and welcome the Bill, much of which is in concert with what I have been requesting during my short time in this House, as have many others going back even longer, as Senator McDowell said.  I am happy to say that my party will be supporting the Bill through the various Stages although we will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister will welcome and encourage those amendments, and participation by us and others.</p> <p>The Bill on first reading appears to aim to promote excellence and best practice among judges and the functioning of the Judiciary.  It put in place a system to deal with complaints about judges, which fall below the level necessary to trigger impeachment but are deemed not to be abiding by principles of best practice when administering the law of the State.</p> <p>The judicial conduct committee, to be established under the Bill to examine complaints, will issue an annual report on its investigations.  However, to the Bill's detriment, judges' names will not be published in that report unless they fail to co-operate with the committee or fail to complete a sanction imposed on them.  I am unsure as to why such a provision would be in place.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that.</p> <p>While I understand everybody is afforded the right to privacy as a citizen of this State, I fail to see a compelling argument as to why such a clause should be inserted in this Bill, something my party will seek to amend on Committee Stage.  Under the Bill, inquiries will be held in private and it will be an offence, attracting a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a jail term of up to 12 months, to publish any document or evidence provided to the inquiry.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be holding inquiries into the conduct of barristers and solicitors in public and that no anonymity will be provided.  It is not uncommon in other professions, so I do not understand why protections should be afforded to this one as some sort of privilege.</p> <p>Public confidence in the Judiciary requires not only accountability for misconduct, but also transparency.  However, that is not achieved under the legislation currently.  Judges who behave improperly should be named.  Judges who intend to act properly into the future should have nothing to fear from the inclusion of a measure to publicly name those who act improperly.</p> <p>My colleague and Sinn F&eacute;in justice spokesperson in the last D&aacute;il, Senator Mac Lochlainn, published legislation on 8 October 2015 that sought to introduce a sentencing council in this State.  The Senator put months of work into that comprehensive legislation.  We plan to introduce many of its provisions on Committee Stage as we feel it would further strengthen the Bill and would complement it.</p> <p>A sentencing council already operates in England and Wales and provides sentencing guidelines to the Judiciary.  This has ensured that sentences handed out for criminal offences in their courts are consistent and accountable across the board.  Concern has arisen over recent years about the perceived inconsistency of sentencing in our courts.  Of particular concern and controversy have been some sentences handed out for sexual offences, an issue that has again arisen only today after a very small sentence administered to a prominent journalist for a very grave and sickening crime.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn has examined the model of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales for some time.  We believe that this model of consistency and accountability should be introduced in this State.  A key strength of the sentencing council model is that it involves a range of key stakeholders such as victim support groups, academics, senior police officers, senior parole officers and the wider public in the process of establishing sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary.  As members of the Judiciary are the majority members of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales and a senior member of the Judiciary chairs the council, they are still central to the process.</p> <p>However, the sentencing guidelines issued ensure that the Judiciary must stick to the range provided for the category of offence before them.  They must also clearly indicate why they have sentenced an offender within that range, taking into consideration the impact on the victim and the blameworthiness of the offender.  This ensures consistency and accountability across the court system and across the State.</p> <p>Similar to the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, the sentencing council we are proposing for this State would develop sentencing guidelines and monitor their use, and assess the impact of guidelines on sentencing practice.  It may also be required to consider the impact of policy and legislative proposals relating to sentencing when requested by the Government, and promote awareness among the public regarding the realities of sentencing and publishing information regarding sentencing practice in our court system.</p> <p>We must consider the impact of sentencing decisions on victims and monitor the application of the guidelines to better predict the effect of them.  We need to play a greater part in promoting understanding of and increasing public confidence in sentencing and the criminal justice system overall. </p> <p>I again reiterate my party's support for the Bill.  I commend Senator Mac Lochlainn on his work on our amendment.  I thank the Minister for making this Bill a priority and bringing it before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-22a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112200002#FF00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House, and I welcome this important and long-overdue Bill.  Like others, I express my support and that of the Labour Party group for the Bill.  I look forward to teasing out the proposals in it on Second Stage, and also on Committee and Report Stages.</p> <p>As we know, the Bill will introduce for the first time a formalised system for the public to make complaints about judicial misconduct.  Actually it is about much more than that.  As the Minister did in his speech, many of our contributions will concentrate on Part 5, relating to the misconduct or complaints provisions.  Of course, the judicial council is a far more important entity and provides for many more aspects than that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When one looks at judicial councils in other jurisdictions, one sees that these are forums where judges seek to ensure best practice, promulgate codes of conduct among their members and provide for support structures for themselves.  We see that in this Bill.  We know the need for a judicial council has been strongly recognised by judges in Ireland in order to enhance public confidence in the Judiciary and to affirm its independence.  It is important for all these reasons.<br/><br/>Like other Senators, as a former practising barrister, I would like to say that we all appreciate the independence and integrity of the Judiciary generally and note the high regard in which our judges are held internationally.  Ruadh&aacute;n Mac Cormaic's great recent book on the Supreme Court illustrates that in his insights into the members of the Supreme Court and their work.  We need to have a judicial council.  This has been flagged for a long time.  We have seen more than 20 years of consultations and promises to legislate.  I note the Minister commended former Chief Justice, Susan Denham.  It is important to commend her work leading to the preparation of this Bill.  She has been very involved in the past in preparing draft legislation and pushing the need for this.  I was struck by one comment she made saying there was a significant institutional vacuum where we do not have a provision for a judicial council.  Those are the reasons it is important to see this Bill in place.  I note, as others have said, that there was a commitment to a judicial council in the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government in 2011.  I am sorry that we did not deliver on that.  I think Senator McDowell has also given a<i>mea culpa</i>about failure to deliver.  Successive Governments have failed to deliver so having this Bill before us now is extremely welcome.<br/><br/>I know the Bill is part of a package of measures.  Earlier this year, we saw the introduction of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  Others have commented on that.  My view is that we could have strengthened the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, and enhanced its powers to have greater effect without the need for the new Bill but perhaps that is only of historical interest.<br/><br/>Turning to the structures and provisions of the Bill, one has to acknowledge that there has never been a completed process of impeachment under the Constitution and others have referred to the Article 35.4.1&deg; procedure providing for impeachment for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  We have never seen a completed process to that effect in the Oireachtas but concerns were raised about particular issues and members of the Judiciary in the late 1990s and there was the Curtin case in 2002.  That is part of the context of this.<br/><br/>Looking at the provisions of the Bill, one of the first things I wanted to refer to is its relationship with the constitutional procedure and, in particular, the definitions contained in the Bill.  I think Senator McDowell referred to those.  In section 2 of the Bill, we see the phrase &quot;judicial misconduct&quot;, which is used throughout the Bill, in particular in Part 5.  That is the key concept on which the complaints procedure is built.  The question I have is how that relates to the constitutional definition of stated misbehaviour or incapacity.  A different phrase is used.  It is misconduct rather than misbehaviour.  What does this mean in practice?  I am looking at the definition in section 2, constituting the departure from acknowledged standards of judicial conduct and so forth with reference to those principles set out on section 7(1)(b) and section 32.  I think the standards in section 7(1)(b) are very important and welcome.<br/><br/>I particularly welcome the recognition of the need to ensure equality of treatment to all persons before the courts but reading on in section 7, perhaps more detail could be provided on those principles.  I note that it is envisaged that the council will provide what are called guidelines.  I do not see a specific reference to a code of conduct for the Judiciary.  I know it was a recommendation in the 2014 Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO, report to which the Minister referred.  Clearly the GRECO called for an independent statutory council to be adopted in Ireland but it also recommended a code of conduct for judges and a dedicated training service for judges.  Are the provisions relating to guidelines referred to in this Bill sufficient to constitute a code of conduct such that we would have more detail on what the high standards of conduct expected of judges are and, in particular, where we fall short of those and where misconduct becomes misbehaviour?<br/><br/>I was interested in the provisions further on in the Bill which refer specifically to the relationship with the Constitution, particularly section 67 of the Bill which gives us what we might call the transition process, which is the referral by the judicial conduct committee to the Minister of a matter relating to conduct or capacity of a judge which Article 35.4 prefaces.  That seems to provide the only route for the judicial council to take where a panel of inquiry has formed the opinion that a matter disclosed by the investigation relating to conduct or capacity is of such gravity that it would justify a referral by the judicial conduct committee with regard to that judge.  That provision in section 67(3) seems to be the only guidance given to the panel of inquiry and the judicial conduct committee on when a matter becomes misbehaviour of a constitutional nature as opposed to misconduct of a statutory nature.  Can more detail be given to that or is that sufficient?  Are we satisfied that it is enough definition to govern the relationship between statute and Constitution?<br/><br/>I have spoken about section 7, the functions of the council and why there is no reference to a code, as I see it.  GRECO required that the issue of training be addressed and I welcome the provisions for it.  Section 17, on the Committee for Judicial Studies, is very welcome.  I am grateful to Maeve O'Rourke from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, for pointing out to me that it might also be worth including a specific reference to training on human rights and equality provisions.  There is a specific mention about training in IT which is clearly important, as it is for all of us to increase capacity in that area.  Given the reference in section 7 to standards and equality of access to justice, perhaps we should have something about equality and discrimination.  I will give a short anecdote.  In an academic capacity some years ago, I gave a paper to what is called &quot;judges school&quot;, the Judicial Studies Institute, to judges about the right to an interpreter before the courts.  In the course of researching that, I came across some quite serious issues relating to comments made by individual judges, generally at District Court level, about nationalities of persons coming before the courts.  I will not go into more detail on that but it is in the public domain and it is an area where there has been public concern.  It might be worth having a specific reference to human rights and equality obligations in section 17 although there is a general provision about training.  The legislation could also make provision for the right of judges to pursue further academic studies which is a recommendation from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties when talking more generally about judges' councils in 2007.<br/><br/>The sentencing information committee mentioned in section 18 is welcome.  We need to enhance our capacity there.  I have a more general point arising from provisions in sections 37 and 51 about the role of the complainant.  While there is much focus in Part 5 of the Bill on the judge about whom a complaint is made, and rightly so, I wonder if we should focus more on the complainant.  The Part 5 procedure is complex.  I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which provided us with a very useful diagram showing how complaints would proceed.  When one reads Part 5, it is hard to follow the process.  Should there therefore be provision, where a complaint is found admissible and a panel of inquiry has been constituted, to provide assistance to a complainant?  The ICCL suggests access to free legal representation once the matter proceeds to investigation.  I take the point that costs are involved here and that complaints may be made which are not admissible and are ruled out.  I do not know about free legal aid.  I think there can be more support and provisions for complainants.  For example, in section 62, where an investigation is adjourned by the panel of inquiry, there is a provision that the panel of inquiry must notify the judge that it is adjourning the investigation but there is no provision that it must notify the complainant.  That is a very basic matter.  In section 64, there is a requirement that a report of the panel will go to the complainant but we need to make the procedure workable.</p></speech>
