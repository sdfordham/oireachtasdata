He is almost as familiar as I am with the subject matter we will deal with.  He opened the gardens of Killarney House, which are a tremendous asset, last year.  It is the St. Stephen's Green of Killarney.  A significant number of visitors have passed through the amenity.  The Minister of State is an annual visitor to Killarney.</p> <p>As the Minister of State has said, the investment in the house and gardens involves about &euro;8 million.  It is the foremost visitor attraction in Killarney and is capable of becoming the largest visitor attraction in the south.  Are we hiding our light under a bushel in not having the amenity open?  A year ago, the Minister of State and I thought the gardens would have reopened earlier this year, but that has not happened. </p> <p>It is the house of the Browne family, who were the Earls of Kenmare and very involved in the development of Killarney town over centuries.  Latterly, it has been the home of John McShane, the man who built the Pentagon and other famous buildings in Washington.  It is intended that it be the main visitor centre for Killarney National Park.  One can guess how important that is. </p> <p>The house has been involved in the development of the town over a long period of time.  It is one of the most, if not the most, valuable tourist asset in the south.  It has become a major attraction, but if the house is reopened it will become the main attraction in the south and south-west. </p> <p>I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State.  Mr. Pat Dawson, the regional manager for the area, and his staff are very good.  The Minister of State might refer to the governance and management that is in place.  I am sure his Department has sorted things out internally and is capable of doing good job.</p></speech>

The Killarney House project involves my Department, the Office of Public Works, as project managers for the construction, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Department first announced the project in 2011 with a budget of &euro;10 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its tourism capital investment programme and the balance is being funded by my Department.</p> <p>The National Tourism Development Authority&rsquo;s significant financial contribution to the project is a clear statement of its confidence that this project will make a significant contribution in the future to the south-west tourism offering. I am confident that the development will optimise the potential of Killarney House as a top class visitor and tourism centre.  It will do this in parallel to respecting its prime focus as a visitor centre for Killarney National Park and by developing its status as a heritage property managed by my Department. </p> <p>In 2016, it was decided to pursue the opening of Killarney House and Gardens on a phased basis.  The opening of the gardens occurred during 2016 and the completion of the historic rooms and the interpretative exhibition is being prioritised for 2017.  I recognise the significant interest at local level in opening the facility as soon as possible, and I assure the Senator my Department is working tirelessly to meet these deadlines.</p> <p>The house is being developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the national park, highlighting the beauty, richness and significance of the park&rsquo;s landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of human interaction with the park over the centuries.  Some of the formal rooms are currently being restored to their former glory.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, the original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the House have been restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the park and provide vistas linking the town to the scenery of the mountain, woods and water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The gardens were opened to much public acclaim in April 2016 and I formally opened them last August.</p><p>The visitor centre will have various aspects, including a newly built extension to the house.  It will be a visitor centre for the national park, explaining its significance and importance to the town and region, providing information on the major themes of the national park: mountains, woods, water and the human impact on the environment.  The final phase of building works to the house is now complete.  I intend to open the historical rooms element of the exhibition during the summer.  In this context, works in the restoration and refurbishment of the furniture collection for display are significantly advanced.  The exhibition phase of the project, to be located within Killarney House, is advancing and I expect the various elements of the works to be completed this year.  It is intended to open them to the public as soon as they are completed.</p><p>Visitors to Killarney usually stay in the town and visit other locations and attractions within the immediate area or the wider region.  The length of stay tends to be quite short and, in the case of bus tours, may be just one night.  Often a visit will be confined to Muckross House which focuses on cultural heritage and many tourists will leave Killarney unaware of the true extent and beauty of the national park that surrounds them.  When completed, Killarney House and gardens will explain the relevance and importance of Killarney National Park both from a cultural and a natural heritage point of view which will be to the benefit of tourists and local businesses.</p><p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to update him on what will no doubt prove to be one of the country's most significant assets from a cultural and a natural heritage perspective.</p></speech>

The significant line was: "I intend to open the historical rooms element of the exhibition during the summer."  I look forward to him doing so as early as possible in time for the main part of the season.  It seems, however, that there is a delay in opening the interpretative centre exhibition area for the national park.  The Minister of State will open the historical rooms and the rest will be opened on a phased basis.  Is there a problem, financial or otherwise?</p></speech>

I do not know whether the Minister of State can tell me anything about it, but it is a question that is on everybody's lips in the town of Killarney and among those connected with the tourism industry in the south west.  If the Minister of State can say a little about it and perhaps about management of the centre when it is opened, it would be appreciated.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided &euro;5.2 million.  As I told the Senator previously in the House, I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism when the decision was taken and believe it was the right one.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is putting up the remaining funds.</p> <p>We agreed that we would open the centre on a phased basis.  We had a great day last year.  There was great community spirit when the gardens were opened.  Works to the house are now complete.  Works to the exhibition and historical rooms are taking a little longer.  We are putting pressure on the OPW to have them completed.  There is great interest in Killarney where people want to have the house open this summer.  I am putting pressure on the OPW to have it ready, with the exhibition rooms, if we can, but it is taking longer than expected to complete.</p> <p>There is no problem with funding.  My understanding is that &euro;10 million was the sum that was required.  Like every development that has ever taken place in the country, there may be a knock-on effect with people looking for more than they looked for at the beginning, but everything is being resolved.  I am confidence that the house will be opened and we are trying to have the exhibition and historical rooms opened as quickly as possible.  There may be some problems, but they are being dealt with.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#B01000"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.</p> <p>I refer to the provision of funding for two bridges in County Donegal, Tyrconnell Bridge in Donegal town and the nearby Fintra Bridge.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, met a delegation from Donegal municipal district at the end of February, for which I thank him.  Both bridges are in a poor state of repair and in need of immediate attention.  </p> <p>Tyrconnell Bridge is located in the centre of Donegal town.  It is an old railway bridge and its construction dates back to 1895.  It is vital in that it links one part of the town with the other.  Unfortunately, it is in a very dangerous state and deteriorating day by day.  Donegal County Council carried out a structural survey in 2000, at which point it reduced the load bearing capacity of the bridge to 7.5 tonnes.  Twelve years later, owing to ongoing concerns about the deteriorating construction of the bridge, another survey was conducted by the council, as a result of which the load bearing capacity was reduced to 3.5 tonnes.  It is probably the case that the construction of the bridge has got even worse since.  As I am sure the Minister of State can appreciate, trying to police vehicles traversing the bridge to ensure they are under 3.5 tonnes is a task in itself.  It is dangerous.  When the repairs are completed, there will be the normal load bearing capacity of approximately 40 tonnes.  The council has progressed the issue as far as it can from its own resources and is now seeking funding which could be spread over three years.</p> <p>Fintra Bridge provides a vital link between the towns of Killybegs, Kilcar, Carrick and Glencolmcille.  It is located on the Wild Atlantic Way and a vital piece of infrastructure.  It also provides a link with Slieve League, one of the country's premier tourist attractions which last year was visited by over 185,000 people, and with Glencolmcille Folk Park.  It is, therefore, of national significance.  It is, however, in a poor state or repair.  It is so narrow in parts that two vehicles cannot pass each other and numerous accidents have been recorded.  As a result, there are tailbacks which are a road traffic hazard and create their own dangers.  Using its own resources, Donegal County Council has advanced the project to the point where funding is needed to enable it to be put out to tender.</p> <p>For the two projects, a figure of &euro;2 million has been mentioned which, I understand, could be provided on a phased based over a three-year period.  These are two vital pieces of infrastructure, but, currently, they are hazards and a danger to the public.  The last thing we want to see happen is an accident on both.  I earnestly request the Department to seriously consider providing funding for both projects as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#B01100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who answered an oral question on 22 March on the same issue.  I am happy to restate the position.</p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, including bridges, in Donegal and other counties are the statutory responsibility of the local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Department officials and the Minister, Deputy Ross, met with a delegation from Donegal County Council on 27 February 2017 to discuss Fintra Bridge and Tyrconnell Bridge in Donegal.</p><p>Fintra Bridge is located on the R263 between Killybegs and Kilcar.  It is understood from Donegal County Council that the issue with this bridge is alignment related.  It is structurally sound but is restrictive in width and is located on a bend.  Part 8 planning approval is in place for a new bridge and associated realignment of approaches and the cost of this is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.  Given the challenging financial climate, the specific improvement grants scheme, under which this scheme would previously have been considered, has been curtailed in recent years in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.</p><p>Tyrconnell Bridge is a four span steel bridge supported by cut stone piers spanning 29 m across the Eske River at Tyrconnell Street, Donegal town.  A number of structural reports were carried out on the bridge in 2000, 2008 and 2012.  A study in 2013 concluded that the bridge will continue to deteriorate and will result in the closure of the bridge in the coming years.  The council reported that a full-deck replacement is needed.  On 12 October 2016, Donegal County Council submitted its application to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the 2017 bridge rehabilitation programme.  Tyrconnell Bridge was not among the bridges prioritised for funding in the 2017 application.  No application in respect of this bridge was received by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for either 2016 or for 2015.  Following the meeting with the council, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is awaiting further information from Donegal County Council in respect of both Tyrconnell and Fintra Bridges.

This is an issue which I, along with many other groups, have campaigned for over a number of years and which was recommended by the Constitutional Convention in 2013.  Too often in Ireland referenda have become debates about subject matters that have no relationship whatsoever to what the people are being asked to vote on.  It is very important that from the outset those of us advocating this change on behalf of Irish citizens living overseas do so armed with the facts, and use the opportunity to not only hold a national conversation about what place Irish citizens living abroad should have in our society, but also what the functions of the office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann exactly are.</p> <p>The President is a symbolic figure, but symbolism matters even more so for those citizens of this State who are Irish, who love this country and who want a meaningful place in our society even if they do not live within the territorial land mass that is governed by this State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Billy Lawless:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Immigrant voting has emerged as a global democratic norm.  While immigrant voting is not there yet, Ireland is relatively progressive in allowing immigrants the right to vote in local elections.  I recognise that an advance of the proposal for a referendum the Government needs to first decide which category of overseas citizens should have an entitlement to vote.  Other nations with very high levels of overseas citizens let their emigrants vote.  Of the top five nations in the OECD, by emigrant percentage, Ireland is the only one to disenfranchise its emigrant citizens.  New Zealand, Mexico, Portugal and Luxembourg all allow their emigrants to vote.  India, the nation with the largest absolute numbers of emigrants and a global leader in diaspora engagement is also in the process of enabling its emigrants to vote.  I welcome the options paper published earlier this month by the Government.  We will make our formal submissions in due course but I want to make the point to the Minister of State that this is a once in a generation opportunity.  I hope the Government objective is to enfranchise the highest number of citizens abroad possible, not to create further divisions through arbitrary controls such as criteria on the number of years living abroad.  We have to be bigger in our ambitions and not simply replace old barriers with new, albeit less restrictive ones.</p><p>I have great faith that citizens living in this State want to extend the franchise to their children, cousins and friends living overseas and give them a meaningful role as well as delivering a clear mandate to our next President, or at the very least the one after that, that he or she represents all Irish citizens at home or abroad.  The President will be as much their ambassador as ours which is something I truly believe Irish people living here would like to share in the recognition of.  What a celebration of modern Irish identity that would be - a nation of emigrants with a President who leads all of us and is elected by all of us.  I can think of not better way to remind the world that Ireland is a global nation.  Ireland is not exiting its relationship with its European partners.  We are not shutting down our borders but we are extending them.  I thank the Minister of State and look forward to debating these matters further.</p></speech>

Is ceist t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute;.</p> <p>I thank Senator Lawless for his own individual campaigning and as a representative of many groups down the years which have campaigned on this issue.  No doubt the Senator is in constant communication and liaison with them and he will pass on my message and the Government's message about our commitment to this issue.  </p> <p>The announcement by the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia that a referendum will be held over whether Irish citizens resident outside of the State, including potential voters in Northern Ireland, should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections was a historic moment.  It recognises the importance that Ireland places on its relationship with all our citizens wherever they may be.  In times gone by, leaving Ireland meant a person severing their relationship with the State.  We now want to give Irish citizens where ever they may be a chance in choosing the person who represents Irish people at home and abroad.</p> <p>Many other countries give citizens resident outside the state a chance to vote in elections.  However, I acknowledge that in respect of our citizenship laws, Ireland has some unique features which make the policy considerations more complex here compared to other countries.  This is a timely development for Ireland given the ongoing and strong commitment of this Government and, indeed, successive Governments to deepening real engagement with our citizens who reside outside the State.  Ireland's diaspora policy, published in 2015, recognises the need to nurture and develop our unique and important relationship with our diaspora.  The issue of voting rights is of enormous importance to Irish citizens abroad who feel it is important that they have a say in electing the President who also represents them as Irish people living overseas.  We drew on the skills and support of our diaspora in recent times of economic crisis.  This initiative is a fitting recognition of the enormous contribution made by Irish people abroad historically and more recently to Ireland's recovery and development.  The Government's decision to hold this referendum is in line with the recommendation with the Convention on the Constitution in its fifth report.  Some 78% of its members were in favour of citizens outside the State having the right to vote in presidential elections.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, published an options paper which sets out how the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution might be realised.  That paper, prepared in conjunction with my Department, provides a detailed analysis of the legal, policy and practical implications of extending the franchise.  It shows the complexity of the issues but also that the various challenges which arise can be addressed with sufficient planning and resources.</p> <p>The options paper will inform public discourse on the proposal that will be put to the people at the referendum.  The upcoming Global Irish Civic Forum in May will further provide an opportunity to discuss the options paper with representatives of Irish communities abroad.  It is intended that this and wider public discussions will allow the Government to identify a preferred option to put to the people in a referendum.  As this House knows, I have had a strong and public personal commitment to extending voting rights to citizens abroad in Presidential elections.  I was pleased to be there with the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia when he made the announcement.  I have seen the vibrancy of the Irish community during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade and acknowledged the contribution of the Irish to the United States at the memorial to Commodore Barry and at Independence Hall.  I saw for myself the positive reaction from Irish emigrants and Irish Americans as the Taoiseach said there was "no more fitting time or no more fitting place."</p> <p>Article 2 of our Constitution requires us to cherish our special affinity with Irish people abroad.  I believe the Government&rsquo;s decision to hold a referendum on extending voting rights to Irish citizens abroad sends an important message to them on the value we place on them and their connection to Ireland.</p></speech>

I am disappointed we will not be able to hold a referendum before the next Presidential election.  When I mentioned this to our citizens abroad they were really delighted.  They were delighted also when I was appointed by the Taoiseach in that they felt they were being recognised at long last.  It is something of which all the parties are in favour, and of which the convention came out in favour.  However, we do not have a good record in referendums in this country.  I would impress on the Minister of State and the Taoiseach and all the Members of both Houses that when we have the referendum that everybody is fully behind it, and not half-heartedly.  It is a once-off opportunity and we are going to make it happen.  We owe it to our people abroad.</p> <p>Do not forget that even in the last five or six years, some 230,000 young people left Ireland.  There are about 500,000 parents of those people who want their sons and daughters to come back here.  I have brought this up with the Minister of State before and we have to make it easier for our citizens to return as this is their home and will always be.  We have to make it much easier, with things like drivers' licences, insurance and health care, that when they come back there is a welcome for them and that they feel like they are wanted back home.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment.  We have to make sure that we really go at this wholeheartedly.</p></speech>

There will be opportunities in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il prior to the referendum and proper, open and honest discourse, prior to the preferred option being chosen, will be important.  I know that Senator Lawless will be participating in the Civic Forum on 4 and 5 May.</p> <p>I want to make one point, which the Senator mentioned, about the symbolism of the office.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are talking about votes for the diaspora in Presidential elections specifically.  I have seen the role of the office evolving over the last 20 years.  Look at the mark left by Mary Robinson and the imprint Mary McAleese left in the relationships with Northern Ireland and elsewhere and among our welfare organisations internationally.  Within 48 hours of getting this job as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I was at a summit in Istanbul with President Higgins.  He was our President, but he was seen as an international voice; a voice of hope for a lot of people in humanitarian crises and development.  The international community looks to Ireland for leadership.  I have had a very positive insight into the symbolism of this role at both national and international levels and want to acknowledge the international role that President Higgins is playing.  When one sees African leaders giving the President of this country a standing ovation for his commitment, his words and his inspiration on the international stage, that is where Ireland is going and we should never forget that.</p></speech>

We are all concerned about the impact this will have on Ireland, especially the threat of a hard border.  Today it is easy to forget the problems our country faced before the Good Friday Agreement.  We take for granted free movement between North and South.  At only three Border crossing points, there are as many as 325,000 crossings per week.  In 2016 Ireland and the UK traded approximately &euro;39 billion in goods and services.  We are faced with a situation that could lead to job losses and have a massive impact on the economy at large.</p> <p>The Government has made some superficial moves to deal with Brexit, but mostly we have seen only rhetoric on the common travel area, preventing a hard border and protecting the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has yet to appoint a Minister with responsibility for Brexit as Fianna F&aacute;il has advocated.  The Government seems to have completely ignored the impact Brexit will have on key sectors of the economy in which we trade most with the UK, for example, agriculture, food, engineering and manufacturing.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland the undisputed facts include we have had two Assembly elections in the past year, we have had parties refusing to serve in the Executive, and we have had Sinn F&eacute;in withdrawing from the Executive because of a refusal to establish an inquiry into cash for ash, which has actually been established.  Now, we have a standstill in the formation of the Assembly at the hour Prime Minister May is triggering Article 50, and at such an hour we need to be united.  We learned this morning a civil servant, David Sterling, has taken control of the Stormont Government budget in the absence of the establishment of an Executive.  All departments in the North, from health to education, may be affected by this action, as a civil servant's budget is a reduced budget.  This inaction by the leading parties in Northern Ireland is inexcusable.  We need to acknowledge the period of peace over the past two decades.  We need to work together to commit to continued peace in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, we need to see a united approach to reducing the impact the triggering of a hard Brexit will have on our country and our island.</p> <p>Today is the sixth day of the bus strike and 2,600 employees have been on strike.  The Minister has gone to ground.  He will attend a committee hearing today to give us an update.  I understand he will not interfere in the bus strike and he will give some sort of acknowledgement there will be a review into transport services.  This is not enough.  We need to see action today.  Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann employees will support their colleagues at lunch time, which I support.  The Minister needs to take some action.  He cannot sit on the fence on every issue.  He needs to meet union members and sort out this crisis.  Traffic in the city is beginning to be massively affected and workers throughout the country are being discommoded because of his inaction.</p></speech>

Since the foundation of the State going back to the Geary case in Ennis in the 1920s, and a Fianna F&aacute;il Government in the early noughties compensated Mr. Geary for how he was hounded out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is to be admired for it-----</p></speech>

In senior Garda management today there is somebody who knows what is going on and is afraid to speak.  I put out a call today and I hope the Leader will support me.  Whoever that person is, let the entire force not be tarred with a rotten brush.  Somebody knows what is going on and is afraid to speak.  It is just possible the Commissioner is under pressure from her management group and that she is not able to speak out.  If somebody there has something to say I am sure any Member of the House would be willing to meet him or her and assist with a protected disclosure.  We cannot allow this to go on indefinitely.  Hounding N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan out of office will not solve the problem at the end of the day.  There is something rotten and the ordinary garda&iacute; on the street need support at this point in time.

SIPTU and NBRU members will be outside the building today.  I hope that we can all go out and engage with them.  I would like to hear a clear call, particularly from the Fine Gael side, for the Minister to do more than just sit on his hands.  It is Fine Gael's Government.  As I stated yesterday, each day that it leaves these people out on strike is its responsibility.  It needs to stand up and be counted.  People know what needs to be done.  SIPTU has spelled out a means of resolving this dispute by establishing an employment regulation order, ERO, but I have not heard anyone in Fine Gael engaging on that point.  I invite them to engage and to do something constructive about the dispute.</p> <p>I wish to discuss community workers, who provide crucial support to many within our society - older people, people with disabilities, young people and vulnerable families.  Work is focused on areas such as providing child care, combating poverty, supporting those with mental health issues, human rights advocacy and family support.  The workers providing these vital services have endured years of cuts from the Fine Gael-Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  That continues to this day.</p> <p>Matters have taken a dark turn.  A SIPTU delegation explained to us last week that, although a high-level forum had been established for the community sector, the civil servants are not engaging with the union and, worse, the Department of Social Welfare in particular is refusing to attend the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I must be clear on this - that is unacceptable.  As a matter of urgency, will the Leader find out why his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is refusing to attend the WRC?  If a Minister refuses to attend the industrial relations machinery of the State, what message does that send to rogue employers?</p></speech>

I asked how many similar cases there were and whether there were other cases in which the HSE, Tusla or the Garda had been made aware of sexual or physical abuse allegations against a foster parent but the child had not been removed from the home.  It is important that we know that no other children are living in homes against which abuse allegations have been made.</p><p>Today, I read in the <i>The Journal</i>that a woman was left in the care of a foster family for two years after allegations of sexual abuse were made against the foster father.  An intellectually disabled woman known as Mary was left with the family even though allegations were made in 2014.  Despite a decision being taken in September 2014 to remove Mary from the home, the order was not executed until February 2016.  However, because Mary was 18 years of age and deemed to be an adult, she was no longer in statutory care or under Tusla's remit.  How could this be allowed to happen?  How many other cases are there of children or vulnerable people who are still in foster care despite allegations of abuse being known to the authorities?  Are the cases of Grace and Mary just the tip of the iceberg?  We need to get assurances from the Minister to the effect that children in foster care are not in danger of being abused, that where allegations of abuse are known to one agency, this information is made known to other agencies with responsibility for the issue, and that action is taken immediately.</p></speech>

She will address the House of Commons on the issue within the next hour.  The Seanad's Brexit hearings are a welcome initiative, but we also need to consider raising the issue of Brexit in other debates in the House.  Yesterday, we in Labour published our detailed Brexit policy, outlining 20 concrete actions that the Irish Government should be taking.  We expressed our concern at the lack of detail from the Government regarding what it proposed to do as the Brexit negotiations got under way.  What positions will it take?</p><p>The Government needs to ensure that adequate money - &euro;1 billion from the rainy day fund - should be deployed for the capital investment likely to be needed as a result of Brexit.  A &euro;250 million Brexit trade adjustment fund should be set up to support directly Irish businesses that suffer because of trade upheaval with the UK.  New transport connections will be needed, in particular at major ports and airports.  Others have pointed to the instability in Northern Ireland.  The prospect of Brexit negotiations is not helping that situation.  A special status for Northern Ireland needs to be incorporated in the negotiations.  At a minimum, a new Irish protocol to the EU treaties recognising the common travel area, the Good Friday Agreement and the unique situation of the Irish Border must be negotiated.</p><p>There have been disturbing signals about what might happen because of Brexit.  In an article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i>, Ms Patricia King points out the downward pressure likely to be applied as a result of the UK no longer having to observe minimum terms and conditions of employment as set down in EU treaties.  The concern is that there will be a race to the bottom among Irish businesses.  Pressure will be placed on Ireland and other EU countries to reduce the quality of workers' terms and conditions.</p><p>On behalf of Labour, I express solidarity with the Bus &Eacute;ireann strikers, who will be protesting outside Leinster House today.  We have called for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to take a stand on this matter.  He has been absent, as others have stated.  He needs to be engaged on this and convene a stakeholders forum.  The Government must commit to increasing subvention for public transport to EU levels.  A sectoral employment order must be introduced for all transport workers in order to ensure the protection of their terms and conditions.  Given that this issue is crucial, will the Leader arrange for the Minister to attend the House to discuss it?</p><p>Like others, I am worried about the new executive order from US President Trump - not on immigration this time - reversing environmental protections, many of them put in place by former President Barack Obama, and thereby causing immense concern among environmental groups, NGOs and the UN that there will be a serious encroachment on international measures to prevent climate change.  It is a retrograde step by the US Government and we may need to debate it in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

There is a need to recruit 850 people to the Army.  There is a colourful exhibition and attendees get to hold the various machine guns and equipment that the Army uses.

Charges represent a major cost for many cancer patients at a time when they are going through physical and psychological stress, not to mention financial pressure.  The Irish Cancer Society is to be commended for its work on highlighting this matter through a campaign that encourages the HSE to have a national policy on the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The society called for free parking or subsidised parking.  Unfortunately, the campaign has fallen on deaf ears to date.  I appeal to the Leader to urge the Minister for Health to implement a national policy so that cancer patients undergoing hospital treatment can park free of charge or avail of subsidised parking.  Some cancer patients have spent up to &euro;16 per day just on parking charges, which is unfair on them while they are under the pressures that I have outlined.  I appeal to the Minister to instruct the HSE to adopt a national policy to tackle this issue.</p></speech>

The funding is welcome.  As much as &euro;226 million will be spent on the critical roll-out provision of essential infrastructure for the development of new homes.</p> <p>The scheme will cover 34 sites and 15 councils.  I would like to ask the Minister why the scheme will only be rolled out to 15 councils.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to come in here to answer my question.  There are 31 local authorities yet funding has only been allocated to 15 of them.  I am open to correction but I think 22 councils applied for the funding.  </p> <p>Both Galway city or county local authorities applied for critical infrastructure funding for social housing, private housing and affordable housing.  I am disappointed, following yesterday's announcement, to learn that neither authority received funding.  The scheme will cover 34 sites around the country and will produce 70,000 new homes.  There is a 10% gain for social and affordable housing, which is a plus.  The scheme will lead to a win-win situation.  I want to acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Government.  I thank them for funding this scheme, which forms part of the Rebuilding Ireland initiative.  </p> <p>I suggest to the Leader that it would be appropriate for us to invite the Minister to the Chamber to explain the rationale behind the scheme and to keep us up to speed on what is, perhaps, one of the single biggest problems facing everyone at the moment.  I am referring to access to a home be it social housing, affordable housing and to purchase a house at a reasonable and fair price.  I acknowledge yesterday's good news story.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to this Chamber in the next few weeks to tease out how the scheme will be rolled out.</p></speech>

I ask that the Leader communicates with the Minister for Social Protection and his officials and ensures that every effort is made to get the website, <i>welfare.ie</i>, up and running.  People have had to resort to using the Citizens Information's excellent website called <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>for all of their queries.</p><p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the activation fund.  Two worthwhile projects in Limerick will receive &euro;15 million.  Housing is a huge issue but Greenpark racecourse and Mungret College in Limerick will receive funding to build distributor roads to ensure lands can be developed for housing.  Affordable starter homes must be a key element.  If the State is stepping in to assist by providing the infrastructure to enable houses to be built then it must ensure that the people contracted to build these houses provide affordable starter homes.</p></speech>

Many of us have not looked forward to this event.  We have anticipated and waited for it because we want to hear about the proactive response this Government will make to the move made by the British Government.</p> <p>I do not need to tell anyone that Brexit presents a very dangerous situation for Ireland, both North and South.  Brexit actively undermines and usurps the integrity and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which was overwhelmingly voted for by the electorate in this State and, indeed, in the North.  Last February, a D&aacute;il motion was passed that called on the Irish Government to make a case for special designated status.  That is the most responsible and logical position, alongside other necessary positions, that the Irish Government can adopt not just to protect the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and the democratic expression in this State but also for the economic, social and cultural well-being of this island. </p> <p>The Leader will know that the Tories have no mandate in Ireland either for Brexit or other policies of theirs.  The Taoiseach has received the clearly expressed mandate from the people in the North, and on this island, that we want to remain in the EU.  In the immediacy of the period that we are now in, which is against our will, it is critical that we hear from the Taoiseach.  I appreciate his earlier stance but we no longer wish to hear aspirational intentions and what the Government hopes to achieve.  We must now hear the practical steps the Government will take to negotiate the best deal.  The best way for the Taoiseach to do so, and I offer him my sincere suggestion, is for him to work with all of the parties.  We are all unified in seeking to have Ireland's national interests defended.  Therefore, we all want the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement to remain sacrosanct.  We do not want a return to a hard border and we want Ireland's interests defended.  We need to hear about these matters from the Taoiseach as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Leanann an obair go st&oacute;ch&uacute;il agus D&eacute; Domhnaigh seo caite tugadh isteach corp Captain Mark Duffy.</p><p>The dignity with which Captain Mark Duffy, from Rescue 116, was borne ashore on Sunday last is something that will stay with me forever.  He gave his life so that others might live.  Along with his colleagues, he was a hero and somebody to hold up as a role model to our children.  Heroes do not arrive out of nowhere.  They are the embodiment of their family and often their communities.  Captain Mark Duffy will be laid to rest tomorrow in his home village of Blackrock in County Louth.  It is striking that his funeral notice reads: &quot;Mark's wish would be for you to carry an organ donor card.&quot;  It is very fitting that this notice by the Duffy family comes just at the start of Organ Donor Awareness Week that has been organised by the Irish Kidney Association.  Many people here in the Seanad have done great work to promote the importance of organ donation, including my colleague, Senator Mark Daly.  Approximately 700 people in Ireland await life-saving heart, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas transplants.  Thanks to the gift of organ donation over 3,000 people in Ireland enjoy an extended life.  Just like the thousands rescued by the Irish Coast Guard, they too have been rescued and given a new lease of life.  </p><p>While the focus of Organ Donor Awareness Week is to raise awareness, I was heartened to hear what the Minister for Health said yesterday.  He said:</p><blockquote>[He has prioritised] the development of legislation to provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation.  My Department is currently working on this in the context of the work required to develop an overarching human tissue policy and legislative framework.</blockquote> <p>He also said that he intends to bring a memorandum to Government shortly on this matter.  I urge the Leader and his Government colleagues to keep the pressure on so that this can happen as it will save lives.</p></speech>

That fact does not surprise me.  The first time it happened was in the D&aacute;il in the 1920s when Austin Stack and others made unjust remarks about District Inspector Kearney who was due to be made the Commissioner of the newly-formed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why I am interested in disrespect of Kearney is that he was the man who arrested Roger Casement.  He was the man who left the door open for Austin Stack, and many others, to release Roger Casement.  It was at their ineptitude that they made these scurrilous remarks.  District Inspector Kearney moved to Boyle and saved my grandfather's life from a Black and Tan assassination squad.  Those allegations were made and he and his family had to high-tail it to London because of the remarks made in this Oireachtas by Austin Stack and many others.  </p><p>I have now seen the way Alan Shatter was treated.  I have seen many Garda Commissioners.  My grandfather was one of the first garda in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stood for this State and defended it and I will have no truck, as a politician, with other politicians using parliamentary privilege to make comments about the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If it is true, make the comment.  There is a frenzy out there.  We need to reflect that, sometimes, if we make remarks in the Chamber, we do a disservice to men and women, and to the Garda reputation.  Perhaps we should draw the line at the men who held the line in setting up, and saving, the State.  If it is true, then say it, but Alan Shatter did not get many apologies from the press or from Members of the Oireachtas.  I think we should be strong enough and mature enough, if we make a mistake, to say that we made a mistake on the record of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.</p></speech>

I would like to put on the record that since last week it has reversed that decision and realised that it was a negative move.  I would like to congratulate it for reversing that so quickly.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the issue of discalculia, which is the maths form of dyslexia and which can be really debilitating for anybody who suffers from it.  I have personal understanding of the suffering that is involved in trying to access third level education.  Currently Trinity College Dublin is, I believe, the only college offering a maths waiver.  The problem is, if a person accepts this maths waiver, they drop maths from the leaving certificate.  That is a positive for someone that has this disability, but the problem is that if a person drops maths from the leaving certificate the other institutes of higher education, HEIs, do not operate the same waiver system, so if that person has applied to other universities on the CAO and they drop maths, they will not get into any other university and their only option is Trinity.  That is something we need to look at.  </p> <p>We have moved really far in the area of dyslexia but we have not moved very far in recognising the disability of discalculia.  This is something that we need to discuss with the Minister.  He has outlined many areas on which he wants to work in respect of numeracy but unless we address disability attached to numeracy, we cannot address numeracy as a whole.</p></speech>

The first issue is that of Jadotville.  As the Leader knows, a motion, signed by the majority of Senators, is ready to be submitted that deals with the injustice that the Jadotville veterans and their families have faced for all these years.  It calls for a medal ceremony in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;n to recognise the scale of the injustice that they have suffered.  I know he has raised it already, but I ask the Leader to raise it with the Minister and his Department officials again.  I want to avoid submitting a motion and dividing this House, though I will if necessary.  It is important that we unite together and address this issue in a dignified manner.  I ask the Leader again to raise this.  If necessary myself and Senator Craughwell, who co-sponsored the motion at the outset, would be happy to meet with the Leader and the Minister to try to resolve this issue.</p> <p>The second issue has been raised with me by members of the fire services and was news to me.  I knew that members of the Defence Forces were presented with 1916 commemorative medals last year to mark the centenary.  I am led to believe that all members of the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Ambulance Service were presented with commemorative medals last year.  The only front-line emergency service that were not is, apparently, the fire services.  Clearly this would be a very serious omission.  The firemen who have raised this with me are understandably aggrieved as to what has happened.  I assume it is because of the structure of the fire services under the management of local authorities but I ask the Leader to raise that with the relevant Minister, who I assume is the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to address this anomaly and to ask her to, even now, belatedly ensure that they are presented with a medal to mark that commemorative year.  It would be important.</p></speech>

In my view, what has emerged is disgraceful.  A systematic pattern of cover-up, procrastination, deception and facade-keeping has characterised the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>The issues with the fixed charge penalty point system have been known for a considerable period of time.  The people who knew about it did nothing about it until it came into the public domain.  To say that they instituted an audit within the force to examine it is wholly unacceptable.  When it is found out that there is a problem, the Minister is told.  There is a really big problem here.  It looks to be in the region of 10,000 to 15,000 miscarriages of justice.  We are on the ball now.  We are going to do something about it.</p> <p>This same applies to the mandatory alcohol tests.  The problem was known about.  Even Gay Byrne signalled the alarm on the basis of a former Garda reservist who had resigned in disgust on the basis of a letter sent to him two years ago.  Nothing was done about it thought there were signals everywhere.  </p> <p>The third point I want to make is that we do not need a Patten Commission or a root and branch reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based on some lengthy process.  We need action now.  We need the Minister with responsibility, that is the T&aacute;naiste, to institute the changes that are necessary in a matter of weeks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be led by somebody who the force has faith and confidence in and who the public has faith and confidence in.  That situation does not exist now.</p> <p>There is an idea that we can kick the can down the road and that we can have another major inquiry, which might take two years.  How long did the Patten Commission take for that matter?  We cannot wait.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be reformed now.  There is one person who has ministerial responsibility under the Ministers and Secretaries Act to ensure that reform starts now and that is the T&aacute;naiste.  She must put in place a leader of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who commands public respect now.  Not later, now.</p></speech>

The &euro;200 million that has been announced will, it is hoped, open up 32 sites for housing, which will be very important for the housing strategy.  There is a local dimension to that.  There are moneys for roads in Cork, but they are very positive and it is a very positive project.  There were independent audits regarding which projects got the go-ahead.  The independent factor is very important and should be duly noted.</p> <p>One of the key issues I would like to raise here is in regard to Garda vetting and where we are going with that programme.  I note from the newspapers that there are 721 teachers who have still not been vetted and that there is work ongoing towards a resolution of that process at the moment.  The entire way we carry out Garda vetting has to be looked at.  A person could be vetted four or five times regarding different institutions or organisations they are involved in.  That is inappropriate.  There should be one vetting and then a person should be on the list.  That should be the routine.  </p> <p>I came across an issue in the last few weeks where an under-21 team in a GAA club had minors, that is 17 year-olds, on a team.  Given that they were under 18 years of age, they were informed that the rest of the team would have to be vetted because they are in the same dressing room.  There has to be logic in this.  Someone has to say that Garda vetting is important, but that it makes no sense that there is a need to vet all the 21 year-olds because there is a 17 year-old in a dressing room.  Work needs to be done here.  A complete reform of the system is required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That needs to happen in order that something can be done speedily about this issue.</p></speech>

Members of the various unions involved in this strike will protest outside the House later while the Minister addresses the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He should not only address the committee; he should address the unions and the company.  While acknowledging that the company is loss making in its present guise and that the workers have a right to strike to protect the rights they have earned over many decades, more than 100,000 people, mainly in rural Ireland, depend on bus services, which are a vital part of the infrastructure of rural Ireland, and they are the real victims of this strike.  This is day six.  How many more days are workers going to have to endure the picket line?  How many days will ordinary commuters, who depend on the bus company to get to and from various locations throughout this island, have to wait because eventually this will have to be sorted?  There are those who say the bus company is waiting until it is such a dire financial position that it has to go into examinership.  If that is the motivation behind what the management are at, that is disgraceful and a stop needs to put to that immediately.  I call on the Leader to use his good offices to impress on the Minister, who has an opinion on every Department except his own, to intervene in this dispute before it gets too desperate for the workers, the company and the more than 100,000 people who depend on bus services to go about their daily business.</p> <p>Yesterday, Senator McDowell raised the issue of judicial appointments.  The former Minister has a great opinion on this.  I endorse everything he said in that regard.  The Judiciary has served us well since the foundation of the State.  It is a function of whichever Government is in power to appoint judges and there is a system in place to vet those who apply to become judges before the nominations are put before the Minister and the Cabinet for appointment.  While the process should be left as it is, I would like the Leader to impress on the Minister for Justice and Equality the important point made by the director general of the Law Society.  He said that since it became possible for solicitors, who comprise 80% of the practising legal profession, to become judges of the superior courts, less than 8% of appointments have gone to them.  That needs to be addressed.  Senator McDowell used the word "excellence".  There is excellence among that 80% and they should be given credit for that.</p></speech>

The Cabinet discussed the Mary case yesterday and the horrific abuses wrought on young women.</p> <p>The latest revelations regarding Garda misuse of funds and tax avoidance seem like they are part of tsunami of allegations, abuses and criminal activity all rolled into one and it has been going for a long time.  When Martin Callinan was dismissed a number of years ago, we all thought an external appointment was needed in order that there would be someone with a new broom and an independent eye to oversee the running of the keepers of the peace in our society.  That did not happen but there have been more revelations about phantom breath tests, phantom checkpoints and tax avoidance.  N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan needs to step down and Sinn F&eacute;in has asked for that.  She needs to take responsibility for the good of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allow an external investigation and an external appointment to the Commissioner position.  The force is in need of a root and branch overhaul and cultural reform.  These scandals are bigger than individuals and the reform must happen now.  I have spoken to garda&iacute; on the beat in my locality of Rialto and Kilmainham and they are absolutely despondent.  They are embarrassed and the embarrassments are piling up.  They are more disrespected and more prone to ridicule and many of them do not want to turn up for work.  We have always prided ourselves in this country on our honest and integrity but we are no longer the island of saints and scholars.  There are far too many somethings rotten in this State and we need a clean sweep with integrity at the heart of what we do.</p></speech>

The upgrade is vital because a ranking hockey match has not been played in the national hockey stadium since 2015.  I call on the Leader to raise this with the Ministers for Education and Skills and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Ireland has had huge success in this realm in recent years with the men's team qualifying for the Rio Olympics.  The fact that our national hockey stadium is no longer certified to host international hockey matches is an absolute disgrace and this stand-off has to be resolved as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The GAA does so much good in the country and it is part of the social fabric that makes Ireland unique.  I am surprised by a diktat issued by GAA headquarters in recent weeks.  They wrote to county boards and asked them to reduce the minute's silence to 20 seconds silence.  It is one of the most bizarre requests I have heard of in quite a while.  The GAA is very much a roots up operation as opposed to a branch down operation and I was disappointed to hear about this coming from headquarters.  I was delighted that when this proposal came before the delegates of the Westmeath County Board, there were strong voices in opposition.  Billy Foley and others told those in the higher echelons that Westmeath would not carry out this diktat.  A minute's silence does not happen too often.  Those who have played for the county or have been heavily associated with the county set up are acknowledged with a minute's silence before a game if they died recently.  It is the very least we could do for people who have borne colours for the GAA, filled cars with kids, marked pitches and travelled the length and breadth of the country to facilitate games for nothing.  It is a poor day if we cannot even given them one minute to say, "Farewell".</p></speech>

During the Celtic tiger era, the majority of these parks were set up for manufacturing industries or offices and not for retail outlets.  They have had a huge effect on town centres.  A legal challenge has been taken in my county relating to why retail units were allowed into the business parks.

There has been debate about the lack of trust but one issue that has not been highlighted is that there will now be a difficulty accepting the evidence of garda&iacute; in courts.  It is important to resolve the Garda's current difficulties at a very early stage, in particular, where judges accepted the evidence of garda&iacute; that the fixed charge notice had been served and there is now clear evidence that it had not been.  A number of legal colleagues were on to me over the weekend about cases in which people went into the witness box and gave evidence under oath that they had not received the fixed charge notice.  The doubt was created but they had to go through all of that and it is an issue we need to address.  We need to build that trust not only in the Garda, but in the garda&iacute; presenting their evidence in court.</p> <p>I join my colleague, Senator Lombard, in thanking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the announcement yesterday that a major infrastructural development will take place to assist the building of new houses.  In my area of Cork North-Central, over &euro;30 million has been allocated which will enable more than 1,600 houses to be built.  It is a welcome development which could yield over 3,600 houses in the long term.  It is important that the infrastructure is put in place to fast track all the requirements for housing and that there are no further delays outside the planning issue.  Once planning permission was granted, there was always a delay in trying to put in the infrastructure.  It is important it is now done.  I welcome the announcement that was made in the past number of days.  It is important that all local authorities around the country identify projects that can assist the building of new houses.  It is the biggest expense people have in their lives and, therefore, the State must do everything possible to make it affordable for people.  The important part about the development is to make sure we have all the necessary infrastructure such as roads, water and sewage systems.  I welcome the development and the need for it to be fast tracked.</p></speech>

No conversation about tobacco is complete without mentioning the 700,000 people who die unnecessarily across Europe every year because of this product - 6,000 of those people are in this country.  It causes misery for tens of thousands of others who suffer with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers and various other ailments that would be utterly avoidable if they did not smoke.  Plain packaging is a major initiative and one that is very important.  It does one of the most important things we can do, which is protecting children from ever taking up smoking.  Children are not stupid.  The Irish Cancer Society did a little survey where they showed children the current cigarette packets which they thought were nice and lovely to play with and they wanted them.  They were then shown the plain packs and they recoiled in horror.  Who would ever want to smoke?  This measure will save tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of lives in the future.  It will save the State a huge amount of money, some &euro;10 billion annually, that we spend on health and as a result of lost productivity.  This is a great day for children and for all smokers because these packs will remind them of the damage they are doing to themselves.  The House will agree we are all trying to support smokers to stop smoking.  We are not anti-smoker, rather we are anti-smoking.</p></speech>

Members may recall that I raised certain questions last week about wages and conditions in this House.  As a trade unionist, it is perfectly legitimate to do so.  I will add one final thing to show how utterly ludicrous the notion of making us fob in is - a majority of Fine Gael Members in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann do not fob in.  They are Ministers so they do not have to do so.  A majority of the Government party is not fobbing in.

Senator Gavan is saying we should get rid of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is the Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to get rid of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is fair enough.  I posed the question to the Members opposite.  Let me make it quite clear that the Taoiseach, as the head of the Government, is leading a whole-of-Government approach to Brexit.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that we must be united as a country, North and South, in our approach to Brexit.  It is one of the most important decisions that will face our country for a generation.  Its impact is profound.  I reassure Senator Ardagh and others that the Government is under no illusions about the task ahead.  I agree with Senator Bacik that perhaps the Seanad, notwithstanding the good work that has been started by the Seanad Brexit committee, should have a debate in the House.  I would be happy to have it but it is important to dovetail with the Seanad Brexit committee.  I am happy to have that debate here.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be here tomorrow for statements on the North.  The Government is committed to protecting and advancing Ireland's cause across Europe.  Nobody wants the return of a hard Border.  As the Taoiseach says, nobody wants to see the creation of a new border in the future.  The Government will defend the Good Friday Agreement as we have always done.  We are working with Mr. Juncker and Mr. Tusk and if one reads their recent comments, one cannot but be heartened by the importance Ireland has been given in their remarks.  The position paper will be published by Government before 29 April.  We will have a very strong case across Europe but it requires the support of all parties.  I commend the Labour Party on its position paper.  Deputy Donnelly is Fianna F&aacute;il's newly created spokesman on Brexit.  I am sure we will all work together to ensure Ireland has a united voice.  We should all wear the green jersey.  We should not put naked political partisanship up the pole but should all stand to fight for Ireland.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Gavan, Bacik and Wilson raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I reiterate the remarks I made yesterday.  Nobody is winning in this dispute.  Nobody wants to see an all-out ballot of any union - in this case the bus workers - or of Dublin Bus or Irish Rail.  It is in no one's interest.  As Members have said, it is not in the interest of the workers, the company or the travelling public.  There is an absolute certainty here.

Funding was increased in the past two budgets and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is examining the provision of funding for the free travel scheme.  From my reading of it, the core of the issue is efficiency.  Such issues are best resolved at the WRC.  Everybody wants the dispute to be resolved.  I agree with Senator Diarmuid Wilson in that I do not want management in Bus &Eacute;ireann to keep the dispute going to the point where a solution cannot be found.  I appeal to it to be the first, if necessary, to accept the need for talks and re-engage.  The pillorying of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, will not solve the problem.  He might be a very handy-----</p></speech>

Craughwell, Frank Feighan, Michael McDowell, M&aacute;ire Devine and Colm Burke referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is committed to resolving the matter and an independent review is to be carried out.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it is about governance and that the issue must be rectified immediately.  It amuses me when I hear Members of both Houses, in particular, Fianna F&aacute;il Members who were in government for 14 years in a row and appointed many of those in management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, look for a head to roll.  The removal of the Garda Commissioner in itself would not lead to the cultural change and reform needed.  Let us not race to the bottom in politics to get someone sacked.  The substantive issue is the way in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is operated and how it is viewed by the public.  The challenge presented by the change of culture and regime requires serious political consideration and debate.  We all need action in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is awful and nauseating in waking up every morning and listening to "Morning Ireland", or whatever programme one listens to, to hear a new story emerge about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which does nothing for the morale of rank and file garda&iacute; who are doing the very best they can.  As the party that founded An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has always held it in respect and that stood up for law and order when others did not, we will stand by it and see a new force emerge.  We need a Patten-type report.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it should not take two years, but we need to see reform which must happen now.  I am very committed, as are the Minister for Justice and Equality and members of my party, to standing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and bringing about regime change.  There is a need for a regularisation of affairs with the Revenue Commissioners and significant reform.  It was the Fine Gael Party in government with the Labour Party that changed the appointment method for Garda Commissioners and promotions to other senior positions.  Let us be clear: it was not the parties opposite but my party that changed the regime.  What we must also do is restore public trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which, regrettably, are at an all-time low.  I am a member of a number of policing fora in Cork city and county and pose the question to myself every time I attend a meeting as to whether the statistics read out are correct.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must re-establish the trust and confidence of the public, an gn&aacute;th dhuine.  There is a need for a forensic review of operations to put in place a new An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We should all look at the Garda Inspectorate's report, Changing Policing in Ireland, which contains some very good information and which will result in action.</p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan referred to community workers and the Minister involved attending the WRC.  I am not aware of the matter.  If the Senator wishes to send me an e-mail, I will be happy to take up the issue with the Minister.</p> <p>Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Frances Black raised the cases of Grace and Mary.  Senator M&aacute;ire Devine also touched on the issue.  It is important that there be accountability and transparency in the protocols between Tusla and the HSE for persons in care and those involved in fostering because it is a specialised area in which so much joy, relief and comfort are brought to people.  However, there is an issue that must be addressed and I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss it.</p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik referred to President Trump's new executive order.  It is absolutely baffling to have a President reverse the environment policies of President Obama because, as the Senator rightly said, the issues of global warming and climate change are very important.</p></speech>

We were due to have a debate on them in the House prior to St. Patrick's Day.  I hope we will have it soon.</p> <p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the issue of car parking charges for cancer patients.  I know that there is a protocol in some hospitals whereby cancer patients and their families are given a derogation.  I hope it can be applied universally across the country.  I will be happy to talk to the Senator about the matter.</p> <p>Senators Victor Boyhan, Colm Burke and Tim Lombard mentioned the very good news yesterday about funding for and investment in local authority housing.  I cannot indicate why councils in Galway and one other county, the name of which I cannot remember, have not yet received funding.  A total of 34 sites have been unlocked, while 15 councils have been allocated funding to the tune of &euro;226 million to be invested in infrastructure.  It is a good news story.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill indicated that the website of the Department of Social Protection was down.  I will be happy to ask the Minister to address the matter.</p> <p>Senator Keith Swanick raised the issue that was raised yesterday by Senator M&aacute;ire Devine about organ donation.  I join him in hoping the very fine report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will be implemented and that we will have a soft opt-out system.  I will not get into a debate with him on the role of certain people in helping the cause of organ donation, but what we must do is ensure that we collectively change the policy in order that more people will assist in organ donation.</p> <p>I congratulate Senators Lynn Ruane and John Dolan on the reversal of the decision on DIT access students.  The issue of discalculia and the waiver for maths is important.  In the short term perhaps Senator Lynn Ruane might table a Commencement matter to which the Minister for Education and Skills would come to the House to respond.  I accept that it is an issue that must be addressed.</p> <p>As Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn is aware, I am endeavouring to broker an agreed motion on those who were involved at Jadotville.  I agree with him that it is a motion that requires the support of all of us to give the members of the Defence Forces who were involved justice at some level.  I know that what is being sought is not much in terms of change and the Senator and I are on common ground in that regard.  I am trying to make progress on the issue.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he is very amenable but work remains to be done.  I am happy to work with the Senator on the issue.  As regards front-line service personnel, I am surprised by what the Senator said that fire brigade personnel do not receive commemorative medals, given that other first-line responders do.  Perhaps we might raise the issue as part of our discussion with the Minister of State.  The current arrangement does not make sense to me.</p> <p>Senator Tim Lombard raised the issue of Garda vetting.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was in the House last week to respond to a Commencement matter on the issue.  It is important that we address it.  It is an area in which improvements have been seen, but we must ensure transparency and uniformity of approach.</p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson also raised the issue of judicial appointments.  I reiterate what I said yesterday, that we all recognise the importance of having an independent judiciary.  We accept the excellence of the Judiciary in the work it does and the role it plays.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the issue in the context of the judicial appointments Bill.</p> <p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine referred to children in care.  She raised the issue of access to HSE disability services in the context of the memo to the Government yesterday.  We all accept that it is an important step.  We are aware of what was said in the debate yesterday on the health Bill about free GP care.  We have some distance to travel in the provision of disability services and I hope the Government will be able to put together a package in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Neale Richmond referred to the stand-off between the Irish Hockey Association and Belfield.  I have seen the new national hockey stadium at Belfield.  It beggars belief the last game played there was in 2015, given the investment made in what is a fine stadium.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a world cup there in 2014.</p></speech>

I was in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Rinn last Sunday at the Cork-Tipperary game and to the best of my knowledge, a minute's silence for the late Michael Maher and Tony O'Mahony, two fine former officers of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael at Munster and Cork levels, was held.  I agree, however, as a member of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael on the question of the minute's silence being reduced.  It is important we acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of volunteers and players.  Senator Feighan said the FAI had a round of applause, which is a nice way of acknowledging the role of deceased persons.</p></speech>

He raises a very good point because many businesses have moved to the periphery of our major towns.  Retailers in the towns are competing with these business parks as well as with online shopping, and parking is also an issue.  There is a need for a common-sense approach to planning and I encourage him to set up a cross-party delegation with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of plain packaging.  I commend the respective Ministers, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and Harris, on signing the Bill, which was passed in the previous Oireachtas, into law today.  It was commenced under the leadership of Senator Reilly as Minister for Health and he deserves credit and our congratulations for the role he played in standing up to big tobacco and for taking to fight across Europe.</p></speech>

In city and county councils members attend 80% of the time and that may be the way to proceed, though how we would work it out is  a different matter.

Unless Senators or the Minister have any additional contributions to make on these amendments, I will put the question on amendment No. 1h.  On the last day there were Second Stage speeches and a total rehash of the same thing.  We are not making any progress on any side and I am trying to be sensible.

People who live on canals and local authorities which administer them should be made aware of any canal closures.  This amendment will ensure that happens.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1m is also crucial as it sets sensible limits on the rate of increase of the costs of permits and licences.  It will ensure that all cost increases must be appropriate to the intended use and linked to the rate of inflation in the economy.  The incremental increases in costs are also vital to ensure that houseboat owners are not put into precarious positions regarding the cost of maintaining their homes. </p> <p>Amendment No. a1w is also crucial, as it speaks to the issue of fixed payment notices that we will debate more fully as we progress through the Bill.  I do not think it is appropriate that Waterways Ireland should be able to issue fixed payment notices without any formal appeals process and this amendment will delete the ability of Waterways Ireland to do this.  It works in conjunction with the more extensive amendments we have tabled relating to fixed payments notices, which will be taken later.</p></speech>

Something we have hardly mentioned is the question of moths and butterflies.  There has been no screening or report to the House on the impact of this proposed legislation on them.  I would welcome a screening, but there is not much point in having a screening unless it is published and made available to those with concern about this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some 27 out of the 35 butterfly species breed on hedgerows and hedge banks.  Of the common hedgerow plants, a total of 115 moth species breed on willow, 62 moss species breed on common hawthorn, which is also known as the whitethorn plant, 49 moth species breed on common blackthorn and 46 moth species breed on common hazel.  It is important that we take into account the impact on these often neglected species of insects.</p><p>Roadside hedges, in particular, for example, because of the traffic that is passing and the fumes of the cars, are often warmer than internal hedges and that means they provide better quality breeding grounds than internal hedges for butterfly and moth larva which need warmth to develop.  Roadside hedges are beyond the range of chemicals used in agriculture, also making them more suitable.</p><p>Upland areas often hold populations of more specialised rarer butterflies, such as the legally protected marsh fritillary butterfly.  The sociable caterpillars of this butterfly emerge from hibernation in late February-early March feeding on grassland containing its food plant.  Burning destroys this species by burning the larva.</p><p>These are the kind of issues that need to be considered in any screening and assessment and it is important that not only are these screenings carried out, but that they should be published.  For that reason, I am happy to strongly support the amendment in the name of Senator Kevin Humphreys.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#T00200"><p>I will speak briefly to the group.</p> <p>In principle, when a notice is published in respect of a proposed by-law it should have already been screen.  We do not want to see by-laws published where there is a 90 period and there is information missing.  We would expect that if Waterways Ireland is publishing by-laws, it would have already ensured that all of the necessary screenings and checks are taking place.  We certainly should not be relying on members of the public to express concern, to ask for a review or to ask that these obligations would be met because in many cases it will not be feasible within a 90 day period to get the necessary information.  It is a practical amendment.  If the Minister, for example, indicated that she wanted to include it anyway, I am sure we might not even need to press it.  We will have the opportunity to see if that is the case.  That would be useful.</p> <p>I recognise my colleague has a similar amendment in respect of birds.  This may be an area where the Minister can indicate that she would plan to ensure that this is a necessary prerequisite on Waterways Ireland before it brings a proposal to the public and opens a 90 day period for consultation.  I recognise and appreciate that the Minister indicated she is open to that 90 day period rather than the previously proposed 21 day period.  It is an improvement.</p> <p>I will not speak to all of the amendments in this area.  I recognise there has been some engagement.  We will be watching closely and hoping that many of our other amendments will be reflected by the Department on Report State due to the Minister's contact now with groups such as the canal users, but there are a few amendments which may need to be pressed because they are important points of principle.</p> <p>In respect of amendment No. a1z, Senator Craughwell has a proposal, which I strongly support, which states that it is not enough that notice of a proposed by-law should be published.  It is important that a local authority should be directly communicated with in writing to be informed that a by-law will impact on its local area.  I imagine there will be support across the House.  Many of us across the House have contact with local authorities.  It is a reasonable request that if Waterways Ireland is bringing in a by-law, it would write to the local authorities in the area which will be affected by the by-law and simply notify them of it so that they have an opportunity to act in the 90 days.</p> <p>I will skip through to another one, which is amendment No. 1ad.  Given the new authorities and the creation of new by-laws, if persons are approached by an authorised officer and informed that he or she is in breach of by-laws or laws in respect of the canals, the persons should be immediately informed of and shown what by-law they are in breach of or in danger of breaching.  These are pragmatic requests.  The reasons they are the ones we intend to press, unless of course the Minister indicates to directly absorb them into the Bill, is because they are important principles.  The amendment states that an authorised officer should be able on request to offer or show physically the by-law - it may be as simple as a booklet.  They should be able to show somebody the by-law which he or she is in breach of.  It is a simple and appropriate amendment.  In terms of any due process of law, it is very reasonable that a person who is told he or she is breaking a law be told what law the person is breaking and that the person is able to see it.  It is simply that they would present a hard copy of the by-law.  It is not enough to be told one is breaking a law and to go and check it on the website later.  One needs to be able to see it, there and then.</p> <p>In terms of amendment No. 1ae, this is another crucial and important point.  It is in respect of the new by-laws.  There are considerable powers in respect of by-laws being given to Waterways Ireland.  We have a reasonable proposal here - we would be happy to work with the Department if it has a counter suggestion which is similar and achieves the same policy intent - that Waterways Ireland should, every 36 months, review its by-laws with a specific focus on the new by-laws that have been introduced in the past three years.  They should review how these new by-laws are working and whether there are any unintended consequences and they should hold a public consultation so that they can assess the effect, positive or negative, of the by-laws introduced, and that public consultation should take place during the open season.  Of course, what nobody here wants is a situation whereby a by-law is brought in in October, November or December and it is only in the following summer season, in June, July and August, that is the peak tourism season, where we see the effect of the by-law and maybe some inadvertent consequences.  This ensures that we are able to ensure that by-laws that are put in place are reviewed and tested and that we all can learn and benefit from assessing their impact.</p> <p>One last amendment is important.  Proposed by Senator Norris, it is amendment No. 1af.  Waterways Ireland can, in addition to producing by-laws with the 90 day provision that we have heard, add ancillary provisions it deems appropriate.  We do not want to see a by-law the interpretation of which extends at great length to mean all kinds of different things and that we have one by-law with seven subsections that get added at a later stage.  Every new proposal should come through with the same kind of robust public engagement - the 90 day consultation for which the Minister has rightly allowed.</p></speech>

I did not realise.  I have spoken on it and will not need to speak to it again.</p> <p>These are pragmatic proposals.  I look forward to the Minister's response.

This requires that by-laws be communicated in writing to each local authority.  There is no way that we can allow organisations to operate on the hope that the message will get through at some stage or other.  We have to put it into the legislation to ensure that local authorities are aware of them and are communicated with at every stage.  Given that the waterways cross several local authorities, we do not want in five years' time to find out that somebody thought somebody else was doing something.  We need to ensure that it is enshrined in the legislation.</p> <p>Under amendment No. 1ab, the Minister will see that I am looking for an extension for public consultation, from 21 to 60 days in most cases.  I note, from the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, that 21 days is not enough notice to get an organisation in to give a presentation.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for facilitating the helpful consultation period in the AV room with Waterways Ireland staff.  However, I was deeply disappointed by their level of interaction.  There was none, and we felt as if our views did not matter.  I can relate to the experiences of residents and others along the Barrow line, given that Waterways Ireland, which is a North-South body, seems determined to proceed irrespective of democracy or the wishes of local users.  I was disappointed with the consultation.  Perhaps we can touch on that issue later.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 1x, Waterways Ireland must comply with screening and assessments under European legislation.  I would appreciate clarification on the matter.  Any planning process should cover this, but I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the by-laws in terms of this amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1y refers to 21 days, but the Minister indicated that she would increase the period to 90 days, which we welcome.  Will she clarify how she will implement that?  Presumably, a departmental amendment will be submitted on Report Stage.  If so, that would be good.  Not just local authorities, but all stakeholders and users should be covered by the 90-day period.</p> <p>In light of the recent presentation given by Waterways Ireland in the AV room, an element of local democratic accountability must be brought into the mix.  I do not mean "consultation" where people are told what will happen.  That is not consultation, it is dictating, and it is what has happened to date.  Consultation has to be prescriptive and there must be a statutory obligation on Waterways Ireland to engage with the element of democracy closest to the people, namely, the councillors and officials of local government.  This must be done so that the interests of local stakeholders are protected.  That is why the 90-day period is so important.  While I welcome the period, there may be a requirement to follow up with additional measures, and I would be interested in the Minister's comments on same.  Amendments Nos. 1aa and 1ab are linked to the matter of 90 days and I welcome that the initial amendment is being accepted.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1ad refers to "Authorised Officers", a matter discussed by Senator Higgins.  The amendment seeks to require authorised officers to present copies of the by-laws.  This is only right.  If there is an enforcement issue, at least the individual on whom it places a requirement knows which by-laws are being enforced.</p> <p>I have lost the number of the next amendment, as they are confusing.</p></speech>

Senator Norris and I have submitted an amendment to the effect that there should be a wider publication of the by-law.  According to subsection (2)(a), the by-law shall be published on Waterways Ireland's website and in newspapers circulating in the vicinity, but Waterways Ireland is not required to notify all registered users of the canal.  That should occur.  For one reason or another, people who utilise a service might not have access to the website or read the local newspapers.  Most people have moved away from reading newspapers and do not buy them.  There should be a mechanism requiring Waterways Ireland to notify all users of when it makes by-laws so that people can be aware and engage in the 90-day consultation period.</p> <p>I am sorry, but I have lost the amendment's number.

I strongly support Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  It is clear that the users of the canal should be consulted when Waterways Ireland is constructing by-laws, but my real point is that I was told by the Chair that it had been impossibly confusing to create a coherent list of the amendments.  I will wave this around.  The civic engagement group has provided it.  It is helpful.  There is no reason that it should be done the other way.  Everyone present is confused - the previous speaker, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Minister and her advisers - about the numbering of these amendments.

When matters are so completely confused as this, we could easily spend more time on these issues.  We have plenty of time, given that we only meet for a day and a half a week, but no consideration has been given to that.  When matters are so confused, we should address each amendment in isolation.  Then everyone would be clear as to what we are discussing.  The next time that we have such a complex Bill, we should produce something like the civic engagement group's document, that being a consistent, coherent, logical and understandable listing, and then discuss amendments individually.</p></speech>

If the Minister incorporated it on Report Stage, it would save quite an amount of time.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's point on how to engage with users applies across the board.  When we got involved in politics, we used letters and telephones.  Now, we use e-mails or engage through Facebook.  When users register, they must provide their e-mail addresses for notifications.  Many of the canal's users come from other parts of the country, so advertisements in local papers will not be sufficient.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for taking on board the extension of the consultation period.  Regarding the review of by-laws raised by Senator Higgins, will the Minister revert to me on a query?  The amendment reads "36 months", but sometimes there must be common sense about the capability of Departments to conduct reviews.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When such a comprehensive review is taking place through the Heritage Bill 2016, we should come up with an achievable date for review of the by-laws being introduced.

Many of the issues covered in the amendments were discussed along with other canal-related issues.  There was a shared understanding on both sides of the importance of the canals to rural areas for tourism development and local communities.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland recognised the rights of the regulator to regulate and that legislation should cover regulators, user requirements and by-laws.  The importance of having regular engagement was acknowledged and my officials are happy to work with the IWAI on any issues of concern it may have.  My officials also had a very good meeting with Senators for which I thank them.</p> <p>The proposed amendments Nos. 1x and a1y are not needed because any provision in the Canals Act that makes or may make provision for land use must comply with the obligations under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  As with everyone else, Waterways Ireland is subject to habitats directives.  If we keep repeating it in legislation, it becomes very cumbersome.  It is given that it has to comply with them so there is no need to put that in.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1y is about notifying identified users.  Waterways Ireland automatically notifies all registered boat users, representative groups and local authorities as part of the process.  My problem is that there is no such thing as a registered user of a canal.  It would be very hard to identify them.  This public consultation or notification would be run on the same basis as a local authority would do it, by advertising in the newspaper and publishing it on the website.  It is incumbent on those using the canal to make themselves aware of any changes that might be made.</p> <p>As I have indicated, I am happy to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to extend the consultation period for making the by-laws to up to 90 days.  That gives people with an interest in the canals and waterways 90 days to make a submission.  By stating registered users, someone could be left out and we would not even know who had been left out.  It is very hard to do that.  However, there is a register of boat users and we will advise them.</p></speech>

I believe I have addressed most of the issues there.</p> <p>On the consultation with Waterways Ireland, it must be remembered that Waterways Ireland works very closely with local authorities.  I have a number of examples where it has worked very well on a collaborative basis on projects.  On the Shannon-Erne Blueway, from Ballyconnell down to Carrick-on-Shannon there have been a number of projects that have worked extremely well.  There is a good working relationship between local authorities and Waterways Ireland.  In my county, Waterways Ireland was the lead partner in an application for funding in conjunction with the local authority that actually produced &euro;5 million in indirect money to develop the blueway along the route of the Ulster Canal from Smithborough to Middletown on a cross-Border basis.  They work very collaboratively.  I have complimented Waterways Ireland on how it works with local authorities in introducing good projects with tourism benefits for the local community and the wider public.</p></speech>

While it is not my amendment, I would be quite flexible in that regard.  I would like to see a review mechanism built into the legislation.  No precedent is being set in this regard.  When I brought legislation through the House in the past, I accepted amendments to introduce a review mechanism.  Given the number of amendments in the Heritage Bill, it would be good practice to have a review mechanism.</p></speech>

We thought that 36 months seemed like a reasonable period.  The Minister might like to consult with Waterways Ireland, but we need a review mechanism.</p></speech>

That must be done through consultation.  We have the full consultation period if something needs to be changed.  They are not left sitting for the next three years with nothing happening to them.  If something arises that needs to be addressed, a consultation process will take place and changes made if necessary.  I take the Senators' point.  Perhaps we could examine the possibility of reviewing all the by-laws every five years and put that in.  I will look at that.  It is just about getting the right wording for an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We cannot expect all officers to have all by-laws in their heads.  It might not be a book; it might be in online format or perhaps it is commonly accessed by-laws.  If people could be told, "It's X by-law and here's where you see it", that would be something.  It is still not enough.  We do not want people being told they are breaking the law without being shown what law.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister's point that by-laws are organic.  We are dealing with legislation today and what I am asking to be reviewed is the legislation we are putting through the House today.  The Bill is an enabler for by-laws.  The purpose of the amendment is to review that mechanism.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the fundamental basis of democracy is that one knows with what one is being charged.  One has to know the offence with which one is being charged.  It should be referenced.  It need not necessarily be an enormous book.  I do not think the by-laws would necessarily be an enormous book.  Presumably authorised officers would have a satchel of some kind.  It is not an unbearable duty on them to carry these things.  They could also do it through their telephones.  Most people have telephones that show these things.  All I am saying is that the principle of the amendment, with which I am sure the Minister will agree, is that an individual member of the public should be placed in a situation where they know with a degree of exactitude absolutely with what they are being charged.  People are entitled under law to know the offence with which they are being charged.  It is a fundamental principle of democracy.  I am sure the Minister will agree.</p></speech>

This amendment states that they have to have "for reference purposes a hard copy of the bye-laws".  That means they have to go around with a hard copy of the by-laws and show it to people.  It appears to be a bit cumbersome for an officer out there enforcing the by-laws on the canal to have this book and have to show it to people when he or she wants to outline to them what they are doing wrong and that a prosecution may follow.</p></speech>

Over the years, we have all worked through the local authorities.  There was always confusion over local authorities, OPW and Waterways Ireland.  Who will implement the by-laws?  Are there extra jobs involved?  Where will the money come from?  Like with everything that is set in writing, we must ask where the funding is coming from.  Will this be an extra charge on the users of the canals?  I have massive concerns.  Unless by-laws are controlled and implemented, they are absolutely a waste of time.  The by-laws are mentioned but there is no further information about how it will happen and how it will work apart from the public consultation, which I understand.  Everything has to be controlled, which the Minister knows.  Over the years, my biggest issue has been that nobody takes full responsibility in their areas, for example, through local authorities.  We are always trying to find out who will take ownership and control of it.  Can the Minister give more information on what is happening and the bigger picture?</p></speech>

It allows the body to decide what provisions may be necessary and expedient to include in the by-laws for the management of the canal and the canal property.  This basically gives flexibility to Waterways Ireland to change the by-laws, which is exactly what the Senator was speaking about.  If something comes up that needs to be changed, this provision gives the flexibility to change it, notwithstanding the fact that it has to go through the full process - the 90 days consultation and all of that.  The purpose of this is to allow necessary changes to be made to the by-laws if deemed necessary.</p></speech>

The class D fines, at the moment, are in the financial bracket from &euro;501 up to &euro;1,000.  I am not sure if Senator Humphreys's amendment meant a class E fine instead of class B, because  class E is below &euro;500.  Perhaps that was what was meant or maybe it is a misprint.</p> <p>On the fines, this is a contentious issue within the fishing sector at the moment and has been for some time.  I introduced legislation in this House which would introduce fixed penalty notices for minor offences for small fishermen instead of convictions in court and fines.  That is what is proposed here as well, a fixed penalty notice with a reasonable limit.  If the only recourse here is a class D fine, then the person or persons convicted are looking at paying out between &euro;501 and &euro;1,000 per offence.  There could be additional offences as well.  There are consequences here and the risk of major financial liabilities.  There should be a staggered system, if nothing else, and not just the option of a class D fine.  If someone is in contravention of, for example, four or five different by-laws it could stack up.  There should be some sort of a staggered system introduced which would include fixed penalty notices.  I would be willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister had another look at this.</p></speech>

On occasions a fixed penalty fine, or a lower one, may be correct but the penalty for major offences has to reflect the damages that could be done to Waterways Ireland and to our water systems.  The breaching of serious by-laws can be detrimental and costly.  I would be happy if the Minister would engage with the Senators to ensure that the fines reflect the crime.</p></speech>

Class D fines are only prosecuted if the fixed penalty notice of &euro;150 is not paid.  There is a fixed penalty notice in place there.  That will cover the concerns the Senators have.  It is when the fixed penalty notice is not paid that it moves into the more severe fines.  I think that answers the Senators' questions.</p></speech>

That seems to me, again, to be reasonable.  If a person is charged with something, the person charging needs to have some degree of credibility, proof and evidence.  Another amendment, No. 1al, would insert the term &ldquo;determining reasonable proof&rdquo;.  This is, as the wording says, reasonable.  It is reasonable that there should be a requirement for proof.</p></speech>

I do not want to get into it, because I know we are all keen to move forward, but there is a fundamental point and it came up in the previous section.  It is very unusual that we would look at fixed payment notices without an appropriate appeal mechanism and so forth.  There are many other areas where fixed payments are due.  The reason that there are so many of these amendments is that we are looking at a situation whereby somebody is effectively being charged, judged and paying the penalty all in the same moment, as it were, because it is a fixed payment notice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why there are these complications.  Normally one would not have to go through the whole process there and then, but if we do not have an appeals mechanism which is something we need to examine overall in respect of fixed payments, it all has to be done there and then.  If there was an appeals mechanism, a fixed payment notice could be issued and the mechanism would be available to the person in the rare cases where it was contested.  They should be able to contest it and ask about evidence, etc.  Some of these issues arise from that core aspect of the Bill.</p></speech>

Fixed penalty notices are the way to go.  They make sense.  The justice system and the courts are clogged up enough without having to deal with minor offences such as these.  The comparator would be fixed penalty notices for driving offences such as speeding which start at &euro;80.  In this instance, they start at &euro;150.  Presumably the system is staggered, depending on the nature of the offence involved, and that there is not just a flat rate of &euro;150, irrespective of the severity of the offence involved.  I am not even sure what the offences could or would be.  Will the Minister give examples of offences and tell us whether she believes a sum of &euro;150 is appropriate?  Should lower sums be specified staggered upwards according to severity?</p> <p>Amendment 1ak relates to increasing the payment period from 21 days to 30.  This is a reasonable request as most people are paid monthly.  These are new financial times in which people are in mortgage distress and have bills to pay and so on.  In the financial calendar credit cards, etc. work on a 30-day period.  Would it not be reasonable, therefore, to increase the period to 30 days?</p> <p>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor will speak on this issue in more detail, but I agree that there should be some appeals mechanism at the fixed penalty notice level.  It is most likely that the only way to appeal it will be to not pay it, meaning that the person concerned will end up in the courts.  There should be some internal appeals mechanism similar to the appeals system in the Department of Social Protection whereby individuals could within 30 days register their grievance or appeal.  Within a further 30 days, Waterways Ireland would issue a response.  Perhaps there might be some such mechanism.</p></speech>

I agree that many people do not have &euro;150, which is a lot of money.  There should be some system in place to help with an appeal.</p></speech>

A sum of &euro;150 is the maximum fine.  It starts much lower and that is the maximum.</p></speech>

If people are breaking the law, we do not want to have a system whereby it will be appealed and they go to court.  If they feel strongly about it, they do not have to pay the fine and can go to court to make their case.  However, the sum of &euro;150 is the maximum.  I did not want to make it more complicated.  I was trying to make things simple.  We can assume that most of the people involved are actually breaking the law.  The authorised officers will not be stopping people to make false accusations against them.  The purpose behind the section is to ensure there will be rules and regulations in place by which people will have to abide in order that we can all use the waterways which will be available for the enjoyment of both boat users and the public in general.</p></speech>

I have suggested an amended wording to include after "notice" the words "determining reasonable proof".  I have also proposed inserting a subsection providing "where a person wishes to contest notice served, the matter should be referred to an independent appeals board who will adjudicate on the matter as determined in the bye-laws".  I do not believe there is provision for such an independent appeals board and believe it is important that there should be.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position.

It would be simple to state such officers need to be appointed from within the staff of Waterways Ireland.  For example, we do not want a scenario where this work might be contracted out to a private security firm.  Hospital security services and so on have been contracted out.  We do not want a scenario where a private security firm would have the power to issue fixed payment notices and enforce by-laws.  These officers need to be appointed from Waterways Ireland staff.  That may mean the organisation will decide to hire additional staff, but that is for it to determine.  Accountability is important and we do not want a situation down the line where Waterways Ireland states the company it contracted to enforce the by-laws did X, Y or Z.  There is a need for direct accountability.  Similarly, it must be ensured that the officers are suitably qualified because they are being given a new series of powers.  I am happy to engage with the Department on the detail of the amendments, but the Minister will understand they are about taking seriously the powers, accountability and training of authorised officers.</p></speech>

I may engage further on this issue because there are public procurement concerns and about trade agreements for planning.  It is important that we ensure where there is public delivery of a service, it is retained for public delivery.  In some cases, this may need to be reflected in legislation.  I am happy to withdraw the amendments, but I might engage with the Minister on specific concerns in order that we will not leave this to standard practice.  We must ensure it is covered in legislation.</p></speech>

We did not have an opportunity to discuss the previous section but it dealt with allowing people to board boats.  Amendment No. 1aaf refers to search warrants.  My colleague and I are concerned that the current legislation allows authorised officers to get search warrants to enter and search boats accompanied by anyone whom they believe to be appropriate.  My colleague and I believe this aspect must be clarified.  In ideal circumstances search warrants should only be issued to a garda, a customs official or a Revenue official.  The ability to grant search warrants to authorised officers is quite a considerable power.</p><p>We are concerned about the provision which states: &quot;A search warrant under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named authorised officer, accompanied by such authorised officers or other persons as the named authorised officer thinks necessary.&quot;  We believe that if an authorised officer is issued with a search warrant, he or she should be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a customs official, a Revenue official or health and safety inspector.  We also believe that they should be the determinants.  Perhaps authorised officers from Waterways Ireland could also ask for a search warrant.</p><p>The power I have alluded to is very considerable.  My colleague and I will probably not push the amendment.  We urge the Department to review granting a considerable power to search and enter people's private properties and homes to authorised officers as stipulated in this legislation.  This is particularly important given the fact that we have not been reassured about the accountability of authorised officers.  I do not plan to press these amendments at this point but I want to discuss the matter.  The granting of search warrants is quite a considerable power and the persons who use search warrants must be accountable.  I am concerned about this power and ask the Minister to address the matter.</p></speech>

I also agree that it would be well worth our while examining the matter to ensure that the appropriate person is used.  These are very wide powers.  They include the power to enter the personal property and home of an individual.  Let us remember that some people live on houseboats.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1aah deals with the presentation of a warrant.  As the legislation stands, persons must request the presentation of a warrant.  They may neglect to do so, or may not know they have the right to do so, or may not do so for one reason or another.  It is important that a warrant is presented to the person who is alleged to be guilty of an offence.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 1aai extends the provision from merely covering a boat to include other canal properties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not restrict it to the question of a boat.</p></speech>

The officers executing a search warrant have to go to court to get a search warrant before they can execute it.  That will allay some of the fears around search warrants.  They will go to court to ask for search warrants on the basis of breaches of the canal by-laws.  A judge would have to be satisfied, based on the sworn information of an authorised officer, that there are reasonable grounds granting a warrant.  That is what this section is about.</p> <p>Senator Norris said that if an officer does not automatically produce a search warrant that would invalidate the search.  At that stage, he or she probably should have known that there was an issue and it should not come as a surprise because he or she would have had to go to court to get a search warrant.</p> <p>I refer to amendment No. 1aai.  It suggests that Waterways Ireland would need a search warrant to enter its canal property.  That does not make sense.</p></speech>

It is absurd for a Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come in here and blather on about hedges.  What have hedges got to do with heritage?  It is a complete and absolute nonsense.  The absence of scientific evidence on the part of the Minister has been underlined throughout the debate.  No survey has been done and this is disastrous.  It is appalling that the Government would introduce policy based on no scientific research whatsoever.</p><p>The Heritage Bill proposal to allow burning in March would have a very serious impact on upland breeding birds.  Birdwatch Ireland, a professional body engaged in this area, presented the best available data to the Minister but the science is being totally ignored.  It might as well not have been done.  We need Irish data so we need a proper pilot study, not a mass implementation of a policy which is unsupported by science.  The necessary research must take place before this is implemented.</p><p>What science underpins the proposed changes to ensure birds are not impacted?  What evidence has the Minister got for this?  She has presented none to this House.  If a pilot study shows that nesting birds have been impacted what will the Government's policy objectives be?  Will this alter the situation?  Can we have the details of what secondary legislation is envisaged by the Government?</p><p>According to Derek Mooney, a well-known populariser of natural history, modern farming practice has taken its toll on wildlife and the destruction of hedgerows has greatly reduced the cover of mammals and birds.  He said seed-eating birds will decline drastically in numbers and the shortage of insect larvae will make it difficult for birds to raise their young.  Three quarters of an hour ago in this House I adverted to the impact on the moth and butterfly population so I will not regurgitate it.</p><p>We do not have much scientific evidence in Ireland as it simply has not been done.  I would, however, like to put on the record the results of a survey conducted by the University of Leeds on the impact of peat burning on the chemical composition of the landscape.  It states that p<font color="#231F20">rescribed burning on peatlands was shown to have clear effects on peat hydrology, peat chemistry and physical properties, river water chemistry and river ecology.  It is a substantial impact.  It also states:</font></p><blockquote><font color="#231F20">Burning reduces the organic matter content of the upper peat layers.  The net result is that the peat is less able to retain important particles known as exchangeable cations.  In other words, the peat in burned sites is deprived of chemicals which are important for plant growth and for buffering acidic rainfall.  [By burning peat we are creating conditions that are adverse to important plant growth.]  Lower concentrations of nutrient elements found in peat soils in burned river basins do not support the idea that burning enriches the peat with nutrients from ash.  [We are often told that by burning on grassland, gorse and scrub areas one gets a fresh growth of grass but this does not appear to be the case with regard to peatlands.]  Rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium concentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned catchments.  Rivers draining burned sites had higher concentrations of silica, manganese, iron and aluminium compared to unburned catchments.  There was no difference between burned and unburned catchments in peat nitrogen concentrations or in carbon to nitrogen ratios (high C/N is considered unfavourable to microbial decomposition of peat) ... Water-table depth is very important in peatlands for maintaining their stability and function as a carbon store.  Water tables were found to be significantly deeper for burned catchments than for unburned ones.  Deeper water tables would suggest a greater scope for degradation of the peat and loss of carbon to the atmosphere.</font></blockquote> <p><font color="#231F20">In other words it is carbon negative.  The report further states that sphagnum is an important peat-forming species.  Sphagnum grows on the bogs and in historical times it was used as a dressing for wounds as it has powerful medicinal properties.  The report goes on:</font></p><blockquote><font color="#231F20">Changes in the hydrological properties of the peat after fire make the peat less conducive to Sphagnum moss growth.  River flow in catchments where burning has taken place appears to be slightly more prone to higher flow peaks during heavy rain.  However, this was not a conclusive finding.  Burning vegetation alters the natural peat hydrology in the upper layers of the peat affecting the balance of where water flow occurs.  Recovery of many hydrological properties appears to be possible if a site is left unburned over many years.  [This means the site shows a capacity to recover.]  Thermal regimes appear to recover as vegetation regrows.  This recovery was also seen in soil hydrology data from burned plots of different ages.  Macroinvertebrates play a vital role in aquatic food webs by feeding on algae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they themselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians.  The research found that river macroinvertebrate diversity was reduced in burned sites.  [This means there is a reduction in the small fauna in burnt areas.]  In burned sites, river macroinvertebrate populations were dominated by groups that are commonly found in higher abundance in disturbed river systems, such as non-biting midge larvae (Chironomidae) and burrowing stonefly larvae (Nemouridae).  Increases in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa counteract declines and/or losses amongst some groups (e.g. mayflies) which are typically sensitive to reduced pH, increased aluminium and deposition of fine sediments.  These changes show that burning increases the effect of biological stressors compared to unburned rivers.</font></blockquote> <p><font color="#231F20">All these things suggest a dramatic impact on the chemistry and ecology of peatlands.  In addition, section 8 extends the burning period which would affect a significant proportion of our most threatened species.  Upland burning has been shown to have some positive aspects but it is essential that threatened species are not wiped out.  Among those species are curlew, which used to be a very common feature of the Irish landscape.  Now one hardly ever hears the curlew's call, or the golden plover.  This section needs to vigorously opposed and then rethought.  I ask the Minister to do so.</font></p></speech>

When Senator Alice-Mary Higgins tabled amendments which would have greatly improved the road safety aspect of dealing with hedgerows her proposals fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Norris that the measure must be opposed.  I call on Members to support the amendment because at the very least one must support good science, which is what it is.  One must investigate and carry out a proper baseline study and then one can move forward.  Our neighbours in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland moved in that direction but they have moved back.  Recently, Northern Ireland voted to ensure that August was still included.  It is important to acknowledge that was done.  I support the amendment.  I will possibly table an alternative to the baseline study on Report Stage in terms of time, area and distance in kilometres.  We need good science.  What is proposed today relates to the Twenty-six Counties.  The Minister asks us to trust her to do it by regulation.  We would be failing citizens if we were to take it on trust.  This is primary legislation and the baseline study must be outlined in detail in terms of what counties are covered and how many kilometres of hedgerows will be taken into account.  Let us kill off the notion once and for all that the issue relates to road safety.  Let nobody in this House try to justify the argument because that is not the case.</p></speech>

I wish to be clear that sometimes I do not always get the opportunity to speak.</p> <p>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed by a number of Senators on the impact the provisions might have on biodiversity.  I share the views of Senators that hedgerows are a very important wildlife habitat that provide food, shelter, corridors of movement, nests and hibernation sites for many native flora and fauna.  The changes in timing of cutting which are set out in the Bill will not interfere with any of those functions.  As I stated previously, my intention is that any hedge trimming in the month of August may only take place on road sides or on land where reseeding or tillage is being carried out and that the trimming may only be of the current year's growth and should not involve the use of heavy flails or grubbing.  If a person needs to carry out heavier cutting of hedges such as grubbing and flailing they must do so during the existing permitted period between September and the end of February.  I wish to be clear; it was never my intention to allow the grubbing, heavy cutting or destruction of hedges in August.  The text reflected the wording in the original legislation and I now propose on Report Stage to delete the words "grubbing" or "destroying otherwise" from section 8(2) of the Bill.</p> <p>To be clear, this is a pilot scheme for two years, subject to regulations and guidelines and there will be monitoring of the pilot phase.  After two years it must come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas, which must pass a resolution &ndash; that means it will not be a nodding exercise &ndash; for the pilot period to continue and if it is not passed the pilot scheme will fall and the scheme will cease.</p> <p>Section 8 also allows for the controlled burning in certain areas to be specified by regulation during March should it be necessary, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.  Members are all aware of the illegal burning that takes place.  What I want to do is allow flexibility to work with landowners and to do that in a managed and safe way.</p> <p>Section 8 also provides for managed hedge cutting to be allowed under strict criteria during August to help ensure overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  The sunset clause of two years provided for in section 8 can only be extended by separate resolutions of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  It is good practice for the provisions to be reviewed during the two-year period in order that we can assess the works in practice and determine if there are any lessons to be learned or if any improvements are needed.  We must also ensure that the new provisions should not adversely impact on wildlife.  That will be a key aim of mine, taking account of my responsibilities for natural heritage.</p> <p>I am aware of some concerns surrounding scientific data to underpin the nesting and breeding periods for wild birds.  I am satisfied that the provisions to be put in place in section 8 fully respect the requirements of the nesting and breeding seasons for wild birds.  Furthermore, Senators will note that the provisions in the section provide that the cutting of hedgerows in August will only be possible if it is done in accordance with regulations which I will make in relation to hedgerow husbandry and to ensure that wildlife and other flora and fauna are protected.  No cutting will be possible in the absence of the regulations.  The provisions in the Bill are for a pilot phase of two years.  In that time my Department will monitor activity under the provisions and an assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing the measures beyond the pilot phase.</p></speech>

However, if a hedge is blocking the view of road users or where land management requires, the landowner will have the option to cut back one season's growth in the month of August if he or she so wishes.  That is a serious issue on local byroads in rural areas where hedges grow out on roads in particular in the month of August following heavy rain.  I know because I live there and I have experienced it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It damages cars, it restricts the view of motorists and it is dangerous for cyclists.  People prefer local authorities to have the power to cut hedges.  There is a provision whereby local authorities can cut hedges in the interests of road safety.

They just do not have that capacity.  Anyone who lives in rural Ireland will be aware of that.</p></speech>

It will allow hedges to be cut in August in certain circumstances only, subject to strict regulations, and in this regard, any cutting of hedges in August may only be of the current season's growth and may only be carried out on roadsides and on land where reseeding or tillage is taking place.  This represents only a small percentage of the overall hedgerows in the country.  Furthermore - I have said it before and will say it again - I will prohibit grubbing and flailing in August.  If farmers and others need to carry out heavier cutting of hedges such as grubbing and flailing, they must do so during the existing period between September and the end of February.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#FF04300"><p>I was going to speak strictly to amendment No. 2.  I will not go extensively into amendment No. 3, which I believe we will be debating together.</p> <p>I need to correct two key points for the record.  We have had this debate and I do not think it is constructive.  As a Minister for all of Ireland, the Minister needs to be very clear that it is not constructive to suggest or ascribe comments to the Seanad.  Nobody here has cast any aspersions about farmers.  That has been clear.  We spoke as custodians.  My colleague spoke as her father is a proud member of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA.  We have spoken about the interests of farmers, for example, horticultural farmers, those growing crops who are deeply concerned about the impacts of this legislation on pollinators.  We need to be very careful and appropriate and not try to create division where division has not been sown in this House.</p> <p>I would also like to make a technical correction.  The Minister said "as all who would live in rural areas".  All who live in rural areas and many of us who now live in urban areas are aware that the legislation is currently that councils can issue a permit which will allow the landowner to cut the hedge.  The Minister suggested that councils can cut hedges but do not have the capacity to do so.  The section 70 order allows a landowner to cut the hedge.  I do not believe in this context that this was accurate.  Let us be accurate about what the legislation provides.</p> <p>That said, I believe there is a resource issue.  It would be useful, as we have often said before, if we looked at places like County Clare and others where resources have been given to county councils to allow them to support the hedge cutting in issues of road safety.  I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator Kevin Humphreys, kindly acknowledged the amendment I put forward along with my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan, which would have strengthened road safety.  Our amendment is the only amendment to this legislation that is explicitly set out to strengthen road safety.  It was to ensure that not only landowners would be allowed to cut hedges where they feel there is a road safety concern, but that individuals could do so too.  We heard passionate testimony from persons with a disability about the obstructions for them.  Any person who is a road user or a path user could ask for a section 70 order to be issued.  It was a strengthening provision to allow road users who are concerned about road safety to ask for an exception.  Where road safety is a concern, section 70 allows for cutting at any time of year, 365 days a year.</p> <p>I wish to speak on amendment No. 2 and my other concerns around gorse-burning and hedges.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#FF04500"><p>It is amendment No. 2.  We are speaking only on amendment No. 2.  Those were simply clarifications of the Minister's speech.</p> <p>On amendment No. 2, unfortunately, the Minister did not comment on her views on baseline data.  We have been hearing at length that this is a pilot.  We have been hearing ideas as to what might be done.  We need to be very clear on the messages the Minister has given today with regard to one year's growth, what is or is not included and where it will be targeted.  None of this is currently in the legislation.  At present, the legislation gives clear and wide permission, and none of the constraints or the concerns on which we have heard very welcome suggestions from the Minister are in the legislation before the House.  We need to be very clear.  It is imperative that the Minister puts what she is saying here in the Chamber into the legislation.  We have a very wide divide at the moment between stated policy intent and the legislation that is before the House.</p> <p>There is also a concern when we talk about a pilot.  We have not really heard what is the intention of the pilot.  Why are we doing a pilot on cutting?  What is the urgency?  We know that road safety can be addressed elsewhere.  What is the driver?  What is the Minister's perspective as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?  What is the major heritage concern in rural areas that is driving this intrusion into our wildlife legislation?  It is a template that has stood for a long time and has been copied across Europe and in the UK.  We need to know why we are doing this pilot, and the case for doing it needs to be strong.  There is a key concern.  The Minister talks about science and such, but she is still talking about assessing the impacts.  If we do not have a baseline, we do not know how to assess the impacts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At present, there is no provision for baseline data gathering.  If, in two years' time, we simply say here is the situation now for whatever species may have expired or still be there, there will be no indication as to from where we have come or what we may have lost.  As I have said before and I will not repeat it in the Chamber, we know from the people who write to us and who monitor nature in their own areas that they have seen what has been lost already.  What about a baseline?  The Minister has not made provision for a baseline or indicated for a baseline.  Amendment No. 2 is separate to our general provision.  We have put forward very reasonable and appropriate scientific terms under which a baseline could be conducted so we know what is the biodiversity in our hedgerows right now, what is the nature of our hedgerows, what is there and what species are there.  We have information from the UK, which has done this research, and it is very interesting that when the UK conducted research on its hedgerows and looked at its baselines and impacts, it decided to change and copy our legislation because it was better.  It decided to remove August from the period of cutting and burning.  We also need to be clear that there needs to be freedom.</p><p>The Minister mentioned assessment.  At no point in the legislation do we have clarity on what assessment will be published, where it will be shared and how we will all be able to talk about what has happened during the two year period.  There is no plan for the pilot at present.  There is no specification.  It is not simply enough for the Minister to ask for blanket permission to invent a pilot.  The pilot cannot be all of Ireland and the Minister needs to set out what proportion of Ireland will be covered and not covered.  The Minister is giving assurances which, sadly, I do not believe she is in a position to give, that no wildlife will be affected.  We just do not know this unless we have the data and the science.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's comments on grubbing.  That is dealt with in amendment No. 3.  I imagine the Minister plans to accept our amendment on grubbing and destroying.  I also welcome the Minister's comments on flailing.  I note we will have an opportunity in this regard, if the Minister is genuinely serious about addressing issues of grubbing and flailing, as amendments to section 10 look to strengthen and set out regulations in respect of both of these practices.</p><p>I will not speak to the substance of section 8 until we come to the next group of amendments.  Will the Minister indicate whether she will accept the amendment on a baseline?  Will she put forward her own amendment on a baseline on Report Stage?</p></speech>

This is no surprise because in essence it is quite clear this section is designed to pre-empt any measure such as section 8 without a baseline data study being put in place to justify it.  There are a few points we must consider on what is being proposed.  The Minister has indicated road safety is an issue which concerns her and motivates the legislation.  If this is the case, I would like to see some mention of road safety as one of the criteria for making regulations in her section when we come to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#GG00300"><p>Hear, hear.</p></speech>

In a spirit of genuine conciliation in this debate it seems to me the Minister should indicate she is open to accepting the introduction of road safety as one of the constraining factors in section 8 if her section 8 is to proceed.</p><p>The second point that occurs to me is there is a distinction between section 8(1) which is a burning section and section 8(2) which, at present, is a cutting, grubbing or destroying section, but the Minister now indicates it is purely to be cutting.  It is very notable from the wording of section 8(1) it is proposed it should apply to such part or parts of the State as the regulations may permit.  When we look to the regulations envisaged by section 8(2) no such geographical criteria are there.  If we were considering a genuine pilot study to evaluate whether this should take place on scientific grounds, and bearing in mind the implications for wildlife and flora and fauna, one would expect, even from the point of view of having control studies and the like, that any scientific approach to a pilot study would look at areas where it was permitted and areas where it was not permitted, and see whether there was any significant difference between the two.  I was interested that Michael Viney in an article on this subject in <i>The Irish Times</i>pointed out there are particular species which produce second clutches of eggs and chicks in August each year.  The beekeepers of Ireland have come forward and their objections are based on the needs of bees with regard to cutting back that year's growth.</p><p>This brings me to the next point the Minister mentioned in her contribution.  She mentioned the regulations she had in mind would deal with roadside hedge cutting and non-roadside hedge cutting where it was necessary for land management in a tillage context.  Why is this not mentioned in the section?  I am worried by a particular point in all of this.  I do not doubt the Minister's good faith for a minute, but it is all very well to say that cutting would be restricted to that year's growth, whatever that would mean for bees and animals dependent on berries, but if somebody brings a machine into a field and starts cutting, afterwards who will say the person cutting went further than this year's growth?  In the real world what inspector will be sent out, and by whom, to crawl along the hedges and state that cutting has gone a bit further than this year's growth and it is 4 inches into last year's growth?  Where will the line be drawn?  People will not be out with secateurs and measuring tapes.  Either a hedge cutting machine will be deployed on a hedge or it will not.  In the aftermath, there will be nothing to show how far into last year's growth the cutting actually went.  There will be no person whose job it is to state the cutting went further than this year's growth because that person would have to prove he or she was there last year and saw the state of the hedge last year.</p></speech>

If the Minister is actually saying this is the justification for this, how will anybody control it?</p> <p>I come back to the point about the provision on cutting, grubbing and destroying being a nationwide operation as section 8(2) stands.  There is not the mechanism, machinery, resources or capacity on the part of any wildlife agency or conservation body to do anything effective to stop widespread cutting of hedges in August once an order is made under this regulation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nobody will be able to police any regulations effectively.  I do not see why we have not been shown the draft regulation.  We pass referendums and we see the draft Bill.  The child adoption Bill was put before the people, the abortion Bill was put before the people, divorce legislation was put before the people in draft, various pieces of legislation are put before the people on occasions so they could work out what they were actually voting for.  On this occasion no attempt has been made to produce a draft regulation which has the limiting factor such as tillage and land management and this season's growth, all of these issues are just absent from the legislation.  It occurs to me that if this season's growth is to be a genuine criterion, there is absolutely no reason it should not be mentioned in the legislation in respect of off-road hedge cutting.  I presume the Minister would tell me before we go much further that she would accept an amendment on Report Stage to do that.  If she is not willing to say that, and put it in the legislation that it is intended to have that minor effect, there is no point in making a speech justifying it in this House by reference to something she is not willing to commit to in legislation.  <br/><br/>Likewise, if it is required for the purposes of reasonable land management, what do we mean by that?  If it is to be in a tillage context, let us see what is actually meant by all of that.  What I am coming down to is this - that the amendment proposed is effectively putting in place a standstill until some scientific basis for a change in this area is established on scientific grounds.  That is the precautionary principle that we are supposed to follow in environmental matters.  It worries me that this seems to be a very unscientific, broad-brush approach and one which gives a free licence to all farmers to attack any hedge.  Even if the Minister took out grubbing and destroying, as long as there is something left at the end of the operation the possibility of proving that any particular landowner had infringed the legislation would be very small indeed as would the the chance of enforcing it.  <br/><br/>Lastly, I do not want to reignite the controversy that we saw some moments ago.  This is not a question of the townies versus the farmers.  This is not about idealists.  Some of us are very conversant with rural Ireland, and know what it is like when a bramble grows out of a ditch and it forces bikes out into the road and such like.  No one needs to have a particular background to know what growth occurs and what the road safety implications can be of roadside hedges growing out onto the road in summer.  By the same token, although some people may get hotheaded on social media and use broad-brush language about this particular proposal, the Minister should not underestimate the feeling that there is on this issue.  It is not just that <i>The Irish Times </i>wrote an editorial on this and praised this House for querying what the Minister is doing.  There is a huge amount of people in Ireland who object to this, they object to its unscientific basis, the manner in which it has been done, the absence of draft regulations, the unthought-out way that this has been done; they object to what they suspect is just a deal done with farmers' organisations and that it why it is being pushed forward with such vehemence.  We live in a very uncertain world but I do believe that if by any chance the Minister manages to progress this into legislation she should bear in mind that this Government has a lot of problems - we only have to look around at what has been happening in the last week - and this is going to alienate a very significant area of votes from it.  They are not just people who sit on beanbags thinking about San Francisco in the 1960s </p></speech>

This is a case of real ordinary people who are upset about this.  It is a significant group in Irish society.  As somebody who uses them myself, I cannot object to there being some order on them and if resources permitted somebody might enforce minimum standards of safety on the use of our canals and rivers.  If the Minister wants to bring order to Irish waterways, I have no problem with all of that but I ask her to consider this. This legislation could do without section 8.</p></speech>

There are an awful lot of people outside this House who would say she should get on with her Bill and leave out section 8.  Those people would be well disposed to the Minister if they felt that she had listened to a debate in this House where considered opposition to section 8 had been voiced.  I do not think that it would do any harm to her electorally or to her ministerial standing.  As one of the people who admires many of the things the Minister does, I do not believe that it would detract in the slightest if between now and Report Stage, she were to reconsider her support for section 8.  I do not think that the farming organisations would go mad if she modified section 8 along the lines that she says she intends to do and could do by restricting its application.  I do think that with so many political problems around her neck, this is not a case of her taking the hard decision in the national interest.  It does not fall into that category and the Minister should not think of herself, or the Government of itself, as taking the hard decisions with a whole lot of intemperate, ill-informed critics voicing half-thought out opposition.  This is something where most people, I think reasonably, come down against section 8 if they consider the issue.  Most independent commentary comes down against section 8.  I ask the Minister, between now and Report Stage to consider whether this Bill would not be a far better Bill if she walked away from section 8 and said that she had listened to the debate in this House.  That is what the Seanad is for.  She has not tried to push it through on a whip.  The balance of opinion in society is against it.  There is not a very good scientific basis for enacting section 8 at this stage; in fact there is none.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister is not merely a Minister.

I am very supportive of the Irish farming community.  We would not have the landscape we have without the farmers.  They have cared for the environment.  We have what we have because of them.  In this House, we have actually listened to each other.  We may have started from different places but we have moved closer together.  At a very early stage, I made the same suggestion that section 8 be shelved, and that we look at the signs and develop a logical approach.  If we want to deal with the road safety element, Senator Higgins's road safety amendment could be adopted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, when he gets around to doing something.</p> <p>I doubt anyone is happy with the idea and taking it on trust.  We have to understand what the baseline is.  The baseline cannot be Twenty-six Counties.  If we are asking for a study to be done, or a change in legislation to allow a study or a pilot project be carried out, it cannot be on a Twenty-six County basis.  I said earlier that this is a place to start from, if we insist on going forward.  This is not a townie versus rural Ireland.  It is actually the opposite.  The vast majority of e-mails I have received on this issue come from outside the Dublin area from the agricultural community and from people who live and work in rural Ireland.  I was accused earlier of just being a Dublin 4 person.  Hedgerows are an important part of our environment.  I thank the Minister for the indication that she is removing the words "grubbing and destroying".  I also notice she has changed her language.  In the Bill the word used is "cutting" but she is using the word "trimming".  Does that refer to a different length or distance?</p> <p>A job well done would be to allow the canal section of this Bill to progress, and possibly send section 8 into an Oireachtas committee.  Let us invite everybody in to discuss this in depth to ensure we are doing the right thing.  It is not just the birds, bats and hedgehogs.  It is about farmer's livelihoods as well.  There is REPS and payments are made to the protection of the environment.  That all has to be considered.</p> <p>Rural Ireland is facing great problems with Brexit.  Its economic viability is going to be threatened in the coming two years, and as a country and a nation we need to stand together.  To build trust between the communities we should remove section 8 and send it to an Oireachtas committee, perhaps the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

I certainly support the previous Senator's position that we should drop section 8 completely.  If we do not, I will vote for this amendment too.</p></speech>

I have sat here or in my office for most of the day listening to the contributions, and many Senators mentioned the amount of communications we have received.  We have received communications by e-mail, on Facebook and on Twitter, and I have read most of them.  I have also met people.  I went to Bantry a week ago last Monday night, to the Cathaoirleach's home town.  I met 500 people.  Rarely have I gone into a room with 500 people.  There was an unfortunate feeling, as other Senators have mentioned, that it was them against us.  That was an unfortunate feeling to get from that room.  Entrenchment has become an issue in this debate.  That has been the unfortunate thing in this debate.  Rural people feel that they have been driven into the ground on this.  I am not saying that is on purpose, but they do feel that it has become "them" and "us".  That has been the unfortunate outcome of this very important debate.  </p> <p>There is an issue.  Everybody in this House who understands rural Ireland is aware that when one goes to the local council one of the key issues is cutting hedges.  Anyone who has served on a rural county council knows it is one of the key issues with the engineers at the area roads meeting.  As most of us here who went through the local authority system will be aware, the first thing that the engineer will say is that they do not have the money and that it cannot be done because it is against the law.  It is an issue.  In many ways, this legislation is trying to put something to bed.  Let us look to see what will work and what will not work.  Let us look at a two year pilot study and at trimming back hedges for two years where they must be trimmed back.  Some Senators have said that maybe we will cut every hedge in Ireland.  We will not.  A small percentage of hedges will be cut.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#JJ00600"><p>Nobody said that.</p></speech>

I live in a place called Minane Bridge.  I will not be cutting a hedge in August because I do not need to.  I am a grassland farmer.  I do not need to cut those hedges.  I can cut them when it comes to the appropriate time that is in the legislation at the moment.  However, I have neighbours who have grain farms and when it comes to winter cereals, which is a huge issue further south from me near Kinsale, they need to cut their hedges back because they are doing their tilling and their sowing and their setting in August.   They cannot do it at any other time of the year.  At the moment, they do it afterwards.  The weather goes against them and it affects their crops.  It just does not work.  The use of phrase "land management" by the Minister is such an appropriate one because that is exactly what it is.  In many ways, it is helping the environment because at the moment they are doing double the work.</p> <p>This legislation is looking to see if there is a better way.  It will come back to this House in two years' time if it is not a better way, and we can take that into consideration then.  This legislation allows for the results of the information to come back to these Houses.  Then the Seanad can look at the results of what we have seen.  That is appropriate, and is what the farming community wants.  It has been an unfortunate, damaging debate.  This is our third day in the Seanad.  I have seen it in the e-mails and text messages I have received from my own part of the world and it is unfortunate how entrenched people have become.  That is something that I am deeply conscious of.</p> <p>This legislation set out to do two things.  One was to help the farming community manage certain conditions when it comes to land use regarding re-seeding and winter cereals.  That was the idea of it from an agricultural point of view.  The other issue was to help road safety for the month of August, for the 31 days required.  That is what the Minister has proposed, and if she brings the information back from this two year pilot study to these Houses, we will have a say.  That is important and appropriate and is what people want to know, namely, that the reports will come back to these Houses when we will know exactly what is happening.  How many hedges will be cut in August?  Will it be everywhere?  I would say less than 5%.  In major grassland areas, there will be no hedge cutting done in August.  That is why it is limited to such a small area.  There are parishes further south from mine which have nothing but dairy cows.  There will be no hedges cut there.  There are parishes near Kinsale where they will be cut because that is where grain is grown.  It is location, location, location.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on this good legislation.</p></speech>
