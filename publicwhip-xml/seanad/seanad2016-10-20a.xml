    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-20a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1398" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102000002#A00500"><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, is most welcome.  I am extremely concerned and, frankly, suspicious about the inordinate delays in the Drogheda boundary review process which was launched last year.  As the Minister of State is aware, the previous Government conceded that the boundary between Drogheda and County Meath needed to be reviewed.  The review was initially announced in June 2015 and the closing date for the receipt of submissions was 22 January 2016.  Despite a nine-month gestation period, as it were, the baby has still not been delivered.  In fact, the silence from the Government on the matter has been deafening.</p><p>The current situation is untenable and if the <i>status quo</i>is allowed to continue, the Drogheda area will pay for it in missed economic opportunities, in particular.  There are approximately 6,500 residents living in a small geographical area straddling the Louth-Meath border.  Residents of large housing estates such as Highlands, Millmount Abbey and Grange Rath are supplied with local services by a distant local authority - not just in geographical terms - in Navan rather than one located one mile away on Fair Street in Drogheda.  The areas on the Meath fringe are entirely contiguous with the urban edge of Drogheda, the largest town in the country that does not yet have the status of a city.  In the delivery of sustainable services, sustainable planning principles and good governance, it is high time the situation was regularised. </p><p>Of most concern is the economic impact of this anomaly, particularly in terms of job creation, on the Drogheda area in general.  The Meath fringe of Drogheda houses an IDA Ireland park that neighbours the N1 and is a 20-minute unimpeded drive from Dublin Airport but which has just one single resident, IFS State Street.  There are at least two prospective investments in this, the best, IDA Ireland location in the country that have been held back and may be lost because of a lack of clarity on what the Government will do in the boundary process.  One side of the road is in what was formerly known as the border, midlands and west, BMW, region, but the side of the road which houses the IDA Ireland park is not.  For anyone who states they are interested in job creation, this anomaly needs to be addressed.  For the Drogheda area, not just the town but the general area, to realise its full economic and social potential, the full and real extent of the town of Drogheda, including its environs in County Meath, needs to be officially recognised and formalised.  The extension of the boundary needs to happen.  Citizens, investors and decision makers need this clarity from the boundary commission and the Government sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

In each case the committee was asked to carry out a review of the boundary between the respective local authorities and make recommendations on those boundaries and any consequential matter it considered necessary in the interests of effective local government.  The committees were not established on the basis of specific proposals or plans to alter the boundaries.  The purpose of the committee in each case was to undertake an objective review of the issue and, in the event that there was a recommendation that the boundary be altered, to provide in its report relevant details in that regard and supporting information. </p> <p>The main rationale for undertaking the boundary reviews is that in each case there is a significant overspill of population into another county based on the statistics reported in the 2011 census.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the case of Drogheda, the town has expanded into County Meath, with a population of 5,983 reported as located in the latter at the 2011 census, which equates to nearly 16% of the total town and environs population of 38,578 citizens.  As the Senator noted, that has since increased considerably and the latest census figures will soon be available for 2016.</p><p>The boundary committees were due to submit their reports by the end of March 2016 but these have been delayed due, in part, to the volume of submissions received as part of the public consultation processes, and also in view of the fact the committees considered that further work was required in order to complete the reviews.  Accordingly, the reviews are continuing, with an anticipated date for submission of the committees&rsquo; reports being within the next few weeks.  As the committees are, by law, independent in the performance of their functions, it is not appropriate to comment further on the matter in advance of their reports.  Needless to say, careful consideration will be given to the committee reports when they are submitted.</p><p>As members will be aware, the Government programme provides that, by mid-2017, a report will be prepared for the Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  It is envisaged that any matters arising from the boundary committee reports will be addressed in the context of the preparation of that report.</p></speech>

However, I look forward to reading the recommendations of the group when the report is published.  I hope we will have a debate before the Minister makes a decision in regard to that process.  I would like to establish when the Minister will publish the recommendations and when, ultimately, a decision will be taken.</p> <p>There is a degree of suspicion around the reasons for the delay.  I totally accept the independence of the commission and, as I said, I look forward to its report, but there is a compelling case for the extension of the borough boundary of Drogheda.  Ultimately, of course, this will come down to a political decision by Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance.  I hope I am wrong but I suspect the outcome might lead us through a process where we will be helped to a very large serving of fudge because the Government is not capable of making decisions that might even be mildly controversial.  In fact, I am suspicious that we might be in the process of seeing these reports buried.</p> <p>Since the process started, we have been subjected to the nonsense of county flag-waving by those who are opposed to the extension of this boundary.  This nonsense should be dispensed with by anyone who is serious about sustainable planning, good planning, good local governance and job creation.  Through the regional Action Plan for Jobs process, for example, we are in the process of establishing the Drogheda-M1 corridor area as a digital payments centre for this country, with some success, and we are competing for global investment.  We all know that investors look at areas on the basis of the critical mass of the region and not necessarily where arbitrary lines are drawn.</p> <p>Towards the end of last year, the then Government announced the review of the national spatial strategy, which we all know was a nakedly political document which bore no relationship to the reality of good planning on the ground or proper sustainable development.  Criminally, the Drogheda area was entirely left out of the national spatial strategy despite being the fifth largest contiguous urban area in the country.  It is important, before this process gains momentum in regard to the review of the national spatial strategy and the development of a new national planning framework, that the boundary of Drogheda is reviewed and regularised to reflect the reality of the situation on the ground.</p></speech>

I will certainly convey that to the Minister.  I also note the Senator's suspicions, although I perhaps do not agree with them, and I will inform the Minister of these.  I will ask that a debate take place before a decision is made on foot of the receipt by the Minister of the independent review in regard to the boundaries in Drogheda and the other areas listed.</p> <p>The Senator commented on the inability to make tough decisions.  As he knows, we now have consensus politics within the Oireachtas.  We have a minority Government and no decisions can be made without the agreement of the Oireachtas.  If legislation has to be enacted in regard to this or any other decision, that has to be agreed by consensus.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Senator's heartfelt views in regard to what is best for Drogheda.  I have some experience of this, given a report was published recently in regard to the amalgamation of Galway city and county, and I was surprised to see some councillors rejecting the report even though they could not possibly have read it - they were out of the traps quicker than an e-mail could be sent.  I am sure they have their own heartfelt views as well.  I will certainly convey Senator Nash's views to the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102000002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to the House.  This is an issue I have raised before with another Minister of State in the Department and it has not changed.  From the outset, I would like to put on record that, when we are dealing with children and the most vulnerable in society, it is vital that the highest level of protection and vetting is afforded.  However, that does not excuse the fact the current system is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>When I brought this up before the summer recess with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, he assured me the waiting time for Garda vetting was down to just five weeks.  I have had dozens of cases brought to the attention of my office where it is clearly well beyond five weeks.  A number of applications that were made in August still have not been dealt with and it is now late October, and I know of two applications that took at least three months to go through.</p> <p>Where I find there is a lot of confusion is in regard to the requirement for multiple and duplicate vetting.  For example, if someone is already Garda vetted to, for example, coach under-15s rugby in a secondary school, the same person needs to be vetted again to coach under-15s rugby in a different school or club.  We are constantly hearing from people who require multiple vetting.  There is a sports provision company that works in secondary schools.  It has ten coaches on the books who go to schools all across Ireland but they need to be vetted for every single school.  Instead of being vetted once, the company has to get the same individual, with the same background, vetted ten times for the same activity.</p> <p>This is leading to inordinate delays and leading to businesses not being able to get the right people in place.  It is putting huge pressure on parents who are not sure that these services can be provided.  A further problem is that these businesses are not able to take on anyone for work experience or training because of the various requirements.  They know that if they were to take on a person for, say, a two-month placement, it would take at least two months to get the person vetted, so they would not go through with it.  Another area is in the provision of pre-school care, where to get a substitute teacher for a cr&egrave;che or Montessori school at very short notice, the teacher has to be vetted not just to teach the activity to the age group but be vetted for the school in question.  This is unlike the position with secondary and primary schools, where there is a central database.</p> <p>The issue is very topical at the moment, given the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has rightly said in the past two weeks that, for the ASTI's upcoming industrial action, he will look to bring in parents and people from the school community to cover playground supervision and others duties that are being withdrawn separate to the actual strike days.  When I did my leaving certificate many years ago, the ASTI only went on strike for five days officially but it worked to rule for an additional 11 days, so those in my school missed 16 full days because we were unable to bring in parents or other staff to do the supervision.  This industrial action is due to start next month and there is no way that parents will be vetted in time to do this, even though the vast majority of those who might be willing to volunteer their time are already vetted for other activities, often in the school, be it coaching rugby or soccer, looking after drama clubs, debating and so on.</p> <p>I believe there is an unnecessary amount of bureaucracy and duplication for a process that, while important, could be simplified and improved.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-20a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102000002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Richmond for raising this issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</p> <p>The primary purpose of the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  While every effort is made to make the system as efficient as possible, as is always desirable, it cannot be at the expense of this core function.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda vetting unit for each new vetting application received, to ensure the most recent data available are taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p><p>Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up to date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also protects against the risk of fraud or forgery.  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant, for example, persons involved in voluntary work with more than one organisation at the same time.  Similar arrangements can arise in the health and education sectors.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is, however, pleased to inform the Senator that 80% of vetting applications are now being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days through a system that reflects best practice internationally.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting transferability becomes something of a moot point.  This vast improvement on the turnaround times of 14 weeks in 2013 comes about primarily as a result of significant investment by the Government in the National Vetting Bureau, in particular, the launch in April this year of the bureau&rsquo;s new e-vetting system.  All organisations are encouraged to avail of this service and 85% of organisations registered for vetting already use it.</p><p>Some cases will of their nature take longer than the average to complete.  Vetting applications that continue to be submitted in the old paper format take four weeks from the receipt of the application, and there will always be certain cases whose natures demand more extensive inquiry.  Delays can also occur in the application process which are outside of the control of the bureau.  In that regard, one very welcome feature of the e-vetting system is that it allows applicants to track the progress of their applications.  The Garda authorities will continue to work with all organisations to bring them into the e-vetting procedure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-20a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed response.  Some of its elements were reassuring, but I must take issue with other elements of the reply.  If it were the case the procedure takes five working days I would not have tabled this Commencement matter.  I would not receive so many phone calls from service providers, schools or sports clubs.  Does this mean five working days is spent on vetting?  What is the all-in process time, from the moment the application is made until the vetting is granted?  There is absolutely no way it is being processed in five working days.  The figure from 2013 of 14 weeks is a far more accurate reflection of the queries I receive, which are from people using the e-vetting system.  I also take issue with the fact paper applications supposedly take four weeks.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, will the Minister of State see whether the T&aacute;naiste will come back to me to detail this process and see where it could be ironed out?  If the five working days information is accurate, and I query it, there is absolutely no reason for transferability, and I agree with the Minister of State on this, but I remain convinced it is not accurate.  We have people in positions, be it teaching in schools, coaching or working with children in various clubs or associations, who are active and the vetting is being put into practice, but they cannot transfer to another body.  This is an area where we could remove an element of duplicity, particularly in real-time.  I am not speaking about someone who was vetted four or five years ago, but someone who was vetted several weeks ago and is still working in a school or club setting.  It is ideal that their vetting should be able to be transferred to another body.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-20a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102000002#C00300"><p>The T&aacute;naiste would like me to emphasise that the purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, given the importance of this service, the T&aacute;naiste does not consider that processing times of five days are at all unreasonable, although I will ask her to come back to the Senator to show the veracity of this.  I accept that not many people processed within five days will come to the Senator to thank him for this.  He will only hear from those who suffer inordinate delays in processing.  This is not the same for everybody.</p> <p>E-vetting has contributed significantly to improving the vetting service, and the Government and the Garda authorities are committed to sustaining this level of service going forward.  Most organisations are now signed up to e-vetting, and there are great benefits to this for them and vetting applicants.  As I stated, individuals can track their own applications on the system.  The Garda vetting bureau works with the registered organisations on an ongoing basis to maintain quality and standards in respect of the process.  The Garda authorities continue to work also with the other registered organisations to bring them on board.</p> <p>I take on board and will convey to the T&aacute;naiste the Senator's concerns about ongoing delays and the veracity of the figures quoted regarding processing times.  What the Senator is speaking about makes sense with regard to transferability where there are delays.  I will ask the T&aacute;naiste to come back to verify the five working days as reported by the National Vetting Bureau.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is very welcome and I thank him for his attendance here this morning.  I welcome the fact the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has agreed to defer indefinitely its decision to cease trout production at its hatcheries in Mullingar and Roscrea.  The decision came as a result of massive opposition from anglers throughout the country and I compliment them on their campaign.  We need a firm commitment to provide the resources necessary to guarantee the long-term future and viability of these hatcheries.</p> <p>IFI infrastructure has been fractured by continuous downgrading.  At one point it had almost 500 staff members, but today this has been reduced to 294.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  Tourism angling is worth an estimated &euro;750 million to our national economy.  It is also estimated that angling is responsible for supporting 11,250 jobs in the country.  Cavan and Monaghan have 12 angling clubs with almost 3,000 members.  It is estimated this group is responsible for generating &euro;3.4 million to the local economy in cross-Border fishing trips.</p> <p>When we consider &euro;800 million each year is allocated to our economy from the angling industry and the fact it supports more than 11,000 jobs, any reasonable person would have to conclude it surely is time the issue was taken seriously and the necessary funding was put in place.  I call on the Minister of State and other Ministers with responsibility for tourism and rural affairs to recognise the value of angling to the State and provide the necessary funding to secure its long-term viability.</p></speech>

He raised it previously in the Seanad but unfortunately I was not in a position to attend that day and I apologise.  I am taking this matter on my own behalf, for a change.</p> <p>The value of angling in Ireland is already well recognised, and a number of developments have been recently progressed in this regard.  The most comprehensive study of angling activity in Ireland, commissioned by Inland Fisheries Ireland, was carried out in 2013 by Tourism Development International.  This study and subsequent updates demonstrate that the angling sector contributes &euro;836 million to the Irish economy every year and supports more than 11,000 Irish jobs, often in rural communities where alternative income earning and employment opportunities are not readily available.  In 2015, Ireland attracted 163,000 overseas visitors who participated in angling, with a further 273,000 domestic anglers in the country.</p> <p>Following on from the study, IFI has set out its national strategy for angling development.  This is the first comprehensive national framework for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s angling resource.  It aims to increase the economic contribution of angling from &euro;836 million to &euro;932 million annually and to increase the number of jobs to more than 12,800 from a current base of some 11,000.  The strategy is intended to deliver a wide-ranging set of investments, innovations and promotions over the coming years.  This is to ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected and enhanced for their economic value and their recreational benefit to the communities and visitors they serve across Ireland.  Effective and sustainable implementation of the strategy will ensure stability of existing jobs and businesses reliant on angling and the creation of new jobs as the economic impact of angling grows.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The strategy will ensure that our inland fisheries resource is protected and conserved in an environmentally sustainable manner for future generations to enjoy.  Fundamentally, this strategy will strive to make angling an accessible and attractive pursuit for all and is the foremost statement of intent for the future of Ireland&rsquo;s angling resource since the establishment of lFl in 2010.</p><p>The NSAD aims to develop our angling resource sustainably through balancing the economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects of any development in line with IFI&rsquo;s responsibilities for the protection, management, conservation and development of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  IFI has embarked on its efforts to secure funding to underpin the strategy.  My Department has earmarked &euro;1.3 million for capital elements of the NSAD.  An additional allocation of capital funding was made to IFI in last week's budget and some of this may be used for capital elements of the strategy.  IFI also recently secured funding of &euro;536,886 from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to develop key angling projects in rural areas as part of the Government's programme to support rural development.  The package will deliver projects in counties Westmeath, Leitrim, Mayo, Tipperary, Roscommon, Galway, Donegal and Longford.  It will invest in projects such as river bank restoration, a fishery recreation hub, access for coarse angling and fishing points which will allow for international match events and upgrade of existing facilities for anglers with a disability and attractive, accessible lakeside and river bank walks.</p><p>As part of the development strategy, IFI has also established a new fund to support projects that will contribute to the delivery of an accessible and sustainable, world class inland fisheries resource.  This capital works fund was announced earlier this week and is aimed at capital improvement works with grants available to all groups and individuals, including local development associations, Tidy Towns groups, angling clubs and others looking to improve access to angling.  The strategy is an overarching policy initiative concentrating on the economic development of the entire angling sector.  Economic research conducted as part of the strategy identified key strands of angling activity with the most potential for development to benefit local and peripheral communities.  These include coarse angling, pike angling, bass and sea angling in Ireland, wild salmon and sea trout and wild brown trout.</p><p>On the separate issue of farmed trout raised by the Senator, proposals regarding the fish farm operations of lFl are a day-to-day operational matter for its board but it I have paid attention to it over the past number of months.  My Department had indicated to IFI the need for consultation with affected stakeholders prior to any action.  I visited the fish farms to view operations in Roscrea and Cullion, and I met with members of the board of IFI and the chief executive officer to discuss the concerns of both IFI and the trout angling community.  The board has deferred indefinitely its proposal to exit trout production.  I am advised by IFI that the board also met a delegation from the main trout angling representative bodies to discuss lFl's proposals in this regard.  All parties recognised that there are significant economic, environmental and biological issues surrounding the current production facilities which need to be addressed.  I am assured by IFI that the board is committed to developing a comprehensive strategy to meet current and future trout production needs, subject to securing any investment required.  All parties have agreed to continue to work closely together to deliver this strategy.  I am conscious of the concerns about continuity of a supply of fish for lakes around the country and I have asked IFl to advise me of the outcomes of ongoing discussions with the angling representatives.  However, the appropriate course of action is to await these outcomes, including whether suggested production, management and funding models may emerge, rather than pre-empt the discussions with stakeholders.</p></speech>

I outlined previously the benefits to our economy both from an employment perspective and an income generation perspective.  I very much welcome the ongoing discussions between the various parties.  Is there a timescale for those negotiations?  When will we be informed of the outcome?</p></speech>

Action has been taken and there has been lobbying by anglers and politicians.  I acknowledge the reversal of the board's decision during the summer.  Plans are being developed and I cannot say whether the Department will invest in projects until they come before me for approval.  The board of IFI has to make decisions regarding what it wants to do with the investment.  The facility in Cullion is under lease while the facility in Roscrea is owned.  While both facilities are currently doing what they were designed for, they are antiquated and in need of investment.  The board will have to come back with proposals in this regard.  It is engaging on this but there are environmental issues.  For example, the availability of a water supply is a particular issue on the Roscrea site.  All these issues have to be examined before a decision is made.  When a proposal is brought to me or whomever succeeds me, that will be dealt with and I am sure it will be looked on favourably because the Government recognises the importance of the resource, particularly to lakes in the midlands.  We need to ensure continuity in the fish supply.  There are also tourism and social benefits.  IFI has done a great deal of work on getting children involved in angling as a recreational activity and a sport.  There needs to be continuity of supply for that to continue and I have highlighted that at all times to the board of IFI.  That is, thankfully, why IFI indefinitely postponed the decision that had been made.  When a proposal is brought to me for investment, I will bring that to the Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I will continue to engage with the board and the chief executive officer of IFI regarding its plans.  I commend the Senator on his interest in this matter and I will continue to engage with all relevant parties to ensure a resolution to the concerns of anglers and to achieve a full and solution to ensure continuity in the supply of fish.</p></speech>

Carlow ambulance service comprises 18 staff - four women and 14 men.  They are based in a prefab with no hot water, a leaking roof and in a sewage problem.  The store for their medication is located in a different building and it is not ideal having to go to a different building on winter evenings, which puts them in a vulnerable position.  Last week, a health and safety audit carried out on the prefab and it was condemned and deemed unfit for purpose.  As of next Monday, 24 October, the 18 staff will pick up their keys and kit and will work out of Kilkenny on their 12-hour shift, which means there will be no ambulance service in Carlow.  This is uncalled for and the 18 staff will have to travel from Carlow to the depot in Kilkenny and back.  If accidents happen and an ambulance is needed, no service will be available in Carlow.</p> <p>The building is not fit for purpose.  Despite 18 trained paramedics raising concerns and issues over a number of years about health and safety in the prefab, they have to move to Kilkenny because the HSE has not listened to them.  I have a major issue with that.  These staff have been complaining for years.  Who is accountable?  Is it the HSE or the Minister?  The most recent audit also highlights that issues were raised regarding staff numbers because the service is under staffed.  There is ongoing health and safety training yet the staff are expected to work from a condemned building.  As a matter of urgency, the staff need to be relocated in Carlow in a suitable alternative building.  It is unacceptable that funding should be an issue, as taxpayers are paying for this service.  It is not being delivered, leaving the people of Carlow and the surrounding area in a vulnerable position.</p> <p>I have met the staff and there is no need for this.  These trained and qualified professionals have to leave this prefab in Carlow because it is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, who cannot be present.  The National Ambulance Service, NAS, has confirmed that following a health and safety audit, an issue was identified in respect of the shower and changing facilities used by staff at Carlow ambulance station.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Works are planned to rectify the issue which is being treated as a priority by the NAS.  I am advised that the station remains fully operational.</p><p>The NAS has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years, during which a number of significant service innovations and developments have taken place.  They include the establishment of the national emergency operations centre; the delivery of improved technology to improve response times; the development of an intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, thereby freeing more emergency ambulances for more urgent calls; and the establishment of a permanent emergency aeromedical support service to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for high acuity patients in remote rural areas where access by land ambulances may be difficult.</p><p>We are also examining alternatives to the current care model which requires every patient to be brought to an emergency department.  They include providing clinical advice over the telephone for callers and referring them to other care pathways, as appropriate, and transporting patients to a wider range of care destinations such as a local or minor injuries unit or medical assessment units.</p><p>The reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the Health Information and Quality Authority's review of ambulance services which was published in 2014 and the NAS capacity review which was published earlier this year.  The capacity review which was undertaken by Lightfoot Solutions, a UK based consultancy firm, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  The review found that the NAS was presented with a major challenge compared to ambulance services elsewhere, as population density in Ireland was significantly different from that in many other countries.  Outside the greater Dublin area, the population is widely dispersed, with a relatively large population living in rural areas.  This means that response time targets are much more difficult to achieve owing to longer driving distances.</p><p>The report endorses the existing policy of dynamic deployment, whereby vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than statically deployed, which means being located at a particular station.  Implementation of the recommendations made in the capacity review will require a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  In that regard, I assure the Deputy that increased funding will be available to the NAS in 2017.  The detail of the improvements to be funded will be provided in the HSE's 2017 national service plan.  In the coming weeks my officials will work closely with their counterparts in the HSE and the NAS to agree priorities for the 2017 allocation.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable in 2016 that 18 staff members are working in a facility with a leaking roof, no access to hot water and a sewage problem.  Taxpayers are not being provided with the service for which they are paying, which is unfair on the employees and people living in Carlow.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister to visit the facility which is too small for 18 staff working 12-hour shifts.  Will the Minister of State provide a timeframe for completion of the works?  Staff can no longer work in the current conditions and will move to another depot in Kilkenny.  Relocation to a new or another building in the Carlow area should be considered.  The medication required by staff is not located in the prefabricated building, which means that during winter months they must go to a different area to obtain medication, leaving them unsafe and vulnerable.  I want another audit to be carried out.  I accept that the Minister of State may have first been notified of the issue this morning, but it is an urgent matter which I will raise every week until I get answers.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with it.</p></speech>

As I stated, the Health Service Executive will prioritise the allocation of a building for the service.  I will also raise the matter with the Minister when I meet him later and outline the Senator's concerns about staff having to use a building that is in such poor condition.  I will urge the Minister to give the HSE a timescale for rectifying the problem.  That is the only commitment I can give.</p></speech>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Statement of Strategy 2015-2017 refers to strengthening our influence in the EU, to the United Nations and so on but makes no mention of Irish neutrality, which is worrying in the context of the EU's relentless progress towards militarisation.  The President of the EU Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, has spoken about the need to move towards common military assets, which is about people making money from the sale of hardware.  That the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade statement of strategy neglects to mention our stated position on neutrality reflects badly on the Government.  There is no point talking about it, it must be stated in black and white.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, was unable to explain why the departmental officials had not included reference to our stated position on neutrality in that strategy.  The reply I received when I raised the matter at the committee was that the statement of strategy is not solely a policy document but an articulation of how we intend to implement our programme, which is straight out of the top drawer of Sir Humphrey's manual on how to reply to a question without actually giving a reply.</p> <p>We have spoken at length in this House on the issue of Brexit.  I understand the issue is being discussed in Europe this week.  The stance we have taken on this issue is in no way as aggressive as that of other EU countries, such as France, in terms of the manner in which they are pursuing businesses based in London or throughout the EU that are uncertain of their future because of Brexit.  EU institutions based in England are also being pursued by other European countries.  We need a strategy that will enable us to pursue EU institutions and businesses located in England in the same manner as other EU countries.  </p> <p>On my original point regarding Irish neutrality not being mentioned as a core principle in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Statement of Strategy 2015-2017, members of the Fine Gael Party also expressed disappointment at the lack of reference in that regard in the Department's strategy. </p></speech>

I recall making the statement at the time that if the EU moves to do that another country, namely, Ireland, will be exiting Europe.</p> <p>I am calling on the Leader today to discuss with the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform the major industrial relations collapse into which we appear to be steam-rolling.  Currently, the ASTI, GRA, AGSI, INMO and the IMO are in difficulty with respect to the Lansdowne Road agreement, whether inside or outside it.  I have sat around the table of executive committees in unions.  Unless something is done the Government runs the risk of the Lansdowne Road agreement collapsing.  I agree with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and all of the Ministers who have publicly stated that the only show in town is the Lansdowne Road agreement.  If side-deals are done to halt industrial action, they will lead to the leapfrog syndrome creeping into industrial relations and everybody looking for more.</p> <p>We must re-open the Lansdowne Road agreement, and we have only three weeks within which to do so, if we want to put this industrial unrest to bed.  To be fair, the Leader's party, bears the responsibility for overheating expectations within the economy during the election campaign.  The peace and harmony in industrial relations has been stalled, with some of the main unions in this country having stepped outside the industrial relations process.  Unless we get these unions back into the tent not only will they leave the process but so, too, will other unions.  That is my prediction.</p> <p>I am asking that the Leader engage with Ministers on the need to get all of the unions back into the process.  There is no need to be afraid.  Trade unions in this country have shown in the past that they are pragmatic and capable of doing a deal.  It strikes me that members of the Fine Gael Party are not really labour people.  They are not people who understand public service workers.  Perhaps Fine Gael should engage with the Labour Party which helped it so much in the last Government-----</p></speech>

It shows what this Chamber is capable of, and the fact that we could all negotiate successfully to agree on such an important issue shows that this House can at times be a very effective unified force for doing the right thing.  I will therefore bring up Shannon Airport again.  It is the elephant in the room, I am afraid, because we know what is going on at Shannon Airport.  I can read the House reports from this week alone on the aircraft, including commercial aircraft, that have come and gone.  We know that they are carrying troops and ammunitions.  We know that this week the troops had to stay over in Clare because there was a problem with the aeroplane.  I do not make this point in a party-political manner, I just want us to be honest with ourselves.  How can we on the one hand quite rightly demand peace in Syria while on the other turn a blind eye to the use of our civilian airport in Shannon to carry troops, munitions and weapons being used in the wars in Syria, Yemen and Iraq?  In all honesty, how can the excellent motion on Syria have real standing when the world can see that we are turning a blind eye to what is continuing to happen at Shannon Airport?</p> <p>I am delighted to hear Senator Mark Daly raise the issue of neutrality but I have not heard him say anything about Shannon Airport.  There was a time when Niall Andrews and other good people such as Dan Breen in Fianna F&aacute;il were prepared to stand up for our neutrality, not just talk about it.  However, there is now a gross hypocrisy - those are the only words I can use - in this regard because we all know what is going on in Shannon and we all know that we are turning a blind eye to the transport through Shannon Airport of military troops, weaponry and munitions that were used to blow up women and children in Yemen last Saturday, which continues to happen.  I therefore ask the Leader whether we could have another look at this issue.  I ask that we be very serious about this and not decide we are only in favour of peace when it suits us.</p></speech>

First, I congratulate the Union of Students in Ireland for having got more than 10,000 people out on the streets yesterday in the fight for both free education and access to education and to show students' distaste at the possibility of third-level loans.  I know the education committee is due to discuss the Cassells report, but something must be done in the interim.  We need to go back to the Minister for Education and consider the bureaucracy in the likes of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  I get very distressed e-mails from mature students.  I have one this morning from a nurse about to quit her third year.  It will be a loss to this country to lose nurses due to the bureaucracy in the likes of SUSI, which is set up by the State to provide access to students who need it.  SUSI insists every year on treating this nurse as not being a dependant of her mother, with whom she has not lived for years, but she has always looked after herself and lives on her own.  It is a real shame that we cannot set up a system whereby we can give those most vulnerable students the access they need.  I also have a handwritten letter from a young child, who is quite distressed, in fourth year.  It is a shame that the emotional well-being of someone so young is being affected because he is so worried about how he will access third-level education three years from the time at which he is even due to consider it.  We should therefore come together and support the likes of the students who were outside the House yesterday seeking reform in the education system.</p> <p>I also read this morning a very exciting article which I showed to Senator Mark Daly about Deputy Jack Chambers, who has circulated a policy seeking to relax the criminalisation of drug addicts.  I hope the other Fianna F&aacute;ilers in the room will take some heed of the younger people in the party when the Bill with this aim which Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I are to introduce comes before the House.</p></speech>

I could not believe what I was reading, that a Fine Gael Minister of State would suggest widening the huge deprivation and inequality already present in the area and make it even more observable than it already is.  It is hard enough for children growing up around there to look at an IFSC and know they will never be employed there, work there or be part of it without a Minister of State suggesting the placing of a school there that would segregate any people coming to live or work here from abroad from the ordinary citizens of the north inner city.</p></speech>

I thank the movement personally because its members worked very closely with me in developing the micro-credit scheme.  I hope the eventual outcome of the scheme will be the closing down of what I call the legal money lenders, who charge up to 130% interest rates to many people in deprived areas who cannot access money elsewhere.  The credit union movement played a key role in rolling out the micro-credit scheme, which is worth &euro;100 million as an anti-poverty strategy, so it has been successful and I hope it grows from success to success.</p><p>Very often I have used the floor of the Seanad to criticise the new politics and ask what it is.  However, reading Fiach Kelly's article in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning  in which the Minister for Finance is quoted as saying he will now adjust the help-to-buy plan, it is positive when a Government can see it has made a mistake and then start making adjustments.  However, several more adjustments need to be made to the help-to-buy scheme.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, wanted to attract people coming back to Ireland.  Many people I know who emigrated want to come back to Ireland but will not be able to compete with other families buying houses.  They will be disadvantaged because they will not be able to get the tax benefits due to their having to work abroad for many years.</p><p>The other element of the budget I ask the Leader to consider is the lack of any measures to benefit renters.  There have been tax cuts for landlords and an increase in the threshold for the rent-a-room scheme but absolutely nothing for people who are in rental accommodation.</p></speech>

They are hugely disadvantaged.</p> <p>I welcome wholeheartedly the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding Airbnb.  Senator Denis Landy and I have highlighted this issue in this House over and over again.  We have a housing crisis in the country and in this city in particular.  Some 2,000 apartments and homes have moved to Airbnb.  The decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la means that the owners of these properties will have to get planning permission to rent their properties through Airbnb.  Think of the impact if we were to bring in regulation to control Airbnb and if we could put 2,000 units back into the rental market for people with families to rent.  This has been the single biggest impact on the rental market in the Dublin area and also in the Cork and Galway areas regarding the housing shortage.  The Minister may bring in new initiatives, but we are still leaking units at the other end.  If we could bring those 2,000 units back into the long-term rental market, it would have a significant impact on housing.</p> <p>With regard to the debate on new politics, it is positive if Ministers listen and adjust and change, but there is an issue regarding Cabinet collective responsibility which I have raised before in this House.  I feel very strongly about repeal of the eighth amendment and believe it should be repealed.  However, a Cabinet decision has been made by all members of the Cabinet for the Government to go down a particular line, that is, the Citizens' Assembly, which sat last Sunday.  Now we hear talk of Cabinet members seeking a free vote.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Should we abandon collective Cabinet responsibility so easily and without a proper debate and discussion?

It follows from the proposed Garda strikes which are to take place every Friday in the month of November.  I ask the Leader to talk to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to find out what plans he is going to put in place in terms of the immigration unit which staffs many airports.  There is a fear that if there is no one there to run things, passengers may be affected.  Will airports be able to open?  It is an issue that affects all airports as a result of the threatened strike.</p></speech>

In his budget proposals, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, got his lines badly wrong as I suggested at the time.  He is now reconsidering and redrawing his plan for a tax rebate for first-time buyers.  He is on shifting ground.  After meeting the Minister this morning, the IPAV released an in-depth survey of the housing market.  There are two figures which jumped out at me.  The first is that over 92% of homes in the State are second-hand homes.  It is not a shocking statistic in that there are not too many new homes being built.  The second figure is that 90% of house-sale completions for first-time buyers are in the &euro;100,000 to &euro;350,000 range.  The budgetary instruments are devised to stimulate the building industry, but they are ill-judged and will only end in failure.  One more year will be wasted in terms of house-building and house starts.</p> <p>The core problem is the cost of building.  As has been outlined many times, the cost of building has increased by 50% over the last number of years due to regulation, new engineering requirements, dezoning and a plethora of other reasons.  All new homes must be A-rated, which is a great jump forward in the standard of homes we are going to produce, but the cost of it has been passed directly to the builder.  There is no extra benefit for the builder in relation to that requirement.  Until we tackle the core cost of building with a lower VAT rate, this problem is not going to disappear.  If the Minister introduced a lower VAT rate, it would certainly be tax efficient.  The reduced VAT rate in the hotel industry has led to a tourism boom.  A reduced tax rate of 9% on goods and services on homes being built would immediately address our housing crisis, boost the State's tax coffers and increase employment.  This is going to be the answer.  We will have to look at it.  We are tinkering around and failing to increase supply.  The core issue is the cost of building.</p></speech>

Today is international credit union day and many of our colleagues were in the Davenport Hotel from 8 a.m. this morning for a presentation.  The credit union movement in Ireland is a North-South one.  Most of the credit unions in Northern Ireland are accredited to the Irish League of Credit Unions, which is a really important point.  What do the credit unions want to do?  What did they say to us this morning?  They asked us to come back to the Chamber to talk to both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  The credit unions say there is a commitment in the confidence and supply agreement between the two parties to develop a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector.  Some might smile and ask what that is about when the State owns approximately 95% of AIB.  Clearly, the State wants to see AIB boosted because the Government intends at some point to sell part of it.  As such, some will ask why it would assist credit unions at this juncture.</p> <p>It is timely for us to support credit unions.  They have given everyone a pack setting out ten simple objectives and commitments, some of which appear in the programme for Government.  In fact, some of them were to have been implemented within the first 100 days of the action plan for Government but none has been achieved thus far.  We should all try to get the pack or go on the website to see what is in it and support Irish credit union movement.</p></speech>

It was a great debate with a high level of participation and a great discussion.  I ask the Leader now for a focused, stand-alone debate on the following aspects of education.  The first involves those young people who leave school prematurely.  While the number of such young people has fallen in recent times, there continues to be a significant cohort who leave prematurely.  We need to discuss the factors at work there and the remedies we could put in place to reduce the risk of early school-leaving and keep them in school.</p> <p>A closely related matter involves the large cohort of young people for whom the academic option is not the best one.  We need to look at the German model of apprenticeship.  While it has some academic input, it is mainly an apprenticeship model.  We must look at the entire range of apprenticeships.  I notice now that more of the traditional apprenticeships are returning, including in areas like insurance.</p> <p>I ask that the relevant Minister attends the House to consider why people leave school early, what strategies we can put in place to cope with that and, in respect of those who remain, how we can make school and lifelong learning more attractive.  There is a lacuna there which we need to address, including by way of a specific debate in the House.</p></speech>

One in Four provides group treatment programmes to sexual abuse victims and offenders.  Its treatment programmes also cover families, including wives, husbands, partners and parents.  The treatment programmes are evidence-based and they work.  Most importantly, these treatment programmes protect our children.</p> <p>I raise this issue to help us all to continue to protect our children.  The vast majority of sexual abuse happens within families.  Most offenders will never face a criminal trial as the victims rarely report the crimes, which are kept secret within families.  Extremely worrying is the fact that over 40% of offenders are under the age of 18.  Tonight's edition of "Would You Believe" to be broadcast on RTE 1 is entitled "Beyond Redemption?".  I ask Members to watch the programme and to consider its content and how we can make Ireland safer from the abuses discussed.  We could have a wider discussion and debate in time.</p> <p>I will be discussing this matter as a member of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs to which I hope we can invite Maeve Lewis from One in Four to discuss its annual report.  One in Four is completely overburdened.  It provides counselling to 116 adult survivors of child sexual abuse and 40 families.  It provides almost 3,000 therapy hours and practical information on child protection notifications.  One in Four worked with 38 sex offenders and 19 wives during 2015.  There is now a delay of up to six months for people waiting for an appointment with One in Four.  From my experience as a psychiatric nurse and having dealt with victims and offenders of sexual abuse, I encourage the House to have a wider discussion on this.  I welcome and am grateful for the extremely difficult work One in Four does and, again, encourage Members to view the "Would You Believe?" programme tonight.</p></speech>

The people who use mental health services in Roscommon, their families and the staff must be provided with the facts about the current and future provision of services in the county.  I have listened to a wide range of individuals over the past number of days who are involved in the mental health services in the county.  All these people have been clear and definite in their view that the HSE is implementing a different agenda on the ground to that which it publicly states.  What is clear is that the statements from the HSE and the experiences of people within the mental health services does not match up.  I have spoken at length to the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Helen McEntee, and with the chief officer of community services within that service area.  Both have advised me that there are no active plans to close the various day centres and hostels, namely, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Strokestown, Castlerea and Athleague.  The HSE has also informed me that there are no plans to close the community nursing unit in &Aacute;ras Naomh Chaolain or to relocate residents to private nursing homes.  I have been advised that the HSE is currently consulting residents, family and staff in one setting from which patients are being transferred to a more appropriate setting.  That is an ongoing process at the moment.</p> <p>I want to make it very clear that this information has been provided by the HSE to me in writing.  The difficulty is that there is an obvious difference between what people are saying to me and what the HSE has stated.  I want to know the truth.  I also want the external report into mental health services in County Roscommon to be finalised and made available as quickly as possible.  I expect this report to identify challenges and weaknesses within our services and an action plan to support people and bring about improvement for people who need to use our mental health services and their families.  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, addresses us on this issue as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

School principals around the country are dismayed and concerned that there was no mention of the minor works grant in this year's budget.  For schools, this grant has always been a vital part of school funding.  Its removal a number of years ago has caused difficulties for school management with regard to basic repairs in schools, be it maintenance of the school infrastructure itself or equipment.  The rates applicable typically run such that a school of about 50 pupils, for example, could expect to receive a grant of &euro;6,400, whereas a school with 300 pupils could expect to receive a grant of &euro;11,000.  We all know that the failure to maintain and invest in the upkeep of schools is a false economy.  The old adage of "A stitch in time saves nine" springs to mind.  The grant, as Members know, is spent on the physical infrastructure of the school and items of school equipment, including IT-related equipment.  The money might be needed for general maintenance outside, which could be the replacement of windows, the purchase of PE equipment, as well as the repair or repurpose of equipment such as computers, printers, etc.  It is for all of the basic stuff that keeps our schools going.</p> <p>Principals also state that having certainty about whether the grant is going to be paid is nearly as important as the grant itself, as it allows the board to manage the budget for the various minor works involved throughout the year.  The board of management is, as we all know, made up of volunteers working for nothing on behalf of our community.  We are very lucky to have them and we cherish that.  The very least they deserve is the security of knowing what they are going to get, if anything.  At the end of the day, no funds for schools means extra fund-raising for parents themselves.  That is another form of taxation.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to address the confusion over whether the school grant is going to be paid this year.</p></speech>

We will be taking it straight after the conclusion of the Order of Business without debate.  I thank all colleagues who signed up to that.  Every political party grouping has signed up.  I know Senator Boyhan's name is to be added as well.  Any other Independent colleagues who wish to have their names added should do so.  It is important that the Seanad speaks with one voice on this hugely important humanitarian crisis.  We all share such immense concern and horror at the unfolding events in Syria.  The fact that we see an eight-hour cessation announced by the Syrian Government with its Russian backers is of very little comfort to the besieged population in Aleppo.  We are all conscious that there are other besieged civilian populations across Syria, not just in Aleppo.  We have seen horrific bombardments of medical facilities, aid convoys and civilian populations, with hundreds of people killed this week alone in Aleppo.  I raised this issue at the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, as did other colleagues.  We joined in calls that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should express in the strongest possible terms his condemnation of the Syrian Government's treatment of its people and his condemnation of those who back them, particularly the Russian Government.  I will be communicating directly with the Russian ambassador to let him know that the Seanad has passed this motion.  I ask that the Leader and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to do the same.  I also told the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that this motion was being passed in the Seanad today.</p> <p>Last night, we saw particularly strong language from the French and German leaders, Mr. Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande and Ms Angela Merkel, against Russia, speaking of war crimes having been committed in Aleppo.  At the EU Council meeting this afternoon, it is likely that further sanctions against Russia will be on the agenda given this very strong language and the ratcheting up of pressure on Russia that we have seen from France and Germany, in particular.  I hope that we will see the Government support that.  I put that to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at the committee meeting this morning.  A number of us also asked the Minister that Ireland take a position in voting against Russian inclusion on the UN Human Rights Committee when that comes up.  We are awaiting a response on that.</p> <p>Finally, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House on migration and Ireland's response to the Syria crisis in terms of our reception of Syrian refugees.  It has been very slow to date.  Again, that is a matter we raised at the committee this morning.  The Minister acknowledged that while the resettlement targets are being met in the resettlement of Syrian refugees coming through Lebanon, we have seen real delays in the process of welcoming refugees here from Greece and particularly from Italy.  There have been, as the Minister accepted, bureaucratic delays and, therefore, the relocation programme has effectively been stalled.  We are nowhere near the admittance of the 4,000 refugees we committed to welcoming here.  I ask the Leader for a debate on that with, more appropriately, the Minister for Justice and Equality in early course in this House.</p></speech>

I raise in particular the funding for housing for these ex-servicemen.  A fuchsia appeal was launched in July, which is a charity.  I do not believe that ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen that have served their country so proudly should have to rely on charity when they fall on hard times.  ONE has several houses around the country.  One of them is in my own hometown of Athlone and others are in Dublin, Letterkenny and Limerick.  There are also several different drop-in centres, all of which are funded by charity, although I do not think that is good enough.  Single men, in particular, are falling through the cracks when they leave the Army, although not just the Army, and find themselves in a situation where they need support.  All the ONE fund-raisers are volunteers.  I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and ask him to address this issue within his housing strategy and the budget.  These houses receive nothing from the Government or from their county councils.  I think the house in Dublin receives some money from a Dublin county council but that is as much as it is.  I urge that this is raised with the Minister.  It is not good enough for ex-servicemen who have served their country.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come to the House to discuss the issue of regional and rural development.</p><p>The final issue I wish to raise is the new home grants or tax rebate scheme.  I remember on the day it was announced mentioning that the 80% loan-to-value ratio would incentivise people to take on debt.  Now we see in the media today a report that it is being tinkered with and may be reduced to 70%.  The scheme is incentivising individuals to take on debt in purchasing a home, which is wrong.  Is it possible for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to come to the House to discuss the scheme?  In parallel, he might discuss the Government&rsquo;s social housing allocations for local authorities.  Both issues are relevant and it would be of benefit if the Minister discussed the home grants scheme before the debate takes place in the House on the relevant legislation which I presume will be introduced later in the year.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that the situation impacted on the homeless crisis in Dublin.  The Government&rsquo;s rent-a-room scheme and the increased provision of apartments might help to ease the problem.  However, there is an issue which I raised some months ago in terms of how Airbnb was helping to resolve the crisis arising from the lack of hotel bedrooms in Dublin city centre.  I understand more than 3,300 rooms in Dublin are being used for the purposes of Airbnb which I have used when I have travelled to attend meetings in London or elsewhere in the country.  In effect, one can obtain good value in renting a room at a time when one cannot find a hotel room for less than &euro;200.  The same is happening in Dublin.  Because of the shortage of hotel rooms, effectively hoteliers are trying to fleece many tourists, as well as Irish people who come from rural areas and simply cannot find a hotel room.  We need to examine the issues of homelessness and the lack of accommodation, but we must also consider the problem overall.  I would, therefore, like the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to come the House but also the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for a debate on how we can get things right.  I welcome the decision, but it may result in a shortfall of 3,300 beds that will impact on the viability of the tourism industry in the city centre, in particular.</p></speech>

Their message was loud and clear - they do not want to see student fees being introduced and neither do their parents.  The State and this society cannot afford them.  We have seen the disastrous impact of student loans in every country in which they have been initiated, including the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.  All of these countries have taken on a massive national debt and created mass indebtedness among young people.  Student loans are a surefire way to limit and stifle access to third level education for young people, in the process saddling them with debt earlier in their careers.  I commend the USI and the students who took to the streets in their thousands yesterday.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports their call for a publicly funded education system.  Our pre-budget submission outlined clearly a reduction in the student contribution charge of &euro;500 in 2017.  We seek a statement from the Minister for Education and Skills on the matter.</p></speech>

We all know that the retail sector has changed in rural areas and that many transactions now take place online, but the big issue is planning permission for out-of-town shopping centres and filling stations where parking is free.  Paid parking is killing town centres.  In many cases it is costing local administration to have machines emptied.  Local authorities are talking about privatising the traffic warden service to get rid of that cost.  It costs a lot of money to provide parking meters in town centres, but it is having the effect of killing the retail sector as people can avail of free parking spaces in the bigger shopping centres and at filling stations.  I call on the Minister to outline his plans for town centres.  We have all travelled the country during Seanad election campaigns and have seen the impact of parking charges which are to the detriment of the retail sector.  In certain areas there is tumbleweed in the centre of towns because people are not prepared to pay for the luxury of parking to spend ten or 15 minutes purchasing a few items when they can park for free in out-of-town shopping centres or at filling stations.  This issue must be examined.  Revenue from parking meters has dropped by between 50% and 75% because people are travelling out of town to shop.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that we speak with one voice and send a clear message on this matter, given the significant number of innocent people, especially children, being killed.</p> <p>In talking about the need to speak with one voice I wish to refer again &ndash; I am sorry for doing so &ndash; the ten-year health strategy.  Senator Mark Daly raised the matter yesterday.  My understanding is that Fine Gael was to bring forward a motion this week in the D&aacute;il to allow Senators to become full members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, but I believe both Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in indicated that they would vote against the motion.  I am extremely concerned about this as it is very important to have agreement on a ten-year health strategy.  It indicates to me that the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams, have no confidence in the Senators of the respective parties represented in this House and they consider they have nothing to contribute to the strategy.  That is a terrible indictment of this House and it is regrettable that this is the attitude of the leadership of these parties to Senators who have a contribution to make to the strategy, yet they are being excluded from involvement in the committee that is devising it.  Is this new politics?  Is it about excluding 60 Members of the Oireachtas from the process of dealing with a major policy issue which affects every man, woman and child in the country?  Is it about making sure Senators are not included in a major strategic planning process?  It is appalling that the leaders of the two main Opposition parties are objecting to Senators being included in the committee.  The Leader should write to them to ask them to explain why they have adopted this policy towards Members of this House.  That is not the new politics I want to see and it is not the new politics Senators want to see.  I take extreme exception to the fact that Senators are being excluded from the process.</p></speech>

We wish her well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome my friend Mr. Pavlock from Philadelphia, to the House.  He is a welcome guest.</p><p>I thank the 19 Members who raised many issues.  I will begin with Senator Colm Burke's remarks regarding the future health strategy.  I do so in a spirit of co-operation and cross-party consensus.  It is not good enough that the leaders of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are opposing the appointment or nomination of Members of this House to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It means that we are not good enough and we do not have the expertise.  In the context of retention of the Seanad, they are doing a bad job in promoting the House.  I appeal to both leaders to go back to their respective parties.  It is wrong, it is not good politics and it sends the wrong message.</p><p>To be fair to Senator Daly, he was not party to the decision of his party and I am sure Senator Gavan, the Sinn F&eacute;in Whip and, Senator Devine, the party's health spokesperson, are not complicit in that but it is absolutely appalling that Seanad Members are not being supported to serve on a committee that will set the health policy of our nation for the next decade and beyond.  It is unacceptable and the leaders are speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  If they want reform, political correctness and new politics, then all of us should be included.  Senators Daly and Gavan should go back to their respective parties and make a stand because this is not good enough.  I intend to raise this issue at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the next few weeks.</p><p>Senator Daly raised the issue of neutrality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I did not think our position on neutrality had changed but the Senator made a good point.  The document to which he referred is a statement of strategy, which outlines the goals and objectives the Department intends to pursue to promote the values of our people and to promote the State while advancing our prosperity abroad.  I assume the value to which he referred is neutrality and I hope that will not change.  We should come back to this at a later date and I very much support his call on that.</p><p>On the issue of Brexit and jobs, I mentioned yesterday that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, has been travelling throughout the eurozone to highlight Ireland's importance and to try to attract companies to locate here.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation secured additional resources for her Department in the budget relating to the post-Brexit era.  This funding will provide for an additional 50 staff in the Department and its agencies specifically tasked with assisting companies adjusting to the challenge.  The funding will equally help to secure new business and innovation opportunities and diversification into new markets.  The Government is prepared and it is working on this.  If the Senator has ideas in this regard, I would be happy to convey them to the Minister but he is correct to raise the issue.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of industrial relations.  We are in an uncharted time post-recession.  Expectations are growing and people want more money in their pockets but, at the same time, the Government parties have a limited amount to spend.  On one level, we want increased public services and increases in take home pay but the Government must balance the books not only in fiscal terms but to ensure it gets the mix right between public expenditure and service provision.</p><p>It is important that as Members we invite members of the GRA, AGSI and ASTI to engage in meaningful talks about the issues they have.  This will not be done through megaphone diplomacy on the airwaves of our broadcasters.  It is important that union representatives sit down with officials from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Education and Skills and the respective Ministers to reach a resolution.  The Lansdowne Road agreement, which Deputy Howlin and Senator Humphreys were party to, is a framework within which pay restoration to public servants can be managed and delivered.  All of us recognise the fundamental difficulty garda&iacute; encounter in doing their job and all of us understand the importance of education.  I appeal to all sides to engage in talks.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Shannon Airport yet again.  As he knows quite well, Ireland is not precluded from allowing military aircraft to land or overfly as a neutral country.  There is a UN resolution in this regard and post-9/11, the Government of the day took a decision in conjunction with the UN Security Council to allow for the use of Shannon Airport.  I would be happy to have a debate on this.  Our position has not changed.  The Senator comes in sometimes perhaps trying to get headlines with some of his comments about the airport.</p></speech>

The Cassells report has been published.  There are different viewpoints in it.  What we all aspire to and what we all want is to ensure people have access to affordable education.  The rainbow coalition introduced free third level fees and this cost has increased exponentially over the years.  I am not sure about the remarks by the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, but I think he was referring to the international European school and attracting foreign direct investment into the country post-Brexit.</p> <p>Senators Humphreys and Boyhan mentioned International Credit Union Day.  I join them in congratulating members of the credit union movement on the work they do.  I am a former supervisor in my own credit union in Bishopstown and I am aware it plays an important role in the lives of people.</p> <p>Collective Cabinet responsibility has not changed.  I agree that when the Cabinet makes a decision, it is a collective decision and, therefore, all members of the Cabinet are bound by it, unless they choose to resign.  As regards the eighth amendment, a Citizens' Assembly has been set up and it behoves Oireachtas Members and Ministers to stand by it and allow it to do its work.  Another motion before this House or the D&aacute;il relating to the amendment is unhelpful and it only serves to create political controversy.  There is a process in place and it should be allowed to proceed in order that all options can be explored.  The assembly can come back with a plan of action to Government which will then refer it to a committee before, ultimately, the people decide.  That is what should happen.</p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Garda vetting and the industrial dispute.  I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Davitt called on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss housing.  The Finance Bill will be before the House in the next few weeks and that will present an opportunity to discuss the issue.  It is important that housing supply increases and that first-time buyers can buy houses.</p> <p>Senator Reilly referred to early school leavers, which is an important issue.  The former Ministers of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputies Sherlock and English, and the current Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, have begun the process of addressing it through the apprenticeship programme.</p> <p>I thank Senator Devine for raising the important work One in Four is doing.  She is correct that the protection of our children is important.  That is why we had a children's referendum and why we appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to Cabinet.  We need to be proactive about this and I would be happy to have a debate with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of mental health.  The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health issues, Deputy McEntee, is happy to come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher asked about the minor works scheme.  The Minister for Education and Skills announced in the budget debate that further projects will be announced under the summer works scheme in early 2017.  The details will be outlined then.</p> <p>I commend Senator Bacik on the motion she has tabled on Syria and on the work she had done on that.  It is an all-party motion and I am happy to work with her on it.</p> <p>Yesterday, Senator Kelleher raised the issue of vulnerable child refugees.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will come to the House to discuss that.</p> <p>Senator McFadden had a question about the important issue of housing for ex-servicemen and women and I would be happy to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in to discuss that.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of regional and rural development.  The Minister for the Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will be in the House on 17 November for a debate.</p> <p>Senators Feighan and Humphreys mentioned Airbnb.  The Government reduced the VAT rate for the hospitality sector but hotels are raising prices and forcing people to pay exorbitant fees for rooms.  That is not in the spirit of what the Government intended.  The VAT rate reduction was designed to attract visitors and mobilise local economies.  I appeal to hoteliers again to reconsider their prices.</p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of the retail sector in rural Ireland.  That can be raised with the Minister for the Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government when they visit the House.  He is correct that parking fees are an issue and we must get the balance right.</p></speech>
