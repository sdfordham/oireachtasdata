I regret I have been obliged to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator O'Brien as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p></speech>

It is an awful tragedy for one family to bear, to lose three brothers.  It shows the danger and risks fishermen in our waters take every time they go out to sea.  Our thoughts are with the family today and with the Leader and his colleagues from the Waterford area.</p><p>I read with interest the announcement from the Central Bank on its debt pilot scheme which will commence this month.  It has met with a degree of criticism from the Irish League of Credit Unions.  That said, all schemes that try to assist individuals in debt are welcome but I am sure the Leader would agree there is a proliferation of such schemes currently.  We have the mortgage resolution measures from the banks, the Irish Banking Federation agreed steps for those in mortgage arrears, the personal insolvency service and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, among others.  The situation is difficult.  I looked at the Insolvency Service of Ireland website this morning on foot of the announcement from the Central Bank and it is quite confusing, even to someone such as I who has a specific interest in the issue.  It is difficult to see where one would go to seek advice and in what process one would become engaged.  I suggest that in the next couple of weeks we could invite either the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the House to debate the various options available for distressed borrowers.  The House could do a good job in that regard, in so far as it could tease out what is available and who should go into which process.  I further suggest that we could appoint rapporteurs to produce a guide following the debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to provide to individuals in difficulty.  It is difficult to know which scheme a person should enter.  It would be of value to citizens and to us if we could tease out the matter further and see what options are available next week.  I urge the Leader to consider the matter.</p><p>I have not had an opportunity up to now to congratulate the new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, on his appointment by the Taoiseach.  I have no doubt he will do a very good job.  I look forward to him coming to the House to debate issues, in particular those of interest to me in the horticultural area.  I ask the Leader to convey my congratulations and best wishes to the new Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes.</p></speech>

The accident that happened at sea yesterday was an utter tragedy.  All of our thoughts and condolences are with their family.</p><p>On a happier note I remind colleagues that today is Yeats Day.  Our colleague, Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, is in Sligo today and is very involved in the organisation of the day to celebrate the achievements and life of the former Senator, poet and cultural icon, William Butler Yeats.  There are lots of plans afoot in Sligo to have celebrations worthy of Bloomsday in Dublin.  We all very much hope it will really take off this year and in future years.</p><p>I welcome the publication by the Government late last night of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.  We had an extensive debate on the heads of the Bill in this Chamber under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Many colleagues, including me, participated in the debate.  It is very welcome to see that the Bill is now greatly improved from the heads we debated during the committee hearings.  I am proud that the Government is finally facing up to its responsibility as legislators and putting the Bill before us as legislators.  There are key changes in the Bill that will make it a much more effective and accessible procedure whereby women might vindicate their constitutional right to life and whereby the constitutional right to life of the unborn might also be vindicated.  Some of the key changes, including the definition of appropriate institutions-----</p></speech>

As I said, there are key improvements in the Bill as published.</p><p>  In the context of the debate, it is also worthy of note that <i>The Irish Times</i> opinion poll today shows a clear majority support the Bill and for abortion to be legalised in a much wider range of circumstances.  I note also that 81% of people are in favour of abortion to be legal in cases of rape.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that he is firmly on the side of students but he will convey the deliberations of this House to the review of what went wrong with the leaving certificate.</p><p>I concur with the sympathy expressed by Members to the Bolger family on the tragedy off the coast of Tramore.</p><p>Recently, stalwarts on the Government side, including Senator Brennan, and Senator Mooney on this side, have sought the promotion and development of tourism.  Part of that is the development of walking.  We are aware of the huge success of the Great Western Greenway between Westport and Achill Island.  Tourism always needs new products.  I remind the House that Deputy Robert Dowd&rsquo;s walking Bill goes to the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  I hope the Bill will go to Committee Stage and that the views of the Members of this House who are so keen to promote tourism will be taken into account.  It is important that CIE keeps control of the rights of way attaching to the old railway lines and that local authorities conduct their planning procedures to take account of the possibility of those walks.</p> <p>I recall a splendid television programme on the Howth peninsula by Senator Quinn, where due to An Taisce, the Great Northern Railway and its successors, and the Gaisford-St. Lawrence family, there is a network of walks.  That is a sector of the tourism industry we should develop and I am sure we all hope Deputy Dowds's Bill will progress from the D&aacute;il tomorrow into this House.</p></speech>

Everything he said was valid and I urge the Leader to take on board the Senator's recommendation, and I second the call for an early debate on that.  We are all aware of the suite of options available - there is varying variety that is widely varying with the differing approaches in different financial institutions.  I am not saying we can achieve standardisation but in the interests of the consumer and those affected, there should be better guidance on the way through this maze.  I urge the Leader to facilitate that.</p><p>I do not want to enter into debate but unlike Senator Bacik, I totally disagree and I would not like to widen in the slightest-----</p></speech>

Perhaps today is not the day to call for urgent debates on the fishing industry but we must look closely at marine safety.</p><p>  I was recently in Castletownbere where a new RNLI station was opened.  The guest of honour was none other than Tom McSweeney, a great journalist, writer and broadcaster who presented the wonderful programme &quot;Seascapes&quot;.  In his oration, if it could be called that, he condemned politicians for neglecting the fishing industry for the last 30 years, which we must admit to, and he made the point that it is only when there are tragedies like this and the <i>Tit Bonhomme</i> in Union Hall that the media take up the flag for the fishermen.  Whether it is RTE, <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, it is always the same when these tragedies occur - there are front page headlines about fishermen and then fishing is forgotten again until the next tragedy.  If the media is listening, perhaps RTE could reintroduce a programme like &quot;Seascapes&quot; and have some focus on the fishermen.  Some of these young men in my area are those who were forced out of work in the construction industry, have bought small boats and many of them are now fishing lobster, with the end result that lobster will be fished out in the next few years.  No one is listening.</p><p>  Today is not the day to do it but next week or the week after that I will demand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come before the House for a broad debate on this topic.  Unfortunately only about half a dozen Senators will take part because there is no interest in fishing here either.</p></speech>

During the Seanad election, I found it to be one of the most beautiful parts of the country when I visited.  I would like to pass on my sympathy to the Leader and my colleagues from Waterford on this appalling tragedy.  Coming from an area where fishing is a big business, I know the risks and challenges for those who work in this sector.  All we can do is pass on our prayers and thoughts.</p><p>At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, there was an interesting debate on the teaching of history as second level.  We should have a debate in this House on that topic.  To plan for the future, we must know our past and where we came from, and we must learn about it in an unbiased and factual way.  History is an essential subject in the curriculum and I am troubled that there has been a reduction in the number of students taking history as a subject for the leaving certificate.  We must look at an alternative way to teach history, recalibrating it into the important position it should have in the second level curriculum.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said he hoped to bring it back to the Seanad after Report Stage.  I urge the House to pass this Bill as quickly as possible.  It was initiated in this House almost three years ago.  It has now completed Committee Stage and must go through Report Stage in the next couple of weeks and I urge the Leader to find the time to get it through this House.</p><p>I also wish to offer condolences on the terrible tragedy in Waterford yesterday.  Those three men were wearing life jackets but died from hypothermia in the water, which is very sad.  We hear so often of fishermen dying, often because they were not wearing life jackets but in this case they were.</p><p>We all support the Bill being introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Dowds tomorrow, and I echo Senator Barrett's remarks about the idea of increasing tourism to such a large extent by ensuring we enjoy the right to walk, a right that is being denied in many cases.</p><p>Legislation has been enacted in France that will force foreign drivers who had broken the rules of the road to pay the fines in France.  This will lead to a &euro;15 million bonus for the French exchequer because so many people do not pay the fines.  That is a problem in Ireland, with northern cars coming south and southern cars going north avoiding the payment of fines.  We should look at this to ensure foreign drivers coming into this country are forced to pay the fines when they are penalised.</p></speech>

I am glad to announce that in conjunction with the water augmentation scheme from Cooley to Omeath via Carlingford, a walkway is being built between Carlingford and Omeath.</p> <p>The walkway will be located along one of the most beautiful and picturesque loughs in the country and it is planned to extend it subsequently across the Border via the Newry Canal and River Clanrye to Portadown.  I am not sure how long the route will be, but I expect it will be approximately 40 km in length.  The walkway will be a significant tourist attraction for all the towns and villages along the route, from Carlingford and Omeath on the Cooley Peninsula to Newry and beyond.  This is another cross-Border initiative which indicates to me and the wider population that peace has returned to this island.  I hope we will never have a return to the Troubles.  I acknowledge the co-operation of landowners along the route who have facilitated this project, which will provide a tremendous tourism boost for Carlingford and the Cooley Peninsula. </p></speech>

I extend my condolences to the men's mother, Margaret, two brothers, Michael and Anthony, and two sisters, Linda and Paula.  The men belonged to a large family of seven which has been fishing for generations.  The death of the three brothers has shocked their family and the wider community in County Waterford.  We have had far too many tragedies off the south-east coast.</p><p>  As the Leader will agree, many issues affect the fishing community but today is not an appropriate moment to raise them.  For this reason, I ask him to arrange a debate on the fishing sector at some point in future to allow these issues to be discussed properly.  I will, however, refer to one issue that I have raised on three previous occasions, including twice on the Adjournment, namely, the need to improve safety for fisherman.  I refer specifically to the introduction of personal locator beacons on the persons of fishermen.  I will read a response given by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when I raised the matter with him last year.  He stated:<blockquote>A second priority will be to encourage the use of personal locator beacons for fishermen on all Irish-registered fishing vessels.  These personal locator beacons are designed and operated in accordance with recognised international standards and will be required to be registered with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It is intended that my Department will take measures with a view to making the provision of personal locator beacons and vessel beacons mandatory under appropriate legislation and my Department's code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels less than 15 m.</blockquote>  I ask the Leader to make inquiries with the Minister to ascertain what progress had been made on this issue since October last.  Personal locator beacons, which can be worn as a wristwatch or integrated in a life jacket, send out a beacon and help the emergency services trace individuals.  While the devices are already located on fishing vessels, the emergency services can find it difficult to locate persons.  Obviously, the quicker they reach a person in the event of an accident at sea, the better will be the outcome.  I ask the Leader to make inquiries as to the progress that has been made on this important issue.  We must do everything possible to improve the safety of fishermen at sea.</p></speech>

Last week, it was brought to my attention that President Obama spoke a number of weeks ago at an event organised by Planned Parenthood, an organisation which carries out approximately 330,000 abortions each year in the United States.  The US President said "God bless you" to the Planned Parenthood meeting and told the organisation he stood with it.</p></speech>

My wife, who is a native of the town, was present for the historic moment at which Senator O'Donovan was also present.  She was not representing my interests but happened to be in the town.</p><p>Yesterday, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, representatives of the City and County Managers Association pointed out that current Government funding for the maintenance of our local and regional road network, as distinct from the motorway network, is running at 50% below requirements.  The meeting heard that without a significant increase in the funding allocation for local authorities, Irish taxpayers will pay an enormous long-term cost to reconstruct roads that have been neglected for years.  We will return to the position that obtained in the 1980s when the Government of the day, due to the recession, wilfully neglected the road network.  As Senators, especially those who served previously in local government, will be aware, it took almost two decades to restore our local road network and make it fit for purpose.  Will the House have an opportunity, prior to the Estimates being decided, to debate this issue, which affects every man, woman and child in the country, with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance?  While road restoration may not be a sexy subject, if the local and regional road network continues to deteriorate to the extent outlined by the County and City Managers Association, we are in for a difficult time.</p></speech>

As most people are aware, the Central Bank of Ireland has a code of conduct on mortgage arrears to which the lending institutions are obliged to adhere.  It is disturbing to note that they are failing to do so in many cases.  Bank customers who find themselves in mortgage distress are not being provided with the correct information on the code of conduct and on the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  While it is easy to blame banks in general, in this case the fault lies with individuals in the banks.  I would go as far as to argue for sanctions to be applied to staff in lending institutions who are not doing their job correctly.  Responsibility lies with regional managers but the ultimate sanction for any lending institution is to have its banking licence removed.  While I realise this sanction will not be applied, I call for a debate with the Minister of Finance to ascertain what precisely can be done in respect of bank staff who are not adhering to the obligations set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Sanctions must be applied to bank employees who act irresponsibly by putting people under pressure and telling them they must sell their family home after six months in arrears.  This approach is wrong and unreasonable.</p> <p>I would like the Minister for Finance to come into the House to debate this issue immediately.</p></speech>

It is something that can be grown, not just in terms of a festival for the north west as the contribution of Yeats is something on which Ireland can capitalise throughout the world.  We can see the success of the work of Senator Norris with Bloomsday and what that has done for Dublin in particular, as well as the country at large.  In that regard, Senator O'Keeffe is owed a debt of gratitude from all of us.  Well done to her.</p><p>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on the Haddington Road agreement.  Media reports today indicate that there are 350 employees of the HSE who earn more than the Taoiseach.  It is particularly unsettling that a full third of the 94,000 employees in the HSE earn less than &euro;30,000 per annum.  It is not justifiable to have almost 400 elite members of staff, some of whom are earning up to &euro;400,000.  There are quite a few earning &euro;350,000 and a lot earning more than &euro;200,000.  There is also a significant number earning more than &euro;80,000.  We need to look at rebalancing the pay scales in the public service to make them more consistent.  It is right that the salaries of public servants, and politicians in particular, should be reviewed and set independently and reduced in accordance with the demands of the economy of the day.  It is one thing to do that in these Houses but we cannot preside over a situation where 30,000 people in an organisation are paid less than &euro;30,000 per annum while a small elite within the same organisation are paid up to &euro;400,000.  </p></speech>

I agree with Senator Cullinane that we need to have further discussions in this House on health and safety in the fishing industry.  The loss of life on this scale is hugely regrettable.</p><p>Like Senator Healy Eames, I very much regret the recent comments of President Obama on the Planned Parenthood organisation, which performed approximately 330,000 abortions last year.  I was also disappointed to hear Senator Bacik, on the day that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill was published, already expressing her wish to extend the scope of that legislation.

These are schemes and resources provided to the elderly and those with disabilities.  We have scarce resources, as we all know, so we need to ensure that the people most in need receive most support.  The aforementioned grants and allowances must be targeted at the most needy and deserving.  I welcome the Government's announcement that it will continue to pay the mobility allowance until October.  I also note that the Ombudsman gave a cautious welcome to that decision.  However, in advance of the inter-departmental review that is taking place, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, we should have an input into the mobility allowance and motorised transport schemes.  Members of this House would have good contributions to make which could help to ensure that the schemes are targeted in a way that is most effective and benefits those who require assistance most.  We must move away from the situation where the State was in breach of equality legislation, as highlighted by the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

Also coming up soon is the 53rd anniversary of the speech President Kennedy made to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association when he was running for the presidency of the United States.  He made his speech in September 1960, two months before the election and I wish to quote briefly from it.  He stated:<blockquote><br /><br />  I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute; where no Catholic prelate would tell the President - should he be Catholic - how to act and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote ... I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials; and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.</blockquote>I say this because I would like the Leader to convey, for what it is worth, my personal gratitude to the Taoiseach for standing up for these values yesterday and in acknowledgement of the pressure that has been brought to bear on so many people of good conscience in dealing with the troubled issue of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  People have been subjected to unbelievable pressure and intimidation.</p><p>  I believe that two specific actions should be taken.  I do not know if there is a formal mechanism through which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or our local consular office in Boston can express the displeasure of the people of this country at the disrespect shown to our democracy by the boycott of the Taoiseach by the Catholic hierarchy of Boston when he gave the commencement address at Boston College.  Second, in the spirit of good fellowship in this and the other House, it would be good to agree a policy of 100% voluntary disclosure of all Members of any support, be it financial or otherwise, they have received from any organisations attempting to influence the vote on this critical measure, which could determine the lives of Irish women.</p></speech>

In addition, a television programme broadcast last night showed that racist attacks appear to be increasing, in both frequency and vehemence.  This is something that we should not tolerate in this State.  The policing of racism on the Internet is a much more complicated issue than it was in the past.  The people who have contacted me, for example, regarding racist comments about their neighbours on a particular social networking site were told by the site's operators that the comments would not be taken down, even though they were very serious.  The matter has now been passed on to the Garda.  </p><p>We should debate the issue of racism and how we deal with in this State with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We need to discuss how prevalent racist incidents have become and how this is affecting people.  Racism is something that none of us should tolerate and we must keep it on the agenda.  In that context, I would be grateful if the Leader would organise a debate on racism, racist attacks and how they can be dealt with, from a legal perspective.  I would also include the question of how to deal with racist commentary in any of today's media.  </p></speech>

I agree with Senator O'Donovan that it is time to focus, on a more regular basis, on the difficult lives of fishermen.  Today is not a day to address that issue but we should discuss it on another day.</p> <p> I worked as a teacher for many years and I witnessed the dumbing down of history as a subject.  History is becoming like Greek and Latin, both of which were removed from the curriculum in most instances.  The difficulty with history is that students tend not to take it as a leaving certificate subject because they believe it to be of no value to them.  However, they are quite wrong in that regard.  They also shy away from history in light of the huge workload involved.  In comparison with other subjects, it is necessary to spend a tremendous amount of time studying history.  Perhaps we might have a debate on the matter.</p><p>I welcome the publication of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill and I look forward to a good, sensible, logical and dispassionate debate on it in this Chamber.  My party, in its wisdom, decided to have a free vote on the legislation.  That means free speech for people on all sides of the House.  There are two different views on the legislation within my party and I hope both will be expressed in a balanced way.</p></speech>

Passage East, Cheekpoint and Dunmore East are closely-knit fishing communities.  There is no doubt that what happened has caused great shock and sadness in those villages and among fishing families nationally.  On behalf of the House, I express our deep condolences to all involved on their terrible loss.</p><p>Senators O'Donovan and Cullinane raised the issue of the fishing industry.  I will certainly seek to discover what is the up-to-date position in respect of the personal and vessel location beacons to which Senator Cullinane referred.  In the context of the points raised by Senator O'Donovan, a number of weeks ago I indicated that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, will be coming before the House in July to engage in a debate on the fishing industry.  That debate, which has been planned for a number of weeks, will certainly proceed.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien made a very constructive suggestion with regard to the number of schemes relating to debt forgiveness, etc., of which people may now avail.  He also referred to the recent pilot scheme launched by the Central Bank.  I will certainly investigate the possibility of proceeding in the way the Senator suggested.  The House is due to deal with the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill next week, which will afford Senators the opportunity to express and expound upon their opinions on the pilot scheme.  If the matter is not covered sufficiently during that debate, then I will certainly try to facilitate the worthy suggestion made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p><p>Senators Bacik and MacSharry welcomed the fact that Yeats Day is being held in Sligo today.  The purpose of the day is to celebrate the life and work of the late Senator W. B. Yeats.  I am sure the celebration of that great man will constitute a wonderful occasion.</p><p>Senator Bacik and others alluded to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  Senator Healy Eames inquired as to when the Bill will be brought before the House.  I understand that this will possibly happen in the second week in July.  It will definitely be here as soon as the Lower House has concluded its deliberations on it.  I note Senator Bacik's request but following the debate on the Bill, it will be some time before we debate the subject again in the House.</p></speech>

He also referred to the legislation introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, in the Lower House.  Establishing walkways is a wonderful way to utilise disused railway lines.  They are not only being used as walkways.  In my constituency, for example, the Waterford and Suir Valley Railway - on which steam trains run - has been mentioned in many tourism documentaries on the BBC and other television stations.  The railway lines in question should be utilised for the benefit of the public.  I note Senator Brennan's comments regarding the fact that in conjunction with the Cooley-Omeath waterway, a walkway is being put in place between Carlingford and Omeath.  The Senator highlighted the co-operation of the nearby landowners, which is extremely important in the context of the develop of walkways throughout the country.</p><p>Senators Conway and O'Sullivan referred to the teaching of history.  I listened to some of the debate which took place at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The history teachers present made some excellent presentations on the matter.  It would be regrettable if the teaching of history were to decline in any way.  If necessary, we will try to facilitate a debate on the matter in this House.  First, however, we will wait to see what progress is made on foot of yesterday's submissions from those who teach history and who put forward an excellent case at the joint committee's meeting.</p><p>The Construction Contracts Bill at last passed Committee State in the Lower House yesterday evening.  I assure Senator Quinn that as soon as Report Stage is completed, we will be facilitating the passage of the Bill through this House.</p><p>In note the points made by Senator Quinn in respect of penalty points for foreign drivers and those from north of the Border.  I will communicate his views to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to the maintenance of roads.  That matter was the subject of discussion at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I heard part of that discussion.  Significant additional funding has been provided in recent weeks.  Regardless of the amount of funding provided, there will always be a demand for more.  However, I take on board the Senator's point regarding the need to maintain our roads, particular secondary routes.</p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to sharp practice on the part of the banks in the context of their not meeting their responsibilities.  I suggest that the Senator make those points to the Minister next week in the context of the debate on the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill.</p><p>Senator MacSharry referred to the Haddington Road agreement.  We engaged in a detailed debate on that matter not so long ago.  However, I share the Senator's concern with regard to the extravagant salaries of certain senior staff in the HSE.</p> <p> Senator Mullins raised issue of the respite grant, which we debated comprehensively last year with regard to the budget.  I note also his points regarding the mobility allowance and the motorised transport schemes.  The debate on Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be taken in the House this afternoon and that might be an opportunity for the Senator to discuss those items.</p><p>Senator Crown raised the 50th anniversary of the visit of President Kennedy to the country.  There are many celebrations planned next week for Wexford, New Ross and Dunganstown in which I am sure many people will want to share.  The Senator also noted the 53rd anniversary of the speech the then Senator Kennedy made to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association.</p><p>I note the Senator's points on the boycott of the Taoiseach by the Cardinal in Boston and some other groups, which was regrettable.  Donations to Members of this House and others is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission, which I am sure will be investigated if any problems arise in that regard, but I thank Senator Crown for his comments on that matter.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the question of recent racist attacks in social media in particular.  I agree that they must be condemned.  It is a very serious matter which the Minister for Justice and Equality has already condemned.  If necessary we can have a debate in the House.  We will see if the Minister can be made available to attend the House.  The State cannot tolerate such racist attacks, be they on social media or whatever media.</p><p>I note Senator O'Sullivan's points on the Bill that will come before the House in July.  I hope that we will have a respectful debate and that people will respect each other's opinions.  Senators on all sides of the House have very different opinions on this issue but I hope we will have a dignified and respectful debate when that Bill comes before the House.</p></speech>

To achieve the most effective high quality outcomes for patients in the most cost-efficient manner possible, reform of the structures and governance for the delivery of hospital services is now vital.</p><p>The report was informed by consultation with management and senior clinicians from hospitals, patient advocates, health agencies, and the clinical programmes, among others.  Detailed data analysis also informed the report recommendations.  It is important to make special note of the clinical programmes which have been instrumental in improving our health services, in conjunction with front-line staff and supported by the special delivery unit.  The stroke programme and the congested heart failure programme were mentioned in the keynote address in Oregon last year by Don Berwick, who was Barack Obama's health spokesperson.  Since the stroke programme came into being, we have moved from the bottom of the list in Europe for thrombolysis, the administration of clot-dissolving drugs, to the top and we now save an extra life a week and pre-empt the need for three people a week to go into long-term care.</p><p>We know the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality and safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  By cost effectiveness I do not mean saving money for the sake of money but saving money to have resources to treat more patients more quickly.</p><p>The organisational structures and system of governance in the Irish hospital sector are unsatisfactory.  Many Senators will say this is an understatement, because the governance of many of our hospitals in the past has not been at the level it should be.  The investigations by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into Tallaght hospital and the occurrences there exposed a huge weakness in governance which has helped us learn how better to govern our hospitals.  We now have very clear direction on how this should be done.</p><p>The existing organisational structures have restricted the development of the management systems and leadership we require to run a world class national hospital network.  In reforming the organisational structures for hospital services, I want to take the best elements of governance and autonomy found in our system to create a new governance framework which can yield the benefits of increased independence and greater control of local clinician and managerial leaders to every hospital in Ireland.</p><p>We look to ourselves to solve our problems but we also look outside our country.  We are a small island nation and we can and do learn from others.  In this respect, I thank Sir Keith Pearson for the work he did on governance while the chair of Tallaght hospital.  I must also mention Professor Higgins and the huge amount of consultation he did on this issue.  A total of 75 formal meetings and more than 70 informal meetings were held.</p> <p>Since the Government approved the groups' establishment in May, there have been more than 50 additional meetings.  I have visited each hospital group to address staff, including clinicians and community staff.  We had good interactions.  As I told them and as I am happy to confirm on the floor of the Seanad, this is the beginning of a conversation that will continue.  People can feed into an e-mail address as they encounter problems on the ground and conceive solutions.  The people who deal with our problems on a daily basis are the best placed to deal with them.</p><p>The success of the special delivery unit, SDU, was that it visited the front line and the clinical programmes, listened to what people had to say, assessed their suggestions and told them whether their suggestions would work, could work if they were less expensively priced or would not work.</p><p>In reforming the organisational structures for hospital services, I want to take the best elements of governance from around the world.  As well as benefits in terms of safe, high-quality patient care and cost effectiveness, other key benefits that will arise as a result of the establishment of groups include stronger governance and management structures at the hospital level; an end to hospitals providing the same services unnecessarily within the same geographical area, that is to say, duplication; a concentration of complex services at appropriate hospitals in order to ensure quality; and efficiencies through the avoidance of duplication in terms of HR, finance, etc.</p><p>As I have often stated, the idea of model 2 hospital work such as hernia repairs, gall bladder surgery and so on being done in model 4 hospitals is grossly inefficient and is not cost effective.  It is like bringing one's ten year old Volkswagen to the Ferrari testing centre.  The centre will surely do a great job, but the same job could be done more conveniently and with a great deal less cost at one's local garage.</p><p>I am mindful of people's nervousness about the status of their smaller hospitals.  Even though the small hospital framework document has been ready for some time, its publication was delayed to coincide with the major hospital groups.  The two are inextricably interlinked.  The framework demonstrates clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure.  The establishment of the groups will see small and large hospitals working together as one.  This is a key step on the way to the introduction of universal health insurance.  There will be a live-in period, as it were, and trust formation lasting 18 months.  The groups will be reviewed by the Department of Health to ensure that they are delivering better outcomes for patients as intended.  For the CEO of each group, the other key performance indicator will be the amount of resources and worth that have been returned to the smaller hospitals.</p><p>When the groups are established, services can be exchanged between sites in line with overarching policy and the group's strategic plans.  This will result in the maintenance of activity in smaller hospitals, allowing them to focus on provision of safe and appropriate care.  A significant increase in the volume of activity in smaller hospitals is the expected result of these service improvements.  One need only consider Louth County Hospital or Roscommon hospital to see the greater range of safe services that they offer to their local populations.  At the same time, more complex operations and procedures are kept in those hospitals that are better positioned to deliver them.</p><p>The implementation of the recommendations of the group's report has commenced.  In the past two weeks, I have visited all of the areas alongside the director general designate of the HSE and officials from my Department.  We explained the policy objectives and listened to the staff's questions.  This process has been useful and informative and the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.  Since the Government approved the groups' establishment, Professor John Higgins has also been carrying out briefings.</p><p>The implementation will be overseen by a national strategic advisory group, which will shortly be appointed, and be driven by the HSE.  This group will provide guidance and ongoing direction in respect of the implementation of the hospital groups report and the smaller hospitals framework.  It will also provide a forum to resolve issues and assist in the development of specific implementation guidelines on the steps required for full implementation.</p><p>I will appoint chairs to each group in the coming weeks.  Advertisements to seek other board members will be placed in parallel with this process and the subsequent appointment of group CEOs and management teams.  Each appointment will be made based on the competencies an individual brings to the board in line with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report on Tallaght, but that will not prevent appropriate representation of the geographical areas in the group.  The need to ensure primary and community care is also covered by board membership.</p><p>Within one year of the formation of hospital groups, each group will be required to submit a strategic plan that will outline its plans for future services within the group.  These strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group.  Critically, each group will develop its own plan.  It must also decide on a new name.  We have divided them geographically for indicative purposes.  Having visited the Limerick mid-west area, I am aware that its group has determined its new name, that being, &quot;University Limerick Hospitals&quot;.  Its chair and board are in place and have met three times.  The group is well advanced.</p><p>It is good that there will be seven groups, including the national paediatric hospital group.  That they will operate differently in various fields will provide each an opportunity to learn from the others.  Furthermore, instead of having 49 managers and management structures, we will only have seven, six of those in adult services.  I intend to ensure that there will be regular meetings between these seven CEOs so that they might exchange ideas of mutual interest.</p><p>One of my main criticisms of the HSE previously related to the fact that, despite being a monolithic body that was supposed to deliver uniformity across our services, it did not.  Excellence in one hospital was not transposed to other hospitals.  A good way of handling scrubs in one hospital was not followed in other hospitals.  One hospital's approach to staff was not taken elsewhere.  Why are there nine nurses per health care assistant in some model 4 hospitals but only 2.8 per health care assistant in others?</p><p>The implementation of these plans by each group will be rigorously reviewed, including all necessary due diligence checks, to determine whether the groups are in a position to advance to hospital trust status after the necessary legislation is put in place, which is planned for 2015.  As Mr. Tony O'Brien, the HSE's director general designate, has stated, trust status is not guaranteed.  It must be earned and groups must reach the bar.</p><p>The Higgins report represents a major milestone in the health reform programme.  I am confident that the new groups will help to deliver a more effective and efficient hospital service for patients with better outcomes.  If all we do is predicated on better outcomes for patients, we will not stray too far from the right path.  Although we have developed some measurements of hospital outcomes, we need more.  Measurement is also light in primary and community care.  I have invited those involved in these areas to join the Department and the HSE in developing outcome measurements so that we can focus more on those activities that we know improve outcomes for patients and less on those that do not.</p><p>By way of a rhetorical question, why is it that, when we have some of the best doctors, nurses and managers in the world, we do not have one of the best health services?  The reason is that the health service was allowed to evolve in a chaotic fashion.  We are trying to put order on it in a way that allows those who work therein to deliver of the excellence that they have been trained to deliver, are capable of delivering and want to deliver.  It is frequently reported to me that people are frustrated by their inability to do their jobs because of the system in which they must work.  We want to remove this frustration.  For this reason, our meetings have been important and the e-mail address will be important.  The reform is ongoing and will be informed by those who work in and use the service.</p></speech>

As the Minister is here, I wish to raise a different issue to the one being debated today.  While I appreciate that this is, strictly speaking, an issue for the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I ask that the Minister's office would make inquiries into the delay of the transfer of the management of Cregg House and the services it provides to people with severe and profound disabilities.  I gather there is a very serious delay in that regard.  A price-comparison was done by the HSE and Wisdom Services which showed that the services provided by Wisdom Services at Cregg House were &euro;40,000 cheaper, per user, than those provided at HSE-run facility at Cloonamahon.  Wisdom Services has announced its intention to discontinue service provision because it cannot afford to carry on.  The HSE tried to replace Wisdom Services with other operators but none were interested because of the lack of funding.  The HSE agreed to take over the provision of services itself.  A statement was released by Wisdom Services today to the effect that the HSE is playing games with this issue.  While I appreciate that this is Deputy Lynch's area, I ask the Minister to have his officials investigate the delay because the uncertainty for the service users and their families is of grave concern.  I apologise for taking advantage of the Minister's presence to raise that matter.</p><p>On the surface of it, most people welcome the idea of hospital groupings, with shared services, shared expertise, centres of excellence and so forth.  However, a number of questions require answers.  When is the licensing going to take place?  When will the legislation for the licensing come before the Houses?  It is not on the legislative programme for 2013 so will it be published in 2014 or later?  Who will the hospital groups report to?  Further down the line we will see the development of hospital trusts but will they be independent republics, capable of doing whatever they want, with no connection to the government of the day?  Will we merely provide the money for the hospital trust and allow the trust to spend it as it sees fit or will there be some level of responsibility attaching to the Minister for Health for the trusts?  What is envisaged in terms of the reporting structure?  That is somewhat uncertain at present.  In 2015, the HSE will no longer exist and I am interested in what will happen at that point.</p><p>The two reports published recently on hospital groupings refer to smaller hospitals, of which there are many in this country.  The Minister claims that the future of such hospitals is now secure because they will be carrying out certain types of procedures and discontinuing others.  The difficulty I have with this, as someone from the north west, is that a different sub-structure will be required for Letterkenny and Sligo because of the unique geographic challenges of that region, which the Minister, Professor Higgins and many others have readily acknowledged.  I have concerns about the power shift to Galway.  Having researched health in this country in recent years, it seems to me that medical politics would put these Houses in the ha'penny place in the context of the manoeuvring that goes on.  Consultants try to build up the numbers attending their particular hospital to show that they are doing more cases, can achieve better outcomes and so on.  Under the proposed hospital grouping for the north west, the power focus would shift to Galway.  However, as one oncologist said to me recently, Galway is already beyond capacity.  That is just in terms of cancer treatment.  Inevitably, if Galway has the budget and the CEO, it stands to reason that it will come first.  If two sitting rooms in two houses need to be wall-papered, obviously one will do one's own first before doing the one down the road.</p><p>The level of expertise that will be available to hospitals like those in Letterkenny and Sligo will be hampered down the line by the fact that the centre of power is elsewhere, namely, in Galway.  Rather than extend the clinical programmes that are so celebrated throughout the country in the context of cancer care and cardiology, we still have no plans or indeed any indication that we will have any cardio-catheterisation laboratory facilities in the north west.  There is no centre for radiotherapy.  Professor John Crown will testify, I am sure, that in the United States they would not leave 250,000 people without access to radiotherapy or cardio-catheterisation laboratory facilities but we are doing that.  I must say that the previous Government is just as guilty in this regard as the current one, if not more so.  There has been a tendency to take refuge in the notion of co-operation with Northern Ireland on this issue but that is very sketchy.</p><p>At the briefing in Buswell's Hotel with Professor Higgins I was shocked when I questioned him about the situation pertaining to Galway, Sligo and Letterkenny.  The Minister attended that briefing himself and would have heard Professor Higgins saying that he hopes that &quot;existing synergies&quot; between those hospitals will continue but that in the fullness of time, the road to Galway will improve.  This is a Professor of medicine who, in fairness, did a very thorough job in going around and meeting everybody concerned.  He attended approximately 150 meetings and I welcome his report.  However, if this is the vision for the delivery of health care in the north west of the country then I have a real problem with that.  The current Minister for Health was the best campaigner, when in Opposition, for a better health service, and would not have accepted medical professionals telling him not to worry, that the approach to improving health services in the north west would be to do up the roads.  Surely the people of the north west are entitled to a little more than that.</p></speech>

I am speaking today on behalf of my party's health spokesperson, Senator Colm Burke, who cannot be here today and who sends his apologies.  I commend the Minister for Health on the launch of the report on hospital groupings.  The Minister has signalled the fundamental modernisation of the organisation of our health service, in line with best practice internationally.  The traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital was neither sustainable nor safe.  We must ensure that everybody who goes into hospital is safe, first and foremost and that the services being provided are sustainable.  The formation of acute hospitals into groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospitals to deliver services to a very high standard in a way that is safe, efficient and cost-effective and I hope that when the Minister returns in a year's time, my words in this regard will be proven.  The current organisational structures have restricted the development of hospital management systems and the leadership we require to run a world-class national hospital network.  In reforming the structures the Minister has promoted new governance structures that will yield benefits from increased independence and greater control.  Leadership is important in every hospital and the new structures will give autonomy, power and responsibility in terms of the duty of care to the leaders of the hospital groupings.  I visited Tallaght hospital recently with the Minister and was very impressed with the grouping I was shown that day.  The management system in place there now, under Dr. Eilish Hardiman, is most impressive and the figures in Tallaght speak for themselves.</p><p>In drawing up the hospital groups report, consultation was a priority.  All of those on the ground in the hospital system, including consultants, management and so forth, were all consulted in the drawing up of the Higgins report.  The aim of all hospital groups is the delivery of cost-effective hospital care in a sustainable and timely manner.  At the aforementioned briefing in Tallaght, I discovered that the hospital in Naas, which is now part of the Tallaght hospital grouping, is doing marvellous work with stroke victims using the latest technology and in co-operation with other hospitals in its group.  </p><p>The Minister made reference to the possibility of saving one extra life per week and preventing three people from entering long-term care every week.  While I agree it is vitally important that lives are saved - that is what every doctor wants - it is equally important that we prevent people ending up in long-term care.  Long-term care costs the State a lot of money so this is a cost-saving exercise as much as anything else.  When one talks about health, one is reluctant to refer to costs but it is a fact that long-term care is costly.</p> <p>I was pleased to hear about the appointments made, and the Minister mentioned that the chairs of the group would be appointed by mid-July.  All of the appointments are based on competences that an individual brings to the board in line with the HIQA report.  There will be no prevention of appropriate representation of geographical areas in the groups, as the Minister stated.  Will he elaborate on how that will be achieved?</p><p>The panel of experts in drafting the report have done the State a service and the figures speak for themselves.  Since the Minister took office, the number of patients has decreased, which means the system is being reformed.  For example, the number of people on a waiting list for more than three months for a procedure has been reduced by 18% and at the end of 2011, 1,759 children were waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or day care surgery but within a year, the waiting list has been reduced to 89.</p><p>There is a value for money aspect to this for taxpayers.  Very often in the political sphere one would see a criticism in moving away from small hospitals and what that would mean for the local community.  The Minister indicated in his speech that small hospitals will be doing more work in a safer way and the work will be appropriate to the job they were set up to do.  As the Minister mentioned, Roscommon hospital has seen extra facilities and patients, which is testimony to what this process is bringing to the system.  The Minister has seen politicians on the street and when he has tried to bring about centres treating a patient under one roof, political lobbyists ask why the Minister is taking away local hospitals, but this is proof that there will be more work in local hospitals that will be safe, fast, efficient and local to the community.</p><p>The idea of money following the patient is important as some hospitals are closing systems when the budget runs out.  Will the Minister comment on the system of money following the patient and how it will work?  It is an important element of managing budgets in the hospital.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300012#L00200"><p>I will take a moment to compliment the Minister on the good work he is doing on the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.  It has not been an easy passage but the Minister has addressed it while others have neglected it.  When the story of these times is told, people will recognise that he has taken a very wise and responsible course.</p><p>The hospital groups issue is being discussed today and there are two key elements.  I am not an instinctive &quot;save our local hospital&quot; person and I have spoken for many years about the need to reform the Irish health system.  The numbers may have changed slightly but as a general rule we had the highest number of hospitals and smallest number of hospital beds of any country in the OECD.  That was a few years ago and the position may have changed slightly since.  There was a clear and dramatic need for real and fundamental change in the number and configuration of our hospitals, with a particular need to concentrate resources.</p><p>We used to have absolute absurdities and even in our capital city, a hospital group had seven small hospitals - all allegedly university hospitals - with cardiology in one, endocrinology in another and some parts of surgery in one hospital and other parts elsewhere.  As recently as a few years ago if a person had to have complicated treatment for primary bone cancer, care could be divided among four hospitals, which exemplifies the key need for a rationalisation of resources.  I am 100% behind the Minister on the issue.</p><p>I am troubled by the bigger administrative picture emerging from this.  The model of developing highly-centralised State-owned care in a trust system with a highly-developed cadre of managers is an extraordinarily accurate copy of exactly what happens in the UK National Health Service.  The Minister should not take this as an unduly negative criticism but it should be thought through at this early stage of the reform process.  It is not the right way to implement the process of money following the patient as money can only follow the patient where the patient goes.  If, in a hospital trust system, all choice goes and a patient must go to one hospital, we may as well give the money to the hospital before the patient goes there on the basis of prospective budgeting.  The purpose of money following the patient is so the patient can have a negotiable insurance instrument and can go to hospital A or B if he or she does not like the way hospital A is run or that fellow Crown.  That is the way the process must be devised.</p><p>I am trying not to be pejorative but the copying of the British model to the extent of using the terminology of &quot;trust&quot; is not the way the go.  It is easier to do it in places like Dublin where there can be a degree of choice between hospitals but we have seen the ultimate logic of the people being put in charge of this process.  We have seen how they have acted in cancer care, and they have tried to take away that choice.  Their model would be based on designing the system and deciding how many patients go through it, determining what they see as appropriate standards and auditing to see if those standards are met.  Standards can be set high or low, which is the fundamental problem of the health quality movement, as it measures compliance rather than quality.</p><p>The Minister is aware that currently in the UK there is a major scandal brewing with regard to the spin-off in the Mid-Staffordshire hospital and health district, where systematic management issues have come to light in one NHS hospital, and as a result the Public Accounts Committee in the UK Parliament has called in the head of the NHS.  There have also been calls for his resignation, as well as a focus on the notion of the gagging order culture.  If there is a bureaucracy with a manager in charge, with the best will in the world, Acton's law will apply and power will corrupt.  If there is no system of competition built in, there will inevitably be an emergence of a system of repression.</p><p>I agree with the Minister's comments on the extraordinarily high quality of our nurses and the general very high quality of our doctors.  My concurrence with the diagnosis at that stage probably reaches a stone wall as I do not believe the next problem is that we need better managers.  We should have the great doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and people who rise through the ranks of a profession put in positions of real leadership instead of being regarded as technicians.  Currently, default leadership is provided by highly technically skilled managers who have no capacity for true leadership.  We should follow such a model but I fear it will not happen here.</p><p>I may have to engage Mr. Bill O'Herlihy to get access to a high-powered ministerial team to make the following point.  The Minister will come before the Seanad to deal with the health information Bill, which has within it the seeds of a real problem for clinical research in this country in the centralising, formalising and bureaucratising one of the few elements of the system that works relatively well in the hands of HIQA, the governance of ethical oversight for clinical trials.</p></speech>

At the outset I acknowledge the progress made in the terms of delivery of hospital services recently, particularly in my county.  At long last, Kerry General Hospital in Tralee is home to one of the finest accident and emergency departments in the country and it is a wonderful facility for patients and staff alike.  The old department is being converted into a cardiac care unit, and the new medical assessment unit is also working well, taking the strain from the accident and emergency department.  We also saw the opening of the new west Kerry community hospital in Dingle and earlier this week we had the transfer of patients from the old Kenmare community hospital to a new facility in the town.  It is important to acknowledge the progress that has been made.  I understand that one of the two newly appointed accident and emergency consultants at Kerry General Hospital is to leave his post and I would like an assurance from the Minister that he will be replaced as soon as possible.</p><p>Although much progress and reform has been made, I sometimes wonder why it takes so long for some people to see a consultant in our public health services.  An 83-year-old constituent recently received a letter from Cork University Hospital advising her of an appointment to see an ophthalmologist a year and a half from now.  Nothing can justify keeping somebody waiting that long for a relatively routine appointment, and that women will be 85 by the time she gets to see the consultant.  If she requires surgery or further medical intervention, how long more will she have to wait?</p><p>The average waiting time in Kerry for rheumatology is three years and two years for neurology, although an appointment can be made for a neurologist in nine months if the case is very urgent.  These departments only have a visiting consultant but the waiting times are not acceptable, so there is more work to be done in this regard.</p> <p>The major problem we now seem to have is the shortage of junior doctors or the inability to attract newly-qualified doctors into our hospital services.  Sadly, too many of our new graduates are going overseas to better pay and conditions and our health services are suffering as a result.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on an issue I heard about on the radio the other day.  She may correct me if I am wrong, but I heard that of the 39 consultant posts advertised, only two or three have been filled.  With the best will in the world, if we do not have the consultants we cannot deal with the problems of waiting lists, etc.</p><p>I would like to raise one other matter, namely, the long-stay facilities for the elderly and how it impacts on our acute hospital services.  Last year alone nearly 250,000 hospital bed days were lost due to delayed discharges.  I do not like to use the phrase &quot;bed blockers&quot; as it seems to imply that the patient is the problem, rather than the system.  According to HSE data, of the 119 public long-stay facilities in this country, only ten will be fully compliant with Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards post-2015 if there is no further investment in those facilities.  The ESRI projects an additional requirement for 888 places per annum up to 2021 to meet the needs of the growing elderly population.  What steps are the Department and the HSE taking to plan for the long-term care of our older population in light of recent statements that indicate that up to &euro;38 million is required to have public long-stay facilities fully compliant with HIQA standards by 2015?  It is one thing to have all the standards laid down by HIQA - and I sincerely welcome those standards and provisions - but it is another thing to put the necessary resources in place to allow the facilities to meet those requirements.  This would take major pressure off our acute hospital services.</p><p>I welcome the calls by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and Nursing Homes Ireland for the establishment of a Department of Health-led forum on long-term residential care.  For the vast majority of people, their interaction with our public hospital services and the staff who work there is usually a very positive one.  The bottleneck seems to remain in accident and emergency departments and I look forward to hearing more from the Minister on what further progress we can make in that area.  I commend Professor Higgins on his report and look forward to the progress of the new and reformed programme which will hopefully deal with some or all of the issues I have outlined.  I recognise that the Minister has done much work in reforming the health services.  I realise it is not an easy task.  We will continue to work with him as best we can on that matter.</p></speech>

The Minister made the point that we have the best doctors and nurses and I believe we do.  However, I want to hear him comment on his move last October to reduce the salaries of consultants by 30% and the JobBridge-type programme he has produced for nurses.  Speaking to a few consultants who are friends of mine, they are very worried about the level of quality of doctors we will continue to attract in this country.  Like the previous speaker I would like the Minister to clarify exactly how many consultant posts the HSE has advertised, how many have been filled and how many have attracted any consultants to even apply for the job.  In the business world when we want to fill posts with the best people we have got to pay for them.  I know we are in times of great turmoil and nobody wants to see anybody paid too much money, but I would like the Minister to talk to us about administration and management.  It is so important, but we also need the best front-line technicians, which we have managed to have in this small country of ours.</p><p>The Taoiseach wants us to be the best small country to do business in.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister want this to be the best small country in the world to be sick in, or to be cured by.  Could the Minister please address this?  The friends I am speaking to are getting older.  Consultants in, for example, St. Vincent's University Hospital are leaving as we speak to take up posts abroad.  New, younger consultants are not taking up the positions.  My consultant friends say some of the consultants who are taking those positions are not of the calibre of the consultants we should be attracting to those positions.</p></speech>

I have a few queries on hospital services.  It is good that the Minister is here and it follows on from the briefing that took place in Buswells Hotel when he announced the situation regarding the grouping of hospitals.  In the north east we have major concerns.  They start from the individual hospitals, particularly regarding Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, which is one of the nine small hospitals earmarked in the report to lose their accident and emergency and intensive care services.  Navan is part of a miscellaneous group that does not relate to the geographical area.  The groups will decide within a year how to deal with the issues in the report.  Could the Minister clarify what will happen to the full-time accident and emergency facility in Navan?  The new facility that is being built in Navan was referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, on behalf of the Government in the Seanad on the Adjournment debate a few weeks as an emergency department-minor injury unit.  I want absolute clarity from the Minister on what is planned for Navan regarding that and the intensive care situation.</p><p>A number of hospitals were given guarantees in the hospital group report including Waterford, Tralee, Wexford and Letterkenny.  No such guarantees were given regarding services in Drogheda and Navan.  I want the Minister to explain those omissions and the inclusions of particular hospitals.  Wexford always seems to do quite well when public expenditure is at stake in this country at the moment.  Maybe that is just the way of politics.  That seems to be how things are working.  It got guarantees on the various services there.</p><p>There is major concern about the building of a regional hospital.  Before the election, the Minister's party gave a commitment that it would build a regional hospital for the north east but the Minister's representatives, Deputies in the constituencies of Meath and a number of councillors and business associates said they were in negotiations with developers and investors about building a regional hospital in Navan.  After Christmas, one of the Minister's party colleagues stated that the Department of Health and the HSE were involved in those negotiations and I would like the Minister to set out the exact position on those negotiations which his party colleagues in County Meath claim are taking place and involving his party colleagues and the HSE.  Is there anything happening regarding that situation?</p><p>Perhaps the Minister might have good news for us about the regional hospital today.  Two weeks ago Deputy Regina Doherty announced it was all still going full steam ahead and that is the position on the ground but I would like the Minister to set out the exact position from his point of view.  Is it the way of the future that individual Deputies, politicians and business people will be negotiating Department of Health hospital plans or does the Minister have control over that?  Perhaps he could give an answer to the people of County Meath.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister about that.</p></speech>

Health care reform is a difficult task, particularly in the current financial environment.  The Irish people have heard promises before and have been disappointed.  When elected to government we were given an mandate to radically reform our health service and put the patient at the centre of health reforms.  Under the Minister's stewardship, progress is happening in hospital reform, including reducing trolley waiting times and improving outcomes, with consultants now seeing, treating and discharging patients on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>  The establishment of the hospital groupings is the next major milestone on the path to universal health insurance.  Hospital groups with large and small hospitals working together will provide more freedom to medical and nursing staff to deliver for their patients.  We have some of the world's best health care professionals in this country.  They know better than anybody else that the <i>status quo</i> cannot continue and we must change to meet the needs and expectations of patients and their families.  Ours is a small country with increasing demands on our health system including demographic changes, increased public expectations and inequalities in access to care.</p> <p>It is time to stop throwing money at the health service as was the will of previous Administrations and to work towards building a health care system that is worthy of the people who use it and the staff who work in it.</p><p>Reform of the health service will not be done overnight.  We all know that.  It is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing.  It will take time, patience, diligence and determination.  This move signals a fundamental modernisation of our health system organisation in line with the best international practice.  Each hospital group will have its own governance and management structure designed to deliver better outcomes for its patients.  There has been no hospital framework to date.  Our hospitals have been just evolving with the result that we have had a fragmented service that was riddled with duplication.  That method of running the health service could not be allowed continue not only for cost reasons but for the safety and the health of patients using the services.  </p><p>I would welcome clarification on the problems in regard to recruiting consultants.  That matter has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  How is it intended to address the issue?  Is it as serious as mentioned here that we were not even getting people to apply for consultant positions?  If that were the situation it would be very serious.  This is a difficult task but one on which I am sure the Minister will work in the coming years.  I ask the Minister to outline his plans briefly on the whole question of universal health insurance.  We did not give a commitment to deliver it in this term but to deliver over two terms.  The hospital groupings is a small step towards that.  In his reply perhaps he will give a brief outline on the question of universal health insurance and where we go from here. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and reiterate our support for what he is doing on tobacco.  I note that under a previous Leader of his party, he would be expelled for voting for his own Bill on the branding of tobacco.  I believe he is against plain packaging.  We will be on the Minister's side on that issue.</p><p>We are moving in the right direction in the health service but there are problems.  Do we have an edifice complex?  We have put in &euro;5 billion worth of capital expenditure over ten years and yet the number of acute hospital beds decreased in that period by 1.9%.  Are people staying in hospitals too long?  That is certainly a theme in the Milliman report which shows as follows: medical inpatient admissions, in hospitals paid for by VHI, average 10.6 days, well managed 3.7 days, almost 2.9 times as long; and surgical implant admissions, paid by VHI, average 7.5 days, well managed 3.7 days, two and three times as long.  Does that mean there are two and three times as many hospital beds?  </p><p>Are we deskilling general practitioners?  We have had forums on the issue previously, one of which was chaired by the ubiquitous Mr. Fintan O'Toole when neither of us was in the House at the time.  Do general practitioners near hospitals become clerical people just referring people to consultants and writing references and medical certificates for people who are not really sick.</p><p>I am concerned, as is Senator John Crown, about the bureaucracy problem.  The health service statistics record that we have 8,142 medical and dental staff but 16,000 administrators.  The current Book of Estimates shows those administrators do not come cheaply at about &euro;71,000 per year and the pay has increased by 10%, a combination of a pay increase in the pay bill for the Department Health and a reduction in the number of staff.  I would be concerned about the layers of administration and would share Senator Crown's  concerns in that regard.  </p><p>We need a value for money culture.  I am concerned that so few people who attend accident and emergency units are admitted.  I wonder what kind of accident it was and what kind of an emergency it was and why general practitioners could not have administered to the victims.  I am concerned there are so few new general practitioners when we deregulated access to general medical service.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, told us recently that only about 100 new general practitioners have joined and we still have other general practitioners earning &euro;700,000 per year on that scheme.  I applaud the Minister's radicalism and will not intrude on his time to reply.  There is much to be done.  We need competing hospital trusts, as Senator John Crown said, so as to be able to get value for money.  Too much bureaucracy would stop that.  I deplore as he does the gagging culture in the UK where people are not allowed to speak in public when they want a service, which is a public service, to be improved.  </p></speech>

In response to Senator MacSharry, I will certainly ask the Department to examine the situation.  When will licensing be introduced?  I have discussed the issue on a number of occasions with the chief medical officer.  There is a huge amount of legislation going through the Department at present.  Licensing is quite complex.  I am very concerned that we do not have a licensing system for private hospitals in particular and our citizens need to be protected.  There are other means of intervening and that has happened in the past when there has been trouble and problems but I would much prefer a much more straightforward licensing system and certainly I hope that will be done in the next 18 months.</p><p>To whom will the hospital groups report?  Each hospital group will have its board.  Each hospital will have to report to its board and those boards will have to report to the Department and the health care agency that replaces the HSE.  The Senator was particularly concerned about Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals within the context of the Galway group.  I can understand that given where he comes from and his constituency but one of the reasons these groups have found so much acceptance and have landed so well with the people is that they have seen them in operation and they have seen Galway deliver.  When Mr. Bill Maher took up position?  There were 9,901 people waiting nine months or longer for an inpatient service.  By last September everyone of them was treated.  At the time there were regularly 40 to 50 people on trolleys with an average of 27 on trolleys; the average is now seven people on trolleys.  That is still too many and we will do more to address the issue.</p><p>In relation to Roscommon hospital, there is grave concern over the change from an emergency department to an urgent care centre and what that would mean for the future security of that hospital.  That issue has been more than addressed.   I said in my address that it is a key performance indicator for the new management and a bar they have to cross in terms of proving their fitness to go to trust status that they have devolved resources out to the smaller hospitals.  Specifically for Roscommon hospital, that means a rheumatology service, a phlebotomy clinic and plastic surgery which it never had previously.  Louth hospital has a coloscopy clinic and a range of other services it did not have previously.  There is a menu of about 40 procedures that can be carried out with absolute safety in smaller hospitals.  It is up to each group with parity of esteem to come to a decision on what services each hospital should provide.</p><p>I want to make a general point which cuts across what many people spoke about, namely, the principle of the money follows the patient.  Money follows the patient is coming in on a shadow basis this year and on a full basis next year.  It will drive the group and its CEO to ensure the service is provided at the most cost-effective place and that will be the smaller hospitals because they have less overheads.  Perhaps I can give examples.  There are people from Connemara who are happy to go to Roscommon hospital for their procedures because they can get them done quicker in a nice pleasant environment where there is not the same sense of chaotic activity that sometimes can be the case in a larger model 3 or model 4 hospital.  </p><p>When I visited Ennis hospital where I opened the 50 bed unit, I met a young lady from Limerick who was there for a procedure and was delighted to be there.</p> <p>As people start to experience the new services they will be very happy to travel.</p><p>I want to get through the issues quickly, if I can.  Delivery of service is a key performance indicator and drives the CEO of the group to make sure that services are delivered in the most cost-effective place.  Obviously the lower the overheads then the more cost-effective a place is.  The transfer of resources is an issue.  </p><p>Senator MacSharry mentioned the health service relationship between the north-west region and the North of Ireland.  Real and tangible things are happening in the region.  The Government has invested &euro;19 million in radiotherapy services at Altnagelvin Hospital.  Advanced progress has been made regarding the discussion on a helicopter service.  There is no helicopter service in the North but there is one in the South.  If we expanded the service to Donegal, parts of Sligo, etc., then the North could justify having a helicopter service and we could move our service down as far as the most southerly tip of the country.  We are exploring the initiative and a range of other issues with our northern counterparts.</p><p>We will sign up to a paediatric all-island cardiac surgery service.  A single team of surgeons, comprising people from Belfast and Dublin, will operate at both sites.  The more complex work will be carried out at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, and the less complex work will be carried out in Belfast.  The service will be available to people in Donegal, Sligo and along the Border.  It will be much more convenient for people in the region to bring their children to Belfast rather than Dublin.  We have real co-operation and synergy with our northern counterparts that benefits the health of people living on both sides of the Border.  However, we all know that health and illness do not respect borders and politics.  Once we have the helicopter service in place it will allow access to cardiac stenting 24-7 for people in the north west.  The region does not have the service at present.</p><p>It would be wrong of me to allow Senators to leave here with the impression that Professor Higgins, or any other medic, suggested that the future of the health service was contingent on us building better roads.  That is clearly not the case.  The clinical programmes and the different way that we conduct business is proof of that.</p><p>Several Senators raised the issue of recruitment.  The hospital groups have gone a long way to address the matter and other issues.  Let me explain.  Doctors and other staff like it shown on their curriculum vitae that they have worked at a teaching hospital.  We do not have many teaching hospitals.  The hospitals have grave difficulty attracting and retaining the best clinical staff due to their location and not being a teaching hospital.  Now that each hospital group has a strong academic partner and an academic officer will be on the executive management of a board, a strong association can be made with research and innovation.  </p><p>I will take this opportunity to send a message.  As I travelled around the country I implored all of my people who work in the health service to do the same.  Too often, government and others, have considered health to be a drain on resources.  Health is a resource and a healthy workforce means a healthy economy.  The scale and size of hospital groups along with their strong academic partner means that they will become very attractive to international and national partners for research in terms of medicine, new medical devices and new methods for delivering care.  Dr. Susan O'Reilly, director of the national cancer control programme, HSE, has stated that an improved management and organisation can also improve outcomes for patients by up to 10%.  We have a wonderful opportunity here on a host of levels.  Health is a resource that can deliver in terms of the economy and that is how it must be viewed.  I shall return to the matter at the end of the debate.</p></speech>

I have addressed Senator Keane's concern about a shift of power, money and resources to the centre.  As I have said, the initiative is a key performance indicator but I accept that everybody here shares her concern.  Professor Higgins has made it very clear that the resources is one of the major parameters to judge whether a hospital group is suitable to change to trust status.  The money follows the patient is a further measure that drives the initiative.</p><p>Senator Crown is troubled by the new administrative management arrangements and I shall discuss them in a moment.  However, there will be competition for national and regional management services.  Cost comparisons will be made between trusts.  For example, how much will it cost to treat a patient with a hernia at a trust hospital.  There is no reason for procedures to be more expensive for the Dublin east group than the south-south west group.</p><p>Quality of service is critically important and the new patient safety authority will be very important in this regard.  The authority will provide patients with somewhere where their complaint will be listened to and it will act as a patient advocate.  As I have said often, it has been my experience as a doctor that nine times out of ten people want an acknowledgement that something went wrong, an apology for it going wrong and an assurance that it will not happen again because things will be changed.  With the current system everyone pulls down the shutters leaving patients utterly frustrated and having to resort to litigation.  The issue then takes on a life of its own.  That is very wrong.  A third of compensation for medical legal claims goes to the legal profession.  I have nothing against the legal profession but the money should go to the people who have been harmed.</p><p>Senator Crown raised an issue about using the term &quot;trust&quot;.  Let us examine what happens with trusts based in the UK, even though that may make the Senator a bit nervous.  We have looked to the North of Ireland for information on special delivery units, to Denmark and Canada for patient safety and to Holland and Germany for how to deliver health care using a multiple insurer model.  I heard what the Senator said about the Mid-Staffordshire hospital and health district.  That is why it is so important that key performance and quality indicators are not just box ticking exercises.  They must be real measurable markers for better outcomes for patients.  </p><p>I agree with the point the Senator made about leadership.  We need leadership in medicine and we are getting it through the new clinical programmes.  We need leadership in nursing and we are getting that as well.  A new chief nursing officer has been appointed an assistant general secretary, the highest level in the Department.  The appointment is long overdue.  There have been chief nursing officers before but not at the new level.  Over 37,000 nurses work in the health service and they must be represented at the top table as the health service evolves and reforms.   </p><p>I must talk about managers here because Ireland has not had the required skillset.  Administrators, many of whom are excellent people, have been promoted into management positions without being given the training or skillset to do the job.  Let us compare that with doctors and consultants.  It costs about &euro;1 million to progress from pre-med to consultant level.  A person is supported during the time in terms of studying and continuing professional development.  Even when a person becomes a consultant development is still catered for and encouraged by the tax system.  What is given to managers?  They are just left there.  They do not receive that type of support but we need it.  Equally, six hospital groups will provide us with the level of management expertise that we need and it will grow a new management beneath.  Last year the SDU provided funding to support and train managers.  Thirty people have availed of the initiative and 30 more people will be aided this year.  However, we need to do more.  We will continue to examine the programme.  As I have pointed out, the management and organisation of the health service is critically important in terms of outcomes for patients.</p><p>Senator Crown expressed his concern about the health information Bill.  The legislation is critically important in terms of developing the health service, public health initiatives and screening, etc.  I am quite prepared to listen to his concern about the legislation.  </p><p>Senator Moloney talked about improvements at Kerry General Hospital.  That reminds me of something.  I cannot address the health issue here without mentioning the real and measurable improvements that have taken place despite the loss of 10,000 staff and the &euro;16 billion budget for the health service being reduced by &euro;3 billion.  We have also managed to reduce the number of people who must endure long waiting times on trolleys by 24%.  There are still too many people on trolleys but we are working on the problem.  We met the one-year target in the first year.  In other words, nobody will wait longer than a year for inpatient treatment.  We met the nine month target last year and we will meet the eight month target this year.  The waiting times are still too long but we are working on the problem. </p> <p>We have reduced by 95% the number of people who are waiting longer than 13 weeks for an endoscopy and the number of children who must wait for 20 weeks or longer for an inpatient procedure has also been reduced by 95%.  These are real, measurable and provable.  I am not afraid and nor is my Department of the truth or of putting it out there.  This is the reason that for the first time, the current Administration has measured the number of people who are waiting for an outpatient procedure.  As Senator Moloney mentioned, it is not that 386,000 people are waiting for an outpatient appointment that is the true scandal here.  The true scandal is that more than 16,000 people have been waiting for longer than four years.  That is utterly unacceptable and I have given an undertaking that this problem will be tackled in the same way as were the other problems, which is that when the urgent cases and cancer cases have been dealt with first, the longest waiters will be dealt with thereafter and no one should be waiting for longer than one year by the end of 2013.  I accept this is still too long but we must start and continue from a starting point that is realistic and we will continue to do that.</p><p>Senator Moloney was also concerned about the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and the number of consultants being appointed - I believe Senator Mary Ann O'Brien also raised that issue - and the issue of long-stay care.  The nursing home supports scheme is visible and because it is a pot of money, people head for resources.  We have discussed this issue in the Department and elsewhere and we must have more choice available to people before they enter long-term care.  It should not be a case of hospital, home help and long-term care.  While we need home help and home care packages, we also need supported sheltered housing and tiered support.  I know of particular facilities in the south east, where some people come, stay the day and then go home at night, while others arrive and stay the night and then go home during the day.  We must address people's needs and not dictate the service on the basis of what is available.  Moreover, we must inform ourselves of what are people's needs and we are doing that.  We will have a much greater and broader range of services - with funding.  However, as we only have a limited amount of funding, that funding must come back from long-stay care to pay for these other, more cost-effective and, I believe, better facilities.  I know of no one who wishes to be in long-term care a day before it is necessary to be there.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien was concerned about the reduction of salary for consultants about which I wish to make the following point.  The new consultant starting salary level is &euro;116,000 to &euro;121,000.  While it is all very well to compare this with the salaries that obtain in the United States of America or somewhere like that, why not simply look up the road to the North of Ireland or across the pond to the United Kingdom, where the starting salary for a consultant is &pound;80,000, which is less than &euro;100,000?  As a doctor, an Irishman, an Irish citizen and a republican, I believe it is not simply money that binds our people to our country and I believe we pay well.  I also believe we have a huge problem regarding the cost of insurance in Ireland.  For example, we are paying the same sort of money for procedures that used to take two hours but which now take 20 minutes.  I will give Members a classic example without mentioning any names.  It concerns a particular individual, who complained that he could do only nine procedures all week in the public system but could get ten done on a Saturday.  However, he neglected to mention that he gets &euro;800 a pop, which comes to &euro;400,000 per year for a one-day week.  Consequently, there are serious issues to be addressed in respect of the problems around this matter.   I am not in the game of haranguing consultants because they do phenomenal work.  They are extremely well trained, work extraordinarily hard to get to where they are and must be remunerated properly.  However, this must be done in a transparent way that is fair because if one spends a lot of money on one thing, it means one has less money for something else.  In the past, some doctors would prescribe drugs the cost of which was not their concern.  However, that cannot be the way any more because there is only a single pot of money.  If one prescribes something that is hugely expensive on one side, one will deprive several people on the other side of some other service, perhaps a life saving one.</p><p>As for the issues pertaining to recruitment and career paths, much of this has to do with the nonsense of giving people six-month contracts.  In the main, these are young married men and women with families but who have no certainty.  They spend six months in one place but do not know where they will be six months later.  They should be given three or four-year contracts and I wish to discuss that with the organisations concerned that represent them and with those who are involved.  Equally, however, it also relates to the lack of respect that has been shown to NCHDs.  Moreover, some of that lack of respect has come from senior doctors.  I refer to scenarios in which people are advised that while their contracts provide they work on a nine-to-five basis, which is what they get paid for, they had better be in attendance by 7 a.m. and had better be prepared to stay until 7 p.m. if needed, because otherwise they will not get a reference.  I know this has happened.  Doctors are people and will not wear that.  While they will take the hit for the six months for which they are caught, thereafter they will be gone.  Many of these factors are influencing this problem, as does the issue of the clear career path.  One should be able to come into a hospital and if one does one's work and if one qualifies through the exams, one should then come out as a specialist - end of story.  While one may not get a consultant job, one is a specialist and is recognised as such.  At present, however, that does not happen.  One does not tend to be a specialist until one is given a consultant post.  I want all these issues to be addressed and I want the people to be treated with respect.  Moreover, one of course should encourage people to go abroad to finish their training.  My point is not that I expect a consultant who has worked for ten years abroad as a professor of cardiology to return here and start on a salary of &euro;121,000.  While that is not the case, it is not a bad starting point for a doctor who has just finished his or her training and is now a specialist.  I think it compares favourably with many countries in Europe.</p><p>I agree with Senator Cummins's comments and have covered the issues regarding the recruitment problem, salary and career path.  As for the universal health insurance building blocks, the Senator is absolutely correct but I do not think time will allow me to go into the subject in the manner he would wish.  I undertake to revert to him on it.</p></speech>

I am glad Senator Barrett is on the side of plain packaging for tobacco, an industry that kills one in two of those who use their products.  I agree the number of acute beds has fallen and that is because more day surgery is being carried out.  Moreover, as medical technology advances, one is capable of doing more things more safely within a shorter period as day cases.  The Senator is absolutely correct about deskilling general practitioners, GPs.  When one builds a new hospital, the GPs who live in its shadow can be deskilled.  For example, they might not bother suturing wounds as people can go to the hospital where it is quicker and easier.  We must try to guard against this.  I have spoken about management, training and support.  I imagine the GP on &euro;700,000 has several other GPs working with him or her.  That normally is the case but obviously I cannot state that for every case.  I believe I have covered virtually everyone's questions, with the exception of the issue of the consultant posts.  This is of 1 January 2013 and I note 136 were advertised this year, 34 are at commencement or clearance stage, 52 are at the stage of recruitment and 50 have been filled thus far.  This is from the Department and from the gentleman behind me, Mr. Hardy, who very kindly has gone out to get that information.</p><p>Although I am Minister for Health, I often feel as though I am the Minister for ill-health because all we appear to talk about is disease and illness.  What we really should be about is prevention and about keeping people well.  The Government has bought into this and has launched a framework document, Healthy Ireland, into which all the Ministers bought because they all understand that the Department of Health cannot do this on its own.  It requires input from education and justice to keep the streets safe and from the environment side to provide good footpaths, well-lit areas, etc.  The Government wants to move away from hospital-centric medicine back to the community and indeed back to the patient's house, which technology will permit as time goes by.  I will conclude by noting that the National Health Service was formed in 1948.  It probably is one of the best things Britain did in the last century.  While people there think they did many good things, this is one that has stood the test of time and they did it out of the rubble of the Second World War.  In 1845, the blackest year this country ever endured - we lost 2 million people - there still were people in this country with the vision and conviction to open a new university in Galway in that year.  That is our gene pool and I believe we can take this huge challenge and turn it into a wonderful opportunity to give our people what they want, which is a health service in which everyone feel safe and of which all the people who work therein always feel proud.</p></speech>

In essence, the social welfare system must provide a safety net and a springboard to help people back to work.  To achieve that, my focus has been on transforming the Department from a passive provider of benefits to an organisation that is actively assisting people back to work, training or education.  In this legislation, I continue the necessary and important structural reforms of the social welfare system.  I also make important amendments to the social welfare code on PRSI, jobseeker's payments, fraud prevention and to the pensions code relating to occupational pension provision.</p><p>In his Budget Statement last December, the Minister for Finance announced a number of measures to broaden the income base for PRSI in order to ensure the stability of the Social Insurance Fund.  One of the PRSI base-broadening measures provided for in the Bill extends liability for PRSI contributions in 2013 to certain civil and public sector workers who pay modified rates of PRSI contributions and who also have income from a trade or profession.  They will now be liable for a PRSI contribution of 4% on any income arising from a trade or profession.  I will give an example with which many Members will be familiar.  There are a lot of highly-paid medical consultants who work in the public system but who also have lucrative private practice income.  Up to now, those consultants did not pay PRSI on the private income.  We know from VHI statistics that more than 300 consultants earn in excess of &euro;200,000 from their private practice income and of the 300, one or two earn double the amount.  The Bill will change the situation and result in a fairer system.  The measure will extend the PRSI base to ensure it covers all income of public sector workers from their trades, professions or other employment.  It is anticipated that the change will yield up to &euro;12 million a year in additional PRSI revenue.</p><p>In recent years, reforms have been made to the one-parent family scheme.  We have discussed the scheme at length in the Chamber.  I now propose reforms that will ease the transition of former recipients of one-parent family payment with young children to the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  These parents will be exempted for a transitional period from the full conditionality of the jobseeker's allowance scheme, specifically the criteria that jobseekers must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  However, they will be required to engage fully with the Department's activation process.</p><p>The changes will allow the lone parents in question to seek part-time work rather than full-time work if that better suits their family circumstances.  They will also be able to access existing child care supports and the additional supports I funded for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for 6,000 after-school child care places.  The transitional period will last, provided the individual continues to satisfy entitlement conditions for one-parent family payment other than the relevant age of their youngest child, until the child reaches 14 years of age.  That was an issue we discussed on previous occasions in the Chamber.</p><p>I am introducing changes to jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance to allow for persons working as retained firefighters to be exempted from certain conditions to enable them to access these schemes.  Sometimes the pace of reform in this country is slow but this has been an issue since 1972 &ndash; more than 40 years.  I am delighted we are now bringing in legislation to deal with the matter because retained firefighters are extremely important in their local community.  There are approximately 2,000 of them in total, of whom approximately 800 rely on support from social welfare payments to supplement their income.  This is part of the cost of providing a nationwide part-time fire service.  However, no legislative basis was ever provided to support the position, which led to uncertainty and difficulty for individual firefighters.  I am now bringing clarity to this situation in recognition of the social good of the work of retained firefighters, their service to the community and the bravery and sacrifice shown by fire brigade personnel through the decades.</p><p>It is essential that each person in receipt of a jobseeker's payment fulfils his or her personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State.  Currently, the rules provide for reductions of up to &euro;44 a week in the personal rates of payment for those who refuse to engage in activation.  I propose that the sanctions which currently apply to the refusal to participate in training and education options will be extended to prescribed employment programmes and education courses.  The changes will also provide for a strengthening of the sanctions, in the form of a disqualification for up to nine weeks, where a customer continues to fail to engage with activation measures after the weekly rate of payment has been reduced for more than three weeks.  If people take part then they will go back to the appropriate level of payment.</p><p>Fraud undermines confidence in the entire system and is unfair to genuine claimants and the taxpayers who fund it by paying tax and PRSI.  Identity authentication is an important part of ensuring that only those who are entitled to payment receive it.  I will propose a change to provide for the introduction of a condition for existing recipients of social welfare payment that the person must satisfy the Department as to his or her identity, including allowing for electronic capture of a photograph and signature.  That is already in place for new recipients.  To date, more than 250,000 public services cards have been rolled out, which contain a biometric photograph.  That is of great assistance in terms of limiting fraud and multiple claims.</p><p>Effective debt recovery is a key aspect of my Department's control policy.  I am introducing a provision in the Bill to further improve the Department's ability to recover overpayments.  It is intended to target persons who have a capacity to repay, but repeatedly refuse to do so.</p> <p>This will be undertaken by way of an attachment notice to earnings, moneys due by other Government agencies, or where that individual has funds in financial institutions.  To date we could only address this by going into civil legal proceedings, which are very expensive and lengthy.</p><p>I am also introducing changes to occupational pension provision.  These changes gives effect to the recommendation of the critical review undertaken by the Pensions Board and the Pensions Ombudsman as part of the public services reform plan.  I am also introducing a number of other amendments to the Pensions Act to: give powers to the Pensions Board to wind-up a pension scheme in certain circumstances; provide for the disclosure of information on a proposal by the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits and to provide for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law against a direction by the Pensions Board to restructure a defined benefit pension scheme; provide the Pensions Board with a right of appeal to the High Court to seek compliance with a directive to either restructure scheme benefits or a direction to wind-up a scheme; change the fines regime that applies to personal retirement savings accounts; and amend the terms of office of the Pensions Ombudsman.</p><p>The changes I am bringing forward today will strengthen governance and regulation of occupational pensions and give consumers greater input into pensions policy.  The Pensions Board will be renamed the pensions authority to ensure public awareness and clarity of its role and functions and distinguish it from the policy advisory activities.  I am very aware of the persistent funding challenge facing defined benefit pension schemes.  Greater accuracy of the overall funding position of schemes will be provided after the end of June when schemes submit their funding proposals.  The deadline for funding proposals is 30 June and it is essential that schemes comply with the deadline.</p><p>Trustees must meet their legal obligations.  Ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed.</p><p>There was an expectation that I would be bringing forward in this Bill changes to the manner in which assets are distributed on the wind-up of a pension scheme.  This is a very complex and sensitive issue and one which has received considerable scrutiny in the Department.  In light of the recent decision by the European Court of Justice in the Waterford Crystal case, the Government recognises the need for a comprehensive policy and legislative response that addresses the range of issues involved.  In light of the outcome from the responses to the funding standard and the considerations on the Waterford Crystal case, which are coming back to the Irish courts, I will bring forward proposals to Government on the appropriate policy response.</p><p>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citations, construction and any necessary commencements.  Section 2 defines a number of common terms used in this part of the Bill.  Section 3 replaces references to training provided or approved by F&Aacute;S contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act in light of the new structural arrangements for the provision of State training.  Section 4 amends the definition of a &quot;special contributor&quot; which is used for the purposes of the special collection system operated by the Department of Social Protection for the collection of certain PRSI contributions.  Section 5 is a technical amendment which corrects an error in the wording of section 23(5) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.</p><p>Section 6 extends liability for PRSI contributions to modified rate PRSI contributors.  Section 7 provides for a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to take account of the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  Section 8 amends the conditions of entitlement applying to the partial capacity benefit scheme.  Section 9 provides for changes to the jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance schemes to exempt persons who are working as retained fire­fighters from certain conditionality due to the nature of that employment.</p><p>Section 10 provides for amendments to the jobseeker's allowance scheme to cater for the transition of persons to that scheme who no longer qualify for one-parent family payment due to their youngest child reaching specified age thresholds.  Section 11 extends the identity authentication requirements that currently apply to new applicants for a social welfare payment, a personal public service number or a public services card to existing recipients of social welfare payments under which they must agree to have a biometric standard photograph and electronic signature taken. </p><p>Sections 12, 13 and 14 provide for extension of the sanctions which currently apply to refusals to participate in training and education options to prescribed employment programmes and education courses.  These sections also provide for a strengthening of the sanctions, in the form of a disqualification for up to nine weeks, where a customer continues to fail to engage with activation measures after the weekly rate of payment has been reduced for more than three weeks.</p><p>Section 15 provides for notices of attachment for the recovery of social welfare overpayments from earnings or money in financial institutions.  This measure will be used in circumstances where a person who has been actively engaged with by the Department, refuses to co-operate with the repayment of his debt and where there is evidence of an ability to repay.</p><p>Section 16 provides that a working director with a shareholding of 50% or more in a company will not be regarded as being insurable as an employed contributor in that company.  Company directors holding 50% or more of the shareholding of a company are not normally regarded as falling within a normal employer/employee relationship and are therefore deemed not to be employed under a contract of service and liable for PRSI class A contributions as an employee.</p><p>Section 17 clarifies the operation of the income disregard which is used for the purposes of the rent and mortgage interest supplement schemes.  Section 18 extends the list of bodies that are authorised to use the personal public service number for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public and for sharing personal information.  The new bodies being included are the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, and payment service providers who have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the local property tax.</p><p>Section 19 is a technical amendment.  Section 20 provides for amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004, to allow for the provision of index information from the registers of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in order to facilitate access to this index information.  Index information on adoptions and stillbirths is excluded on privacy grounds.</p><p>Section 21 defines the term the &quot;Principal Act&quot;.  Section 22 inserts a definition of the pensions council which is being provided for in the new section 26B of the Pensions Act 1990 and amends the definition of employer to allow for a separate definition of employer used in the new section 5OB. </p><p>Sections 26, 27, 28, 29 and 34 provide for structural changes to the Pensions Board.  Section 30 amends section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990 to provide for the disclosure of information.  Section 31 inserts a new section 5OB in the Pensions Act 1990.  Section 32 inserts a new section 50C in the Pensions Act 1990.  Section 33 extends the age on which the Pensions Ombudsman must vacate that office in the context of that office being merged with the Financial Services Ombudsman being merged.</p><p>This Bill is another positive step on the road to reforming our social welfare system into an active, positive system that provides income support to a vast number of people but which all helps those who have become unemployed or who are of working age and out of the labour force to re-enter work, education and training and, where they are unemployed, to cooperate with the Department in availing of the assistance offered by it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300019#S00100"><p>I welcome the Minister.  As she outlined, the Bill provides for a range of amendments to the social welfare Acts, including, for the first time, extending PRSI contributions to individuals who have an income from a trade or profession.  However, it does not address the long-term deficit in the Social Insurance Fund and the range of benefits it should support, while the self-employed will continue to be excluded from a range of benefits.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party position on pensions is that we require a pensions structure which is financially sustainable and socially adequate.</p><p>  The Bill also includes changes to the governance of the Pensions Board and gives the board powers to wind up a pension scheme in certain circumstances.  However, it fails to address the need for greater protection for beneficiaries when a pension scheme winds up and does not address the fact that only 54% of the workforce has pension coverage, an issue to which I will return presently.</p><p>  The Bill proposes changes to the jobseeker's allowance scheme to cater for the transition of persons who no longer qualify for one-parent family payment.  The Government decided that for new applicants, as of 3 May 2012, the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the one-parent family payment would reduce to 12 years and the limit would eventually reduce to seven years in 2014.  The Minister gave an undertaking that she would only proceed with the measure to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that she secured a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  The issue of child care provision was shown in sharp relief in a recent &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme.  All sorts of kites have been flown on the issue of child benefit.  We heard, for example, that the payment could be reduced or reallocated to pay for the provision of additional child care places or other child care services.  In light of the sensitivities associated with this issue, I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate her current thinking on this matter and whether she has received a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of a system of child care.  </p><p>    I welcome the measure to provide index information relating to births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships and the provision to facilitate online access to this information.  I also welcome the decision to give part-time firefighters an entitlement to jobseeker's payments, a measure for which Fianna F&aacute;il has long campaigned.  Until now, many retained firefighters were deemed ineligible for jobseeker's allowance on the ground that they were not available for or seeking work.  Under the legislation, if a person works five days as a firefighter, he or she will receive five days of jobseeker's benefit.  I am curious to ascertain the Minister's thinking on the position of the acting profession.  I speak as a member of Irish Actors Equity, which primarily arises from my broadcasting activity rather than any acting prowess I may have.  As the Minister is aware, I am surrounded by actors in this House and the other House and I defer to their greater wisdom.  I ask for an update on this issue on which I campaigned some years ago when Irish Actors Equity argued that social welfare legislation was anomalous in that actors were not deemed to be available for work.  Of the approximately 1,500 members of Irish Actors Equity, approximately two thirds do not have acting work at any one time but must survive without assistance.  Has the Minister received representations in this regard?  Does she have sympathy with members of the acting profession?</p><p>  I do not know the reason firefighters have been singled out.  I was informed earlier when I asked - perhaps naively - why this was the case, that firefighters were probably able to mount a better lobby than the acting profession.  If that is the case, so be it but I would be grateful if the Minister were to outline her position on the matter because the current position is unfair.  I recall that lollipop men and women were also deemed to be unavailable for work.  In light of the uncertain nature of employment in the acting profession, some understanding should be shown of the position in which actors find themselves.  After all, Ireland prides itself on its actors and literary giants and we like to be associated with them when they are winning awards.  We should address the problem that arises when actors are unable to finance themselves because they cannot work.  </p><p>  On the governance, structure and power of the Pensions Board, the Bill gives the board a new power to wind up a pension scheme where it is under-funded, the trustees and employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal and the trustees fail to comply with a direction to restructure scheme benefits.  This power needs to be used judiciously.  The provision providing for a newspaper notification when a fund is being wound up at the direction of the new pensions authority is inadequate.  Every effort should be made to notify the beneficiaries when it is proposed that a scheme be closed.  Moreover, the period of 21 days' notice is not adequate, especially given the growing number of people who no longer read a newspaper.  There was a time when politicians used to tremble in fear of what journalists might write about us.  We are moving into an entirely new media age in which it no longer matters what journalists write because people no longer read newspapers.  While politicians educate and inform themselves using all available media outlets, members of the public do not know what one is talking about when one mentions a particular story or article.  This provision should be revisited because newspaper notifications may not be the best approach to this issue.  Given the manner in which the media treat this House, it is no harm having diversity among the media.</p><p>  The pensions council should have a stronger consumer focus.  In particular, it should examine the issue of pension charges.  The Minister and I exchanged views on this matter and I believe we are <i>ad idem</i> on it.  One of the persistent criticisms levelled at the private pensions industry is that it is designed to make vast sums for the pension companies, fund managers, administrators and intermediaries.  Frequently described as opaque and confusing, the industry offers mediocre to poor value for pension holders.  I ask the Minister to comment.  While I doubt her views on the issue have changed significantly in recent months, it is important that she place them on record.  I am sure she is not only acutely aware of the problem but also intends to address it. </p><p>  The <i>status quo</i>  as regards pension priority orders remains.  While the Government has stated it is committed to keeping defined benefits intact, the uncertain legislative framework is creating incentives to close defined benefit pension schemes.  This will lead to outcomes which the Government has described as inequitable.  The Government should act to prevent solvent firms from walking away from defined benefit schemes that are in deficit.  The OECD recommends that a minimum of 90% funding should be achieved before a scheme can be closed in a case where the parent company is in financial health.  To reflect more diverse working patterns the State should establish a national pension tracing service.</p><p>  The Bill does not address pension coverage.  According to the Pensions Board, only 54% of the workforce has pension coverage and there are wide disparities in coverage within the working population.  For example, coverage in the public service stands at more than 90%, whereas it is very low in some areas of the private sector.  The national pensions framework published by the previous Government in 2010 cites the examples of the hotel and restaurant sector where pension coverage is a miserly 23% and the wholesale and retail trade where it is 36%.</p><p>  A survey on pensions found that of those who do not contribute to a pension, almost 80% indicated that the State pension will not meet their needs in retirement.  Some 43% of respondents indicated they had not been offered access to a pension, despite the legal obligation on employers to offer employees access to a pension.  Of the 43% of respondents who had not been offered access to a pension, almost 100% had never asked their employer about access to a pension.  These figures highlight serious inadequacies in the system and major information gaps which the Department must address.  Although awareness of the tax relief available for pension contributions is relatively high, at 73%, the majority of respondents were not aware of or incorrectly understood the amount of tax relief that applied to them. </p><p>  Mandatory pensions should be given serious consideration.  Among OECD countries, only Ireland and New Zealand do not have compulsory pension contributions.  While most of the amendments are to be welcomed as progressive changes in how the Department of Social Protection and new pension authority conduct their business, the fundamental questions surrounding pension provision have yet to be answered by the Government.  </p></speech>

This is a good housekeeping Bill, which is detailed, current and relevant, especially in light of our changing social and economic circumstances.  I have a number of questions on the measures provided for in the legislation.  Under section 4, PRSI will be remitted directly to the Department in limited circumstances, for example, in cases of workers who are abroad.</p> <p>The Minister might give us an example of when that would apply.  I presume it does not apply to the immigrants who come here.  Does it apply only to Irish residents who would occasionally work abroad?  Will the Minister give us an example of what she means?  If the income or job is established in this country as a base, with occasional work abroad, would the persons in question not be charged PRSI in any case?  I would like to know more about that.</p><p>Section 5 deals with elections by wife or civil partner, where that person is self-employed, to have PRSI liabilities charged against the other.  Why would that be so?</p></speech>

However, even in the case of married people, is it that the self-employed person does not earn enough income in the first place to pay PRSI?  The Minister might elaborate.  I thought about what the Minister said in regard to section 6, about the 4% PRSI rate against certain trades or professions.  It is stunning to think that consultants with a private practice have been earning these substantial incomes up to now and were not subject to PRSI.  Why was that?  The Minister said this will bring in an extra &euro;12 million in additional PRSI.  Will the Minister elaborate in her answer as to what other types of trades and professions this might apply?  These are the examples that matter.  We know there is not a lot of low-hanging fruit and we want to ensure there is fair treatment.</p></speech>

This is good and is welcome.  What I like about this measure is that the Minister is taking on board the changing circumstances for one-parent families as a child grows up.  The Minister is naming this as a transitional allowance so it will work itself out when a child reaches certain ages.</p></speech>

This is a progressive measure.  Well done by the Minister.</p><p>Section 11 is interesting.  The Minister is looking to authenticate identity for personal public service, PPS, numbers and public service cards.  How advanced is this process and when will it be complete?  This is critical to ward against fraud.  A photo and an electronic signature will be required.  Is that better than fingerprinting, which applies in other jurisdictions?  The Minister might comment on that.  The electronic signature interested me because we are very behind in this compared with the rest of Europe.  I was at an EU meeting which pointed out that if electronic signatures were in place across the EU, as part of a services directive we could gain 2% growth in GDP because we would be able to engage in business across the EU.  Not only Ireland but every country needs to do this.  I presume once the Minister introduces this measure, it will help us to meet our services directive obligations across the EU.  This must be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>Section 12 mentions the directors with 50% or more shareholding who are being moved to a PRSI class contribution.  How much will that be and what benefits will these people gain?  The self-employed person has been treated badly in this country, as the Minister has acknowledged, especially when their income falls or their business folds.</p><p>I refer to section 13.  Will the Minister explain a little better about the income disregard for the rental and mortgage income supplement?  Why does this apply to some but not all income?  It is very good that the PPS number is being broadened to take into account things such as property tax, etc.  I commend the Minister on the notice of attachment which will keep us out of the courts as much as possible.</p><p>The issue of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 is a big one and I have a big question for the Minister.  I have been lobbying for this for a long time, as she knows, though possibly not for what the Minister might be thinking about in this regard.  There are two parts to this, the first being to enable online searching for genealogy purposes.  I presume when the Minister gives access to the register of deaths and marriages, etc, the people under consideration are no longer living.  That is important for data protection.</p><p>What I look to the Minister to amend in the Civil Registration Act 2004 concerns the registration of deaths abroad.  We have had conversations about this, both public and private.  Our Irish citizens who die abroad while on holidays and who carry Irish passports do not have their deaths registered in this country.  The trauma and grief and the lack of closure for grieving families in this area are considerable.  I have met the Minister's principal officer in the Department and I know she is moving on this.  If she referred to this in the summary, it would be truly appreciated.  There are people waiting for this response today, as I speak.  In the last term in this House,  the social protection committee had a very long session where families came before the Chair to talk about the closure it would bring to their grief if they knew that their Irish children, husbands and wives who had died abroad could at least have their deaths registered here.</p><p>On the issue in Part 4, under section 60-----</p></speech>

I commend the Minister on the pensions council.  It is a good idea because the pensions area is very complex.  Will the eight members the Minister is to nominate be from the industry?  When will this happen?  I know they will be unpaid but will they receive expenses?</p><p>Section 26 regards the direction and restructuring of a pension scheme.  Has the Minister applied this in many cases?  The area of pensions is a mess at present.  Section 27 gives the Minister power to wind up a pension scheme that is underfunded.  Will all members of the scheme be notified and what will happen to their contributions?  This is a very big concern.  I note the Minister stated that after 30 June, she will have an update on overall funding of schemes.  Will she give the House a statement at that point?</p><p>That sums up my position.

It is great to have the opportunity to debate the Bill, which incorporates many changes in light of the Minister's commitment to reform, something I always like to acknowledge.  I welcome her efforts, particularly those to allow for the transition of lone parents to the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  Senator Healy Eames identified many of the aspects.  I love the language the Minister uses, noting the importance of "easing" their transition.  She really has listened to the advocates in that regard and I commend her on that.</p><p>I have a couple of concerns about the effects of the transition status, which I will mention.  In addition, I have grave reservations about some significant amendments to the Bill that were included after its publication.  I question whether this provides us with adequate time for proper scrutiny.  I refer to sections 12 to 14, which comprise 12 pages, and section 15, which comprises pages of the Bill, as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I particularly note section 15.  In her speech the Minister noted the section is about debt recovery.  The language of the speech states it is important to be more &quot;efficient&quot;.  We would all say &quot;yes&quot; to that, but is that efficiency as benign as it sounds in the way the Minister has laid it out?</p><p>I have two questions that relate to the effect of the transition from the one-parent family payment to jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p>The first relates to the 156-day rule.  One cannot receive a payment for a child dependant aged between 18 and 22 years and in full-time education unless one is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or other specified relevant payments for 156 days or more.  Those in receipt of such payments can claim &euro;29.80 per week.  That 156-day rule did not apply to those in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  The question for those coming off the one-parent family payment is whether the time they spent on the payment count towards the 156 days when they apply for jobseeker's allowance.  It appears that on making a claim for jobseeker's allowance, which means the claim would not be 156 days old, the payment cannot be made.  I have been advised that periods spent on the jobseeker's allowance can be combined with time spent on relevant payments for the purpose of the 156-day rule.  A cursory examination of what constitutes a relevant payment, as contained in section 2(4) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, appears to include the one-parent family payment but that interpretation is not consistent with the information provided on the Department's website.  I ask the Minister to clarify to the House the legal position for one-parent families who make new claims for jobseeker's allowance.  Will they lose income supports for their children over the age of 18 and in full-time education or will they retain these supports?</p><p>The second issue pertains to the fuel allowance.  The national fuel scheme is a very valuable administrative scheme open to people on long-term social welfare payments, including those in receipt of one-parent family payments.  Currently the allowance is worth &euro;20 per week for the fuel season.  Those who are in receipt of the one-parent family payment receive the allowance but I understand one must be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for 390 days before being considered eligible for the fuel allowance.  There is no administrative position to allow those moving from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's allowance to retain the fuel allowance.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether those who have been on one-parent family payments will continue to receive the fuel allowance when they make that transition.</p><p>Sections 12 to 14 appear to give officials increased powers in regard to activation measures.  They can decide to withdraw social welfare payments where an individual does not, without good cause, do what a official deems appropriate in terms of taking up work, training, etc.  I am in favour of increasing efficiency and providing active and progressive activation measures but it is important that we know the circumstances in which it is proposed to stop a person's basic payment.  It seems that claimants will have little control or power in this regard.  A person is unlikely to protest a recommendation by an official at the risk of losing a payment, even if the recommendation is inappropriate.</p><p>Section 15, which was added only recently,  presents a change that should not be driven through in haste.  The Minister indicated to the D&aacute;il that she delayed in presenting the section because she was awaiting clearance from the Attorney General on the complex amendments it contains.  I agree these are serious legal matters and they require proper scrutiny and debate.  I wonder, however, whether the section is necessarily based on information from the Department that the money is rightly and properly owed.  Are we to accept that the information is correct and, once owed, that the Department as creditor should receive favourable treatment?  We are to decide on this with little opportunity to examine the legal ramifications of this extensive amendment.  What is at stake?  As the Minister indicated to the D&aacute;il, she already introduced measures in the Social Welfare Act 2012 to recover social welfare overpayments through weekly deductions from persons' ongoing social welfare entitlements.  That Act provided for deductions of up to 15% of the weekly personal rate to those on social welfare payments.  I did not get an opportunity to object to that provision because the Bill was guillotined in the House.  My primary objection is that a minimum income to meet basic needs did not apply to those in welfare debt, whereas the mortgage debt and personal insolvency legislation set out guidelines for a minimum standard of living.  The section is based on the presumption that the money is rightly and properly owed, that is, it is a legitimate debt to the Department.  Can the Minister guarantee to the House that each and every person who receives a decision from her officials to the effect that he or she owes money will be able to access competent independent advice when the decision is being made?  Will they be able to appeal those decisions?  Will notices of attachment only be used where there is evidence of ability to repay and how will that evidence be determined?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300021#U00200"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House for the second day in a row.  I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Members for facilitating yesterday's debate on youth unemployment and the youth guarantee.  I commend the Minister on her efforts to move social welfare from a passive system to an organisation that activates people to work.  I know from experience in my area that the new office in Killarney is working well.  I have been in touch with many of the new social welfare officers who tell me to send people down to them because they are there every Tuesday evening.  An appointment is not necessary.  Many people are not aware of what is available for them but the new system is working well.</p><p>Like Senator Zappone I will confine my remarks to certain issues today because we will have more time to debate the Bill in detail next week.  I welcome the broadening of the PRSI base.  Every time we speak about funding we seem to use hospital consultants as an example.  Earlier today we had a lengthy debate with the Minister for Health on the lack of hospital consultants.  Although he argued that money does not tie a person to a country or a job, I am afraid that it has a significant influence.  Senator Healy Eames asked why this was not applied previously.  I understand that a ceiling formerly applied to the income subject to PRSI and an individual was not liable for PRSI on earnings above that ceiling.  I welcome that provision is being made to address that issue.  It is anticipated that the change will yield up to &euro;12 million per annum.  Will that money be reinvested in the social insurance fund or will it be spent elsewhere?  I would welcome any measure that builds up the social insurance fund, which has been raided over the years because the money was badly needed.  </p><p>The jobseeker's transition allowance is a welcome measure, particularly in respect of parents who are about to come off the one-parent family payment.  Activation is the key word in this regard.  Many parents, including working couples as well as lone parents, find they have to give up work in order to look after their children.  As they might be able to access part-time jobs, it would be welcome if the allowance could apply in those circumstances.  They are currently disqualified from applying for jobseeker's benefit or allowance because they are not available for full-time work.  I recognise there is more pressure on families with lone parents than on those with two parents but the problem exists for both types of family.  </p> <p> Last year, the Minister announced that she would not make changes to the one-parent family payment unless proper, safe, cheap and accessible child care was put in place.  I accept that she has started the ball rolling in this regard.  However, I am of the view that what is proposed in the legislation represents another step towards putting in place child care of the sort to which the Minister previously referred because parents will now be available to mind their children when they have finished school for the day.  There is no better place for a child to be than in the safe hands of his or her parents.  In a way and albeit by a different method, the Bill before the House is putting additional child care in place.</p><p>I am aware that the Minister has proposals regarding changes to family income supplement in respect of lone parents who are working.  Those who lose their one-parent family payments and who are receipt of family income supplement cannot have their cases reviewed for one year.  In other words, once the decision is made it obtains for 12 months.  I know the Minister had proposals to introduce changes which would allow for a mid-term review in this regard.  That is most welcome because I have come across many lone parents whose payments have been reduced either as a result of the income they receive for part-time work increasing or because they have lost their entitlement to those payments.  The family income supplement paid to such individuals could not be adjusted to take account of these reductions and, in such circumstances, the Minister's proposals are very welcome.  Perhaps she might make arrangements to bring forward those proposals as quickly as possible in order that they might be implemented.</p><p>I live in a rural area and retained firefighters are extremely important.  There is no doubt about that.  It is actually sad that it has taken 40 years for us to reach our current position.  Successive Governments of various hues were responsible for failing to take action on this matter.  We are all, therefore, to blame for the fact that this matter has not been dealt with previously.  Fair play to the Minister, however, because she is prepared to take action and make changes.  It is essential that firefighters should live in close proximity to their fire stations.  They must be able to get to those stations quickly in order that all the necessary personnel can travel to the scene of an emergency as fast as possible.  The distance which firefighters must travel to their stations definitely has a bearing in this regard.</p><p>On the penalty rates, will the Minister outline whether there are exemptions for people who are the subject of activation measures?  If a person is sick and cannot attend for activation, then he or she would obviously be on a different payment.  Are there any reasons that people do not make themselves available for activation?</p><p>In the context of fraud, I visited my local office in the company of the Minister a couple of weeks ago and we were informed in detail about the photographic identification required of clients.  What technology makes possible is absolutely fantastic.  For example, the technology they are using now allows local offices to make exact photographic representations of individual clients' faces and this means it is not possible for others to present in their place.  Perhaps last year or the year before someone suggested that clients' fingerprints should be taken and people were up in arms about this.  However, fingerprinting is becoming a way of life and my husband and his work colleagues are obliged to present at fingerprint readers on their way into work each day.  We will watch this space in order to see what happens.</p></speech>

A large number of these individuals are quite elderly and incapacitated and they may not be able to present themselves to be photographs.  I am concerned that their payments will be stopped.  I am aware of a lone parent whose payment was stopped.  She received a letter requesting that she attend to be photographed but she rang the Department and indicated that she could not be present at the time stipulated because she was working.  The message did not get through the system and her payment was stopped.  Having the payment restored - this eventually happened - proved messy.  I am concerned that pensioners' payments might be stopped if they do not attend to be photographed.  Perhaps the Minister might monitor how matters proceed in this regard.</p><p>It is harsh that where an overpayment is the fault of the Department, the recipient is required to pay back the full amount.  I am of the view that there should be room for negotiation in this regard.  Fraud of this nature is not intentional and is the fault of the Department.</p><p>There is much more I wish to say but I will have to wait until Committee Stage.

We can discuss the matters to which I refer in greater detail on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Is bre&aacute; an rud &iacute; a fheice&aacute;il ar&iacute;s.  Is d&oacute;cha nach gcuirfidh s&eacute; iontas uirthi go bhfuilimid i gcoinne an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Aithn&iacute;mid go bhfuil c&eacute;imeanna dearfacha sa Bhille agus f&aacute;ilti&iacute;mid rompu.  N&iacute;limid t&oacute;gtha le p&iacute;osa&iacute; &aacute;irithe den reachta&iacute;ocht seo agus, d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute;imid ag cur ina gcoinne.</p><p>As the Minister is aware, there are measures within the legislation which we welcome and which are positive in nature.  However, we consider that there are other measures which could have been taken in the context of reversing and mitigating cuts that were made prior to the introduction of the Bill.  Most crucially, the legislation contains provisions which we consider punitive and to which we are opposed.  It is for this reason that we will be voting against the legislation.</p><p>I will comment, in the first instance, on the changes which are to be welcomed.  We welcome the fact that the Minister has, to some extent, qualified the cut to the one-parent family payment.  The Bill introduces measures to allow for the transition of lone parents to the jobseeker's allowance scheme when they no longer qualify for the one-parent family payment due to their youngest child reaching specified age thresholds.  I understand, on foot of a memorandum produced by the Minister's Department, that former recipients of the one-parent family payment will be exempt from a number of the conditions relating to jobseeker's allowance for a transitional period up until their youngest child reaches 14 years of age.  Such lone parents will, therefore, be placed on the targeted version of jobseeker's allowance to be known as jobseeker's transition.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposes, in the strongest terms, the change of the qualifying age for the child from 14 years to seven.  We also oppose the removal of the transitional payment which had previously been in place in this regard and which had facilitated single parents being able to return to the labour force.  This is important and we should ensure that there are no disincentives for single parents in the context of their returning to the workforce.  When the previous legislation in this area - matters relating to which the Bill before the House is meant to tidy up - was introduced, Sinn F&eacute;in flagged this as a considerable mistake which it viewed as regressive and as placing single parents at a disadvantage.  The Minister has partially reversed the change, which is welcome.  However, it is a piecemeal solution.  The decision to change the age of entitlement relating to the payment has not been reversed.</p><p>The Minister had indicated that there was a need for a proper system of child care, funded either partially or wholly by the State, and that this would compensate in the change in the age of entitlement relating to the single-parent payment from 14 years to seven.  It is Sinn F&eacute;in's view that she is putting the cart before the horse.  Why not simply repeal the section which changed the age qualification for one-parent families from 14 to seven years.  This matter might, perhaps, be reconsidered when a Scandinavian model of child care is available in the State.  However, we do not have such a model at present and we are not likely to have one in the near future because the necessary investment is not available.  It is all very well to talk about the Scandinavian model but the reality is that we are million miles away from having it.  The correct thing to do would be to reverse the change relating to the age of entitlement.</p><p>There are also positives in that the Bill provides that retained firefighters will be exempt from certain conditions which apply in respect of the jobseeker's benefit and allowance schemes.  I note Senator Mooney's comments.  Perhaps he is thinking ahead.  If the Seanad is abolished, he may wish to dust off his Equity card.  The Senator raised a very pertinent matter.  As someone who was involved in the media industry and who worked with actors in a professional capacity, I am aware that there is an issue with regard to actors who do not have full-time permanent employment and who depend on jobseeker's allowance to tide them over between jobs.  It would be worthwhile considering what Senator Mooney said about facilitating such individuals, possibly in a similar fashion to firefighters.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that matter.  The changes relating to the firefighters take account of the very specific nature of their conditions of employment, which limit their flexibility considerably.  Again, these individuals were placed at a disadvantage by the changes introduced in the previous legislation.  We raised the matter relating to them on a number of occasions.  The firefighters implemented a considerable lobby on this matter and it is positive that they have reaped their reward.</p><p>Other welcome changes include the provision for appeals under section 8 of the previous legislation, which relates to those on partial capacity benefit being able to appeal.  We are of the view that this provision should have been in place from the outset and we welcome the fact that the matter is now being dealt with.  Section 14 allows for the use of PPS numbers by more organisations.  State organisations requiring access to PPS numbers should now be facilitated more speedily, albeit subject to the provisions of data protection law.  I also welcome the provisions which deal with the anomalies in the civil partnership legislation.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is disappointed with regard to some of the areas in which changes have not been introduced.  Changes in the structure of the social welfare system have led to many people either struggling to cope or living in dire poverty.</p> <p>We believe there are retrograde decisions which need to be reversed as soon as possible.</p><p>The Minister has claimed there have not been cuts to social welfare rates but Sinn F&eacute;in has shown repeatedly that there have been such cuts.  One of the latest cuts was to jobseeker's benefit.  It is a cut if one changes the eligibility period for jobseeker's benefit from 12 to nine months.  That amounts to a cut of three months in a person's jobseeker's benefit.  There are many other examples.</p><p>There are sections of this legislation to which we are totally opposed and it is on the basis of those sections added on Committee Stage that we will be voting against the legislation.</p><p>Section 12 deals with sanctions for those who have not been able to find employment and whom the Minister believes have not done enough to seek employment.  The reality is that we all know countless people who have lost a job.  They are very keen to find employment.  They do not want to be at home.  The hope of finding employment is foremost in their minds.  It is a time which all of those who have to go through it find difficult mentally and emotionally.  </p><p>We believe there is a responsibility on jobseekers to engage with activation measures.  However, there can be valid reasons for a failure to engage such as when activation programmes are not available and there is no access to training and education at a given time.  It is the case that in many areas the opportunities do not exist to take up education and training schemes, and community employment schemes cannot cope with the demand for places.</p><p>The Bill gives greater responsibility to the inspectors to decide what is a good cause for missing such a meeting or engagement, and there is no definition in the Bill.  We believe that could lead to inconsistency.</p><p>I note also that there is an issue with workers who have reached the age of 65.  They have reached the age of retirement as it was when they started employment.  They are now expected to comply to the same standards as other workers even though it is likely they will not be able to find employment.  There should be some recognition through a transitional arrangement for those who are aged 65 years and over.</p><p>We will be opposing the legislation and will seek to table amendments on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300023#W00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Burton, and I welcome the Bill.  I regard the Minister as a reforming Minister who appreciates that a Department that spends &euro;20 billion per annum, or 40% of Government expenditure, must regularly review and refine the various schemes designed to assist so many of our citizens.</p><p>Many people who today rely on social welfare never expected or intended to be in that position, and we must redouble our efforts to help get those people back to work and contributing to the economy.  There must be closer linkage between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure that impediments to taking up employment opportunities are minimised.  There is a debate on the issue of how we can ensure that happens.</p><p>There are some positive elements in the Bill.  I welcome the progressive scheme to help lone parents return to work.  We all agree that paid work is the best way out of poverty and social exclusion but it is crucial that lone parents are helped in a compassionate and supportive way to return to work in a way that best suits their family circumstances.  </p><p>All of us want the Minister to take a hard line on social welfare fraud because fraudsters are taking money that is needed to support the most vulnerable in our society.  I hope the improved security measures - photographs and electronic signature - is sufficient given the sophistication of today's criminals.  I want a security system that is foolproof.  We have the technology and the expertise to put in place a system that will crack down on this once and for all.  We do not want to hear any more stories of multiple PPS numbers, multiple claims or foreigners flying in monthly to collect large sums of money, although it is possible some of those stories are exaggerated.  We must get to grips with that particular problem.</p><p>In trying to crack down on that type of crime, would the Minister consider the possibility of an amnesty?  In other words, if people came clean regarding their social welfare fraud could they possibly evade having a more severe penalty imposed on them?  The Minister might consider that suggestion.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's decision to improve pensions governance and oversight.  In recent years we all saw the carnage in private pensions schemes that were under-funded by employers and that left employees without a pension or with only a fraction of the pensions they expected on retirement.  We need a wider debate on the pensions industry and pension reform, as well as a legislative response to the European Court of Justice decision in the Waterford Crystal case.</p><p>One section of society that has been very badly treated by the State in recent years is the people who are self-employed.  Those are the people who created many jobs during the good times.  While their employees were entitled to redundancy payments and unemployment benefit, they were entitled to nothing.  That cannot be fair or equitable, and I ask the Minister to address that injustice.  If we want people to be risk takers and create badly needed jobs, there must be support available if those enterprises fail.</p><p>I welcome the section that resolves the issue for the retained firefighters.  It was an issue on which I campaigned because coming from a rural area I know the importance of having our retained firefighters available in emergencies.  They should not be discriminated against, and I very much welcome that the Minister has addressed that issue.</p><p>I ask the Minister to examine and support Senator Healy Eames in respect of the registration of the deaths of people who died outside the country.  The relatives of those people need closure.  It should be a simple process to address the issue, and I genuinely believe it is within the Minister's gift to address it for once and for all.</p><p>There is a real need for efficiencies in this area.  I am keen that we would pay people in a way that is safe and that we will move to a cashless system of payment but I have a concern that many of our rural post offices will suffer as a result of that.  I am concerned also about people getting moneys paid into their bank accounts.  I discovered recently, and business people are bringing it to my attention, that if one goes into a bank in any town, including my town, on a Saturday afternoon the chances are one will be unable to get money out of the ATM machine because the banks are not putting the facilities in place to top up those machines over the weekend.  That is affecting local businesses-----</p></speech>

I know the banks want everybody to opt for payment by card, thereby eliminating the need for cash, but the customer is paying dearly for that.  Business is suffering as a result of the banks failing to give a service to the customers that the customers deserve.  As a Government we need to examine that.</p><p>The Minister is a member of a Government that was given a mandate to fix a badly broken economy.  The people want her to succeed and return our country to prosperity.  They expect fairness, and I believe the Minister is trying hard to spend her budget in a way that targets the least well-off in our society.  She has the support of the people, and I wish her continued success in the reforms she is attempting to make.</p></speech>

There is some element of a climb-down in this Bill, which shows that people who object to this Government are not always wrong and that sometimes they can be right and have a point.</p><p>In so far as the Minister's proposals go, I welcome them.  I welcome changes regarding the retained firemen.  I regret there is nothing in the Bill relating to mortgage interest supplement, which was a particularly cruel cut introduced this time last year when people were put in the hands of the bank.  Effectively, what has happened, and it is up to us to change it, is that people are not aware of mortgage interest supplement now.  I met a couple last week who were a year on a revised payment with the bank and I told them they should apply for mortgage interest supplement, but they did not know about it.  They had just been told by the community welfare officer that they were not eligible for it.  People need to be aware of their rights.</p><p>I was disappointed when the Minister announced major changes to rent supplement and that, in regionalising certain counties, she did not do the same in County Meath.  I am aware representations were made by some of her colleagues from County Meath on the rent allowance where rents in Dunboyne, beside the Minister's area, and in south Meath are vastly in excess of rents in other parts of the county, although it must be said that the rental market in County Meath is extremely tight and it is helping to create a massive housing crisis.  The uniform rate for rent allowance in County Meath is not helping matters.  I thought when the Minister changed it in Kildare, Fingal or other areas that Meath would be included but I understand it was not, which was a mistake.  The Minister's colleagues told us they had been in contact with the Minister about it.  I hope she would listen to them and re-examine this because there is a strong case to be made on the rents in County Meath.  There are massive regional variations but, overall, they are quite high in what is a tight market.</p><p>This is the type of Bill that is published at this time every year.</p> <p>It is not as controversial as last year, but at the same time we believe the changes the Minister has made do not go far enough.  The tinkering around the edges with pensions will not solve our problems.  The extension of PRSI contributions to individuals with an income from a trade or profession moves the game somewhat, but it does not address the real supports many people require.  During the recent by-election in Meath East, I met an individual who is self-employed in a trade.  He begged a welfare officer for &euro;50, as that was all he needed to get his business back up and running, and now he has a six-figure turnover.  A little help for the self-employed can help them and then help the economy.  The person in question is employing people.  His story was told in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>before Christmas.</p><p> People are not looking for a lot.  I appreciate there are issues of cost.  Perhaps a major debate is required on how we would pay for such a system.  However, I urge the Minister to go further because one of the things that is holding people back from becoming self-employed or going into business is the lack of support when things go wrong.  I refer to a small amount of support, not major support.  I have lost count of the number of business people, self-employed people and small company directors who told me they would not under any circumstances recommend that their children go into business because while it is all right when things are going well, when things go wrong or a business fails, one is in serious trouble.  That is not only a drag on those families but on the overall economy and is contributing to the social welfare bill because some people end up getting social welfare following a means test to which they perhaps did not contribute, whereas if a business person is able to stay alive with the hope that something could be provided, perhaps the situation could be turned around and he or she could get back into business, as happened with one individual whom I know.  He was an inspiration to me when I spoke to him.</p></speech>

I apologise that I was not present for the early part of the debate, but I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on the Bill.  My colleague, Senator Moloney, who is far more expert in this area than me, has spoken eloquently and comprehensively on it.  She made the point clearly that the Bill represents another step in the Minister&rsquo;s reform programme in terms of seeking to move the social protection system from being a passive one to an active one with the focus on reactivation.  The Minister referred to the need for social protection to be not just a safety net but also a springboard.  For far too long the safety net aspect has been emphasised and we have not placed enough emphasis on the springboard element.</p><p>Colleagues on both sides of the House have paid tribute to the Minister and I wish to add my voice to theirs.  She is a genuinely reforming Minister who is putting the emphasis on the springboard aspect of social protection and on activation measures, which is important.  That is to be very much welcomed by everyone.  In particular at a time of high unemployment, especially high youth unemployment figures, it is important that the emphasis is on upskilling, retraining and ensuring people get a foothold back in the labour market.  In the boom times we used to talk about getting a foot on the property ladder, but I always think the far more relevant and important ladder is the career ladder and allowing people to get a foothold on it, especially when they have fallen off it or have not had an opportunity to start on it.  My students are in quandary now as they graduate and are looking for the first step on the ladder.  That is where internships and the JobBridge programme can help people to get a start.</p><p>The main provisions contained in the Bill, some of which address the activated element of the social protection scheme, have been addressed by previous speakers.  There are five areas of change, namely, changes to the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment schemes, changes in liability for PRSI contributions, measures to tackle social welfare fraud, including identity authentication requirements, which everyone has welcomed, and the debt recovery aspect, including the attachment of earnings orders which, from the criminal justice side, has been quite contentious.  We must consider moving towards that as a way of recovering debts more efficiently.  There are also changes in the governance structure of the Pensions Board.  Section 16 contains provisions for the facilitation of online access to index information from the register of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships.  That will be very important to people tracing their ancestors and for genealogy purposes.</p><p>I wish to focus on the changes in section 10 that seek to help lone parents back to work.  I am one of the many people who lobbied the Minister following the changes to the one-parent family scheme.  I was very much persuaded by her own words when she introduced the changes about the history and context of the introduction of what was then the unmarried mother&rsquo;s allowance.  The payment was hugely progressive at the time because it brought lone mothers out of a poverty trap and enabled them to rear their children by themselves.  One cannot underestimate the hugely progressive impact the introduction of the payment had, but decades on, it was timely that we would examine the issue again because, more recently, the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance has not succeeded in lifting lone-parent families out of poverty.  It is clear there was not enough of a springboard element to the payment.  Many of us spoke to the Minister about how best to change the measures relating to the lone-parent family allowance to ensure that was the case.</p><p>The measures in section 10 are important because they will help lone parents to transition actively to the labour market and support them to get back into work.  The advocacy groups to whom I spoke at the time were very keen that there would be the type of modification the Minister has introduced to ensure lone-parent families would be exempted for a transitional period from the full conditionality of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  That is exactly what the Minister is doing with the introduction of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment, which is important.  Jobseekers who are lone parents and who qualify for the lone-parent allowance must no longer fulfil all the other criteria in terms of genuinely being available for full-time work.  They can now seek part-time work rather than full-time work if that better suits their family circumstances.  They will also be able to access existing child care supports.  Work is ongoing to ensure better access to child care, not just for lone parents but for all families.  This is a progressive pathway back to work for lone parents and their families.  It is an important reform for the Labour Party in government and I very much welcome it.  As the Minister said, the change has been welcomed by many of the advocacy groups.</p><p>Colleagues referred to section 9 which relates to retained firefighters and the changes in jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to allow persons working as retained firefighters to be exempted from certain conditions to access the schemes.  Again, there is cross-party support for that important change in recognition of the enormous social good retained firefighters do.</p><p>Senator Moloney asked me to mention pensions, which she did not get an opportunity to speak about in detail.  I said she spoke comprehensively but that was the only omission.  I welcome the changes the Minister is making to occupational pension provision, which give effect to recommendations that were made.  On behalf of Senator Moloney I welcome the changes, which, as she said, will strengthen the governance of pensions and will give consumers greater input into pensions policy.</p><p>I echo the words of Senator Mullins who spoke about self-employed persons and access for them to social security entitlements.  Something that was raised with me on many doorsteps during the 2011 general election, and many other colleagues will also have heard the issue, is that people who employed a number of others in small and large businesses during the boom times and whose business have failed find their employees qualify for social security entitlements such as redundancy but they do not.  That is a real omission and it is something we must examine and address in the future.</p></speech>

Her focus has been on transforming the Department as a passive provider of benefits to an organisation that is actively assisting people back to work, training and education.</p><p>In the legislation she is continuing the necessary and important structural reforms of the social welfare system.  She must be applauded for her efforts to date.  Reference was made to ATMs.  Banks in my home town of Carlingford, which is a historic town that is attractive to tourists, regularly run out of cash.  ATMs are the first port of call for tourists and more often than not there is no money in them.  Something must be done to ensure visitors to Carlingford have access to cash because it is bad for business.  Many people from Northern Ireland require euro currency.</p></speech>

Many speakers have referred to retained firefighters.  I campaigned myself on the matter on several occasions.</p> <p>Since 1972, the social welfare system essentially has subsidised the State's cost of providing a nationwide part-time fire service.  However, a legislative basis was never provided to support that position.  I commend the Minister on bringing in that measure.  I compliment the firefighters for their patience in waiting 40 years.  I thought 35 years was a long time to wait for my Narrow Water bridge but there were others waiting longer for something they wanted.  Well done to them for their patience.  I want to acknowledge the service given by those men and women and the sacrifices they made.  Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their duties in the past 40 years.</p><p>The grave issue of fraud must be tackled with gusto.  Fraud undermines confidence in the entire system and is unfair to genuine claimants and taxpayers alike.</p><p>The Minister is proposing to provide for the introduction of a condition for existing recipients of social welfare payments, which has been mentioned by other speakers.  The person must satisfy the Department of his or her identity.  How does the Minister propose to implement that, and how long will it take to complete that proposal?  Will she put in place a time limit for current recipients to fulfil their obligations?  What difficulties, if any, does the Minister envisage in implementing this scheme?</p><p>The Minister might comment on welfare tourism.  Does it continue?  Is it growing or has it decreased?  What should we do to ensure it is obliterated forever more.</p><p>I congratulate and commend the Minister on her efforts and the changes she has introduced in her Ministry to date.  I congratulate all her officials also.  The Minister's heart and soul are in these changes, and I welcome what she is doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300025#Y00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation on Second Stage.  There are major anomalies in the entire social welfare budget, particularly with regard to self-employed people.  The legislation proposes changes that will not address any of the difficulties being faced by people in self-employment.</p><p>In the past ten years this country has seen an exodus of people who were formerly employed in manufacturing jobs and in the construction sector in particular.  Many of those people were self-employed and, as a result of the social welfare rules that govern the area of PRSI contributions and the class of contribution paid by self-employed persons, they find themselves unable to draw down a social welfare payment.  That is wrong and this Bill does nothing to address that particular query.  </p><p>That is an issue faced by small fishermen, regardless of whether they own the vessel, and even men who have small fishing vessels with a crew.  For Revenue reasons the crew members are defined as being self-employed.  I will give the Minister an example.  Even though those persons can be sacked by the owner or the skipper of the vessel, for social welfare and Revenue purposes they are deemed to be self-employed.  When they are sacked they have no entitlement whatsoever to a social welfare payment.  That is wrong.  </p><p>That is only one example of persons who are self-employed.  Many of the people who were self-employed were working for themselves and employing people during the economic boom.  Now, due to the lack of employment and the anomalies in the social welfare system, they are being forced to leave the country.  They have no alternative because they have no source of income, and this Bill does nothing to address that.  That is one of the reasons we are opposing this legislation.</p><p>As politicians we are moving from a culture where a substantial part of our work was helping people obtain Government assistance by way of grant aid or whatever.  That is fine because it is part of our role, but I find now that an increasing number of hours of my work are spent dealing with social welfare queries.  The reason for that is simple.  The application process is becoming unacceptably burdensome on individuals making applications.  Genuine applications are being refused.  The appeals mechanism is a disgrace.  It is unacceptable, and it is happening on this Government's watch.  </p><p>I have been dealing with a man who is suicidal.  He cannot walk or work, yet the Minister's Department is telling him he can do both.  Despite all the medical evidence having been sent in by consultants and doctors, it is not being accepted by the Minister's Department.  Is it the case that the officials in the Minister's Department are being told to approve only a select number of applications or is it a type of game where one out of every 20 is picked?  That seems to be what is happening because the medical evidence is not being accepted for genuine applications or for appeals being made.  </p><p>I am genuine in raising that issue with the Minister.  It may be an issue that arose in other Administrations but it is certainly happening under the watch of this Administration.  Something must be done about it because how can I deal with representations from people who are thinking of committing suicide because they have no income whatsoever?  They are being asked to pay the household charge, the property tax and they have to pay house insurance and so on but they simply do not have the money.  They can go to the community welfare officer, and that is the response that comes back from the Minister's Department, but they do not qualify for an entitlement because their wives may be earning up to &euro;300 a week.  In terms of the household bills in the case I mentioned, the son and daughter are in college.  There are fees associated with that and the income does not meet the demand.  Something has to be done.  </p><p>I know the Minister has to battle in Government with other Ministers at Cabinet level, and sometimes I pity her, but pity does not solve the problem.  Something must be done and if it is not done quickly, the man about whom I speak, and others, will do something drastic that none of us should have to comprehend as public representatives.  I am pleading with the Minister because this Bill does not touch on that at all.  Applications and appeals must be dealt with within a minimum period and all the medical evidence must be taken into consideration for social welfare payments.  That should be happening but it is not happening, and it must be dealt with.  It is not directly related to this legislation but it is related to the Minister's brief.  I greatly appreciate the Cathaoirleach's latitude in allowing me raise the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300025#Y00300"><p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate in such detail and with such knowledge regarding the way social welfare impacts on a huge number of people in our population.</p><p>To deal with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's contribution, the fundamental problem is that in the aftermath of his Government's disastrous bank guarantee over 250,000 jobs were lost in this country in three short years.  Everybody, including the Senators opposite, deeply regrets that but what we have to do is get people back to work because this year the estimated spend is &euro;20.3 billion.  That is not a small amount of money, as has been said.</p> <p>It represents approximately 38% of total Government spending.</p><p>I make the point with regard to social welfare that the staff and deciding officers in law make their decisions.  I have no legal power and would not wish to exercise any power to direct staff to make decisions.  It is unfair to imply that staff are getting some kind of direction from somewhere to refuse decisions.  The positive point about social welfare is that it is based on law.  Members will be aware that one problem with Health Service Executive schemes, for instance, is that by and large they simply are based on administration and one therefore has huge complaints about the unfairness with which some people are treated compared with others.  When one bases a scheme in law, part of the problem obviously may be the application of the law is therefore more rigid, but it is based on law with deciding officers having the power in law to make decisions.  There are no instructions to deciding officers and were proof required on the allegations the Senator is making, since areas like disability, for instance, have transferred over to the Department of Social Protection, the figures show there have been huge increases in the number of people qualifying.</p><p>As for this Bill, I am glad a number of Members referred to and welcomed the developments regarding both the part-time firefighters and the retained fire service.  As Senator Brennan observed, it is true the Department is subsidising the retained fire service throughout the country.  One issue about which one must think in respect of social welfare is that employment patterns are changing in that many employers increasingly only offer minimum hours contracts.  This certainly is true in particular of some of the larger retail centres and applies in particular to young people and women.  The consequence is people may be getting two to three days of work and are claiming two to three days of social welfare benefits.  This is one way in which the social welfare system is subsidising a great deal of employment activity, for which it often does not get very much recognition.  However, it constitutes a direct subsidy to many employers, particularly some of the very large supermarket chains.</p><p>I also take the point raised by Senators Mullins and Brennan about ATMs running dry in towns such as Ballinasloe and Carlingford.  The Government pay the banks handsome fees to process electronic business for social welfare clients or customers and it is important they make cash services available.  Almost everyone knows that for someone who is on a small income, and someone whose income is based exclusively on social welfare payments is on a small income, it is much better to be able to manage that income on a cash basis rather than with any kind of credit or debit card.  I certainly will make this point to the banks because, as Members are aware, the country has given its all for the banks of this country and requires some services from them in return for everything that all the ordinary citizens have done for them.</p><p>The subject of consultants' PRSI was mentioned by a number of Members and the issue is that, as Senator Moloney noted, there was a ceiling on the charge to PRSI on earnings.  Consequently, a person on a consultant contract of more than &euro;200,000 would have reached that ceiling.  However, on foot of the abolition of the ceiling from PRSI, for the reason of a loophole in the law they were not charged to PRSI on their other income.  In the case of some consultants with big private practices as well as a public practice, the amounts involved from their private income will produce a small amount for the social welfare system.  Certainly, the VHI statistics indicate that more than 300 consultants earn at least &euro;200,000 a year from private earnings, more in the case of quite a number of them.</p><p>There is a really important issue regarding the changes to the rules mentioned by a number of Members about providing greater sanctions for those who refuse to co-operate with regard to education, training and employment training opportunities.  By and large in Ireland, people support the unwritten social contract that a good, strong system of social protection is needed and that one contributes and pays while one is working.  However, taxpayers who contribute by paying PAYE and PRSI, many of whom are on small wages, get a bit fed up when they see people they know personally in the social welfare system who are not honouring their side of the social contract, which is to make themselves work-ready and available for work in the context of the many supports the Department has made available to them.  Senator Moloney spoke of the recent conversion of the offices in Killarney to the new Intreo system.  It really is positive and in a point referenced by many Senators, I am convinced it will assist in the fight against fraud.</p><p>The new arrangements with regard to biometric photographs and electronic signatures mean we will have rolled out this system.  Thus far, we have rolled out approximately 250,000 personal services cards to all new entrants into the social welfare system.  Anyone coming into Ireland, anyone who signs on as a new jobseeker and anyone who registers for a PPS number is going to the new system, and already it is bearing fruit.  For instance, if one's photograph comes up and one has been signing on in Carrick-on-Shannon but it appears as though one also has been appearing in the office in Letterkenny, the software will highlight this and will signal that this appears to be the same person.  I do not suggest that Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mooney look like each other in any way-----</p></speech>

However, intelligent software is being used.  A number of Members asked the reason fingerprinting or iris recognition technology were not used, as the latter also is available and is used in many places of employment.  I found a system that had been commissioned and tendered for when I came into the Department but which had not been commenced.  The Department had been talking about doing this stuff for at least ten years and I felt it was very important that it be done now.  Incidentally, the card has a lot of capacity to store a huge amount of data, including, for instance, people's interaction with the health services, should those services decide to utilise it down the road, as well as information with regard to education services.  There is a huge amount of data capacity on the cards and while it can be upgraded in respect of stronger identification, let us get the system first.</p><p>As for pensioners and people in receipt of invalidity benefit, the only complaint I have heard from pensioners concerns a proposal to use the biometric system that is in use for passports, as this would particularly facilitate pensioners.  However, a couple of pensioners have told me they would prefer fresh photographs and an opportunity to get their hair done because they did not think their current passport photograph does them justice.  I think we all have had moments like that.  While I will bear in mind people's comments, we are trying to facilitate people through the use of passports because, as Members are aware, there is not a great problem of fraud in respect of people who are retired or are in receipt of very long-term payments.  All the studies the Department has undertaken in this regard have shown this to be the case.</p><p>Last year, Senators supported me strongly with regard to the checks at the airport and to give social welfare officers the power to stop people.  The policy is working very well and the social welfare inspectors at the airports have undertaken a significant amount of work in questioning people, with the result that a number of those cases already have come before the courts.  Some involve people from abroad who lived in Ireland and then return even though they have gone back to live abroad.  Others have involved Irish people who have gone abroad to work but who continue to return to claim.</p> <p>All such fraud undermines the position of claimants, particularly the retired who rely on social welfare in most cases for their principal income.</p><p>On pensions, we are, as I stated, looking at the issues arising.  There is a great deal of work ongoing in the Department.  I would hope to come back at a later stage on it.  We are also getting the funding proposals, which have to be in by 30 June.  That will give us much more information.</p><p>On Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the transition arrangements for lone parents, I repeat that it is really important we change to an active system which enables lone parents to go back to education as soon as possible.  The most successful lone parents tend to be those who have a great deal of family or community support in order to stay in education or return to education and training as soon as possible.  Many older lone parents for whom that period is over frequently express regret to me that they did not go back earlier in order to build for themselves the possibility of a better paid job with a better status.  Sinn F&eacute;in takes a different view, but I am telling Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh what many women express to me and, I am sure, to some of the women Senators here.</p></speech>

Last year, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others stated that the community employment sector would close down.  Since the Department has taken over community employment schemes we have increased it, for instance, with T&uacute;s, of which Senators Mooney and &Oacute; Domhnaill will be familiar.  It has been an opportunity that has been jumped at by significant numbers of those around the country to participate in assisting their local community and getting them closer to the labour market.  We have taken on significant numbers on T&uacute;s supervisory contracts from the ranks of those who were formerly unemployed.  Rather than the closedown that Sinn F&eacute;in was tending to predict last year, we have expanded the number of opportunities and I made provision for an extra 10,000 places in the budget.</p></speech>

It is an extremely busy day but we both know stroke awareness is very important to both of us.  This is national stroke awareness week, with this year's focus on the Irish Heart Foundation's Act FAST campaign, which was launched in 2010 to increase public awareness about the early signs of stroke and encourage speedy medical intervention.  I welcome Mr. Chris Macey from the Irish Heart Foundation to the Gallery.  Under an Adjournment motion in January last year I raised the issue of stroke rehabilitation services and the Minister knows I have raised it several times at the health committee before him.</p><p>An estimated 10,000 people suffered a stroke in Ireland in 2012 and the same number are estimated to suffer a stroke this year.  Approximately 2,000 die as a result of stroke, making it Ireland's third biggest killer.  Stroke is the single most significant cause of severe disability and up to 50,000 people are living in our communities with disabilities as a result of strokes.  In addition to the devastating impact stroke has on the sufferer and their families, the financial costs are huge.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, estimated that in 2010 the direct annual cost of stroke was &euro;557 million of which as much as &euro;414 million is spent on nursing home care and there is nothing to indicate that this cost has fallen in the past three years.</p><p>In the face of these stark figures, the Irish Heart Foundation's Act FAST campaign is a commendable initiative which warrants State support.  The campaign, while still in its infancy, has been a resounding success, particularly in raising public awareness of stroke warning signs through the first three letters of the acronym FAST, as follows: face, has the person's face fallen on one side?; arms: can the person raise both arms and keep them elevated?; and speech, is the person's speech slurred?</p><p>The most recent Irish Heart Foundation's Attitudes and Behaviour study found that there had been a 190% increase in awareness of these warning signs.  This increased awareness, along with the rapid development of the 24-7 thrombolysis services nationally by the HSE's national stroke programme, has contributed to a 400% increase in the numbers receiving life-changing, clot-busting treatment and it has helped cut death and disability rates from strokes significantly against demographic and international trends.</p><p>However, the last letter of the acronym, arguably the most important one since it is the call to action, namely, &quot;T&quot;, time to call 999 if one sees any of the signs, has not had the desired impact.  Just over half of the respondents surveyed said they would call an ambulance.  Speedy medical intervention is imperative if we are to limit the detrimental impact of stroke.  The average stroke destroys 2 million brain cells every minute, which means the quicker one gets emergency treatment, the more of one's brain can be saved.  The knock-on effect is reduced risk of death or severe disability and a considerable financial saving to the State.</p><p>The Irish Heart Foundation is entering a new stage of the campaign where there is clearly room to improve on awareness of the timely medical intervention, and it needs State support.  In addition to financial assistance, there are other supports at the disposal of the State, such as providing advertising sites in high footfall areas of Government buildings and properties and maybe examining a way of reimbursing the 23% they have to pay in non-returnable VAT for the campaign, which is proving to save not only lives and quality of life, but is also saving the State money.  I would like the Minister's reassurance that both financial and alternative means of supporting the new phase of the Act FAST campaign are being positively considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300028#CC01000"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and raising awareness in the week that is in it.  She is right about the figures; they are staggering.  Some 10,000 strokes a year is very serious.  We should acknowledge the growth in public awareness of stroke warning signs, as the Senator has outlined, and the improvements noted and confirmed recently by the HSE.  The FAST campaign coincided with a major development of stroke services nationally, including an increase in the number of stroke units around the country from six to 27 and the expansion of 24-7 thrombolysis treatment from a small number of hospitals mainly in urban areas to all hospitals that treat stroke patients.  The FAST campaign has assisted health services to maximise the impact of the stroke service improvements.  The HSE has advised my Department that it provided &euro;268,000 last year and &euro;308,000 this year to the Irish Heart Foundation to help with its various health promotion activities.  Like the Senator I welcome the foundation's presence here.</p><p>Such improvements in stroke services were envisioned in the policy document Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 - 2019 which was launched in 2010.  This established a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.</p><p>I could go through the rest of this but I would much prefer to talk about prevention.  In this country we have a long history politically of engaging in expensive developments.  They are necessary, and politicians are always very pleased to open a new wing of a hospital or an MRI scanner but have been reluctant in the past to invest in public health initiatives that can save many more lives.  When we look at the causes of stroke we see our old enemies again: tobacco is a major cause of stroke and if we could keep our children and the next generation from starting on this habit it would be a lot easier than trying to get them to quit and would prevent a huge number of strokes per year.</p> <p>Obesity is another issue which leads to diabetes and hypertension, which is well known to be associated with stroke.  The issue of alcohol must be mentioned also because it has peculiar properties with regard to blood pressure.  It is known to cause vasodilation peripherally so one would imagine it would drop one's blood pressure, but it causes vasoconstriction which causes one's blood pressure to go up.  It is a risk factor also.</p><p>Many of our figures relating to stroke are preventable if these areas are tackled.  Earlier I mentioned the Government's commitment to healthy Ireland.  I am the Minister for Health but I often feel as though I am the Minister for ill-health because all we speak about is disease and illness when what we need is to keep people well.  The Department of Health cannot do this alone.  It needs the Department of Justice and Equality to keep our streets safe so people can exercise.  It needs the Department of Finance and the manner in which it taxes and incentivises certain types of behaviour.  It needs the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to give us safe well-lit places at night to exercise.  We also very badly need the Department of Education and Skills on board and I know the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is very committed to this area.</p><p>This is about developing healthy lifestyles early in life which will stay with people.  Early habits are the hardest to break.  This has also been proven with regard to tobacco.  If one does not start smoking before the age of 21 one is unlikely to take it up.  We know this industry goes after our children.  It wants to replace with new recruits those who have died, including the 5,200 who died from tobacco related illnesses this year, and those who give it up, and these new recruits are children.  According to a survey 78% of smokers stated they started smoking before the age of 18.  It is wonderful we have a new stroke programme and we are saving a life a week, and I am told the new initiatives we have undertaken save a life per day.  While all this must be done to help those who fall ill now, we must look down the road and realise the actions we take now could save the next generation from much hardship and grief.  If we do not tackle the obesity epidemic among young people and the rising epidemic of diabetes we may very well be the first generation to bury the generation behind us which is an appalling thought.  No parent wants to be at his or her child's graveside.</p></speech>

Strokes are Ireland's third biggest killer and I ask the Minister to give consideration to the financial assistance I have suggested and perhaps consider other measures such as using public buildings for billboard spaces or reimbursing the 23% VAT.  This is a public health awareness campaign and one could argue the State should be running it.  Perhaps there is a way the Government could support it such as refunding the 23% VAT to the Irish Heart Foundation.</p></speech>

I will have to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to achieve the VAT reimbursement the Senator seeks.  This is not the only area where I feel VAT needs to be examined, as we also have VAT on condoms and vaccines.  There is no VAT on tablets or liquid medicine but because vaccines are in injectable form they are subject to VAT.  I would like to discuss a range of areas with the Minister.  We are in very constrained financial times and it is difficult to seek to reduce the Exchequer return in any real sense.</p><p>We must get the people of Ireland and Europe off their addiction to nicotine but we also need to get the governments of Europe off the addiction of the income which tobacco products bring.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of long outpatient waiting times at Waterford Regional Hospital a number of times in the House.  My party health spokesperson, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, sought from the HSE a full breakdown of the figures on all of the departments and specialties at the hospital in respect of outpatient waiting times to see exactly how long people wait to see a consultant and get into the system.  It is fair to state that once people get into the system they get the very best treatment in our acute hospital services, and certainly Waterford Regional Hospital is a strong performing hospital where people get the very best treatment when they are in the system.</p><p>The figures released to us by the HSE show that a total of 28,479 people in the south east who depend on Waterford Regional Hospital are on outpatient waiting lists waiting to see a consultant.  Of these, 11,338, which is 40% of the total number, have been waiting for longer than a year and 20% have been waiting for more than two years.  The Minister has often said in the House that he wants all of the hospitals to meet the target he sets and that he will be very tough with the managers of the hospitals to ensure the targets are met.  The problem is not getting tough with managers of hospitals.  In some respects the problem is capacity and the fact we do not have enough consultants or staff to cater for the need.</p><p>Orthopaedics at Waterford Regional Hospital is a good example where the clinical director and the consultants who work in the sector will say if they are asked that twice as many referrals come to the hospital than there is capacity to treat.  The target set by the Minister is a national guarantee that no patient will wait for longer than one year to see a consultant.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  To give the Minister a flavour of the areas involved, in dermatology 49% of patients have been waiting more than 12 months, the figure for general medicine is 37%, for ophthalmology it is 32%, for orthopaedics it is 44% and for pain relief it is 53%.</p><p>I know the Minister cannot micromanage everything that happens in the health service and he cannot comment on individual cases, but recently I dealt with a stroke victim who is having difficulty getting gallstones removed.  She has been waiting for months to see a pain specialist.  She has no speech whatsoever but has been waiting for months to see a pain specialist.  Another person had a biopsy done on one of her glands and on two occasions she was booked into the hospital for elective surgery to have the lump removed but the procedure was cancelled on both occasions.  A number of elective surgeries have been cancelled at Waterford Regional Hospital this year.  The reason is very simple; it is capacity.  We have closed a ward and two surgical theatres.  The hospital gets full quickly which means there is no capacity to carry out elective surgeries.  This means they are cancelled which creates havoc with waiting times.  As the Minister knows it is very difficult on patients who are building up to having a procedure done and then it does not happen.</p><p>As the Minister is here he might also comment on plans to expand cardiology services at Waterford Regional Hospital.  One of the hooks on which the Higgins report was sold to the people of the south east was that we would have a 24-seven cardiology service, but the Higgins report mentions enhanced cardiology services.  Will we have 24-seven cardiology services?  How will the Minister make it a reality?  My main question is on the outpatient waiting times and the fact that unfortunately the targets set by the Minister are not being met.</p></speech>

We are the first Government to measure the number of people on outpatient waiting lists.  The total number is 386,000 people, but we see 200,000 people at our outpatient clinics every month and I believe we will be able to deal with this problem as we have dealt with the other problems.  After the urgent and cancer patients are dealt with the longest waiters will be looked after.  The true scandal for me is not the 386,000 people which no previous Government acknowledged or measured, but that more than 16,000 people have been waiting for longer than four years.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for the opportunity to update the House on the significant progress being made on outpatient waiting times as a result of the measures introduced by my Department, the special delivery unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Access to acute hospital services is a priority for me and the Government.  Hospitals have responded impressively to this challenge, in the face of considerable pressure.</p> <p>This is due to the hard work done by clinical and managerial leaders in individual hospitals, coupled with comprehensive and coherent strategies and programmes enacted by the special delivery unit, working with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the HSE, the hospitals, the men and women who work on the front-line of the health service and supported by clinical programmes. </p><p>With specific reference to outpatients, the National Outpatient Service Performance Improvement Programme 2012-2015 has commenced implementation.  Current improvements include: validation of current outpatient lists; the standardisation of current referral management processes; and improved turnaround times for categorisation of referrals; the utilising of clinic capacity effectively through booking of pre-planned appointment slots; configuring specific clinic templates to address varying requirements of different specialties; improvements in the discharge planning process; reducing the do not attend rates by patients; and identifying, understanding and resolving long-standing organisational behaviours, culture and attitudes towards the provision of outpatient services.  These measures are being implemented for waiting lists in all specialties.</p><p>Underpinning all of these work streams is the availability of patient level waiting time data in all hospitals providing an outpatient service.  The data has been systematically collated by the NTPF and is publicly available on its website.  As I said, the maximum waiting time target for 2013 of 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment.</p><p>The SDU and the NTPF will shortly publish outpatient waiting times by specialty which will add further to the visibility and transparency of waiting times in our health system.  It is hoped that the publication of data will commence by the end of this month.  Already this work has identified orthopaedics, ENT and ophthalmology as the services which, nationally, are most at risk of not achieving access targets.</p><p>Ultimately, each hospital must systematically achieve maximum waiting time targets each year by matching capacity with demand, eliminating inefficiencies in the patient pathway, ensuring the strict chronological management of patients of equal clinical priority and implementing the recommendations of the clinical care programmes.  Establishing hospital groups will further facilitate hospitals in addressing waiting lists.  These Groups will see small and larger hospitals working together as teams, in conjunction with their academic partners, to enhance innovation and effectiveness in service development and delivery.</p><p>Waterford is a busy hospital.  It is a cancer centre, hub for the southeast renal service, provider of invasive cardiology services and a regional trauma centre including an emergency department, ear, nose and throat and ophthalmology.  Given the level of activity, it is no surprise that midway through the year work is ongoing to accurately measure and validate outpatient waiting lists and to match these to capacity, taking into account the clinical needs of patients.</p><p>With regard to the specialties that the Senator mentioned, these services are delivered not just in Waterford Regional Hospital but in a range of outreach hospital and community clinics in the southeast.  I acknowledge that the numbers are high at 2,814 for dermatology, over 4,000 for ophthalmology, over 5,000 for orthopaedics and over 6,000 for ENT.  However, these numbers are being proactively tackled by the hospital with the assistance of the HSE.</p><p>I am pleased to advise that a candidate is in clearance for the third new post of consultant dermatologist, following the appointment of the second new post on 1 March 2013.  A candidate is also in clearance for the replacement post of consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital, following a consultant resignation.  Finally, one consultant ophthalmic surgeon replacement post will be advertised shortly and a second replacement post is also being processed.</p><p>All of these appointments will lead to significant improvements in their respective services, particularly in respect of waiting times.  Coupled with management plans, revised governance arrangements and additional clinics or clinical reviews in specialties such as regional orthopaedics, regional ENT and opthalmology, l am assured that the hospital is making every effort to ensure the 12 month target is achieved by November 2013.</p></speech>

I share his view that hospital management has responded impressively.  He has acknowledged that the figures for opthalmology, orthopaedics and ENT are very high.  I welcome the announcement of the new and replacement consultant posts.  If the new posts do not allow the hospital to reduce its waiting times and numbers, is the Minister in a position to say whether  extra posts will be made available?  Capacity is important in order to allow hospitals reach their targets.</p><p>  Perhaps he can answer my concern about the provision of 24-7 cardiology.  It is a major issue for people in the southeast.  I hope that he will positively address the matter.  A commitment has been given to enhance such services but what does that mean?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300030#EE00400"><p>I shall address the question posed by the Senator.  A commitment has been given to enhance cardiology services and it will be honoured.</p><p>  With regard to outpatients, one of the underlying principles of the Government is that the patient should be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and is as near to home as possible.  In many instances, throughout the health system, including Waterford, patients are being seen by consultants who could be seen by GPs, GPs are seeing patients who could be seen by nurses and nurses seeing patients that healthcare assistants should be seeing.  I do not know whether Waterford hospital has adopted the same approach as Cork hospital but I have no doubt that it will adopt the measure.  In Cork, all orthopaedic referrals were screened by its physiotherapy service and that unit was able to deal with 50% of the referrals without going near the orthopaedic team.  That reflects the inability of a GP to get a service for a patient who cannot afford private care.  The same applies to the mental health service when trying to access counselling.  </p><p>  I wish to point out a number of things.  GPs are well aware that if they refer a patient with a recurring sore throat to an ENT surgeon that it is likely to lead to a tonsillectomy.  However, if GPs refer patients to a paediatrician the patients are much less likely to receive a tonsillectomy.  Therefore, we need to measure what we are doing, why we are doing it and the outcome for patients.  The information will help to considerably improve hospital waiting times.  Delays are caused by the way the system is organised.  Let me give the simple example of people who do not arrive for appointments.  I have asked the HSE to put in place a system of collecting mobile telephone numbers in order for patients to be sent a text the week beforehand.  A patient is asked to send a return text consisting of a Y or N to indicate if they will attend.  If he or she confirms their attendance then they shall receive another text on the morning of the appointment.  If the patient does not turn up then, having confirmed that he or she would attend, then there should be a compulsory charge of at least &euro;25.  Their non-attendance will have wasted the appointment and deprived somebody else.</p><p>  A corollary of that is respect.  I do not believe that a system that demands 30 people to turn up for an appointment at 9 a.m. shows respect for patients.  It clearly indicates that the system and time is more important than that of a patient.  That is not correct if we want a patient centred service.  There must be a mutual understanding between those who provide the service and those who use the service.  It must be conveyed that healthcare is a limited resource and has an impact on other people in our communities, our families and our friends.  We all have a responsibility to use healthcare in an appropriate fashion.  We, as service providers, must treat people with respect by not calling 30 people to attend at the one time.  Instead, they should be given staggered appointment times thereby greatly improving the situation.  </p><p>  I have outlined some of the ideas that are being put in place.  As hospital groups come together their scale of size will allow them to buddy up with national and international partners to develop new ways of organising and delivering care.  Dr. Susan O'Reilly, Director, National Cancer Control Programme, has stated that better organisation and management can result in a 10% better outcome for the patient.  That is important.  </p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuil s&eacute; anseo.</p><p>  About two months ago, we heard about a scandal relating to a former head of a summer college who also worked in other capacities where he had access to young people.  The man has since passed away.  Apparently, serious allegations were made to various State agencies and arms of the State over the past 40 to 50 years.  The earliest allegation made against the individual dates back to 1955.  The individual worked with a number of different State organisations, the VEC is one of them, and other organisations who received funding from State funded systems.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has taken the matter seriously.  He has called for three internal inquiries to be conducted by the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and his Department, respectively.  He also wants the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to internally investigate the allegations made about the individual and actions taken.  </p><p>  A certain amount of time has elapsed so I shall ask the Minister the following questions.  What engagement has taken place with the three agencies regarding internal investigations?  What timescale is envisaged?  </p> <p>We have let some time pass before asking the question of what engagement there has been with those three agencies regarding the internal investigations, the timescale envisaged and how far back the organisations will look, taking into account that some of the allegations date back to 1955 and that there were court cases pending that were never fully heard.  We are also aware another settlement was made outside of court and different organisations were involved.  Quite a large number of victims have come forward to the media in this case, some publicly and some anonymously, but I know of at least 11 people who are claiming to have been abused by this individual.  That abuse seems to have been widespread judging by reports.</p><p>The terms of reference for the investigation are important, with questions over who will investigate and what manner of investigation will be carried out.  Will there simply be a review of the files held by the organisations or will it cover all correspondence and look back at any payments that might have been made to any of the individuals who have claimed that they were abused by this man?</p><p>This is a serious issue.  I am in contact with a couple of the individuals who were abused and they are distraught.  They want to get some sort of closure and answers about how a man who was apparently abusing children since 1955 was allowed to continue in positions of power and authority, and continued abusing until very recently.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-06-13a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013061300031#FF00200"><p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business.  On behalf of the Minister, I wish to thank the Senator for again raising this important matter.</p><p>  As the Minister has previously made clear, the allegations regarding the person in question are very disturbing.  He would again encourage anyone in any situation who has been abused to come forward to report his or her concerns, and to avail of the counselling which is available from the HSE or from one of the voluntary groups working in this field.  As Minister for Health, I would equally encourage people in these situations to express their concerns and speak to the professionals available to help them.  I know that is difficult.</p><p>  The preliminary report which the Minister received from the Garda authorities set out how in 1997 a criminal investigation was instigated into allegations of sexual abuse, which led to the person in question being charged with numerous counts of sexual offences.  As the Minister outlined at the time of the Senator's earlier inquiry, he is advised that judicial review proceedings were taken by the accused for reasons related to delay in the bringing of complaints, and that arising from these proceedings, the prosecution fell.  The Senator will appreciate that the bringing of prosecutions and their management is a matter for the direction of the DPP, who makes independent decisions having regard to the circumstances of the case in question.  The Minister has no role in this process and, quite properly, is not in a position to explain decisions of the director.</p><p>  More recently, arrangements had been made by garda&iacute; with a further injured party to take a statement but this had not taken place prior to the person in question's death.  Concerns expressed in connection with the suggestion that the person in question was seeking to visit schools to promote a book were also under consideration at the time of the death.</p><p>  The examination which the Garda Commissioner has directed be carried out concerning the procedures surrounding the handling of the complaints against this person is at an advanced stage and a report will be submitted to the Commissioner in the near future.  As far as the terms of reference of this examination are concerned, these would be a matter for the Commissioner but he has already indicated that the focus will be on whether any lessons can be learned from the handling of the above complaints and subsequent investigations.  As this is an internal Garda examination it would not be the normal practice for such reports to be published.  However, the Minister will examine in due course how any key findings might be put into the public<br />domain and will engage with his ministerial colleagues on the outcome of the examination.</p><p>  The Senator will appreciate that the other inquiries being carried out into this matter are not taking place under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality, so he is not in a position to comment on them.  However, it is envisaged that on their completion there will be coordination between the various Departments involved to see what lessons might be learned.  The dreadful accounts of abuse in this case, and the testimonies of those who have gone public with their experiences in recent months, bear out the lessons we have learned from other inquiries and investigations in recent years.</p><p>  It is imperative that we have in place the strongest possible child protection measures.  The Minister would like to emphasise that since taking office this Government has transformed child protection arrangements in Ireland and is pushing forward with further major improvements.  We now have revised Children First guidance, which is to be put on a statutory footing by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and which sets out excellent standards and procedures involving reporting of allegations to the authorities and training to support this process.  These standards are complemented by the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, both introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Moreover, the arrangements for inter-agency working at all levels have been strengthened, supported by the ongoing reform of children and family services in the HSE and the work to establish a child and family support agency.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has in place a new and comprehensive policy on the investigation of sexual crime, crimes against children and child welfare.</p><p>  As far as the particular sector in question in this case is concerned, the Minister is assured by his colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that there are clear and robust child protection procedures in place in Irish summer colleges and in households accommodating students.  These involve, <i>inter alia</i>, each college authority being required to develop and implement a written policy to prevent any form of child-abuse, bullying or anti-social behaviour during courses.  In addition, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in cooperation with CONCOS, the umbrella organisation for the colleges, assists with the training and coaching of college employees with regard to the implementation of Children First guidance, both inside and outside the classroom, and in the households where the students are accommodated.  All households providing accommodation for students in the Gaeltacht and all employees of Irish summer colleges are checked with the Garda vetting unit.</p><p>  This transformation of child protection arrangements has been motivated by the very disturbing lessons we have learned from the past.  If there are further lessons to be learned from this case, or indeed from others, the Minister is determined that this will be done.  For this reason, he believes that the Garda review should be allowed to proceed and its results considered carefully.  He will also engage with his ministerial colleagues on any lessons they feel can be learned as far as their respective organisations are concerned.</p><p>  On behalf of the Minister I would like to again thank the Senator for raising this important issue and will certainly share the points he has made with the relevant Ministers.</p></speech>

It is good to hear the Garda Commissioner's investigation is at an advanced stage and we welcome that report coming out as soon as possible.  The Minister says he has no jurisdiction over the other investigations but I might tapaigh an deis because one of the other investigations relates to the HSE.  I will not spring it on the Minister but perhaps he might go back to the HSE because an internal review regarding this individual was to be carried out, with an internal investigation of whether any allegations had made over the years against this person.  Perhaps the Minister might raise this with the HSE and correspond with me on it.  I will refer to the Minister for Education and Skills about the investigation by the Department.</p></speech>

I will certainly come back to the Senator <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the HSE and its investigation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that subject to consultation with the Garda Commissioner, he will examine how any key findings from the Garda review might be appropriately put into the public domain and will engage with this ministerial colleagues on any lessons to be learned from the perspective of any of the other organisations in question.</p><p>  I would like to reiterate the Minister's expressions of sympathy with all of those affected and his hope that they will be able to avail of the counselling assistance which is on offer.  I join with the Minister in offering that sympathy.</p> <p>We want our children to be safe.  It is a terribly sad reflection on previous Irish life that so many children were left in such exposed conditions that people could take advantage of them, and that the mechanisms did not seem to be in place to deal in a speedy fashion with those individuals who would take advantage of children in order to prevent them having numerous victims.  Sadly, that is the history and legacy we have, but as the Minister has pointed out, we must learn from those mistakes and ensure that in the future, matters are dealt with in such a way as to put child protection to the fore.</p></speech>
