In 2011 he stated that he wanted a sense of trust to be brought back to Irish politics.  As can clearly be seen, he has failed the people in this regard.  The process relating to the Seanad by-election was nothing other than cronyism of monumental proportions.  There has also been a shocking failure regarding Irish Water.  The former Minister of State who introduced the legislation to establish the company in this House has stated that it is &quot;a disaster&quot;.  Irish Water also involves cronyism.  Half the jobs relating to it are not, according to <i>thejournal.ie</i>, being advertised at all and most of them are being given to former public servants.  Perhaps the Leader will arrange a debate on this matter, because I would like to discover why these jobs are not being advertised.  Where is the transparency the Taoiseach both offered and promised in 2011?<br/>As bad as the lack of transparency relating to Irish Water is, that in respect of the HSE is even worse.  I refer to the manipulation of hospital waiting lists, something which is putting people's lives at risk.  Patients are being taken off those waiting lists and told to see private doctors, many of whom are not suited to treating the conditions with which people are presenting.  This is being done in order that the HSE can manipulate the figures, and people's lives are being put at risk as a result.  In addition, surgeons are being told to perform operations on people they have neither seen nor consulted with.  This is being done in the knowledge that these surgeons will not perform said operations and will put the patients involved back on the public hospital waiting list.  As a result, the list is manipulated in such a way as to make it seem that there are far fewer people on it.  What is being done here brings to mind the famous line about lies, damn lies and statistics, which is attributed to Disraeli.  Obviously, all three of these things apply in the context of the HSE's manipulation of the hospital waiting lists.  Mark Twain once stated: &quot;Facts are stubborn, but statistics are more pliable.&quot;  The Government does not like the facts, but it is fairly stubborn when it comes to manipulating statistics.  I request that the Cathaoirleach allow the Leader to bring the Minister for Health before the House in order that we might discuss the memo relating to this matter.  That memo is putting people's lives at risk.  Perhaps the Minister might bring with him a copy of the memo in which HSE officials were instructed to manipulate the waiting lists, putting people's lives at risk.  The person who issued the memo in question, who knew he was putting people's lives at risk, should be fired.<br/>In addition to manipulating hospital waiting lists, the Seanad by-election - quite disastrously, as it turns out - and Government Departments-----</p></speech>

If we are having this debate, we should look at the other reforms the Government has brought forward, for example, extending the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and powers and reforming the system of parliamentary inquiries, even in the wake of the defeat of the referendum in 2011.  We will regulate lobbying through the Registration of Lobbying Bill which is going through the Oireachtas.  Again, for the first time in the history of the State, it will introduce a register of lobbying.  This is hugely important and something which has been called for by NGOs for many years.  We have restored freedom of information legislation and reversed Fianna F&aacute;il's attempts to dismantle the freedom of information system, about which my colleagues on the other side have probably forgotten.  They sought to dismantle a system which had originally been introduced by the former Labour Party Minister of State, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald.  We have put in place protected disclosures legislation to protect whistleblowers and are preparing an ethics Bill to overhaul ethics legislation.</p></speech>

We have gone crazy about it and into a kind of silent stupor.  We spend three weeks talking about a shopkeeper in Kilcar and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  While I agree what was done was wayward, unnecessary and stupid in the extreme, we have people roaring around the place about cronyism.  However, if Fianna F&aacute;il Members really want to ventilate the subject of cronyism, I suggest they re-read about TASC's mapping of the golden circle when they will learn about the interlocking of multiple directorships, the remuneration, pensions and fees for all of the boys, banks and State companies.  It was money, money, money.  If I am correct, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, one of the loudest speakers recently on the idea of cronyism and modern art, was the worthwhile leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, with four portfolios during all of this period when there was a lack of governance and a general swindle.  Four portfolios - it defies belief.</p><p>It is the banks that have the people choked.  The people understand the necessity for water which, by the way, we have polluted.  We have not looked after it, although we understand it needs to be looked after.  We know that it is precious and needs to be preserved well, but that is not the problem.  The problem is that the people do not have the money to pay for it and the reason they do not have the money to pay for it is they are being choked by mortgages and loans.  They do not have proper legal recourse to tenancy or rent arrangements.  The universal social charge is at the top of every single cent they earn to pay for the wayward banks, on top of the &euro;3.7 billion we gave to them, in addition to the people's savings, yet we are still being choked by interest rates, which is financial thuggery at its best.</p><p>Will Senators, please, place their eyes on the most important issue in every house, home and business in the country?</p> <p>I plead with Senators to represent people and stand up against the banks.  Let me tell Senators what Mr. Honohan has done this morning.  He has reinvented fire.  He has run out and told us that he is limiting loan amounts for mortgages.  If he had looked back at practice in the 1980s, he would know people used to get two and a half times their salary as a loan.  That is all they were allowed when they came to a bank.  Mr. Honohan is now reinventing the wheel, but it is a bit too late to discover fire, when what he is doing was discovered in the 1980s when people were allowed borrow two and a half times their salary.</p><p>I urge Senators to think of the big issue, which is the way the banks are treating people - business people, mothers and fathers, mortgage dealers and people who owe money.  How they treat them is disgraceful, but not one of us is talking about it.  Banks are pulling interest rates out of the air and we are sitting here talking about somebody up in Kilcar and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, an issue I agree was wrong and wayward.</p></speech>

I have been trying to understand the Taoiseach's position.  I am sure this will be an issue of curiosity and interest to our Austrian friends.  Apparently, the Taoiseach sees no discrepancy at all between sustaining a rotten borough election in which there are 225 votes involved to elect somebody to this House and the national Parliament and his attempts to dilute the independent university seats, of which there are six, and expand that electorate to 850,000 votes.  Somebody should take note of this.</p><p>Another issue is that Mr. McNulty has withdrawn from the election.  He announced his withdrawal and that announcement was repeated in the D&aacute;il.  However, people are still voting for him and it is said that he can be elected.  How can somebody be elected if he has withdrawn from the election?  It is said his name remained on the ballot paper.  He could have died and remained on it, but would he be elected then?  Would he take his seat in the House as a corpse?  This is nonsense.  His name could have and should have been withdrawn and those votes cast for him should be discounted.</p><p>Last week, when we dealt with the Freedom of Information Act here, the Government prated about the importance of letting a prurient press pore over all our taxi receipts and receipts for a sandwich here and there.  &quot;Freedom of information&quot; is a buzz phrase that is all over the place, yet Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister for Arts-----</p></speech>

We all look forward to hearing what she has to say.  Everything that has been done has been done in private and behind closed doors.  It has been very unsatisfactory.</p><p>I want to raise a very important issue affecting nurses, one I have raised before and on which we should have a special debate.  An Bord Altranais - the nursing board - has been given full power to set fees under recent legislation and almost doubled them.  While the matter was discussed here last week, we should have a special debate on it.  I highlight it again, as there will be a protest this week.  Uniquely among PAYE professionals, nurses are obliged to pay their own registration fees.  The vast majority of professionals who pay registration fees can deduct them from their tax, but that option is not available to nurses.  We should, therefore, have a special debate on the issue because nurses do so much work.  While I raised it last week, I raise it again as it has not received the attention it deserves.  Nurses need a break. We should question bureaucracies at all times about what they need money for and how it is being spent.  There does not appear to be any avenue for us to question the board which has full power to set these fees.  I call for a special debate with the Minister for Health and reject saying it is not our responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas because we gave An Bord Altranais the power to do this and must check that power by asking why exactly it is increasing the fees.  It is not fair to a particular, hard-pressed section of society and public life whose members do so much good.</p></speech>

Given recent developments involving Irish Water, concerns about people having to offer up their PPSNs to agencies, banks and authorities, including Irish Water, and matters before the courts involving the improper dissemination of private and personal information, is the legislation underpinning the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner fit for purpose any longer?  Is it sufficiently robust?  Do we need to revisit it to allow the Legislature to catch up with the many developments in computerisation since 1989?</p><p>We must address whether the deterrents for the wrongful use of individuals' data are sufficiently strong to prevent the misuse of personal private information such as PPS numbers.  While the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has provided a great service, it operates with as few as 30 staff based, following decentralisation, in Portarlington.</p> <p>Could the Leader facilitate a debate through the Office of An Taoiseach, who has line responsibility for this service, and the Data Protection Commissioner so that we can be sure the legislation supporting the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is adequate, sufficiently robust and relevant in this day and age and also that we have a full commitment from the Government to the decentralised office in Portarlington, the staff there and its resources?</p></speech>

I also suggest that this must apply to commercial property because in the madness of the Celtic tiger property boom, commercial property such as the veterinary site not many miles away was even worse than what was done by the banks in the domestic sector.</p><p>I also wish to express the sympathies of the House to the Reverend Colin McKibben, the minister of Convoy Presbyterian Church, which was attacked by fire bombers last Friday.  I commend the local priest, Fr. Phillip Kemmy, for expressing his sympathy.  The Orange Hall in Convoy was also destroyed.  When the Orange Order visited here through the invitation of the Leader and the Cathaoirleach, it praised the former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for a previous programme of restoring Orange Order properties which had been burned out in the Border counties.  This is something we do not want to go back to and I condemn that burning unreservedly.  </p><p>What the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, now describes as the disaster of Irish Water was forecast perfectly on these benches.  We asked him to provide for consumer representation.  The former Minister of State called for the introduction of new board members with a consumer advocacy background.  The Ombudsman has said this week that nobody has explained why statutory and independent redress was removed and that there was no consultation with his office or the public.  We have the recruitment of staff without open competition, the long-standing statement by Professor John Fitzgerald that this organisation should have 1,700 staff, not 4,300, and a watchdog where 59 staff were paid &euro;1 million in bonuses.  We badly need a debate on water in this country because this House was right.  All our amendments should have been accepted by the former Minister of State.  I am sorry he is now in the political wilderness but he did have the way to deal with the problem if he had accepted what we said at the time.</p></speech>

We have a lot in common with Austria and agriculture is one of those areas.  Last night, I attended a meeting in Dundalk organised by Louth Macra na Feirme in connection with farm safety.  Senator Daly referred to statistics.  This is one case where the statistics and the facts come together.  A total of 6% of the occupational population accounts for over 50% of occupational fatalities.  This means that farming makes up over 50% of occupational fatalities.  This year alone, there have been 25 fatalities on Irish farms when there have been fewer than 50 in total.  For example, I think there have been six fatalities in construction.  We need to do something about that in terms of education.  There is a disproportionate number of young and elderly people suffering fatalities on farms.  The main reasons are tractors, machinery and drowning.  There are varying accounts for 17% of farming in terms of the working population and 57% of accidents and fatalities.</p> <p>I would like the Minister to be invited to the House for statements on farm safety to see if we can improve the current situation and prevent the needless loss of life on our farms.</p></speech>

Will the Leader seek clarification from the Minister for Justice and Equality as to why the President was not allowed to visit the Athlone centre and whether that issue can be overcome in the future?  It is ironic given that last Friday he opened the new offices of the Irish Refugee Council.  He has a serious interest in these areas.</p><p>It is frustrating to hear the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, in radio interviews and to read what he has said in newspaper articles when, as Senator Barrett said, we had long, heated and detailed debates in the House about the setting up of Irish Water during which we in the Opposition pointed out the unmitigated disaster it would be.

As Senator O'Donnell said, all of us were restricted to 2.5 times our earnings when we went to buy our family homes.  Unlike Senator Brennan, I have a problem with the requirement for a 20% deposit, in particular for young couples who rent private accommodation prior to purchasing a home.

These new rules will ensure transparency, accountability and value for money.  It should be noted the new requirements apply to all funding received out of the Exchequer, no matter how that money is distributed.  Four important principles will guide the bodies, namely, clarity, fairness, governance and value for money.</p><p>Most significantly, bodies that receive grants will have to publish details of their employees&rsquo; and executives&rsquo; salaries exceeding &euro;60,000 per annum.

In the context of preparing for the recent Private Members' motion on the direct provision issue I visited several centres, and I know the Department of Justice and Equality facilitated my visit on one occasion.  I cannot understand the reason the Department and the agencies involved should not do everything necessary to facilitate a Presidential visit.  It would be highly appropriate for the President to visit.  It is such a part of the symbolic office of the Presidency.  By being present with people and groups, particularly those considered to be marginalised, the President is sending out a powerful message.  By vetoing the visit, the Department appears to have interfered with the President in doing what a president ought to do.  We should hear from the Government on this issue.  I would like to think President Higgins would visit such a centre very soon and that there would be ample media coverage of such a visit.</p></speech>

Recently in the UK, one moneylender firm was ordered by the regulator there to refund &pound;220 million in debts to 330,000 customers who took out loans that they clearly could not afford to repay.  While the scale may be somewhat lower in Ireland, comparatively speaking, the issue remains the same - that is, that there are unscrupulous moneylenders operating in Ireland who lend money to people without knowing or caring whether they can afford to pay it back.  Many of these lenders give out money without asking people about their personal finances and their income.  Often, they give money to multiple applicants in one household, where the loans are far from affordable lending.  There is a need to tighten the lending criteria for customers of moneylenders, because a lack of restrictions for lenders is setting a debt trap for borrowers.  Checking whether a person can afford to repay a loan should be at the heart of any application that is submitted.  If a moneylender has failed to satisfy the basic responsibility, the Central Bank should take action.  That is why I believe it is important that we should clean up this whole industry and the reason I am calling on the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss the issue and what steps he will take to address the reckless lending that is taking place.</p></speech>

Last Saturday I read a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i>about appointments to the board of Galway Harbour Company.  The extension of Galway Port is a really important development for Galway.</p> <p>We have been waiting on this for years and the application for planning permission is about to be submitted.  I was shocked to read about the appointments, however, and see the gender balance on the board, namely, of eight appointments only one is a woman.  That amounts to 12.5%, yet the Government made a commitment in 2011 to adhere to making female appointments at a rate of 40% - on merit, of course.  </p><p>The new Minister of State with this responsibility, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, recently restated this.  How can we believe anything, however, if it has not been implemented up to now?  </p><p>At the weekend, I was reminded of two fine women with extensive qualifications and background that would be relevant to the harbour board.  One is an auditor and accountant, while the other is a legal person.  I cannot confirm if that expertise is on the board.</p><p>Why have the gender guidelines not been adhered to so far?  I am not talking just about gender without merit.  Why were the women who applied - perhaps others applied as well - not appointed, given their immense relevant experience in both the legal and financial areas that could develop and advance the Galway Harbour Board's project to extend Galway Port?  It is so relevant to Galway.  </p><p>I seek the Leader's guidance as to whom I should address these questions.  Let this be the end of cronyism.

Members of the business community, whom I meet regularly, tell me they are being treated with absolute contempt and disdain by the banking system.</p><p>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, should attend the House for a debate on mental health issues.  I am repeating the call for such a debate because of a letter I received today from Councillor Liam Brazil in County Waterford.  He has written quite openly about the fact that his family has been impacted by suicide.  He pointed out, as we know, that over 600 people commit suicide in this country every year.  Those are the numbers that are reported but there are possibly a further 150 to 200 cases that go unreported as death by suicide.  </p><p>Some years ago we had a major crisis with road deaths reaching 450 per annum.  The Government and the NRA put in place a road safety campaign that has thankfully reduced those numbers to 225 last year, although that is still much too high.  We need to put mental health at the centre of our health system and must aggressively address the suicide issue.  There is no more significant issue for the House to discuss than suicide levels.  As the matter is impacting upon so many families and communities throughout the country, I ask the Leader to put suicide at the top of the list for the Seanad's consultation process.  We should invite groups working in that area, as well as the families affected, to make contributions here.  For once and for all, we need to put in train a plan to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Why do we need to bring people in to tell us things we already know?</p> <p>The Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Fund Bill 2014, was non-political and non-adversarial.  We ran after each other to vote against it, which is doing precisely what Senator Mullins wanted.  The Family Home Bill 2011 proposed to make the family home sacrosanct from repossession.  The Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill 2011 would have put a veto on the banks to prevent them treating people with the contempt to which Senator Mullins referred.  A previous speaker referred to the Criminal Justice (Unlicensed Money-Lending) Bill 2013.  I suggest it is not the Minister for Finance but rather the Minister for Justice and Equality who should deal with this legislation.  There is no political appetite to deal with these issues.  There is no shortage of proposed legislation.  Senator Mullins knows well that we do not want to waste our time nor do we wish to create the facade that something is happening just by bringing organisations into this Chamber so that they can tell what we know we need to do.</p></speech>

A series of suggestions to assist the housing market have been made during the past week.  I declare my interest in that I am an auctioneer.  There is talk of a tax on unused sites.  I agree with that if finance is available.  This plays into previous points because if finance was available for developers to use land, I would agree that we should encourage them to build houses.  However, this is not possible because most of the land is under the control of NAMA and local authorities so it is fantasy and nonsense from the Minister, Deputy Kelly.</p><p>I agree wholeheartedly with a previous speaker with regard to a deposit of 20% for buying a house.  Who are the people working in the Central Bank?  My God, it concerns me that we might have the same kind of muppetry we had that led us into the crisis if they think that a person could actually save &euro;50,000 for a purchase price of &euro;250,000.  There is a little boom going on in Dublin districts 2, 4 and 6, where prices are going up.  </p></speech>

This scheme will facilitate foreign nationals requiring a short-stay visa to travel freely within the common travel area using a single visa issued by either Ireland or the United Kingdom.  This will mean that tourists, business visitors and other eligible visitors will, for the first time, be permitted to visit the UK and Ireland, including moving freely between North and South, on a single visa.  The Minister and the Home Secretary announced that from later this month, China, followed shortly thereafter by India, will be the first countries in the world to benefit from the British-Irish visa scheme.</p><p>The Minister and the Home Secretary have also agreed to review the operation, and depending on the success of the scheme in China and India, it is intended to extend it to all countries by the end of next year.  A few years' ago the British-Irish visa scheme would have seemed impossible.  The scheme will boost tourism and business travel to both islands and no doubt will provide a clear and powerful message that the British Isles and the island of Ireland are open for world-wide business and tourism.</p><p>This scheme augurs well for tourism.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Home Secretary, Theresa May, are to be complimented for completing this historic agreement for both countries.</p> <p>It is a truly good news story for tourism-----</p></speech>

Almost &euro;1 million was invested in this state-of-the-art facility which will attract international rowers and those from Northern Ireland due to its central location.  However, there is a need to complete the project and I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his Department to ensure that does not remain on the back burner, so to speak.  It is vitally important that the remaining amount of money be made available in this year's budget.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate issues such as this with the Minister who indicated that the sports capital programme would be continuing.  The Leader might have a view on it.</p><p>I raise an issue which I believe is of public importance.  Members on all sides of the House are familiar with the scamming of e-mails.  We have all seen e-mails stating that if one does not respond, one's bank account will be shut down, and they want one's private details.  However, it has become much more insidious in recent weeks in that there are now scam e-mails circulating.  I have received a number of them, and perhaps other colleagues, which purport to come from the Revenue Commissioners.  They state that unless one fills in the relevant details, which is one's personal information, one will be denied tax refunds.  </p><p>I have spoken to the Revenue Commissioners about this and they tell me that they have made it clear on their website that people are not to respond to these e-mails but I am taking the opportunity in this House of Parliament to put the issue on the record.  I hope the general public might pick up on it, and the Leader may have a view on it also.  It is vitally important that people not respond to these e-mails but, unfortunately, people do respond to them and lose money as a result.  It is just one of a number of scams but it is particularly invidious in that it now purports to come from the Revenue Commissioners.  I advise the members of the general public that when they get an e-mail requesting personal banking details it is not from their bank or the Revenue Commissioners because that is not the way they do business.</p><p>I have a particular criticism to make of one bank in particular in terms of the manner in which it handles its customer relations.  I refer to Bank of Ireland.  If anyone wants to talk to their local branch of Bank of Ireland using the number it provides, they will now get an automated menu, which it changed in recent weeks, that will keep them on the phone for a considerable amount of time and at considerable cost.  I plead with Bank of Ireland to please get its act together in this regard.  It says it has a customer service facility.</p></speech>

It was indicated that this is costing the Exchequer approximately &euro;21 million per annum through lost VAT and excise duty.  That makes sense to me.  It is as much a public health issue as it is an Exchequer issue, and it is clear that the main multinational supermarkets are benefiting from this to the detriment of smaller retailers as well as bars.</p><p>Allied to that is the campaign by the vintners association to get the Government to consider reducing excise duty in pubs ahead of the budget.  I believe that an end to below-cost selling of alcohol in supermarkets would in turn provide a boost to our pubs without reducing the excise duty.  I would much rather see people drinking in the pubs, as happened here for years, in a controlled environment where the publican can have some concern for the welfare of those consuming alcohol on the premises.</p><p>It is interesting to note that while the cost of consuming alcohol in pubs has risen by an astonishing 300% since 1990, the price of alcohol in off-licences halved.  It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that any rise in alcohol consumption is likely to have taken place outside the pubs and is driven by cheap alcohol sold below cost by large multiples.</p> <p>This is also reflected by the sixfold increase in the number of off-licences in the past ten years, against a backdrop of 20% fewer pubs in the same period.  It is time that the Government worked to change this and a ban on below-cost selling would be a boost to public health and the Exchequer.  I would welcome a debate on the issue in the House at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></speech>

It is an essential part of our economy.  Not having a functioning banking sector means we do not have a functioning economy.  Despite the awful things which went on the in past, we should engage in such a debate in a positive way.  </p><p>In addition to the positive news from Shannon Airport, Ryanair today launched its 2015 schedule.  I welcome the fact that it has again committed to further increase its traffic to Shannon by 125,000 in 2015, an increase of 18%.  I also welcome the announcement of the new flights to Manchester and Lithuania.  It is a further indication of the fact that Shannon Airport becoming an independent airport was a game changer.  We have seen the results, with more than 1 million people visiting the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience in 2014.  Those figures will increase next year.</p><p>I agree with the sentiments expressed by colleagues today about the fact that RIA and the Department of Justice and Equality refused permission for the President to accept an invitation to attend a direct provision centre in Athlone.</p></speech>

What is far more sinister are those who receive phone calls on their mobile phones while on the Internet from those who tell them they will hack into their computers unless they pay money over immediately.  I know of people who had such an experience.  It is part of a new trend.  It is quite frightening when it happens.  If it happens people should disconnect their phones immediately and shut down their computers before any action is taken, and not transfer any money as happened in one case.</p><p>I refer to Irish Water.  Now that it has been established it is important that it is functioning and we have a regular review of the procedures it introduces.  One issue which came to my attention in the past week concerns the fact that it is part of the Bord G&aacute;is group.  When it deals with housing estates it insists, and rightly so, that it puts in place the gas pipeline servicing all houses in entire estates.  I understand it is now floating, to pardon a pun, the idea that it would also be responsible for installing water and sewer pipes in housing estates.  That will cause legal complications because if engineers certify the building and make sure there is full compliance with planning, there will be a dispute regarding who is responsible for what.  It is something about which the construction industry is concerned.  Builders are concerned that there could be two or three different contractors in one building estate at the same time without anyone being in overall charge.  It is causing concern and needs to be resolved at a very early stage.  We should have a debate on the current procedure in Irish Water.  </p></speech>

I do not understand the apparent growth in the number of suicides, particularly the sad increase in rates among young people.  I am not sure what the answer is, but more needs to be done.  Could we encourage the Minister for Health to set up a special task force to examine the matter with experts?  I do not understand depression, but perhaps we might consider practical ways to reach out to those suffering from this frightful condition.  I do not know if I should call it a disease; perhaps Senator John Crown might be of assistance in this regard.  I heard him being prayed for at mass yesterday, although it was not in connection with a suicide; he had given great help to somebody else.  This is a matter for consideration by a special task force and perhaps the Minister for Health might be involved.</p><p>I am delighted that Senator Paschal Mooney raised his issue today, as I referred to it some time ago.  I did not go as far as he did in contacting the Revenue Commissioners, as I got in touch with somebody else.  All of these scams are frightful.  </p><p>I support the call initiated by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for a debate on banking.  I sought such a debate before and there are many aspects to the issue that still have to be corrected.  As has been mentioned, if we do not have a functioning banking system, we will not have a functioning economy.  I am delighted that the Central Bank is taking steps to impose limits in the mortgage sector.  As Senator Marc MacSharry noted, there may be an argument about the recommendation of a 20% deposit but having a limit of no more than three or four times a salary is correct.</p></speech>

It was urgent when the Members of this and the other House were elected three years ago and the issue remains unresolved, unmitigated, unpalliated and just as urgent as it was then.  It concerns the scandalous state of waiting lists for public patients.  I will not use any word that could seem judgmental, but it is now apparent that, collectively, we were, as a society and spectators of the health service, at least misinformed about the true trajectory of what was happening with waiting lists for several years.  It appears that a number of "redefinitions" of what constituted waiting lists, particularly long-term waiting lists, were used.  To put it politely, the net effect was to make the figures somewhat better than they had been.</p><p>In January I brought to the attention of the Oireachtas an internal document that had been brought to my attention on the standard operating procedure, SOP, for scheduling outpatient appointments requested by a general practitioner, GP.  It was apparent to me at that stage that within the SOP there was an opportunity to engage in substantial obfuscation of the truth of the waiting list problem by counting those on the waiting lists, not from the time at which the GP applied for a clinic appointment but from the time at which an official made a request for a particular date.  There is a waiting time built into the process before a patient is given a date.  Although I was not aware of it, an extraordinary example has been reported in the past couple of days.  Approximately one year ago waiting lists appeared to drop by 90% in one month and then rise again to where they had been some time afterwards.  There was either an extraordinary epidemic of a very short-lived disease or else there was a major change in the accounting practices used.  </p><p>This Government was elected on the two big promises of fixing politics and fixing the health service.  The report card is not great on either one.  As I indicated, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow the Minister to come to the House to tell us how he will address the waiting list issue.</p><p>The House should acknowledge the wonderful achievement of an Irish-American, Dr. John O'Keefe, who won the Nobel Prize for medicine.  He belongs to a select group of people in the world of biomedicine and science.  He is a first generation Irish emigrant, as his parents are from Cork.  We should acknowledge this through correspondence or otherwise.  </p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett has raised this issue before, but I am very concerned about the fall of Irish universities in international league tables.</p> <p>This is not a mystery; it is happening for a reason.</p></speech>

He also made serious charges about consultants operating on people without having their files.  That should certainly be examined.  As has been pointed out, Senator Daly's current party leader set up the HSE.  Until 2012, no data were available on outpatient appointments and it was totally unmeasured.  The previous Government preferred to live in denial of its failure to address the matter, and patients suffered as a consequence.  This Government is putting patients at the centre of our reforms.  We established the special delivery unit and, as a result, we have a clearer picture of the number waiting and how long people are waiting.  The numbers and the length of time involved are unacceptable and must be tackled.  That is exactly what is being done.</p><p>As regards manipulation of waiting list figures, as suggested by the Senator, the HSE has stated clearly that it has no knowledge of any memo that allegedly urges employees to do this.  HSE policy is clear.  All hospital managers are expected to efficiently manage waiting lists in chronological order, except where clinical need dictates that a patient needs to be prioritised.  So far this year, the HSE has seen, diagnosed or treated 5% more patients at outpatient clinics than last year.  It has also seen 10% more referrals to clinics.  While huge progress is being made, there is more demand than supply for its services.</p></speech>

GPs and consultants are informed if the patient has been removed from the list and, if the GP or consultant considers the patient should be reinstated, this is done.</p><p>In 2013, a total of 500,000 people did not attend outpatient visits.  The estimated cost of each unused slot is in the region of &euro;200 or &euro;300 depending on the specialty concerned.  This accounts for the time of nurses and doctors as well as the preparation and administrative time in advance of the visit.  It is a serious point.  Let us think of all the patients who could be seen in these slots.</p><p>The HSE is working to reduce waiting lists.  Availability, reminders and clinical need for appointment after waiting a period of time dictate the need for validation and verification of the list.  Some 500,000 people not attending the slots given to them is causing a major problem and must be addressed.  There should be a nationwide campaign and information on it.  People should be reminded that if they are not taking up their slots, they should notify the consultant and the hospital well in advance to allow consultants and hospitals to add other people to the slots.  This should be addressed urgently and can help the waiting list problem.</p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the objective and transparent appointments to State boards and the many reforms the Government has introduced in the past number of years.</p> <p> Senator Ivana Bacik called for a debate on the democratic reform process.  I will ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to come to the House to address the matter.</p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and several other Senators commented on the banks choking the system for mortgage lending and through a lack of credit for businesses.  She suggested there was a need for a further debate on banking.  We have had several debates on the issue, but it is perhaps six to eight months since we last debated it.  I will, therefore, try to arrange a further debate on the issue.</p><p>Senator Pat O'Neill commented on the European Commission and suggested we invite various European Commissioners to address the House.</p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne raised an issue that had been raised on several occasions last week and the previous week, that is, the increase in registration fees for nurses.  Perhaps he might table an Adjournment matter to discuss it.</p><p>As I look around the Chamber, I am replying to Members as much as I can.  I am trying to skip those Members who are not here but who did ask questions.  Clearly, I may miss out on some of them.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett raised the question of the Central Bank's position on requiring a 20% deposit and limiting loans to a maximum of three and a half times total income.  He mentioned that this issue had been raised in the House several years ago.  Senator Marc MacSharry disagrees with the Senator on requiring a 20% deposit and takes the view that it should not be introduced.</p><p>Senator Marie Moloney made several points about the banks, as well as raising the possibility of the reintroduction of grants for first-time buyers.  We will have to wait for the budget next week to see if anything will be announced in that regard.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett condemned the attacks on Orange Order halls, which were despicable.  All right-thinking people will agree that they are absolutely outrageous and an attempt to raise tensions within both communities in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy commented on the issue of safety on farms and outlined that there had been 25 fatalities.  This matter was raised last week by Senator Martin Conway who requested that the Seanad Public Consultation Committee consider it when it next met.  I have written to the Leas-Chathaoirelach to ask that we have it as a matter to be discussed by the committee.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden commented on the issue of petrol stretching.  The matter has been raised in the House on at least four or five occasions in recent weeks.  It is an outrageous practice.  The Senator referred to the fact that good quality diesel or petrol should be put up for sale by reputable garages.</p></speech>

I imagine the matter can be addressed in the debate we will have on democratic reforms.</p><p>Senator Michael Mullins remarked on EU anti-trafficking laws and the criminalising of prostitution.  This issue could be included in the sexual offences Bill to be brought forward.  I will certainly raise it with the Minister.</p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins commented on unscrupulous moneylenders.  I gather she is referring to licensed moneylenders and the need to clean up the system.  She called for a debate on the matter.  It could probably be taken in conjunction with the issue of banking, on which we will try to arrange a debate.</p> <p> Senator Mullins also requested a debate on banking.  He and Senator Paul Coghlan raised the question of mental health and referred to a letter which they and many other colleagues in the House received from Mr. Liam Brazil, a councillor in County Waterford, where I live.  At the request of Senator Gilroy, who raised that matter last week, I have already asked that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, come before the House to engage in a debate on mental health.  I am in a position to confirm that the Minister of State will be here to discuss mental health on 11 November.</p><p>Senator Brennan welcomed the establishment of the British-Irish visa scheme and outlined the benefits that may accrue from it in the context of tourism and business.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to sports capital programme funding.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring, will provide details of the new programme when it is being introduced.</p><p>The question of e-mail scams, etc., has been raised by Senator Paul Coghlan and others on a number of occasions.  The point to the effect that the public should be aware of what is involved with regard to such scams is extremely valid.</p><p>On the question of the banks and customer service, I am of the view that the banks are probably more interested in utilising machines rather than having people visit branches and deal with staff.

The Bill addresses the commitment in the programme for Government to legislate to regulate clamping.  The impetus for this commitment stems principally from public concerns in regard to the activity of some clamping operators and the extent to which clamping may be carried out in a less than fair manner, with no obvious consistent or transparent recourse to appeal against perceived abuses.  The areas of greatest public concern relate to the level and variation in clamp release charges currently applied, the lack of a clearly identifiable and accessible clamping appeals process and the oftentimes absence of appropriate information signage for motorists.</p><p>Currently, section 101B of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended, provides for the clamping and-or relocation of vehicles illegally parked on a public road by either a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a person appointed in writing by a local authority or a traffic warden.  However, there is currently no regulation of clamping activities carried out on private land.  The practice of clamping or relocating vehicles on private property does not come within the scope or the spirit of road traffic legislation.  Such legislation tends to relate only to activities on public roads.</p><p>The legal issues surrounding the situation whereby a clamp is placed on a vehicle in circumstances other than those provided for in existing legislation relating to the public road and certain State agencies, primarily relates to the manner of the contract between the owner of the land or car park and the car driver or owner.  However, in such latter circumstances, no account is taken of the need to regulate clamping activities in the broader public interest, nor do such circumstances carry with them the same transparent safeguards for members of the public as apply to clamping activities currently carried out under statute.</p><p>It is, therefore, appropriate that clarity be given by the Oireachtas to this situation in order to protect the rights of both citizens and property owners alike in regard to an activity which has become an increasing feature of urban life in Ireland.  It is in this context that my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, presented a discussion document to the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht in December 2011, in which he outlined the principal issues to be addressed, together with proposals on the shape of appropriate legislation, and invited the committee's views.  The committee responded in a comprehensive report which contained a number of recommendations, the majority of which have been taken into account in this Bill.</p><p>The discussion document presented to the committee outlined a number of options by which the issues of public concern in regard to clamping might best be addressed.  These options included: banning clamping; whether or not proposed legislation should be confined to clamping activities on private property only or to both private and public property; or allowing clamping operators to self-regulate.  The document also outlined how proposed regulation of clamping activities might be applied.  For example, in introducing legislation, should the primary focus be on those individuals or companies undertaking the clamping activity or, alternatively, should the circumstances and requirements for the application of a clamp to a vehicle be regulated instead?  The issue of whether or not the related activity of towing should be regulated was also considered.  The broader issues of who might regulate, how regulation might be funded, what requirements should be adhered to before clamping a vehicle, the setting of maximum clamp release charges, the provision of an independent appeals process and other relevant matters were also outlined for the committee's consideration.</p><p>The joint Oireachtas committee invited a number of representative stakeholders to make presentations to it or to submit written submissions for its consideration.  The range of stakeholders attending those hearings or making submissions to the committee included; local authorities; representative bodies from that sector; AA Ireland; representatives of the clamping industry; business organisations such as Chambers Ireland and Retail Excellence Ireland; the Irish Patients' Association; Dublin City Council's independent parking appeals officer; the Irish Property and Facility Management Association; officials from my Department; and other interested parties.</p> <p> These hearings and submissions raised some important and interesting matters, and after due consideration the committee formed the view, as part of the options for reform, that any legislative proposals in regard to clamping should ensure harmonisation regarding the processes and procedures involved, regardless of where clamping takes place, be it on public roads or private property.  Most of the core suggestions arising from the main areas of concern identified by the committee have been provided for in one form or another within the Bill.  One of the long-standing issues raised by Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il is the role of committees in the drafting of legislation and how Members' and stakeholders' expertise and input can best be harnessed.  This legislation provides an example of how many Members contributed to the drafting of the Bill.  They provided input on the heads of the Bill and a broad variety of people involved in the industry had an opportunity to make their views known.  This process had a substantive impact on the nature of the Bill and its drafting, and I thank all those who took the time to participate in that process.</p><p>Particular core matters dealt with in the Bill are the designation of the National Transport Authority as regulator of clamping activities; the setting of maximum permissible clamp release charges on private lands; the establishment of a two-tier appeals process; an obligation to provide clear and prominent signage in areas where clamping is operated; the establishment of codes of practice to provide practical guidance regarding compliance with regulatory requirements; regulating the means of identification to be carried, displayed and presented by clamping operatives; and the setting of appropriate penalties for breaching provisions of the Bill or regulations made under it.</p><p>The Bill does not provide for the registration and licensing of clamping operators and the associated vetting of staff employed by clamping operators.  Although the provision of such measures was outlined in the general scheme of Bill, after detailed consideration of the issues involved, including extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, these provisions are not included in the Bill I am presenting today.  A compulsory licensing and registration regime for clamping operators, complete with the associated requirements and stipulations attaching to such a regime, would not, in terms of cost and practical effectiveness, represent the most effective manner of addressing the issues of public concern which this Bill seeks to address.</p><p>In the final analysis, the introduction of a statutory licensing regime was deemed to be excessive and too costly to implement for the taxpayer and clamping operators alike.  Due to the relatively small number of sizeable parking enforcement or clamping operators in existence, the public would have been hit on the double for the establishment of such a regime.  It would have ended up subsidising what may have been an economically unsustainable licensing regime, while at the same time having to pay increased clamp release charges imposed by clamping operators who chose as part of their business model to increase such charges to offset licensing fees imposed by the State.  Also, such a regime, by its very nature, would undoubtedly have focused exclusively on clamping operators.  This would have presented difficulties in making provision for those individuals who, of their own accord and without contracting the services of a clamping operator, choose to clamp vehicles on their own private property.</p><p>Taking cognisance of all these very real and pertinent considerations, we decided that the issues arising would be more appropriately addressed through the statutory regulation of clamping activities, irrespective of the location in which they are carried out.</p> <p>I stress to Senators that this is a core decision which permeates the Bill, influenced its drafting and will inform its implementation.  I refer to the point of focusing on the actual activity of clamping and how it is done, regardless of whether it takes place on public or private land.  In choosing to regulate the activity of clamping rather than licensing the person or company carrying out the activity, the provisions of the Bill will cater for all scenarios in which a vehicle is clamped whether by a local authority, individual or contracting party such as a clamping operator on public or private land.  As a consequence of putting the regulatory focus of the Bill on the activity of clamping, we will have far greater breadth of coverage in terms of who does the clamping and the location in which it is carried out.</p><p>The Bill recognises the fundamental importance of regulating these activities so that issues of public concern can be addressed.  It provides for the statutory regulation of clamping activities, irrespective of location.  Corresponding sanctions for the beach of the regulations are also being provided for.  The Bill also contains enforcement powers including powers to prosecute in relation to non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill or a regulation made under it.  In policy terms, it is not the aim of the Bill to determine in what places clamping should or should not take place, nor does it set out to decide parking policy, which is an objective of either local authorities or those who own, control or regulate the private property which is included within the coverage of the Bill.  Bodies responsible for areas of parking - be they local authorities in respect of public roads, State agencies in respect of parking areas or owners of private land - will continue to determine parking policy and appropriate parking controls.  The Bill provides that if clamping is used as a means of clamping control, the legislation must be complied with.</p><p>It is entirely reasonable for landowners to be able to deal in a fair and cost-effective manner with nuisance parking.  For example, the parking of cars all day at a shopping centre is to the obvious disadvantage of other customers.  At an apartment complex, residents may be inconvenienced.  While the owners or managers involved should have the right to take reasonable action, the manner in which the clamping activities are carried out must be regulated.  There is a clear need to establish broad rules governing these activities and it is the manner in which these rules can be formulated which has required detailed consideration.</p><p>It is also self-evident that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure effective traffic management in towns and cities as well as in relation to the corresponding utilisation of finite parking resources on the public road.  However, while the use of clamping as a parking enforcement mechanism is highly effective, the rights of landowners and the responsibilities of the State must not be exercised to the detriment of the individual motorist.  These competing rights and responsibilities must at all times be exercised in the interests of both citizens' rights and the good of society as a whole.  It is a balancing act that much legislation has to walk.  It is particularly important in respect of the Bill given the focus on the activity and the objective that it be regulated regardless of where it takes place.  Bearing these issues in mind, I propose in the Bill to regulate clamping wherever it takes place.</p><p>Irrespective of where clamping is carried out, the Bill will provide for its regulation in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner across the public and private sectors.  In essence, the Bill aims to provide a balanced regulatory framework within which legitimate clamping operators may operate but which also protects motorists from any disreputable practices.</p> <p> As well as regulating clamping activities, the role and responsibilities of those persons or bodies that engage clamping operators are addressed.  Under the Bill, landowners or persons responsible for places in which clamping is operated will be obliged to provide appropriate signage in accordance with regulatory requirements, as well as providing for a statutory first stage appeals process.</p><p>I will now give a broad outline of the main provisions of the Bill which is in six Parts.  Part 1 deals with technical matters such as the Short Title and commencement, definitions of frequently used terms, the laying of regulations and orders and matters relating to regulations made by the NTA.  It also allows for further places where clamping is carried out under statute to be brought within the ambit of the Bill.  This latter provision is noteworthy in that it acknowledges the legal delineation, under which clamping has been carried out in Ireland for a number of years.  In regulating clamping activities in a non-discriminatory manner across both the public and private spectrum, for legal reasons, the Bill distinguishes between those places where clamping takes place under an existing enactment, referred to in the Bill as ''statutory clamping places&quot;, and all other places which are referred to as &quot;non-statutory clamping places&quot;.  Examples of &quot;statutory clamping places&quot; include the public road and parking areas operated by State bodies such as CIE, the Railway Procurement Agency and harbour companies.  &quot;Non-statutory clamping places&quot;, in the main, refers to private land or car parks in places such as shopping centres, sports venues and so on.  This distinction also recognises the legal difference between instances of unlawful parking on the public road and certain State lands as opposed to wrongful parking which may occur on private property where certain parking terms and conditions may not have been complied with.</p><p>Part 2 provides for many of the recommendations suggested by the joint Oireachtas committee relating to the regulation of clamping activities which, in respect of private property, is currently unregulated.  I am confident that the specific activities regulated for in this Part of the Bill address the regulatory lacuna heretofore in respect of clamping activities on private land.  Wherever clamping activities are carried out - on the public road, land belonging to or operated by a statutory body or private property - such activities must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  Specifically, this Part confers on the NTA the two central functions of regulating clamping activities and providing for a complaints and appeals procedure.  </p><p>When it comes to clamping, the source of greatest annoyance and disquiet for the motoring public is the variation in and inconsistent clamp release charges being applied in privately owned car parks.  Under section 14 of the Bill, the NTA will be conferred with regulatory powers to set the maximum clamp release and vehicle relocation charge.  Under this section, the NTA will be able to prescribe the maximum clamp release and vehicle relocation charge that may be charged in non-statutory clamping places such as private car parks and car parks associated with shopping centres, retail parks, sports stadia and so forth.  Where no maximum charges stand prescribed by the NTA, the Bill provides that the clamp release charge will be &euro;100 and the vehicle relocation charge, &euro;50.  A person who imposes or attempts to impose clamp release or vehicle relocation charges greater than the set maximum charges will commit an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a class B fine, a fine of up to &euro;4,000.  In statutory clamping places such as at State airports and railway stations the bodies responsible will be obliged to have regard to the recommendations made by the NTA in respect of such charges.  The Minister, after consultation with both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the NTA, may prescribe clamp release charges on the public road.</p><p>Another issue of public contention is the reported absence of appropriate and prominently displayed advisory signage warning motorists of clamping activities and the parking terms and conditions in areas in which clamping is in operation.</p> <p>Under section 10, persons responsible for enforcing the law or rules applicable to parking in a place where clamping is operated, referred to in the Bill as "parking controllers", will be obliged to provide prominent regulatory advisory signage, which clearly indicates that clamping activities are in operation and detailing the clamp release and vehicle relocation charges applying.  A parking controller who fails to provide such signage commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine, namely, a fine of up to &euro;2,500.  Other than on the public road, where the Minister will retain responsibility for regulatory signage under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, the NTA may make regulations with respect to clamping signage, including their location, information content, dimensions and design and symbols to be displayed, as well as the number of signs to be provided in a particular place.</p><p>The Bill also makes provision to enable the NTA to regulate the physical processes involved in clamping.  The principal day-to-day clamping processes that may be regulated include: the time period that shall elapse before a vehicle may be clamped; the clamp release time after payment of the appropriate charge; the means of identification of clamping operators; the form of clamping notice to be affixed to a clamped vehicle; the methods of payment of the clamp release charge; and the records to be kept in respect of such activities.</p><p>In this regard, the NTA may establish codes of practice under this Part for the purposes of providing practical guidance on clamping matters.  It is envisaged that standards relating to general behaviour, performance of duties and the conduct of clamping operators in respect of the carrying out of clamping activities and their interface with the public will be at the centre of such codes of practice.  Standards may be established regarding the supervision by parking controllers of contracted clamping operators in respect of clamping activities operated on their behalf.  The guiding principle in the establishment of codes of practice will be to assist parking controllers in both the public and private sectors, as well as clamping operators, in properly managing the day-to-day best practice operation of clamping activities in the public interest.</p><p>This Part provides an exemption for ambulances, fire brigade vehicles or any vehicle being used by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces in the performance of his or her duties from being clamped or relocated.  A vehicle displaying a disabled parking permit will be exempted from being clamped in any place where clamping is specifically legislated for under an enactment.</p><p>Part 3 makes provision for the establishment of a complaints procedure to address issues of perceived misconduct by clamping operators in the discharge of their duties, as well as providing for a two-tier appeals process to hear appeals against incidents of clamping or vehicle relocation.  The absence of a fair and transparent means of redress for motorists in instances of clamping is an issue that has also raised widespread public concern.  I have been clamped and I appealed the clamping.  The appeals process varies among clamping operators because it is administered by them.  In contrast to appealing a parking fine or parking charge with a local authority for which a clear process is laid down, when one is dealing with a private company and raising an issue about which one feels strongly, it is sometimes not clear how it should be dealt with.  The introduction of this provision will benefit not only those making appeals but also those working in the clamping industry because they have a right to ensure they can carry out their job to the best of their ability and that the process is well regulated with appeals against them conducted in an impartial manner.  Part 3 seeks to address this issue.  Although some clamping operators have in place appeals processes to cater for such instances on private land, there is an inconsistency of approach that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>Under the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, a person whose vehicle has been clamped or relocated may appeal, in the first instance, to the parking controller responsible for enforcement of the parking rules within that place.  Where the person is not satisfied with a determination made at this stage, he or she may lodge a second stage appeal to an independent clamping appeals officer appointed by the NTA.</p><p>The statutory procedures underpinning both of these stages of appeal, as well as the timelines for receipt of a determination on each, are set out in sections 18 to 21, inclusive.  The two tier appeals process harnesses the roles and responsibilities of those persons or bodies that engage clamping operators.  Generally, clamping operators are the contracted agents of principals such as retailers, hospitals and apartment management companies.  It is only right such principals play their part in ensuring motorists have access to a fair and easily accessible first stage of appeal.  A parking controller who fails to put appeal procedures in place will have committed an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a class B fine, namely, a fine not exceeding &euro;4,000.</p><p>Also, in line with recommendations made by the Oireachtas transport committee, the Bill gives the NTA the power to establish a procedure to consider complaints from members of the public concerning the discharge by parking controllers of their responsibilities, as well as the conduct and behaviour of clamping operators.</p><p>Part 4 provides the NTA with the necessary legislative powers to enforce compliance with the provisions and regulations made under the legislation.  In particular, this Part makes provision for the appointment of authorised persons by the NTA and the specifying of their powers of investigation.  Where it is considered that a parking controller or clamping operator is not complying with the Bill, clamping regulations or a code of practice, the NTA may direct such individuals to comply in accordance with any direction issued by the authority.  Where the NTA, having considered representations made to it by a parking controller or clamping operator, is still of the view that there is non-compliance with a direction given, it may apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing such compliance.</p><p>Part 5 provides for the application of equivalent regulatory provisions within the legislation to the public road.  This is in line with the commitment to ensure the regulation of clamping activities is harmonised across all areas.  In fulfilment of this objective on the public road, section 30 substitutes a new section for section 101B of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  This section provides for the clamping and removal of illegally parked vehicles on the public road, as well as for the prescribing of clamp release charges.  I will retain my ministerial function in the prescription of such charges, but I will consult both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the NTA before prescribing any such charge.  This section also amends the informational requirements of the notice to be affixed to clamped vehicles, particularly in giving details of the two tier appeals process operated under the Bill.</p><p>Part 6 provides for the amendment of various existing statutory provisions relating to the clamping of vehicles on land belonging to or occupied by CIE, the Railway Procurement Agency, State airports and harbours.  The intention of these amendments is to bring uniformity to existing statutory provisions.</p><p>The Bill enjoyed an input from Members through the Oireachtas committee process.  As a result, it has been much improved.  An important element of the legislation is the focus it will place on the regulation of clamping activity.  It will have as broad an implementation as possible, with a specific focus on parking on public and private lands.  The Bill is proportionate, responding to a legitimate public concern on behalf of motorists, while also recognising the needs of other stakeholders.</p> <p>A Bill such as this is also in the long-term interests of people who are working in the clamping industry because we all know that a regulated industry is one that has the best chance of being more sustainable in the long run.</p></speech>

The area of clamping, as the Minister has outlined, has been particularly contentious for many years, not only in respect of the provisions of this Bill, which is about private parking and in some instances public parking, but those on public roads.

In my case, I was going to the cinema in Parnell Street.  I parked on Parnell Street, having looked at the signs which indicated that free parking was allowed after 8 p.m., in other words that the parking fees were suspended at 8 p.m.  When I came back to my car later that night after the movie, I was amazed to discover I was clamped.  While I went through the process, as the Minister did, I was curious as the sign indicated that parking fees were suspended at 8 p.m.  However, I was told that lasted only for half an hour and that from 8.30 p.m. onwards parking was prohibited.  That happened to me again in Parnell Street.  I confess I was at fault, purely through ignorance, as I was running late.  I do not go back to Cineworld any more unless I take public transport.</p></speech>

Later I discovered that one of the areas in Dublin that is most vulnerable for motorists to clamping is Parnell Street.  Why is Parnell Street so vulnerable for motorists?  I did not park on the main road.</p></speech>

Apart from that I was concerned about the Parnell Street issue.  Perhaps the Minister would look at it.  I do not mean he should be micro managing but if it is happening in Parnell Street is it happening in other places?  Why is it that Parnell Street is one of the areas in the city with the highest rate of clamping?  I concur with the Minister that this was a wonderful process which came through the joint committee.  Increasingly, the Government has been using the committee process rather than just providing heads of Bills.  It was excellent and the Minister paid tribute to that.<br/>However, I am somewhat disappointed in one regard.  In his contribution the Minister said:<blockquote>In policy terms, it is not the aim of this Bill to determine in what places clamping should or should not take place.  Neither does it set out to decide parking policy.</blockquote>I have a real problem with this because, as the Minister is aware, there has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the charges imposed at hospital carparks and people who have been clamped and continue to be clamped in hospital carparks, without any regard whatsoever for the context or circumstances in which the owners of that car may have found themselves in default of the policy of the hospital relating to parking.  It is most unfair, in fact it is bordering on the inhumane, because the chances are that the reason the car ended up exceeding the time limit had probably to do with something that took place inside the hospital.  I do not think people deliberately exceed the time limit, once they go into a hospital carpark and pay a charge, which most people do, and in the context of clamping that is what happens.  Surely there should be some regulation in that area because it seems, under the provisions of the Bill, that hospitals can continue to operate <i>carte blanche</i>in any way they wish relating to parking policy.</p> <p>For a start, the charges are unfair and really excessive relative to public roads.  The policy of clamping cars in hospital carparks should be re-examined also.  In that context, I was disappointed that section 9 of the Bill provides for the National Transport Authority to make regulations.  Nowhere does it say, however, what the charges will be.  That does not allow Members of the Oireachtas to debate this matter.  The chances are that it will come through a statutory instrument, which will not allow for any debate.<br/>When I read the explanatory memorandum I expected it to provide details of the period of time that would expire after the detection of the wrongful or unlawful parking of a vehicle in a clamping place before a clamp may be fixed to the vehicle or a vehicle may be relocated.  I am taking that one, apart from all the other subsections included in the large section 9.  I would like to have known what the time limit is once somebody defaults, given the examples I cited.  There is nothing to indicate what the times are.  <br/>I refer to the infamous case of the journalist, John Waters, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He was charged with exceeding the parking time but he argued that he thought he had 15 minutes' grace.  I did not know there was such a thing.  There may be nothing in law to indicate such a period of grace, whereas in practice there could be.  If it is not in the law, similarly it applies to this section because I will leave this debate without any knowledge whatsoever of the time limits involve from the time one defaults to when the clamping operators can move in.  That is critical.  I appreciate that Bills of this nature tend to be worded like this.  The Minister will more than likely reply by stating that is the way the process works.  He will say that the broad structure and aims of the Bill are presented here, while the detail follows later.  I have always believed, however, that that is an inherent flaw in our parliamentary system because it does not give Oireachtas Members the right to question.  <br/>Perhaps the Minister can clarify how section 9 will be implemented by his Department, given that this power is being handed over to the NTA.  The NTA will then publish the data outside the political framework and we will not have any opportunity to debate whether or not the system is fair.  Presumably the Minister will give some direction to the NTA in this regard because the authority comes under his brief.  The NTA will therefore not act autonomously, although the Bill may give it that autonomy.  If it does not, however, and if the Minister has any say in the matter, I plead with him to act in order to minimise the discomfort, inconvenience and annoyance felt by the general public.  A fair time should be given.  It could be five minutes but some period of grace should be afforded before clampers can move in to legally clamp a car.<br/>I wanted to mention other things but I appreciate that I have run out of time.  We will get a chance to discuss them in more detail on Committee Stage.  In his introductory remarks, the Minister said:<blockquote>It is entirely reasonable that landowners need to be able to deal in a fair and cost-effective manner with nuisance parking.  For example, in relation to the parking of cars all day in a shopping centre to the obvious disadvantage of other customers, or in apartment complexes to the inconvenience of residents, the owners or managers involved should have the right to take reasonable action.</blockquote>That is a complex area.  For example, supermarkets would be reluctant to follow up prosecutions because they may feel they might lose customers.  On the other hand, they have a legitimate point in that some people park there.  At weekends, particularly on Sundays when a large number of GAA and soccer matches occur across the country, many towns and villages which do not have sufficient parking facilities for large games, use these carparks.  In the context of parking policy, I hope they will operate fairly and reasonably in this regard.</p> <p>I hope this Bill will not tighten the law to the extent that people coming out of a sporting event might find their car clamped.  Some people might say that the law now gives us the right to do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-07a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100700028#BB00200"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to the House.</p><p>In my experience, if one sees a clamped car at the side of the road one has a certain sympathy for the driver, whereas a parking ticket does not evoke the same sympathy.  I note with interest that the only local authority operating a clamping system is Dublin City Council.  For example, Galway City Council and Galway County Council abolished the use of clamping in 2007 as did Cork City Council in 2012 because it was costing &euro;1 million a year to administer the system and it was only taking in &euro;750,000 in fines.  I agree that Dublin is a different beast and a bigger city, but I question the need for a clamping system.  Approximately 90,000 to 100,000 cars are clamped nationally every year, while a total of 150 cars are clamped in Dublin every day.  Approximately 45% to 50% of cars clamped in the country are clamped on private property.  This is why regulation is needed and I welcome the Bill.  We have all heard the horror stories, and people will always tell one the worst thing that has happened to them.</p><p>Certain categories of private property, such as supermarkets and hotel car parks, are entitled to protect their car parking spaces because such spaces are their means of income and their trade can be affected if the parking spaces are used by those who are not visiting their premises.  The Bill provides for a maximum charge, which will be regulated.  The Bill provides for regulation rather than licensing, which would not be viable in this country.</p><p>Senator Mooney raised points that I had intended to raise.  When will the National Transport Authority provide the regulations as proposed in section 9 of the Bill?</p><p>The Minister referred in his opening remarks to the time allowed before a car is unclamped.  A customer charter will be required.  If my car is clamped I contact the company and I give them my credit card details over the phone and the clampers return to unlock my car.  The customer charter should provide that the clampers must return to release a car within a set period of time after the fine is paid.  I have heard about people who have paid the fine and are left waiting for release for an hour, or an hour and a half if the clampers are busy.  It is a contentious issue, and the nature of the job means that clampers are often in conflict with an individual who may be annoyed at the clamping or the delay.  Members of the public have complained about the manner in which the clamping personnel deal with them.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to private property such as supermarket and hotel car parks, and I would include hospital car parks.  Most hospitals are public institutions, and some leeway needs to be shown with regard to parking in hospital car parks.  There may be extenuating circumstances for a person whose car has exceeded its time limit at a parking space, or a car may have been abandoned in a certain spot because of a medical emergency.</p><p>The Bill provides for an appeals process.  An appeal can be made to the clamping service in the first instance and the NTA will appoint an individual to examine the appeal if the outcome is unsatisfactory.  A person whose car is clamped will be required to pay the fine on the spot but may win the appeal.  The regulations need to include a customer charter.</p><p>I have a query about relocation of clamped vehicles.  I do not have a figure for the number of cars towed away in Dublin on a daily or weekly basis.</p> <p>I know somebody who had a car towed away on a Sunday a few years ago while he was at a GAA match.  It was a Tipperary man, and I am not too sorry for him because of the local rivalry between Kilkenny and Tipperary.  It was three hours later before he got the car back.  </p><p>Private companies should not have the ability to tow away somebody's car.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be the only people involved in towing away cars in that they must give the instruction for the car to be towed.  One can come back to find that one's car is gone.  I do not know who gives notice that one's car has been towed.  It is important that garda&iacute; have an input into the relocation of a car, which can take a long time to have released.</p><p>Outside Dublin the majority of clamping on private property is done by private security operators.  I see it in certain carparks in Kilkenny where a private security company comes in and clamps cars if the owner of that property is deemed to have parked illegally.  It is important, in respect of section 9 of the Bill, that the regulations indicate how much time has to elapse before a clamper can be called in because there have been so-called cowboy operators who know they have people in a catch-22 situation in that if one's car is clamped one cannot move until the fee they ask for is paid and the car released.  It is important that this regulation is introduced and that everything is synchronised in that regard.</p><p>I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill because it is important that we have equality with regard to all clamping operations in the country.  It may not be anything to do with him but the Minister might indicate to the House if Dublin City Council is making money on clamping or if it is costing it money, which was the case in Cork City Council.  I welcome the Bill and hope this regulation will make life a little easier for everybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-07a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100700029#CC00200"><p>I again welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister and I were at a seminar yesterday at which we briefly discussed safety issues, fatigue and so on.  It is interesting that vehicles are now being developed which will recognise fatigue, and it is hoped that will be the next step forward in improving the safety record on roads of which we are all in favour.</p><p>What are we to do about the parked vehicles?  The situation is improving.  Dublin had a notorious reputation for illegal parking.  Professor Michael MacCormack of UCD investigated it and found an illegal parking rate of over 80%, and about an 80% chance that nothing would happen if one did park illegally.  The renowned economist, Colm McCarthy, said that the only solution to it at that stage was that if one found a car illegally parked, one could keep it because there was so little enforcement.  It was a typical McCarthy proposal in that regard.</p><p>I spoke yesterday with one of the controlled carpark operators, where one goes through a barrier to enter, who said he has never used clamping.  The Bill is addressing illegal parking on open access private land such as shopping centres about which Senator O'Neill spoke.  It is a huge problem on the west side of Dublin.  If there are matches in Croke Park the shops cannot do business because the GAA fellows take over the carpark on the morning of the match and nobody can get in to do any shopping.  What are the rights of those people to try to control that?  It is private land.  Some clamping operates on it but they could not possibly do enough to take cars from a full carpark.</p><p>I much prefer what happens in Carlow, Thurles, Aughrim and other venues where local people operate the carparks; in Tullamore it goes to the GAA club.  The GAA should be a better neighbour in regard to parking.  I know there are people in some provincial towns in particular who dread a match because they cannot get in or out of their houses.  They cannot go shopping for the day.  It is great fun and they are great games but something had to be done about that problem.</p><p>Hospital car parking is a problem also.  That is an issue we might have to clear up because as I read the Bill, the provision in respect of a hospital is not statutory while it is statutory in respect of a railway station.  There were private hospitals, but most hospitals are now in the public system.</p> <p>An educational establishment is not statutory, but a railway station is.  In his speech the Minister stated that he wants to have parity of treatment between the different places.  If I may, I will run a fine comb through the Bill to make sure that happens.  </p><p>One appreciates annoyance on the part of people who are clamped.  Some earlier incarnations of the Bill dealt with those people who thought they could park anywhere without penalty.  Approximately 150 vehicles a day are clamped on the streets of Dublin City.  There are 44,000 parking spaces.  The clamping rate is 0.34%.  If somebody sets out to park at lights, on a corner and so on, society has to say that will be dealt with.  The system may have been out of proportion to the problem.  </p><p>I am glad the Minister went for regulation rather than licensing.  It is the correct approach to take.  The NTA will be the operational body.  Regulation does not come cheap.  I hope this will be a case of compliance rather than having yet another regulatory arm.  I understand the Minister stressed in his speech that setting up extra bodies to do these tasks is expensive, as no doubt the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will tell us during his Budget Statement.</p><p>On the maximum fee of &euro;100, I understand Dublin City Council has a maximum fee of &euro;80.  The tow away fee is &euro;160.  Will that be reduced?  Would it be a good idea to reduce it?  Given the cost to society as a whole of somebody's illegal parking on a street in Dublin, it may be correct to let the city manager keep the &euro;160 fine.  Illegal parking is somebody cocking a snook at the rest of society.  A fine of &euro;100 is relatively lenient.</p><p>On transaction costs, there are two appeals procedures for &euro;100.  This offence is not the end of the world.  It is not a human rights case, rather it is a case of someone parking in the wrong place and disrupting the city.  We should tell people to get over it rather than have another field day for lawyers to contest cases at huge costs where the amount at stake to individuals and the Exchequer is &euro;100.  Some measure should be taken to minimise costs.  It has been a feature of Irish society that legal costs are far too high.  It jeopardises the overall competitiveness of the Irish economy.  </p><p>We have to protect private property where it is at risk.  Major car parks where access is restricted do not use clamping as they have enough details on drivers to pursue them elsewhere.  Besides, they can charge people on the way out.  This Bill concerns open access public spaces, some of which are in schools and hospitals.  Illegal parking around such places is something which we should not condone.  It disrupts their work.  </p><p>Page 12 of the Minister's speech refers to the relocation charge of &euro;50.  I understand in Dublin it is substantially more.  We might discuss what to do about that on Committee Stage.  I do not know how much perceived misconduct there was in clamping authorities.  There may have been a lot more perceived misconduct by those who parked illegally in the first instance.  Part of the wider brief of the Minister is to keep cities moving and, no pun intended, to clamp down on people who obstruct the movements of others.  Many motorists are particularly selfish and regard themselves as the centre of the world.  They are deprived of access to their vehicles, but society as a whole has very good reasons for doing so, such as attempting to dissuade people from certain conduct.  </p><p>As with drink driving and improved road safety, society as a whole has moved on a lot.</p> <p>Four or five years ago, people came to Opposition politicians because they were exasperated after being clamped, but there may have been a pretty good reason for the clamping.  If we can put reason back into the process, as the Minister clearly intends to do, I will support the next Stage of the Bill.</p></speech>

Last week, my party leader asked me to lead on the Vehicle Clamping Bill 2014 in the absence of my colleague Senator John Kelly, who is contesting a by-election.  I said I knew nothing about vehicle clamping but I assure the Minister I am learning.  I am thankful the we do not have any vehicle clamping in our area.  I sat down to write a speech but I will not use it because it only regurgitates what the Minister has stated, and there is no need for that.</p><p>There are a few points I would like to refer to.  I welcome the two-tier appeals process.  My daughter visited me in Leinster House some time ago and she parked on Merrion Square.  She parked within the white lines and put up a parking ticket, but when she returned to the car it had been clamped.  She was like a raving lunatic about it.  She told me there was no clear notice of clamping in operation and although it was a new practice, there were no signs, and parking spaces appeared to be marked.  She had to pay to be released.  When she appealed it, she did not win and the appeal went nowhere.  I am glad there will be a second tier of appeals for people such as her to appeal to.</p><p>Proper and prominent signage is essential if clamping is to take place.  I come from a tourist area in Killarney, which has many foreign visitors.  Perhaps the signage could be in different languages for such people.  I know we cannot allow people to park wherever they like and drop their cars anywhere.  Nevertheless, clamping is a harsh punishment in some cases, such as when a person's parking ticket has run out.  A fine should suffice in such circumstances and there should be no need to clamp a car.  Clamping should take place in cases where a fire hydrant or emergency service access is being blocked, for example, or in cases in which a car causes a major obstruction.  Clamping a car because a ticket has expired is too harsh a punishment.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to disabled parking spaces.  I would not care if all four wheels of a vehicle illegally parked in a disabled parking space were clamped; the more wheels clamped in such cases, the better.  If it were possible to clamp the steering wheel, it should be done as well.  It is absolutely despicable behaviour, although I am not referring to the Senator in this case.</p></speech>

It was probably some years ago, as today people are far more aware of the needs of people with a disability and their requirement for dedicated parking spaces to allow them to open car doors and use lifts, for example.  We must remember that disabled people go out at night as well, and they are entitled to go to the cinema or for a drink.  It should be clear that nobody should park in a disabled parking space either during the day or during the night.  I would not care if fines of &euro;1,000 were levied on people who used those spaces illegally.  Anybody parking illegally in such spaces should suffer consequences.</p><p>Perhaps there should be a second type of disabled parking for the elderly.  If an elderly person is taken to a doctor or a hospital, a person may have to assist such people in getting out of the car.  One may link arms with an elderly person and help him or her into a doctor's surgery before seeing that the person is seated comfortably and returning to move the car.  I know several people who have received parking fines in such cases, and perhaps in Dublin one may be clamped in such circumstances of helping an elderly person.</p> <p>Perhaps there could be a system whereby five or ten minutes would be allowed to assist elderly people in such cases, and if a traffic warden came along he or she would be able to see how long the car had been parked.  Maybe a parking disc of a different colour could be used to signify a limited time for parking where the driver is assisting an elderly person.  This may not be the appropriate Bill for such a measure, but we should think along those lines.  In hospitals, elderly people may have to go to an outpatient department that may be some distance from the car park.  In Kerry there was no clamping system, but the hospital staff would put a sticker on the windscreen or elsewhere on the car which could not be easily removed.  That might be another day's work.</p><p>I am not used to the clamping process.  If my car was clamped outside this building and relocated, I would not know where to look.  My first action might be to ring the Garda to notify it of a stolen car.  I would not have a clue what could have happened.  If a car is clamped or towed away, the signage must have clear contact details.  Perhaps it already does, but if it does not, details on the sign should indicate where the driver must go in order to recover a vehicle.  Visitors to the city may not have a clue whom to ring if a car is removed and the sign does not give details.</p><p>When my son lived in Cork, he and his friends used to laugh at the fact that there were people who owned a clamp and would clamp their own cars, park for the day and then return and remove the clamp.  The river was full of clamps that had been thrown into it.</p><p>What happens if a person does not have money to have a clamp removed?  It appears that a person must pay before the clamp is removed, but what happens when a person does not have money or a credit card?  Will such people be able to pay later or in instalments after having the clamp removed?  There should be a charter to assist motorists.  A Senator mentioned a wait of an hour and a half for a clamp to be removed.  There should be a time limit on the removal of clamps from cars.  If the clamp is not removed within an hour, for example, the fine should be waived.</p></speech>

Coincidentally, my car was clamped last week, and the experience was not much craic.  When I came out of the gym on Monday morning my ticket had expired and the car had been clamped, so I had to sit on the kerb, going through the process of paying the fine.  It was not a fun experience, but I will definitely put more money in the meter in future.</p><p>This is a welcome piece of legislation, and I commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the work which has brought this Bill before us.  We all know that clamping has been a major cause for complaint for residents and workers in some of our larger towns and cities for many years.  In some ways the practice is counterproductive, and although there is a place for clamping, it must be enforced in a way that helps address parking issues in a logical and fair way.  In order to free parking spaces and keep roads clear, vehicles are immobilised and a fine is administered for the removal of the clamp.  Clamping only works when the fear of being clamped is a concern; in other words, clamping should only come into effect when a driver is committing an offence by taking a risk.  There is a genuine need for fines and for clampers to operate effectively when people are acting irresponsibly.  As mentioned this afternoon, many people act irresponsibly and knowingly take this risk.</p><p>In order for clampers to operate effectively, they must behave in a manner which creates respect among the public and the idea that their actions are just in administration of these duties.  Many people may cry foul when they are caught doing something they should not be doing and are given a fine as a result, and it is essential that those who are unjustly clamped or fined - no matter how small a group - are given the opportunity to appeal.  Clampers must also operate in a culture that does not encourage clamping for its own sake or for financial gain.  At present, the practice's only merit is in discouraging drivers from parking illegally.  In some cases it may be better not to clamp a car, despite an infringement, in the interests of allowing a free flow of traffic as soon as possible.</p><p>There has been much public confusion about where and when a vehicle can be clamped, and I am thankful this Bill brings clarity in formulating consistent regulation for both public and private property scenarios.  I apologise for missing the Minister's statement.  The previous lack of regulation for private property facilitated much abuse.</p><p>Measures included in this Bill to penalise rogue clampers are essential to creating a driver culture, which I mentioned earlier, with motorists expecting fair but firm treatment.  If a person keeps to the law, it should now be much less likely that he or she falls foul of clampers.  I understand the Minister's comments regarding the operation of clamping at hospitals, but this practice should be considered with great care.  Clamping should not be allowed to impede the use of hospitals by emergency services because a vehicle that should have been removed has been clamped.  Any long-term patient who has a car clamped should be given some recognition; although an infringement cannot be ignored, certain conditions may be recognised as relevant or complicating to a case.</p><p>As has been mentioned, I welcome the two-stage appeal system, which will allow for an independent appeal after the fact.  I welcome the Bill, as it will improve clamping practice as well as the public perception of the industry.</p></speech>

Very often we can be the forgotten House, so it is great to see the Bill commencing here.  It is honouring another commitment in the programme for Government, which was also in the Fine Gael manifesto prior to the last general election.  That is to be welcomed.  The Bill comes from a lengthy period of consultation with stakeholders, which I also welcome.</p><p>I am pleased to support the Bill on the basis that it regulates clamping activities wherever they take place.  As we know, clamping is a particularly emotive issue, and in my city of Galway, the local authority dispensed with this method of parking supervision six or seven years ago because of the annoyance that it caused.  It was a most unpopular practice, and regulation in this area is long overdue.  We can all give many examples of motorists encountering unfairness, arrogance and intransigence at the hands of clampers.  It seems that no explanation for overstaying parking time, no matter how genuine, ever seems to be accepted.  Many motorists have fallen foul of clampers by not knowing that clamping is in operation in a particular area, so I welcome that the persons responsible for enforcing parking restrictions - referred to in the Bill as parking controllers - will now be obliged to provide signage that is prominently displayed, indicating that clamping is in operation, along with the costs associated with those activities.</p><p>I support very strongly Senator Moloney's comments about signage, particularly the posting of details of where a vehicle will be held if it is towed away and how to contact the clamping company in order to have the vehicle returned.  I welcome the setting of a maximum clamp release charge, as such charges seem to vary greatly throughout the country.  This has been a source of much complaint from the general public.  One of the strengths of the Bill is the two-tier appeals system.  In the past, motorists' experiences of appealing to the clamping companies have seldom resulted in a satisfactory outcome for the appellant.  A system of appeal to an independent clamping appeals officer designated by the National Transport Authority seems fair and appropriate.</p><p>The clamping of vehicles in hospital car parks, which has already been mentioned, is particularly contentious.</p> <p>In University Hospital Galway, one of the major complaints of those attending the hospital, whether as visitors or patients, is the lack of adequate parking facilities.</p></speech>

I have no problem with them being clamped if they are likely to cause difficulty for ambulance access or an emergency.  It is incumbent on the hospital authorities to ensure adequate parking facilities are available.  In its 2012 report on alternatives to clamping, the joint committee recommended that self-enforcing barrier control car parks should be used as an alternative to clamping particularly in sensitive locations, such as hospitals.  The Bill, as drafted, does not provide for that exemption.  According to the Minister, it took the view that even though hospitals are sensitive places the fact that some people park recklessly in hospital car parks sometimes impeding access, the NTA is allowed to treat hospitals differently from other public areas but it does not believe an outright ban on clamping in hospitals is appropriate.</p><p>In general the Bill is welcome.  On the issue of parking in disabled spaces, I strongly object to such parking.  In my own town of Ballinasloe, a small town which has a significant number of parking paces allocated for disabled persons, I regularly see able bodied people parking in those spaces.  That is wrong.  Any penalty, no matter how high, imposed on those who park in disabled persons' spaces is acceptable to me. </p><p>I compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill to the House, the main thrust of which I support.  </p></speech>

He must be contorted with embarrassment to be here, having campaigned for its abolition.</p><p>I welcome the Bill, one I called for five or six years ago in this House.  I am glad the Government has caught up with the situation.  To take up a point raised by Senator Michael Mullins, I was in St. Vincent's Hospital yesterday for a meeting with consultants about blood tests and so on.  There is a five-storey car park there but not a single space was available and I parked in front of a ventilation unit.  Somebody who was coming out said I was very courageous to park there and would be clamped.  I said, if I am, I will be unclamped pretty bloody quickly.  This whole area has become troubled since the abandonment by the city authority in Dublin, and probably in other cities as well, of its own clamping service, the little brownies.  They were accepted by people.  They were flexible.  Now we have a situation where it is franchised out and the profits go to London.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  I would like to see the re-installation of a clamping service with our own traffic wardens paid by us and the profits coming back to us instead of travelling over to England.  It is the same with the bins.  They made ducks and drakes out of bins with a Neapolitan Mafia style burning out of others' bin lorries and so on.  They are on the streets every single bloody day after 1.30 a.m.  That is privatisation.  Of course, this is a Fine Gael Minister and so, I suppose, we cannot resist the onward rush of Gadarene capitalism.  </p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is addressing this issue.  The idea of harmonisation with so many different entities involved will be a substantially difficult one.  The setting of maximum permissible clamp release charges on private lands is excellent but it does go against something the Minister said when he mentioned the difficulty of introducing a statutory licensing regime because it is excessive and too costly to implement.  He is setting a maximum and that is good but he is partially involved in intervening there.  He said it ended up subsidising an economically unsustainable licensing regime and so on and increasing such charges to offset licensing fees imposed by the State.  The private clampers increase their charges.  If the Minister is setting a maximum charge they cannot go above the maximum, at least that is as I understand it.  </p><p>The Minister said something very interesting about disabled people, namely that they can park where they like.  I think that is daft.  I quote from the Minister's speech where he said: &quot;A vehicle displaying a disabled parking permit will be exempted from being clamped in any place where clamping is specifically legislated for under an enactment.&quot;  The disabled have a free bill to park anywhere and nobody will do anything about it.  I do not agree with that and I have fought for the disabled all my political life.</p><p>I do not apologise but I think it important to put this on the record.  About five years ago I suffered at the hands of the private clampers on a Sunday.  I attended Christ Church Cathedral because it had music by Haydn whereas St. Patrick's had some awful modern squawker, who was not even dead, providing the music.  I parked on a derelict site where there was no visible evidence that one would be charged.  Eventually when I came back and found that I had been clamped I was hysterical because I had people for lunch and I was up against the clock.  When the clampers came out, they pointed out that there was a notice which had been covered up by ivy.  This was a derelict site and they wanted &euro;175 which I eventually scraped up.  I certainly complained.  It had an independent complaints committee, I suppose somebody with a cup of coffee in a back room somewhere off Francis Street.  I argued the toss and I got half back.  That is completely wrong.  </p><p>There is also the relocation by time.  We have had that in North Great George's Street where cars whisked off Gardiner Street have been dumped in our private residential street.  I do not agree with that.  Where will they dump the cars they relocate?  Why should people have the right to clamp or to tow on private lands?  If it is a question of an aggressive invasion it can be done under the laws of trespass.  I see no reason to clamp.  If one drives into a forest area in the country and parks one's car, one does not expect to come back and find it clamped by some landlord.  I am being very parochial.  North Great George's Street held the award, the accolade as the most clamped street in Dublin-----</p></speech>

It may vary between that and Parnell Street but I doubt very much that what Senator Paschal Mooney says is accurate because there is no parking on Parnell Street.  I have seen some people speak to the Garda there.  North Great George's Street is clamped all the time because it is on the direct rat run for the clamping vehicles back to their depot.  I have seen country cars clamped there at 11.55 p.m. on a Saturday, five minutes to midnight, during the Christmas shopping rush.  That is the kind of thing that creates antagonism to clamping.  When clamping was first introduced I was all in support of it and used to sing "clamp, clamp, clamp, the boys are marching...".</p></speech>

I will begin by emphasising briefly some of the main points in the Bill and will then respond to some of the points made by Senators.  </p><p>The first key part of the Bill that will improve the current situation is its focus on the activity of clamping.  Second, the Bill includes broad terms of reference for the lands on which clamping will be regulated.  I will come back to a particular question that Senator David Norris asked in that regard.  The third point which is very important concerns the appeals process laid down.  It is a two tier appeals process.  Capping will be provided for in place of the charges people may face unless the National Transport Authority, NTA, decides to issue its own regulations on the level of charges.</p><p>There are four features of the Bill that will greatly improve the current situation.  This was recognised by all Senators in the contributions they made.  I will now address some of the questions put to me by Senators in the course of their contributions.  </p><p>To begin with Senator Paschal Mooney, I agree with the point he made in the early part of his contribution where he noted that the issue of signage was crucial.  This is a key point.  If people do not know that they are parking in an area in which their vehicle might be clamped and do not understand the time limits within which they can park and the conditions imposed on them, much of what is within the Bill will not be as effective as it needs to be.  It is important that signage be clear and that people, when parking, understand what will happen if they park at a time or in a space that they are not meant to.  </p><p>The Senator expressed disappointment that the Bill did not play a guiding role on parking policy.  Other Senators also touched on this point.  The reason is that the Bill covers a variety of landowners.  Public land falls mainly within the remit of local authorities, unless it is owned by some of the agencies referred to in the Bill, for example, CIE or the Railway Procurement Agency.  These bodies will determine parking policy on their lands.  Private land is also included.  Senator Sean D. Barrett summed up very well the private land to which we were referring - open private land, land in private ownership which most of the time is accessible to the public.  The person who owns the land - whether they are an apartment complex owner or a shopping centre owner - has rights that we have to recognise in the Bill.  That is why it does not set out to form parking policy, because of the variety of owners and pieces of land the Bill covers and the need to respect the rights of these owners when putting together clamping legislation.  </p><p>I come to the third point made by Senator Paschal Mooney which was also touched on by Senator Pat O'Neill concerning what would happen when the NTA played its role under the legislation, for example, where it set a code of practice or a proposed charge for the clamping or towing away of a vehicle.  The Senator queried what role the public or Members of the Oireachtas would play in this regard.  There will be periods of public consultation prior to the introduction of the proposed charge and code of practice.  During these periods there will be an opportunity for the Oireachtas or a committee of the Oireachtas to have its input.  I hope that will happen, given their roles in the drafting of this legislation.</p><p>On the question Senator Pat O'Neill put regarding the length of time involved, I understand he is referring to a situation where a person pays for parking in a particular area and the parking period comes to an end.  He queries if there will be a grace period.  That is exactly the kind of issue that demonstrates why there is a need for a code of practice to be developed and issued by the NTA.  For example, Dublin City Council has a particular view of grace periods after parking periods come to an end.  It would be helpful if it was consistent and broadly understood.  I would like to see the NTA play a role in that regard by developing and issuing an industry code of practice.  </p><p>Regarding a notice of towing, Senator Pat O'Neill asks what is to happen after a clamping company has removed a vehicle.  The company is required to notify the Garda.  On the Senator's particular question as to what will happen to a driver when he or she returns and finds that his or her car is gone, this is the kind of issue in which I hope the NTA will play a role.  I hope it will lay out a consistent code of practice across the country and make clear the responsibilities of private companies that remove such a vehicle.  </p><p>The point on which Senator Sean D. Barrett concluded his contribution is one that guides the Bill.  He spoke about the need to balance the competing interests of someone who owned a car and broader society in ensuring public access is not reduced and the rights of private property owners.  These are balanced with the responsibilities private clamping operators should discharge.  That, in essence, is what the Bill seeks to address.  It aims to be proportionate in recognising the size of the industry.  Senator David Norris touched on this point.  It is estimated that there are six to eight companies involved in most of the clamping which takes place on private land.  That is why the issue of active registration was not pursued.  Given the number of companies involved in clamping, the same objective could be achieved by focusing on clamping.  By focusing on it, it was possible to address some of the public's concerns, which have been referred to by Senators and of which I am aware.</p><p>On the point about illegal parking in the past, I had an opportunity to look at the summary of the Oireachtas committee's report compiled after its hearings.  One of the early contributions was made by business associations which pointed out how difficult it used to be to find parking because of the level of illegal parking.  One of the contributors to the process offered Merrion Square as an example.  That is why there are such restrictions on where a person can park.  We need to ensure private clamping operators are monitoring in a way that is lawful and regulated.  The Bill seeks to do this.  </p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett put a particular question to me on whether costs should come down.  The Senator compared current costs to the default costs to come into operation should the NTA not play its role under the Bill.  That is the answer to the Senator's question.  If the NTA does not put in place a different set of charges, the default charges included in the Bill will come into operation.  Clearly, power is being afforded to the NTA to play this role and the matter will be subject to a period of public consultation.  The NTA will then put in place the charges it believes are appropriate.  </p><p>Senator Marie Moloney touched on the signage issue, on which Senator Paschal Mooney also made a point.  I agree with Senator Marie Moloney who also pointed to the importance of the appeals procedure.  I went through the appeals procedure, on which other Senators touched.</p> <p>There is a need for that to be properly understood and fairly implemented.  We are also looking to strike a balance, so that when private companies put the appeals process in place and do it well, this is recognised by the Bill, but in those cases where applicants do not feel they have been treated fairly, the National Transport Authority will be able to play a role.</p><p>Senator O'Neill asked a question about where cars go when they are towed.  This is an area that the National Transport Authority could look at in relation to the powers that it will then have, but I should emphasise that under current practice the Garda is required to be notified.  Senator Reilly, who broadly supported the Bill, emphasised the need for consistent regulation across the country, with which I would agree.  She also pointed out that powers for carrying out clamping or fining exist in order to prevent the free flow of traffic from being interrupted, and that when people are parking their cars they need to know that if they do not park legally, or if they stay for longer than they should, they will face sanction.  I believe that at the first stage the sanction should always be a fine rather than a clamp. The question of where that clamp is going to be used is the reason we need better regulation, and that is where this Bill comes in.  </p><p>Senator Mullins supported the Bill and made the point that it was overdue, as was also stated by other Senators during the contribution.  He acknowledged the fact that the two-tier process could play a helpful role for appeals in terms of allaying the concerns that many people have.  He also raised a point in relation to the maximum release charge.  I touched on that with Senator Barrett but would like to emphasise again that the Bill puts in place default charges that could be superseded by the National Transport Authority were it to decide to issue a new charge, which would then be subject to public consultation, as I said when dealing with Senator Mooney's question.</p><p>Senator Norris referred to the rush of capitalism to my head. I should point out that we are bringing in a Bill that seeks to regulate those very forces of capitalism in a way that recognises all of the legitimate concerns that people have raised over many years with the aim of making regulation possible.  Senator Norris asked why this was not being done by local authorities across the country.  One of the interesting points that emerged for me while I was getting ready for this debate, which was picked up on by Senator O'Neill, was the fact that the only local authority that still engages directly in clamping is Dublin City Council.  It is interesting to see that the majority of clamping that takes place in the country takes place on private property, as Senator O'Neill pointed out.  That is why we need an approach such as this.  Most of that clamping takes place in open private spaces, as Senator Barrett mentioned, such as outside office areas and shopping centres, apartment complexes----</p></speech>

It is a fair question to ask.  In relation to his point on who the ultimate party would be, he is correct that it would be a local authority that was hiring somebody to do the work.  Under this Bill, it would then be subject to the regulation that this Bill allows, but ultimately to the National Transport Authority.  A useful analogy would be the role that the National Transport Authority currently plays in the regulation of the taxi industry.  While people may have different views regarding whether it is done well, it is the National Transport Authority that now plays the ultimate role, and under this Bill it would have the ability to play a similar role in relation to clamping and private clamping operatives.  With regard to Senator Norris's point about a derelict site and the signage being covered up, I am glad to hear he still had the opportunity to get home and cook lunch for his guests, and I hope the quality of that lunch was not reduced - I am sure it was not - by the----</p></speech>

His point in relation to signage is important and I do not want to take away from that.  The fact that signage needs to be clear and well understood was touched on by many Senators earlier, but of course the issue of open private land, which Senator Barrett touched on, is of particular significance.  Local authorities, as we are all aware, have lots of different things that they are trying to do well at the moment; they have many competing demands.  The local authorities do have expertise built up in terms of how to publicly communicate what they are asking people to do in land that they own through signage and so on.  We need to ensure that people who are operating open private land are clear about what their responsibilities are. Senator Norris questioned what this open private land could be - could it be a forest?  The answer, as Senator Barrett has said, is that it is mainly shopping centres, apartment complexes and other privately owned land.</p></speech>

I will come back to him in relation to that point and I apologise for not referring to it directly.  The reason disabled drivers are given specific recognition within the Bill is to ensure that the issue is treated consistently across the country and in relation to different pieces of land.  I know from my own constituency work that when people cannot access a space that has been granted to them - we are all familiar with the yellow-demarcated land - it can cause great stress and inconvenience.  The reason there is recognition of this issue in the Bill is to make sure treatment is fair and consistent across public and private land.  It is a fair question, and as the Bill goes to Committee and Report Stages I will clarify the issue further, if it has not already been done within the Bill.</p><p>I thank all the Senators for their points.  I think I have covered them all, but if I have not, there will be an opportunity for further discussion on Committee Stage.  I would like to emphasise that it is not the objective of this Bill to guide parking policy, due to the point to which I referred earlier on.  The Bill covers both public and private land, and the rights and responsibilities that the owners of public and private land would have.  That is the balance it seeks to strike, and in so doing it looks to be proportionate and to address many issues that people have had regarding an appeals process, signage, and the inconsistency of fines.  These are issues that have been raised by all Senators.  I look forward to engaging further with the Senators as the Bill goes through the Seanad.  I thank Members for taking the time to read the Bill and put forward informed contributions about how we can improve it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-07a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100700036#LL00700"><p>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to initiate the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill in this House, of which I am a former Member.  It is a very significant and timely piece of legislation.  The Bill has two main objectives.  First, to amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences)(Amendment) Act 2005 in order to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2008/919/JHA which amended Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism.  The framework decision is covered by the Lisbon treaty and as such must be transposed into Irish law by 1 December next.  Second, the Bill will allow Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism in due course.</p><p>The Bill creates three new offences in relation to terrorist activity which are covered by the amending framework decision and also the Council of Europe convention to which Ireland is already a signatory.  The three new offences are: public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism; and training for terrorism.  This Bill shows the Government's commitment to combat terrorism, in all its guises.  The scourge of terrorism is unfortunately more evident in the world than ever and I am sure that Senators will appreciate the importance of tackling it at source so as to be able to deal, when necessary, with incitement, recruitment and training for terrorist activities.  The legislation will also enable Ireland to further fulfil our international commitments in the area of counter-terrorism and to stand united with our European colleagues, and indeed democratic nations across the globe, in combating terrorist crimes and protecting innocent citizens everywhere.  Those who would threaten the lives of ordinary people by engaging in acts of terrorism, whether on this island or elsewhere, must be brought to justice and know that the international community will not tolerate their activity and will take all possible action to prevent and punish it.</p><p>This legislation is being introduced at a time when international terrorism is, unfortunately, very much to the fore.  It builds on an existing body of Irish legislation that is aimed at combating terrorist activity and ensures that there are no gaps in our laws by dealing with the more subtle and indirect aspects of modern terrorism.  Existing legislation, such as the Offences against the State Acts and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, the latter which this Bill updates, contain offence provisions which cover a broad range of terrorist and terrorist-related activities.  The 2005 Act incriminates terrorist offences as a separate category of crime and contains lists of offences which, with the requisite intent, would constitute terrorist offences.  Penalties for such offences are severe and, if sufficiently serious, include life imprisonment.</p><p>Terrorism is a constant threat to the fundamental values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.  There is considerable concern across Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the consequential threat posed to national security. The compilation of accurate statistics in relation to the numbers of actual foreign fighters is problematic due to the secretive nature of those travelling and the many and circuitous routes some individuals take in reaching their destination of choice.  There has been widespread reporting on this matter in the media, both in Ireland and abroad.  An American television news network has, for instance, stated that Ireland has one of the highest per capita numbers of foreign fighters in the world at 30, from a Muslim population of around 50,000.  These reports are not entirely accurate.  It should be pointed out that the collation of these numbers began in or around the time of the onset of the Arab Spring and within that number are individuals who travelled to Libya and other Arab states to take part in the popular uprisings there.  Within that number are some who travelled for humanitarian reasons.  In addition, some of these are known to have returned and there have been three known fatalities among that number.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to say that 30 Irish citizens are aligned with IS or other groups similar in nature, such as al-Qaeda.</p><p>The phenomenon of individuals travelling from all over Europe to the fighting has affected the majority of European states and is one to which Ireland gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  In fact, this discussion on foreign fighters will feature again this week at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg and indeed as a priority topic at any international gatherings of justice Ministers at present.  Ireland was successful during the Presidency in gaining the agreement of the member states to carry out a review of the EU strategy for countering radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review was the foreign fighter issue and a number of initiatives at EU level have been developed to combat this phenomenon, including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of movements, engagement with third countries - notably Turkey - and engagement with Internet service providers to curb radical online content.</p><p>It is widely accepted that this problem cannot be resolved by security-related measures alone and that a key element in addressing it is a programme of pro-active engagement with the communities most affected.  Meaningful engagement with communities is an essential part of this process in order to avoid any sense of profiling or the stigmatising of sectors of the population.  The protection of fundamental rights and recognition from the outset that the majority of people wish to go about their daily lives in peace, and to play a productive part in society, is enshrined within that engagement.</p> <p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through its racial, intercultural and diversity office, operates a policy of continuous engagement with communities deemed at risk.</p><p>While the threat level to Ireland from international terrorism is considered low, we must remain vigilant, especially where the possibility of lone-wolf type actions witnessed elsewhere in Europe are concerned.  The random and unpredictable nature of such attacks makes them a particular matter for concern.  It is very important, therefore, that we have all the relevant tools at our disposal to deal with terrorist threats, in all their forms and at all stages, including incitement and other preparatory activities.  By criminalising the terrorist-linked activities of provocation, recruitment and training, the legislation before the House further strengthens our hand in this regard.</p><p>I will now focus and elaborate on the three main elements of the Bill, namely, the three new offences created under its provisions.  The Bill provides that the offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence will be committed when a person distributes or otherwise makes available - by whatever means of communication - a message to the public with the intention of encouraging, directly or indirectly, the commission of a terrorist activity.  A person convicted of this offence will be liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine - that is, up to &euro;5,000 - or imprisonment for up to one year, or both and on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.</p><p>A person will be guilty of the offence of recruitment for terrorism if he or she recruits or attempts to recruit another person to engage in terrorist activity or other offences contained in section 6 of the Offences against the State Act 1998, section 21 or 21A of the Offences against the State Act 1939 or section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1976.  A person convicted of this offence will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.  The offence of training for terrorism will be committed where a person provides instruction or training in the skills of making or using firearms or explosives, nuclear material, biological, chemical or prohibited weapons or other such weapons or noxious or hazardous substances as the Minister may prescribe in the knowledge that the skills provided are intended to be used for the purpose of terrorist activity.  This offence also covers training in techniques or methods for use in terrorist activity.  A person convicted of this offence will be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.</p><p>The Bill contains 12 sections and two Schedules, which append the aforementioned amending Council framework decision and Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.  Section 1 simply clarifies that references to the principal Act relate to the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, which is being amended here.</p><p>Section 2 is a standard provision allowing for the making of ministerial regulations.  It amends the 2005 Act by inserting a new section 3A into that Act.  The power to make regulations is required, for example, in order that the Minister may, if deemed necessary, introduce regulations adding to the list of weapons and techniques or methods covered by the training offence outlined in section 6.</p><p>Section 3 amends section 4 of the 2005 Act as follows: replacing the definition of &quot;framework decision&quot; in the principal Act with a new definition that includes reference to the 2008 framework decision - for ease of reference, the text of both framework decisions will be appended to the Act; replacing the definition of &quot;terrorist-linked activity&quot; with a new definition that includes the three new offences covered in the Bill; inserting definitions of the &quot;Prevention of Terrorism Convention&quot; and the three new offences; designating section 4 of the Act, as it stands, as subsection (1) of section 4; and adding two new subsections, (2) and (3).  Subsection (2) provides that a terrorist-linked activity may be committed, wholly or partially, by electronic means, such as over the Internet.  This provision is being specifically included following consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and reflects the use, or perhaps more accurately, misuse, of modern technology in the context of terrorist activity.  Subsection (3) provides that a terrorist-linked activity may occur even if an offence of terrorist activity under section 6(1)(a) of the principal Act has not actually been committed.  This provision is in line with the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and is necessary in order to ensure that a person can be prosecuted for any of the three new offences where no terrorist activity actually took place on foot of provocation, recruitment or training.</p><p>Section 4 creates the new offence of &quot;public provocation to commit a terrorist offence&quot; which I described in my introduction to the Bill.  Section 5 provides for the new offence of &quot;recruitment for terrorism&quot;, which I also outlined earlier.</p><p>Section 6 creates the new offence of &quot;training for terrorism&quot;, to which I also referred earlier.  This section provides for the making of ministerial regulations, if considered necessary, to add to the list of weapons or substances already prescribed in the section and also to cover other possible techniques or methods that could be used for the purpose of committing a terrorist activity.  Before making such regulations the Minister will be obliged to consult with the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister for Defence and such other Minister of the Government as he or she considers appropriate, having regard to the weapons, substances, techniques or methods concerned.  The section also sets out the issues to which the Minister must have regard to when making the regulations.  Furthermore, it clarifies the meanings of certain terms used in the section.</p><p>Section 7 amends section 6(1)(a)(ii) of the principal Act to provide that it is an offence to attempt to commit the offences of recruitment and training but not that of public provocation.  This is in line with the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and reflects the fact that the offence of public provocation, as defined - or elements of - is more conceptually difficult to attempt.  In addition, the notion of intent is already covered in the public provocation offence as framed.</p><p>Section 8 sets out the fines and penalties the three new offences will attract and amends section 7(1) of the principal Act to include a new paragraph (e) to provide for this.  The penalty for the public provocation offence on summary conviction will be a class A fine or up to 12 months in prison, or both.</p><p>Section 9 relates to evidence of Irish citizenship in the context of legal proceedings relating to an offence and amends section 44(2) of the principal Act by providing that it will be an officer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, rather than an officer of that Department, who will certify that a passport was issued and that it will be an officer of the Minister for Justice and Equality who will certify that the person has not ceased to be an Irish citizen.  This is a relatively minor, technical amendment which properly reflects the administrative and functional roles of the two Departments concerned in respect of citizenship.</p><p>Section 10 inserts the amending framework decision on combating terrorism and the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism into the principal Act.</p><p>Section 11 amends Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the principal Act.  The latter lists the offences for the purpose of the definition of terrorist activity.  Paragraph (a) provides for the insertion of a new paragraph 7A to add any offence under section 2 of the Maritime Security Act 2004 to the list of terrorist activity.  These offences relate to ships and fixed platforms.  The amendment at paragraph (b) adds offences under section 2 of the Biological Weapons Act 2011 which relate to the development or use of biological weapons for a hostile purpose.  The amendment at paragraph (c) adds the offence of financing of terrorism under section 13 of the principal Act.  This latter amendment is required to meet the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism requirement that offences under the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which has been ratified by Ireland, are included in the definition of &quot;terrorist activity&quot;.  Section 12 is a standard provision.</p><p>I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Those of us on this side of the House will be wholeheartedly supporting the legislation, which is primarily designed to prevent Irish citizens from returning from foreign conflicts and sheltering here.  The Bill is based on the EU Council framework decision agreed in 2008 when the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was in power.  We are calling on the current Government to be vigilant with regard to the possible return of combatants claiming Irish citizenship from the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq and to ensure that these individuals are suitable for reintegration into Irish society.  This must be done in order to prevent a radicalisation of citizens here.</p> <p>It is ironic that on several occasions I have called for a debate on the basic protection of, and respect for, the human dignity of Christians in places like Syria and Iraq.  Apparently, in such places, to be a Christian, or any other religion than that of the jihadists&rsquo; extremist view of their own religion, is a crime.  If one does not have their tunnel-vision approach, one is likely to be exterminated.  We have seen the appalling beheadings of US, French and English citizens, some of them voluntary aid workers in the region.  ISIL is a radical extreme group and whatever needs to be done internationally to stop this uprising must be done.<br/>In some ways, the Bill probably does not go far enough.  There should be a united approach to this in Europe.  The difficulty is that with a European passport one could have these combatants leaving, say, France or Holland, but coming back to hide away in the Wicklow Mountains or on a remote island off the coast.  A <i>prima facie</i>case can be made that anyone travelling to the conflict zones in Syria or Iraq these times is involved in supporting terrorism.  Who would travel there now, unless they are providing aid to victims and those made homeless there?  Those who took part in ISIL should be excluded from entry into this country.  I hope all other European countries will be as vigilant.  The Minister referred to the numbers of Irish foreign fighters being 30 but this is irrelevant.  The point of principle is that in this country their religion, as well as other religions be they Jewish, Protestant or Catholic, is protected and they are free to practise it under the Constitution but then they see fit to travel abroad to execute Christians and members of other religions.  That is a flagrant breach of that principle.<br/>Fianna F&aacute;il will support this legislation.  I hope it is not misinterpreted that this is for some other reason.  The reasons are crystal clear and I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</p></speech>

It is always a good day for the Seanad when a Minister deems it fit and appropriate to do so.  I encourage other Ministers to avail of that opportunity as D&aacute;il time can be stretched and vying for slots for it can be competitive.  We are always happy to initiate legislation here, particularly in the justice area.</p><p>This Bill gives effect to an important component of the Lisbon treaty which we all worked hard in a difficult campaign to get over the line.  I welcome Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s constructive comments on the Bill.  The House is united in countering terrorism and eliminating the threat it poses.  If the need for this was more cogently evident, it is what is going on around the world now.  We see the degrading beheading of aid workers who went to conflict zones wearing their hearts on their sleeves and with no agenda but to help people.  This is something ordinary citizens cannot comprehend.</p><p>As a society, we have a responsibility to our citizens to ensure we equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Army to deal with these types of scenarios.  Unfortunately, the world is increasingly becoming a very dangerous place.  Terrorism knows no boundaries and certainly does not respect them.  While this country is reasonably terrorism-free, it does not mean it will continue.  We had a troubled history up until a decade ago when incredible acts of terrorism were committed by Irish people against Irish people.  Thankfully, that is resolving itself.</p><p>The world is becoming a global village.  Recruitment of citizens and young people to foreign terrorist groups can occur through Facebook and the Internet.  This did not exist 20 years ago and precautions now need to be taken to prevent it.  At least, an offence will be created for recruiting for terrorism, even if it is just an attempt.  The measures proposed in this legislation are timely and important.  I agree, however, with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s sentiment that it might not go far enough.  When the Minister, her advisers and officials feel it is appropriate to firm up and amend terrorism legislation, this House will be very open to initiating any further measures required to do so.  Every Member has zero tolerance of terrorism or the conditions that will create an environment that will allow it flourish, even to a tiny degree.  While we always have to be cautious, if it is necessary to make such legislation more punitive, then we would open to doing so.  I look forward to the speedy passage of this Bill through the House and I sincerely hope it will get the unanimous backing of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The Leader will raise this matter with the Minister&rsquo;s office and I would be happy if she could look into it.</p><p>Senator Conway often tells the House about Shannon Airport.  Last week, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions visited the airport on foot of a petition made by Shannonwatch regarding US army planes that land there.  We were given an interesting tour of the whole facility and met with garda&iacute; there.  There will be deliberations about the discussions we had there.</p><p>Sometimes in Ireland we think we are terrorism-free and international terrorism will not land on our shores.  The visit brought home to us how vulnerable places like our airports are to the threat of terrorist attack.  People have made the point that several civilians have made their way on to runways at some of our airports in the past.  If a civilian can do that, could an international terrorist with a mind to do damage do so too?  We put this to the garda&iacute; at Shannon who reassured us they do the best they can.  They did feel, however, that in some areas there is a lacuna in legislation and their powers are limited.  I am sure the committee will come back to the Minister on how garda&iacute; feel they cannot go on to some airplanes, not just US ones, and search them.</p><p>This Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 by creating three new offences to give effect to two Council framework decisions from 2008, namely, the public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  While Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports this Bill, it contains several points about which we are concerned and on which we will seek clarification and reassurance from the Minister.</p> <p>Why has it taken the Irish Government so long to transpose this piece of legislation?  It seems highly unusual that the transposition of something like this could take such a long time and perhaps that could be clarified.  My party's main concern with this Bill concerns the definition of terrorism as it is formulated in the Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA.  It is a very broad definition that could include virtually every act that has some element of organisation or planning.  This seems unworkable to us and is something about which we would be quite concerned.  By reiterating the framework decision definition, the Bill legitimately raises the question as to whether this instrument has a built-in function creep in order not only to combat terrorism but to extend the definition in such a manner as to cover most public order situations and more common criminal acts as they apply under national law.  </p><p>I also want to speak briefly about the fact that while there is a definite need for cross-border co-operation in this area, even international co-operation, criminal sanctions and definitions should be the sole realm of the member state.  We do not want to hand over this type of power to Europe.  Such issues should be for member states alone to deal with.  We do not want to see a situation where the EU becomes involved in this area.  Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see greater checks and balances in the Bill to protect against this.  </p><p>Finally, I wish to briefly mention another concern we have, namely, data protection.  Any data collected under this legislation should have to comply with standards in the Twenty-six Counties and not those of any other member state.  We do not want to see a situation where data being shared in good faith leaves the hands of another member state when it is no longer under the standard under which it left Ireland.  We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area.  The clearest example of this in recent years came when Frank McBrearty tried to enter the US with his family and was refused by the US authorities.  Mr. McBrearty was refused entry on the grounds that he had a conviction for assault.  This was despite the fact that the conviction had been overturned and he was found to be innocent of the charges levelled against him.  This raises very serious concerns about how data on individuals is retained in this country and then exchanged with agencies from other jurisdictions.  This is something we will seek to strengthen on Committee Stage.  In the broad sense, we support this Bill.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-07a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100700039#OO00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and express my support for the legislation in keeping with others.  We have all noted that its purpose is to transpose into Irish law a Council framework decision from 2008 which amends the 2002 Council framework decision on combating terrorism.  I note that the decision must be transposed by 1 December so we are not out of time on it, although I note Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's words about delay.  However, this is often a feature of transposing directives and we are better off doing it more carefully.</p><p>The debate so far has focused on the issue of international terrorism.  The Minister pointed out that this is a time when international terrorism is, unfortunately, very much to the fore.  However, we should all be mindful in debating this that we still have a great deal of issues on our own island.  I noted that the last debate we had in this House on similar legislation was in June 2014 on the renewal of the provisions of the Offences against the State Act.  At that point, I noted that there were 30 terrorist-related attacks in Northern Ireland in 2013 and that even by June of this year, five were recorded.  I know that there have more since.  One must bear that in mind as well.  While the focus is currently on the phenomenon of international terrorism, particularly on recruitment in Europe for international terrorism, we should be alive to the threat of terrorism here as well.  </p><p>However, the particular threat posed by organisations like ISIS or the so-called Islamic State is extremely serious.  There is no doubt about this.  Anyone who is watching the current attack on Kobane and the Kurdish fighters' resistance there, and who has been aware of the barbaric treatment of civilians and the persecution of people of other religions and women by this organisation, can see that this is a particularly heinous threat that is spilling over the Turkish border from Syria and also in Iraq.  There are real questions to be asked about how this organisation has spread so quickly and has made so many military gains so quickly.  There are huge questions about who is funding it and supplying it with the heavy artillery we are seeing.  We see how the Kurdish fighters are hopelessly under-equipped by comparison with ISIS.</p><p>There is also the issue of recruits from Europe.  There are a good many reports about recruits from European countries going to fight with ISIS in their thousands.  I am glad that, as the Minister pointed out, the figure of 30 from Ireland is inappropriate and has been inaccurately reported.  The Minister has pointed out that it would not be appropriate to say that 30 Irish citizens are aligned with ISIS or other groups.  We should be conscious that many people travel to Syria or Iraq because they have family there.  They may wish to help or engage in humanitarian efforts there so I think people are jumping to certain conclusions.  It is important that we make that point.  </p><p>I am also glad that the Minister has acknowledged that the problem of international terrorism and foreign fighters being recruited from European countries cannot be solved through security-related measures alone and that this legislation introducing as it does three new offences is clearly not the main strand of preventing the recruitment of foreign fighters for terrorist activities abroad.  Certainly proactive engagement with communities is essential.  I know this has been recognised in the UK as well and is seen as the best way to counter the threat of recruitment and radicalisation of different communities.  The Minister has rightly pointed out the work of the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office.  It is important that this work be supported.  </p><p>The three offences referred to by the Minister - those of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism - really build on existing legislation from the 2005 Act.  The Minister has given very clear interpretations of those.  The definitions are derived largely from the EU legislation.  The definition of terrorist-linked activity is very broad.  I am glad that it is confined to acts that would constitute an offence in the State.  I think this is important.  It is like the provision around the European arrest warrant or extradition.  There would be an existing criminalisation.  </p><p>I have often been critical in this House where I thought legislation to deal with terrorism went too far on a procedural basis to change the normal criminal justice procedures and, for example, to provide for enhanced powers for the Special Criminal Court.  I know this legislation does not do that.  It is creating three substantive new offences so it is not of that nature.  I have always welcomed the opportunity to review the provisions of the Offences against the State Act.  It has been very useful to us over the years to look at how many times different provisions have been used.  We all hope very much that the three new offences here will not be used and that we will not need to use them but certainly it might be useful in a year's time to have some report laid before the Houses as to the number of times they have been used.  It would be useful if we could find out whether people had even been arrested under them.  That is part of the parliamentary scrutiny of provisions like this that are terrorist-related.  I know it has been a really important exercise with the Offences against the State legislation. </p></speech>

I thank Senators O'Donovan, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Bacik and Conway for their contributions and their broad support for the Bill.  As we pass this legislation, we can stand resolutely alongside our colleagues in other EU member states in combating the threat of terrorism, which has evolved with the use of modern technology and, as the Bill outlines, the kind of preparatory activity such as incitement, recruitment and training.  It is really important that these are named very clearly and also if they are used through social media.  This is quite advanced legislation.  Perhaps it is one of the advantages of coming a little late to this even though, as Senator Bacik noted, we are still within the timeframe.  It is important that we have been able to include that in the legislation.  The Bill supports ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.  That treaty can be implemented not just by EU member states but across all countries across continental Europe.</p><p>It is a global phenomenon and we have had a number of resolutions from the UN in recent times relating to terrorism and the sort of activities that it would like to see members states tackling that are worth mentioning.  For example, there was a resolution very recently relating to foreign fighters.  That put much emphasis on criminalising the recruitment of people and the prosecution of recruitment and training so we have a re-emphasis at UN level on the issues we are dealing with in this legislation.  It is very important that the Bill makes an offence to engage in public provocation or recruitment or training for terrorism.</p> <p> I wish to make a few other points.  The UN resolution highlights the importance of international border security, including combating the use of fraudulent travel documents and enhanced passenger screening at airports.  We are taking these matters seriously and in the context of the common travel area we must examine this issue.  Yesterday, I signed an agreement with the UK authorities that enhances our co-operation.  It means that we will now use biometric screening as we develop e-gates at Dublin Airport, which will be used more comprehensively towards the end of this year and throughout next year.  That means that biometric data can now be used for passengers arriving here, which will make quite a difference.  It will be part of the Irish visa application process.  The new SSA cutting-edge automated systems are being put in place also.  That will ensure that we are effectively doing what the UN resolution sought in this area with a view to combating terrorism.</p><p>We are committed in this regard and it is good to have cross-party support for the legislation.  I note the points that Senators have made concerning terrorist acts, which unfortunately still continue on this island.  We need to do all we can to ensure that that does not continue and that the law is used appropriately concerning such terrorist offences.</p><p>A purely law-enforcement approach will not deal with this issue, so it is important to work on preventive aspects also.  The best prevention is to stop people getting involved in anti-social, violent or terrorist activity in the first place.</p><p>Dealing with terrorist activities is very different from discouraging or suppressing freedom of speech or the expression of opinions and political ideologies.  In a democratic world, it is vital to protect the right to express views and beliefs, even though they may be outside the mainstream.  Journalists and others are free to express their opinions and voice their commentaries.  Such fundamental human rights should not be compromised, nor does this legislation do so.  It is important to mention the latter point in the course of this debate. </p><p>The Bill ensures, however, that there are no gaps in our laws which could be exploited by unscrupulous people.  We have seen activity in Belgium recently where people died in a terrorist attack; we have also seen it in Madrid and London.  We want to ensure that there is no hiding place in a democratic society for people who would use terrorist activities to threaten the democratic order.  </p><p>This is a timely piece of legislation and I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  Many important and useful points have been made and I look forward to going through the Bill on Committee Stage. </p></speech>

I wish to raise the proposed technological universities legislation and specifically the current timeframe for its enactment, which is a cause of concern for some people.  I should declare a certain interest in that I hold a lecturing post in the Institute of Technology in Blanchardstown, albeit on a part-time basis these days.</p><p>When the Minister's predecessor published the general scheme of the technological universities Bill back in January he announced that suitable legislation should be ready by December this year to allow for the legal merging of institutes of technology, so that they could then seek designation as technical universities.  This forecast appears to be over-optimistic, however, because according to sources in the Department of Education and Skills, following an inquiry by ourselves, the technological universities Bill is now only at drafting stage and is set to be published early next year.  According to the current schedule, the Bill will not be enacted until mid to late 2015 at the earliest, as sources in the Department have indicated in any event.</p><p>This vague estimate is worrying, especially given the nature of the Bill in question, which requires it to be enacted in time for the start of the new academic year in 2015.  Failure to meet this deadline would have significant consequences for each of the three institutes of technology concerned: the Dublin Institute of Technology; the Institute of Technology, Tallaght; and the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown.  In addition, the institutes of technology in Cork, Tralee, Waterford and Carlow would be unable to merge in time for the start of term. </p><p>The aim of the TU4Dublin project, which incorporates ITB, ITT and DIT, is that the institutes in question would legally merge on 1 September 2015.  It is vital that this date be adhered to in order to avoid problems both for students and the institutes.  The absence of such legislation would only serve to foster uncertainty over which college students are admitted to, which programmes they will be enlisted for and, critically, from which college they will receive awards.  </p><p>Students who are expecting to receive a technological university award may not be in a position to do so, which means the Government will be letting them down.  Such tardiness on the Government's part would make students' transition into third-level education even more testing than it already is.  The notion that this pressing legislation might arrive too late is therefore disconcerting.  Such a regrettable situation would similarly be problematic for the colleges, especially from a financial perspective as their would be two sets of end-of-year accounts for each college.  Similar issues would affect the other bidding parties, of course.</p><p>The current state of affairs is that the application made by DIT, ITT and ITB has been presented to an international review panel along with that of Cork IT and Tralee IT.  A decision is due around November on the state of their bids.  Meanwhile, a progress report on these applications for university status came before the Higher Education Authority last week.  Unfortunately, these processes will be of little relevance if the affected institutes are unable to act on a positive appraisal of their bids due to a lack of legislation which would prevent them from merging.  </p><p>Ultimately, any delay could set back the entire project by a year.  This would be unfair on thousands of students who deserve better than to be unduly stressed about the future of their college education because of Government inefficiency, should that situation arise.  These consequences are absolutely avoidable if the Government proves its commitment to meeting targets to reform higher education by ensuring that this Bill is enacted without delay.  A commencement order should be signed by the Minister allowing the legal merging of the Dublin institutes in time for the next academic year.  I would be grateful if she could give the House the necessary assurance in this regard.</p></speech>

I am very much aware of the timeframes outlined by him.</p><p>As the House is aware, the higher education reform programme that was given initial impetus by the national strategy for higher education to 2030 is being rolled out.  The implementation process relating to the evolutionary pathway laid out in the national strategy for institutes of technology is well under way.  The document entitled, Completing the Landscape Process for Irish Higher Education, published by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in February 2012 laid out a clear four stage process and criteria for institutes of technology that wished to apply for designation as a technological university.  This is to ensure a high quality and performance bar is reached by groups of institutes that intend to apply for this new status.  Three consortiums are engaged in the process.  As the Senator outlined, two of them submitted detailed plans for a merger to the HEA in the summer that are being considered by an independent expert panel, while the third consortium is in the process of developing its plan.  I do not propose to comment specifically on any of these proposals.  </p><p>The general scheme of a technological universities Bill was published in January this year and went through pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The Bill sets out the legislative framework for mergers and the establishment of technological universities.  It also provides for modernised governance structures for institutes of technology.  It is being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and I intend to publish it early in 2015 and have it enacted during 2015 in sufficient time to facilitate the first envisaged mergers.  That is the timeframe to which we intend to adhere.</p></speech>

It is great to see her in this role.  This is the first time I have addressed her since she took over at the Department of Education and Skills and I wish her the very best of luck.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that the level of youth suicide in Ireland is the fifth highest in the European Union, with the figure for 15 to 24 year olds standing at 15.7 per 100,000.  Based on this figure, it is imperative that we devise a course on suicide awareness and prevention aimed at post-primary students.  ASIST, Applied Suiscide Intervention Skills Training, offers a two day course aimed at adults to increase suicide awareness and teach the signs to look out for in persons who may be vulnerable.  This is very beneficial, but a short course on suicide awareness and prevention should also be devised specifically for post-primary school students.  </p><p>A combination of the ASIST and safeTALK courses is already being used in places such as Canada and iproving to be very successful.  Providing students with an understanding of suicide means that those experiencing suicidal thoughts will know where to seek help.  It will also empower their friends and class mates in recognising students who are in difficulty and need help.  Suicide prevention courses should include coping skills in response to stress, substance abuse and aggressive behaviours.  The focus should be on promoting positive mental health in post-primary school settings.  Prevention programmes in schools will allow us to reach greater numbers of students and help those dealing with suicidal thoughts or who could potentially be affected.  Primary prevention at a young age can lead to lower rates of suicide.  The way forward is to educate children at a young age.  </p><p>There is no quick fix solution to the problem of youth suicide, but the introduction of a sensitive course at post-primary level - perhaps in transition year - could make a difference.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider introducing such a course.</p></speech>

I also thank her for raising this very important issue.  </p><p>I am very aware of the serious problem of youth suicide and the important role schools can play in prevention.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, produced guidelines for post-primary schools in 2013 entitled, Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.  The guidelines are informed by consultations with key education and health partners and the findings of current research.  They provide practical guidance for post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and also evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.  They build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education, SPHE, curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support model and the HSE's health promoting schools process.  Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE support service and other external agencies and support services.  </p><p>The new framework for the junior cycle also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being.  It is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is well-being.  It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new junior cycle subject and short course as they are developed.  They include the key skills of &quot;managing myself&quot; and &quot;staying well&quot;.  In addition, the 24 statements of learning students should experience during their junior cycle programme involve students communicating effectively, understanding the process of moral decision making and taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.</p><p>One of the innovative features of the junior cycle framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has developed a new short course in SPHE which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE in the junior cycle up to 100 hours over three years.  The new short course is available to post-primary schools to implement, should they wish to do so, as part of their junior cycle programme.  It includes strands such as &quot;minding myself and others&quot; and &quot;my mental health&quot; and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.  Students will have opportunities to revisit different themes which focus on developing self-awareness and respect for others and the skills of self-management, communication, coping, decision making and relating to others.</p><p>It is open to any NGO, interested stakeholders, or even a local school, to develop a short course in order to fulfil the commitments of the junior cycle framework.  It is possible, therefore, for a group interested in promoting student well-being to develop a short course in this area.  Schools would then be able to implement it should they wish to do so.  </p><p>The Senator should note that there are opportunities for schools to develop short courses.  We all want to see schools engaged in dealing with this hugely troubling issue.</p></speech>

My understanding is, however, that a new drug, Fampyra, gives incredible relief to sufferers, but it is not available as a prescribed medicine under the long-term illness scheme.  My question is simple.  Does the Minister have plans to provide this drug under the scheme for sufferers of multiple sclerosis to enhance the quality of their lives?</p></speech>

I am happy to clarify the matter for the Senator.</p><p>It is important to state decisions on which medicines should be licensed for use in Ireland and reimbursed by the taxpayer are not political or ministerial.  Such decisions are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, at St James's Hospital.   The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and the reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes derived from the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  It received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine, otherwise known as Fampyra, in the GMS and community drug schemes.</p> <p> The HSE received an application for the inclusion of fampridine, otherwise known as Fampyra, in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted an evaluation of fampridine.  It concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and offer a fair price for fampridine in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website.  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the list of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs schemes.  It is open to the manufacturer at any time to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of the drug in the community drug schemes by incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price, or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014 and is currently being considered.</p><p>The Minister for Health wants to assure the Senator that he and the HSE fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug.  While he appreciates that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, he hopes the Senator will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we only reimburse the drugs that are the most effective medicines, and only at a fair price.</p></speech>

On 12 September Mr. John McNulty was appointed to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  On 17 September, five days later, Mr. McNulty was announced as the Fine Gael candidate in the Seanad by-election.  The nomination form, which had his name and address and his description as a board member of IMMA, was signed by An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.</p><p>On 21 September an Independent candidate, Mr. Gerard Craughwell, objected to Mr. McNulty's candidacy but apparently withdrew his objection when he saw that Mr. McNulty was a member of the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Subsequently, there was political controversy which resulted in Mr. McNulty's withdrawal as a candidate.  He withdrew to forestall a legal challenge by other candidates, because there was talk of legal advice being sought and legal challenges being made.  I contend that the withdrawal of Mr. McNulty at that time was planned as a diversion to forestall a legal challenge, which seems, effectively, to have been what happened.</p></speech>

She is probably aware of them.  Who in Fine Gael instructed the Minister to appoint Mr. McNulty to IMMA?  What was the reason given by this anonymous official for advocating the appointment?  What authority did the official cite in requesting the appointment from a Minister of the Government?  Did he or she mention the Taoiseach or a Seanad campaign, or did the person simply state that he or she was acting on his or her own initiative due to Mr. McNulty's interest in being appointed to, in the Minister's own words, &quot;an arts board&quot;?  Were written records kept of this interaction with the Fine Gael official?  Was the Minister aware, or was she notified by her officials, that the appointments breached current Government policy on board size?  If so, why did she override them?  Why was a particular decision apparently made to increase the number of board members of IMMA?  Was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform notified, as it should have been?<br/>Did the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht personally contact Mr. McNulty before the appointment?  Was she acquainted with Mr. McNulty before the appointment?  Why did Mr. McNulty accept the appointment knowing, first, that he would have to resign from the board in the event of his election to the Seanad and, second, that - as should have been known to the Department at least, and to the Minister's advisers - he would have had to resign even as a candidate?  It should have been known that he was not validly appointed and really could not be a member of the board as a candidate.  <br/>Did the Taoiseach, to the Minister's knowledge, instruct Fine Gael headquarters to appoint Mr. McNulty?  The Taoiseach claims he did not know Mr. McNulty was on the board of IMMA, so why did he state that Mr. McNulty was on the board of IMMA on the nomination papers for the Seanad by-election?  Did the Taoiseach ask the Minister to say nothing over the past couple of weeks?  There seems to have been a deliberate policy not to answer questions on this subject.  Can she state whether she voted for Mr. McNulty in the Seanad by-election?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-07a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100700042#RR00900"><p>I am happy to appear before the House again this evening to address matters concerning the appointment of Mr. John McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>As I have previously outlined, I appointed Mr. McNulty and Ms Sheila O'Regan to the board of IMMA on Friday, 12 September 2014.  I made the appointments while being particularly conscious of the balance of talent, experience and skills among board members, as well as regional balance.  Both Mr. McNulty and Ms O'Regan were appointed based on merit.</p><p>Senator Byrne has asked me to outline the circumstances behind the appointment of Mr. McNulty in particular.  As I stated last week, Fine Gael party officials made me aware of John McNulty's interest in serving on a board under my remit.  I looked at his experience in business, culture and promoting the Irish language and I made the decision that he could make a positive contribution to the board of IMMA.  I stand over that decision.</p><p>There has been considerable focus - the Senator has mentioned it here this evening - on the Fine Gael official involved.  I do not see any benefit in making a scapegoat out of a party official by putting his or her name into the public domain.  The Taoiseach has taken full responsibility for this matter.</p><p>What is most important is that the system of public appointments is being reformed.  The Taoiseach has outlined the system of public appointments that is being reformed and has accepted that this entire matter could have been handled better.  I accept that it would have been preferable to use the public appointments process.  While I stand over the appointments I have made to date, I am fully committed to using the public appointments process in the future in line with the new Government guidelines.</p><p>There have been some suggestions from members of the Senator's party that I breached the size limit for the IMMA board by making the two appointments.</p> <p>According to the memorandum and articles of association of IMMA, the current limit in respect of the board is 15 members.  I moved to make two appointments as I believed the two candidates could make a valuable contribution and improve regional representation.  As I was advised by my Department that there were six vacancies on the IMMA board, there was no impediment to me making the appointments.  As part of the Government's plans for reform, it is intended to reduce the size of a number of boards under my remit on a permanent basis.  Legislation is needed to give statutory effect to this change and it is expected that this legislation will be published in late 2015.  Heads of Bills are currently with the relevant committee for consideration.</p><p>Since making the appointments, I have met with the chair of the board of IMMA and committed to working more closely with him to identify the skills needed on the board.  Indeed, I look forward to doing this with the chairs of all our cultural institutions as part of the Government's new appointments procedures.  I will write formally to all chairs to ask them to outline the skills sets that best suits their relevant boards.</p></speech>

She has failed to answer the questions yet again.  That is a travesty of democracy.  I want it to be clear that we are not trying to make a scapegoat of any Fine Gael official.  It is the Taoiseach and the Minister who are making a scapegoat of an unnamed Fine Gael official.  Deputy Humphreys is the Minister and Deputy Kenny is the Taoiseach.  They are responsible for this mess, not anyone else.  We are trying to get to the bottom of what went on, which is why we need to know who it was before we consider anything else.  The Minister has muddied the waters further by referring to officials in the printed text of her speech.  Was it one official or more from Fine Gael headquarters asking the Minister to put this person on the board?<br/>The Minister stated that the memorandum and articles of IMMA require 15 members.  Her Government announced previously that there would be only nine in future and it was open to her to stick to that.  She deliberately overrode her Government's policy to have only nine members on such boards, regardless of what IMMA says.  I put it to the Minister that these questions have not been sufficiently answered.  She has a chance to answer them now.<br/>Will the matter be taken up in the committee dealing with the arts or in the D&aacute;il?  The Minister is running out of time.  These are serious questions and very serious allegations and accusations were made about the Minister in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>last Sunday, some of which I have read into the record.  I wanted to ask the Minister a number of questions before my party made assessments along those lines, but the Minister is not helping the situation.  We will not scapegoat anyone, but we want answers.  Did the Minister vote in the Seanad election and, if so, did she vote for Mr. McNulty?</p></speech>

I have listened closely and taken the criticisms on board over the last two weeks in relation to board appointments.  I acknowledge that this should have been done differently.  I have already moved to put a new system in place in my Department and I will follow those procedures.  It was out of respect for the House that I came here two weeks ago at very short notice.
