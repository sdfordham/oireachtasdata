I am raising the issue of health care for transgender people in Ireland and the widespread deficiencies that exist in terms of standards, access and trans-specific knowledge in the Irish health service.  As the Minister of State will be aware, Ireland ratified the current version of the European Social Charter 18 years ago, and submits regular reports to the Council of Europe's European Committee of Social Rights, which determines compliance with the charter.  In Ireland's 14th national report on the implementation of the European Social Charter, submitted for 2017, transgender issues are not mentioned even once.  When the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission commented on the report, it said that health care for transgender persons in Ireland is inadequate, in terms of meeting their needs, reflecting complex processes, inadequate provision of services and inadequate levels of knowledge and awareness among health professionals.</p> <p>This analysis was agreed with by the European Committee of Social Rights, which reiterated these concerns in its 2017 annual conclusion.  That two respected human rights bodies have come to the same conclusion regarding transgender health care in Ireland today is why I have tabled this Commencement matter.  The bottom line is that we are failing transgender people in Ireland under article 11.1 of the European Social Charter by not providing guaranteed access to health care in practice.  This needs to change, and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would outline in detail the steps being taken by the Government and the Department of Health to rectify this.</p> <p>Transgender people have a very specific range of health care needs.  It is critically important that relevant and appropriate services are available in order to facilitate and meet those needs.  These include: gynaecological and urological care, reproductive options, voice and communication therapy, mental health services, and hormone and surgical treatment.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health lists these as essential services to assist transsexual, transgender and gender non-conforming, with safe pathways to achieving lasting, personal comfort with their gendered selves.  It also lists the importance of social and political climates that provide and ensure social tolerance, equality and the full rights of citizenship, and in this respect at least, there have been great improvements in Ireland recently.</p> <p>It is four years since the enactment of the Gender Recognition Act 2015, and we can all feel collectively proud of that ground-breaking legislation, as Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to enshrine self-declaration of gender into its law.  That law told transgender people in Ireland that we respected their identities, their autonomy and valued and included them as equal citizens in this State.  However, legal recognition is only the beginning of the realisation of true equality for transgender people in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need appropriate and accessible health care at a minimum to allow for greater realisation of trans identities.</p><p>With the Gender Recognition Act, we rejected stigmatising and unnecessary medical diagnostic models for the legal recognition of gender.  Yet such models are still in place in determining access to trans-specific health care, and this must end.</p><p>In terms of hormone replacement therapy, the unacceptable waiting lists were highlighted in this House by Senator Warfield a number of weeks ago.  However, delays are not the only concerning part of such provision in the Irish context.  There is a clear reliance on a psychiatric diagnosis which falls outside the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, WPATH, guidelines, which instead advocates for best practice in line with an informed consent model.  This over-reliance on psychiatric diagnosis, as distinct from a psycho-social analysis, of how the State treats trans-people for hormone replacement therapy is problematic and needs to be changed.</p><p>I understand there is currently only one diagnosing psychiatrist and prescribing endocrinologist operating in Ireland.  While I understand a recruitment process is under way, the concern is that simply hiring more psychiatrists for this area will reinforce the medical diagnostic model which I have outlined, and this is not international best practice.  This service should be opened up and decentralised.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended that general practitioners be empowered to dispense the therapy as they are all trained to do so.  General practitioners administering hormone replacement therapy to assist gender people is a common occurrence.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment today to investigate the feasibility of this even on a pilot basis?</p><p>I also understand that despite the HSE claiming that no separate list exists for transgender individuals seeking hormone replacement therapy that, in practice, such a separation does exist, and this is one of the root causes of the huge delays.  Will the Minister commit today to investigating this claim and ending that practice?</p><p>I met representatives of the This Is Me transgender health care campaign last week who outlined these concerns to me in detail.  Will the Minister of State or the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, meet representatives of the campaign, hear their concerns and consider their constructive proposals on how this could be resolved.</p></speech>

I recognise the deficits in the service provision to the transgender community and the unprecedented increase in the demand for services, particularly among children and adolescents.  To address this, the HSE has developed a model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults.  The model was developed in consultation with the key treating clinicians, planners, policy-makers, advocates and service users.  The model outlines the key services required to address the needs of the transgender population, including children and adolescents.  It builds on the current service provision and identifies emerging service demand.  It also draws on evidence-based international best practice. </p> <p>I understand actions are under way to resource and support health care services at hospital, community and primary care levels in order to develop a national service for adults, adolescents and children in the transgender community.  Eight key posts will be recruited in 2018 for adult services, including a consultant endocrinologist, a consultant psychiatrist, two senior psychologists, a clinical nurse specialist, a social worker and a speech and language therapist.  A further three key posts in child and adolescent service will be filled, including a consultant endocrinologist, a senior psychologist and a clinical nurse specialist.  These actions will address the waiting times and immediate service needs of children, adolescents and adults in transition.</p> <p>The HSE, across mental health, acute hospitals, primary care and social inclusion programmes, is committed to building services for the transgender community in accordance with international best practice.  The issues raised by the Senator are very important if she thinks the model being used is not the accurate or correct one.  We have had that debate in the disability sector for many years.  People were trying to use the medical model instead of a social care model to deal with people with disabilities.  I would be interested to hear the Senator develop that point.</p> <p>An undertaken has been given to building services for the transgender community in accordance with best international practice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Further work will be undertaken to identify additional priorities to be developed and resourced in 2018.  In addition, the Health Service Executive has supported Transgender Equality Network Ireland, the national advocacy service for the transgender community.  It provides funding for the posts of training and education manager and family support worker.  These posts have provided education and training for staff across the HSE.  Furthermore, the HSE has supported a training programme for speech and language therapists to develop the skills to support transgender people.</p><p>Transgender-specific guidelines have been developed by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and the Endocrine Society.  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multi-disciplinary psycho-social assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services.  They highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention.  It is important that co-occurring conditions be identified and addressed, including mental health difficulties, self-harming behaviour, suicidality and autistic spectrum disorders.  Accessing supports to manage co-occurring difficulties can impact on the response to medical transition.  I believe informed consent is essential whereby the benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions.  The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and/or surgical transitioning is based on the use of a multi-disciplinary psycho-social assessment, the fulfilment of criteria for hormones and ongoing psychological support throughout the process.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to providing health care services to meet the complex needs of transgender people and ensuring adequate levels of knowledge and awareness among health professionals to meet these needs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032700002#D00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I will make a number of quick points.  Will the Minister of State agree to look at the fact that there are separate lists for hormone replacement therapy, HRT, with cisgender people being placed on one list and transgender people being placed on another, instead of everyone being one the one list?  This is causing delays.  The HSE is trying to state it does not happen, but members of the transgender community are the ones who are trying to access the service and, therefore, best equipped to know if it is their experience.</p> <p>There is an ongoing recruitment process, but it is still very much led by psychiatry.  Will the Minister of State examine the possibility of Department of Health officials meeting members of the This is Me campaign because they have solid proposals to make, an understanding and insight into the reason this is a problem, rather than having a much more holistic approach focused on the issue as if it was a mental health disorder.  They are constantly sent through psychiatry services before they can access HRT.  Will the Minister of State consider the possibility of departmental officials meeting members of the This is Me campaign and investigate the separation of lists for HRT.</p></speech>

I agree strongly with the Senator that the current system is psychiatry-led, but the only way to resolve these issues and change the entire model of care is for the Minister, representatives of the HSE and departmental officials to meet members of the This is Me campaign.  I will put these proposals to the Minister.  I am also available to meet members of the group.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032700002#D00500"><p>I welcome the Minister and very much appreciate him taking the time to deal with this matter which concerns a cost analysis undertaken in the HSE of the provision of home care services.  I raise the issue because, on the one hand, the private sector is being criticised severely for the charges it requires people who need home help to pay and, on the other, is being compared with the HSE in that regard.  However, what is not being taken into account are the costs incurred by the private sector which includes insurance costs, organisational costs and the cost of renting premises.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are part of the costs the private sector incurs in providing home care to people around the country.  A private provider may charge a contract of &euro;22 or &euro;24 an hour for the service.  From that, the provider may pay &euro;12.50 or &euro;13 an hour to a carer.  However, there are many other costs which they incur which must come from that overall figure.  On the other hand, when the HSE provides a service, the cost of administration is not taken into account.  The HSE does not have to pay rates, and insurance is covered by an overall insurance policy for the country.  We have never seen a breakdown of the cost analysis of home care provided by the HSE.</p><p>While the private sector gives advice to the HSE as to how services should be run, the HSE refuses to take on board these recommendations.  However, one now finds those in the private sector are recruited by the HSE to provide exactly the same services the private sector told the HSE it should not deliver to those who require home care.  Has a cost analysis been done on how much it costs to provide an hour of home care if the person is employed through the HSE?  If not, are there plans for such a cost analysis to be carried out?  We need to do it now because we have a growing number of people living longer who will require additional home supports.  Over 637,000 people are over 65.  In 12 to 15 years, that figure will be over 1 million people.  We must develop the home care package and ensure we are getting it in a cost-effective manner.  I am not convinced that is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032700002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this matter.  He has been pushing for reform of the health services and has been supportive of my portfolio.</p> <p>The HSE has sought to maintain, and where possible to expand, the range and volume of services available to support people to remain in their own homes, to prevent early admission to long-term residential care and to support people to return home following an acute hospital admission.</p> <p>Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated to them.  The resources available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of services to &euro;408 million.  The HSE's national service plan provides for a target of some 17.094 million home support hours to 50,500 people.  Home support services are provided either directly by the HSE or through voluntary and private providers.  Service provision is identified through a needs assessment undertaken by a HSE professional for the purposes of identifying the person's needs and suitable service which will support the person to continue to live in his or her own home as independently as possible.  The average cost per hour paid by the HSE to service providers encompasses all costs relating to service delivery, including the employee's salary, paid leave, employer's PRSI, travel, administration, training, etc.  All providers who meet the HSE standards incur costs in addition to the direct cost of the salary of the worker.  Such costs are essential to the operation of the service to the required standards.</p> <p>In the absence of regulation of the sector, the HSE has put in place formal arrangements with external providers to deliver publicly funded home supports to the standards and requirements of the HSE.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HSE has, therefore, tendered on a number of occasions for providers of home support services so as to create an "approved provider" list in each of its geographic areas.  The criteria to be successful at tender includes adherence to a level of standard of service provision as well as cost of provision of the service.  In general, costs to the HSE per hour will range between &euro;20 and  &euro;25, inclusive of pay and overheads, and will also depend on when the individual service is being provided.  The utilisation of external providers delivers essential additional service capacity across the system without which many older people would not be able to remain at home.</p><p>The costs of delivery of service has increased due to general cost increases and to increased delivery of non-core hours of service at weekends, bank holidays and late evenings together with the costs of delivering an increasingly skilled workforce caring for older people with higher levels of dependency who would otherwise require long-stay residential care.  The HSE has implemented increased contract hours for its directly employed staff in 2014 and is now in the process of offering improved contract hours in 2018.</p><p>In conclusion, it should be noted that the Department is developing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support care services.  This will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.</p></speech>

I believe that the cost of the HSE delivering the same service as that delivered by the private sector could be up to between &euro;30 to &euro;35 per hour.  Those are the figures I am getting.  Nobody has actually sat down and done a decent cost analysis.  Could the Department give consideration to a pilot cost analysis to see exactly what it is costing and how we can deliver more hours for people who require home care in a cost-effective manner right across the country?</p></speech>

As I said previously, the total budget in 2018 for the direct provision of services is &euro;408 million.  Regarding the point about hours, at the moment, the HSE hourly rate will range between &euro;20 and &euro;25, inclusive of pay and overheads.  I accept the Senator's point regarding the other figures he mentioned.  There should be some sort of independent assessment to find out the facts of the case.

I am very grateful to him for coming in to respond to the matter I have put down, namely, what mechanisms for gathering data exist regarding the operation of the new prostitution-related offences of purchase of sexual services under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and how it is proposed to record instances of the new offences and to measure the impact of the new law overall.  In the week after the Facebook revelations have emerged, I am conscious that any question about gathering data sounds somewhat suspect but, clearly, this is a very important question relating to how we can measure the impact of the new offences introduced in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act.  Today marks the first anniversary of the enactment of the 2017 Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The anniversary was marked earlier outside the gates of Leinster House by a group of organisations.  I pay tribute to the great work they did over a number of years to bring about the change in the law.  I pay particular tribute to the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, Ruhama and the Immigrant Council of Ireland among others.  I worked with all of them on the justice committee, as did many colleagues.  A committee recommendation ultimately led to the enactment of the new offence of purchase of sexual services.</p><p>However, I am conscious that a three-year review period is built into the Act and one year has passed.  The organisations are seeking to ensure adequate resourcing and training of garda&iacute; to operate the new offence successfully, and my party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, will ask questions in the D&aacute;il about that.  My question relates to the measurement of the impact of the new offence.  Denise Charlton of the UCD sexual exploitation research project, who was very involved in the campaign to change the law to criminalise purchase of sex, has pointed out that solid data are needed to ensure the law is working.  I note concern on the part of the Immigrant Council of Ireland and others that the progress in implementing the law and making it part of policing practice has been slow to date.  There is concern about issues such as accommodation for victims of trafficking who often end up living in direct provision centres.  While anecdotally we hear from Ruhama and others that women feel safer because they are not being criminalised, given another effect of the legislation was to decriminalise the selling of sexual services, we do not have access to relevant data to ascertain how the Garda is enforcing the offence of purchase of sexual services.  For example, have arrests been made under the new legislation?  Have there been any recorded instances of the offence?  Have there been prosecutions, although I do not believe there has been?  Such basic policing data would be helpful.  That is the reason for tabling the matter and I have done so on a particular date, which is the first anniversary of the enactment of this important legislation.</p></speech>

Part 4 provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  This Part also removes those who provide sexual services through prostitution from the existing offences of soliciting and loitering for the purpose of prostitution.  The new offences under the Act are, first, a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1,000 for a second or subsequent offence, and, second, the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, an offence which carries a potential penalty of up to five years imprisonment and-or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling or, in the case of a trafficked or exploited person being forced to sell, the sexual service will not commit an offence.</p> <p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted on 22 February 2017, and much of the Act, including the provisions I have just described, was commenced on 27 March 2017 - one year ago today, as the Senator said.  Since then, the offences have been available for investigation and prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The operation of the offences, and data gathering mechanisms in respect of same, are operational matters for those organisations.  I acknowledge the work of many support organisations in this area, in particular, the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, Ruhama, Ms Denise Charlton and others.</p> <p>A new incident category on PULSE, titled "Purchase of Sex" will capture the offence of the purchase of sexual services.  This is part of PULSE Release R7.3 and is scheduled to be live on PULSE by 30 March 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will provide a facility to capture all incidents relating to the purchase of sexual services.  The Garda national protective services bureau is monitoring the impact of the offences and is developing initiatives to ensure adequate and proper enforcement.  Senator Bacik will be aware that arrangements for the measurement of the impact of the law are set out in section 27 thereof.  The section specifies that a report will be prepared after three years on the number of arrests during the initial three-year period in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact of the offences on those who provide sexual services for payment.  </p><p>Senator Bacik is right to speak about resources.  Last night, I attended the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors where the issue of resources for training on new legislation such as this was discussed.  As Minister, I am very keen to ensure the resources the Government provides to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are focused on these new areas of activity and investigation, all of which are extremely important in the context of this reforming legislation.</p></speech>

I should have paid tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who played a key role in driving through the legislation.  I accept that data gathering mechanisms are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the office of the DPP but there has been a good deal of concern about how data are gathered by the Garda in recent weeks, particularly homicide data and data on domestic violence.  It is important to ask these questions.  I hope to do this in a constructive manner to assist in ensuring the legislation is implemented effectively.  I am glad to hear the new PULSE category will be made live by the end of this week on 30 March.  It is good to hear.  I am glad initiatives to ensure enforcement are being developed.  I will keep the matter on a priority list by raising Commencement matters as much as I can.</p> <p>I think I am right in saying the report on the number of arrests made must be prepared within the three-year period.  I hope we will have data in advance of that, perhaps in a few months' time, on the number of arrests and incidents recorded.  Will the Minister indicate if that will be possible?  I intend to raise the issue again to assist the Minister and his officials in ensuring the new law is effective.</p></speech>

The exact nature of the report mandated under the new Act has not yet been decided.  Information provided by the women's health service of the HSE and by organisations such as Ruhama and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will form part of the report.  These organisations work together towards the protection and welfare of those engaged in prostitution and the investigation of criminality where it arises.  Officials from my Department have been engaged in discussions with these and other organisations as part of a civil society-led working group to support the implementation of the Act.  In this regard, I acknowledge the support and active engagement of Senator Bacik and others, which I very much welcome.</p> <p>I would be happy to subject myself to questioning and regular reviewing of how matters are progressing.  Within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda national protective services bureau plays a very important and lead role in the provision of operational guidelines on the policing of prostitution and brothels.  Within the bureau, Operation Quest is a national unit primarily involved in investigations targeting organised prostitution and habitual brothel-keeping right across the country.  A major part of the work undertaken as part of Operation Quest is the raising of awareness among those engaged in sex work of the services available to them in terms of their welfare, support and health, including support to exit prostitution.  </p> <p>I thank Senator Bacik for raising the issue.  If there are any specific aspects of the matter she would like me to pursue, I would be happy to do so.</p></speech>

The first relates to DEIS status allocation and the second relates to home school liaison teachers.  We learned from the Department of Education and Skills that the process for DEIS identification uses data from the DEIS primary online database, the post-primary online databases and the CSO data, when measuring disadvantage and affluence in a particular area.  Much of the online databases rely on postcodes and other information.  This data is then used as a yardstick when allocating DEIS status.  The unfairness of allocation of DEIS status is something I have raised in this House on previous occasions.  The Minister, in his correspondence to me, has highlighted that just because a school is in a disadvantaged area, does not automatically mean that it gets DEIS status allocation.  I would like to point out a very serious anomaly in this regard.  This anomaly relates to the housing crisis and the reports from a survey that I completed with principals in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12, who indicated that they have a large proportion of students, which fluctuates between 10% and 20%, in situations where their students are characterised as the hidden homeless.  This is where families are separated and where pupils are sleeping on couches of grandparents, aunts, uncles or friends for the purpose of attending schools.  The figure of 20% in some locations is very high.  For the purpose of not embarrassing the child, the parents in general put down the address for the grandparent or aunt.  This information is then fed into the primary online database, POD, system that gives a distorted picture of the disadvantage or affluence in a particular area.</p> <p>I know of three schools in Dublin 12 and Dublin 8 which fall into this category, and have not been allocated DEIS status.  One is Our Lady of Good Counsel girls' national school, the Assumption girls' national school in Walkinstown, and the Drimnagh Castle boys' national school.  These schools are an island among other DEIS schools and educate children from the most disadvantaged parts of the city.  The review of DEIS status is coming up, and I implore the Minister to re-examine these schools for the purpose of DEIS status.</p> <p>The second issue I would like to raise relates to home school liaison teachers and the need to increase the resources allocated to schools to provide for and support them.  Their need and importance cannot be understated, with their vital role in supporting schools, families and pupils.  One school in particular, Synge Street primary and Synge Street secondary school, share a home school liaison teacher.  This is concerning when the primary school is categorised as an Irish medium stream school, with Gaeilge, and there will be a requirement for a home school liaison teacher in the future to have fluent Irish.  This, of course, must be supported if we are to support the Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Without these vital teachers buttressing the education system in disadvantaged areas, the cycle of disadvantage will not be broken.  There is absolutely no excuse for every child in this country not to get the best national and secondary school education that most us have gotten.  We are known for our world class education system and we cannot leave any children out.</p></speech>

In particular I watched the debate on the proposed expulsion of a member of the Russian diplomatic community.  I am shocked, to say the least, that we have decided to expel a diplomat from the Russian Embassy.  To my memory, we have never engaged in anything to do with incidents that have happened in other countries.  There seems to be an anti-Russian fest running through the western world at the moment.  The Taoiseach said he would make available a briefing to party leaders, but we have to realise there are people in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il who are not in parties and who would be equally entitled to a briefing as to why we found it necessary to seek the expulsion of a Russian diplomat from this country.  This country is a small, open economy.  Trading with Russia is part and parcel of the trading in which this country engages.  We should be very careful about anything we do to snub a country, particularly a country with the purchasing power of Russia.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

The other issue that I wish to talk about briefly is adult education and guidance services and the tremendous job those involved have done throughout the worst years of the recession.  They have dealt with 52,000 people each year.  I do not know whether we fully respect the work that is being done in adult guidance.  There is a paltry budget of &euro;6.55 million.  They are pushing these sorts of numbers through adult education and guidance while the two new companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have a budget of &euro;54 million between them.  From what I can gather, they have only managed to get 18% of those going through their system into full-time employment.  We need to look at the way money is spent on further education and training.  I know the Leader has an interest in this area.  Perhaps, he might organise at his leisure a debate in the House on further education and training in particular.  I attended a conference with a group called NETINVET in Europe.  It was staggering to see the work being done in further education and training throughout Europe.  Maybe we might get the Minister before the House and get an opportunity to review where we are going with further education and training in Ireland.</p></speech>

They do Trojan work.  There are huge gaps in the services and supports and these need to be addressed for families trying to support loved ones with autism.  That is something we will continue to work on.</p> <p>In that context I commend my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, on tabling the Private Members' motion and holding the Government to account on living up to its obligations on disability rights.  I hope all parties will support that in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>The other thing I want to raise today is the situation we are still in with regard to access to Translarna.  You will know, a Chathaoirligh, that Translarna is the medication that is necessary for children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  It is now months since we raised the matter with the Minister.  I appeal to the Leader to go back to the Minister and say that we are extremely concerned that it is taking so long to access this medication and to have this medication, Translarna, approved for children living in this State.  We know that it has been approved in 22 other countries.  We know that people living only a few miles up the road in the North have access to it.  It is intolerable that children living in this State continue to be denied something so vital to their health and well-being and so vital to keep their mobility.  I call on the Leader to go back to the Minister to ask him to ask the HSE to engage fully with the supplier of Translarna.  It is not good enough to say those responsible should submit another application.  The last application submitted took three years.  Only a small number of children need Translarna medication but they do not have three years to wait.  I urge the Leader to impress upon the Minister the urgency of instructing the HSE to sort this out as quickly as possible in order that these children can have the medication they truly deserve in the same way as children in the North and in 22 other countries.</p></speech>

The matches are taking place on Saturday and Sunday.  They will certainly put Ireland on the map, and hopefully both teams will win.</p> <p>It was Daffodil Day last Friday.  We often speak about parking charges for cancer patients at hospitals, but University Hospital Limerick, along with the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh, have been to the fore on this issue.  They announced recently that people who are in receipt of dialysis and cancer patients receiving treatment would not have to pay hospital car parking charges.  This is most welcome.  I call on all other hospitals to follow suit, because when people are in hospital for treatment they are at a very vulnerable time in their lives and not feeling well.  Sometimes they come out of the hospital and have no change, and it is terrible that they are asked to pay for their car parking.  </p></speech>

Life can be challenging for both the parents of children with autism and the children themselves, and we need to provide them with support and funding.  That is crucial going forward.</p><p>Sugar is our new enemy.  The dusty white stuff is the cause of huge problems in our society, and I am glad we are about to start to tax high sugar items.  We all need some sugar, certainly, and there are jobs in the industry, but we need to curb the increase of high sugar products in our children's diets.  While I welcome the sugar tax, which is coming in on 6 April, just taxing the high sugar products is not enough.  It will make them more expensive, but it will not tackle their allure.  Young children want this product every day.  I have a sweet tooth myself.  Sugar can be addictive.  Recently a parliamentary reply outlined that there is an anticipated revenue from this tax of around &euro;30 million in 2018 and &euro;40 million annually from 2019.  The tax will add approximately ten cents to the price of standard cans of fizzy drinks and we need to worked harder on it.  It is not enough to simply increase the prices of these cans.  Manufacturers will find other ways around it.</p><p>We have to control how this product is treated by the consumer.  According to a study published by<i>The Lancet</i>, Ireland is set to become the most obese country in Europe, alongside the UK, within a decade and that Irish men already have the highest body mass index in Europe, with Irish women in third place.  Almost a third of Irish children are overweight, which is a ten-fold increase in the rate of obesity for Irish boys between 1975 and 2016, and a nine-fold increase among Irish girls, according to this study.  These figures do not leave a sweet taste in the mouth.  In fact, they are nasty.  It is time for smart food training.  We need to use the boost in revenue from this new sugar tax in education.  We need to inform and arm the modern consumer with knowledge about what we are eating and drinking.</p><p>In our Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto we sought to invest in sports infrastructure as well as promoting physical activity.  I request that the Minister comes into this House to discuss the issue.  The Government will receive this massive amount of money annually.  It is vital that our young people receive the benefits, and I believe that education and physical training is the way forward.</p></speech>

There are approximately 65,000 people in this country who suffer with this condition to varying degrees.  Including their families, up to 250,000 people are affected by it in a very real way.  In my surgery this morning, I met a 14 year old boy who was expelled from his school a year ago because they could not cope with his challenging behaviour and he has had no school for a year.  I was in the Seanad many years ago when the then Minister, Dick Roche, brought forward a Bill, at my request and that of the Irish Autistic Society, to close a loophole the Department of Education had been using to excuse itself and to renege on its obligation to provide an education for children with autism.  The 1945 Act allowed a derogation for parents who could not have their children educated because of intellectual disability.  In those days there were no facilities for educating such children and this was used rather cynically by the Department.  I am happy to say that an awful lot has happened since then and the Department has moved on hugely, providing special classes and SNAs, which are very welcome.  What happens, however, when one has a child who has nowhere to go?  This child has been at home for a year.  He has intelligence and ability and can make a contribution to our society but he is left locked up in his own world with his parents.  They have been offered a home tuition package but there is no one to deliver it so it is of no use to them.  Meanwhile, time passes and the opportunity for this young man continues to fade away.  I hope the Minister for Education and Skills and the Department will look into this and address it.  I will certainly be approaching them about it.</p> <p>Last year this House passed the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill unanimously on 12 July, a date well known to us for other reasons.  That is nearly nine months ago and this young man is one of 65,000 reasons we need a national strategy for autism and autism spectrum disorder.  As I have said before, I will raise this issue every single week until I see that Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is not something that can wait and people are desperate.  They have children with serious needs which they need addressed.  The autism Bill will not address that immediately but if we do not put a strategy in place and do not have a co-ordinated approach, we are not doing our children and young adults with autism the service we should be doing them.</p> <p>There is now a need for a strategy to address older people with autism, with longevity having increased hugely.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to explain why this Bill has still not reached D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It will reflect badly on this Government and on us if this Bill is not passed into law a year after it was unanimously approved by the Upper House.  The Lower House has not yet been given the opportunity to offer its support but I have no doubt it will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

This is in no way to disrespect the nature of the critical juncture we are at but it has been some time since we heard a statement from the Minister on the matter.  It is timely, warranted and necessary given the significance of the issue, on which we all agree.  It is important that Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; have the opportunity to engage with and hear from the Minister on this and to offer our views as the Government moves forward.</p> <p>There is an ongoing absence of an Executive in the North as a result of the failure of the DUP to sign up to the draft agreement.  I do not wish to provoke recrimination but we need to move now to the logical space laid out for us in, and created by, the Good Friday Agreement, that is, the convening of the intergovernmental conference.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It can allow for the ability to legislate on some of the contentious issues, which I do not believe are contentious - they are solvable - such as language rights, marriage equality and, this week, the findings from the High Court in Belfast on legacy inquests.</p><p>I reiterate the call made by my party president in Queen's University in a keynote lecture delivered last night.  It is necessary to convene the conference at this time, although all of us would rather see an Executive that functions on the basis of equality, respect and integrity for every citizen.  In the absence of that, however, the Good Friday Agreement shines a light on a path forward.  We should follow the Good Friday Agreement at all times, as we have done, and convene that sitting of the intergovernmental conference to ensure the delivery of rights for the people who should not have to wait any longer.</p></speech>

I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the Russian ambassador, Yury Filatov, and the President and people of Russia on the tragic fire that killed 64 people, including possibly 41 children, at the Winter Cherry shopping centre in Kemerovo in Siberia.  It is a terrible tragedy.  We had the experience of the Stardust tragedy, and the fire that happened in that shopping centre was similar in the way the doors were locked and bolted.  It was an horrendous situation for the children and the adults involved.  It would be good if we, through the Leader, extended our deepest sympathy to the Russian ambassador.  I am sure everyone in this House would like to extend their sympathy to the people of Russia.</p> <p>Regarding the expulsion of a diplomat from the Russian delegation here, all I can say is that I hope the Government has very sound grounds that the government there was involved in this Salisbury attack.  We have not been briefed in this House on the reasons for the expulsion of a diplomat from Dublin.  We have a very good relationship with the Russian Federation.  As a former Minister with responsibility for trade, I led the first delegation from Europe to then new Russian Federation in the 1990s.  We built up an enormous trade with the Russian Federation.  All I hope is that we will not be victims of the decision of the Government and that jobs will not be lost in our agriculture and industrial sectors.  We have to maintain our trade links, particularly post Brexit, with all our trading partners.  We have a great relationship with the Russian Federation and the ambassador in Dublin and I hope those relations can be restored as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

He is a very popular Pope and world leader.  We only have to look to the other countries he has visited to see the excitement that has generated and what can be in store for us.  The possibility of his visit was first proposed by Senator Norris in this House, and I also proposed it when I was in the D&aacute;il.  I am glad that it will come to fruition.  However, I would like his visit extended beyond the capital, beyond Dublin, and that he would visit Knock shrine, especially in light of the fact that it is nearly 40 years since the shrine saw the historic visit of Pope John Paul II.  In recent times the Pope has venerated Fr. Patrick Peyton, who was from Mayo, from near the town of Attymass from where I come.  It would be opportune for the Pope to visit there and that would be a very popular move not only with the people of Mayo but with his many followers throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With that in mind, I am sure that Members on all sides of the House will join me in asking that the authorities and influencers, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular, would make every effort to facilitate a visit to Knock.  A good deal of work is going on behind the scenes.  I am aware there are serious protocols in place and that it is not an official State visit.  The Pope is a Head of State and a world leader, and I would like to see the visit happen.  It would mean a great deal to many people and it would round off what will be a very welcome visit.</p></speech>

No doubt there would be people of all ages gathered around the gable wall, if that comes to pass.</p> <p>Last week, we had a debate about reducing the voting age to 16, and whatever one thinks of that proposal, there is no doubt that we need to engage the trust of young people in the political system, but for that happen and for them to believe in politics, they need to see that politics actually works.  One area, tragically, we would all agree politics seems not to work is in the area of the necessary reforms and improvements to our health service to a considerable degree.  Too often, debates on the health service break down on tribal lines, and part of that is because politicians often have a sense of impotence about whether any change is possible.  I am talking in particular about the ever-recurring problem of waiting lists in accident and emergency departments, for hospital beds and for scans and procedures. As we all know, that problem can get worse when the weather worsens, but it is a recurring problem.  One has only to read the Order of Business and the Official Report of these Houses to see the concern of individual Members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister told us on 31 January that it was time to break the vicious cycle that leaves patients waiting in unacceptable circumstances.</p> <p>I bring all this up because I believe it is my duty to draw the House's attention to one particular story.  A courageous and articulate young woman called Helen Murray has been in the media recently, and in touch with me, to describe her very negative experience of waiting six days to get an MRI scan.  She was told there was a possibility she could have multiple sclerosis, MS, and that only the MRI scan can rule that out.  As somebody who had never had any health issues prior to that, one can imagine her terror and how that was exacerbated by having to spend 22 hours in a waiting room of the accident and emergency department in the Mater Hospital to be seen by a doctor.  She makes the valid point that it is not just about people lying on trolleys.  She spoke about how she spent the night on plastic chairs with elderly people, people in pain, people who were vulnerable and people who simply cannot afford private health care where waiting lists can be a problem too.  She said that many did not have access to food because they were too petrified to move from their seat to go to a caf&eacute; in case their name would be called and they would lose their spot.  That did happen when somebody went home to get some rest.  Somebody came around ticking boxes, discovered they were gone and that person lost their place in an interminable queue.  She spoke about the problem of food machines only taking coins, in a world where people use a card or even their telephones to pay for items.  She said many were frozen with the cold as the sliding doors were constantly opening and closing, and pillows or blankets were not given to those waiting.</p> <p>In a service oriented society, how is it possible that even basic things, like treating well people waiting to be triaged or those waiting for further news, do not seem to be possible?  In her particular case, the problem was that the MRI scan could not be done over the weekend.  To make matters worse, when she got a CT scan and an X-ray after a long wait, she was sent home to come back on a Monday only to have another long wait.  That involved giving her a bed in the hospital which she did not need because she did not need to be hospitalised but she was hospitalised because the scan could not be organised.</p> <p>I am not telling the Leader anything he does not know but I believe he would agree that it is my duty to do so when people feel this inordinate frustration.  This is a 23 year old person with an interest in politics who cannot understand how this is going on in a First World country.  The solutions are difficult, but we have to keep focusing on them.  We also have to keep raising the plight of these people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not interested in having a debate which will break down on tribal lines.

I live close to the Luas green line and have strongly supported such public transport initiatives.  I am not a NIMBY person in any shape or form.  However, the House may or may not be aware that it is proposed to incorporate the Luas green line with a metrorail system.  While that may seem innocuous and fine, we have just spent &euro;368 million in extending the Luas green line to Cabra.  We are now being told that a metro system will be built at a cost of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion, replicating, in large measure, in the city centre access to places such as St. Stephen's Green and O&rsquo;Connell Street with new underground stations.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to explain to the House how this proposal is being described to all and sundry as a public consultation process, when, from an email I received yesterday, an &euro;18 million tender for architecture and engineering has already been awarded for the project?  If it is a genuine consultation process, I would like to have some clear views on where Dublin's transport infrastructure could be alternatively served in areas such as Rathfarnham, south-west Dublin and different areas of north Dublin, as well as keeping the Luas green line.  I would like to have some indication as to who made the decision to do this, why and what the alternatives are.  To describe it as a public consultation process and for Transport Infrastructure Ireland executives to say they are open to discussion about the alternatives rings very hollow when one sees the detailed planning and realises an &euro;18 million tender has already been awarded for the particular module.</p></speech>

It raises the question of whether we should be considering alternatives before we commit to this &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion project.  If we have up to &euro;4 billion to invest in public transport in the Dublin region, I do not believe the Houses of the Oireachtas have been given a fair opportunity to consider if this is the best idea.  Even in the worst case scenario, if the project were go ahead, as I very much doubt that it will in the end, the existing Luas green line would be closed for between one and two years.  People should be told the consequences of the decisions being made in their names.</p></speech>

I am Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which spent a long time discussing motor insurance and the cost of motor insurance.  It surprises me hugely that one third of the car thefts that are even reported involve unlocked cars.  Presumably some people in this situation do not report it because of their stupidity in leaving their cars unlocked with cash, valuables, laptops and other equipment in them.  People are going around at night and are checking people's cars and are discovering that they are unlocked.  There is CCTV footage of people checking cars.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or, if she has responsibility for insurance, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation should produce a campaign to ensure that we alert people.  It is a very simple thing to lock one's car.  It is probably a very simple thing to leave it open but the consequences are quite significant.  People are out there preying on it.  As a national Chamber, we should be trying to remind people to do the simplest thing of all, namely, lock their cars, reduce motor insurance premiums in the process and save themselves an awful lot of time and grief.</p></speech>

It concerns fodder on Irish farms.  In particular, it has been raised over the past few months with regard to the north and west.  With the long winter and exceptionally wet and turbulent weather conditions, there has been very poor grass growth and stocks of fodder have decreased dramatically over the past few weeks.  Since 2013, which was the last time there was a fodder crisis, there are roughly 300,000 extra cows in Ireland.  We have depleting stocks of fodder and large numbers of animals to feed.  As this week has proved, the weather has been exceptionally unkind to us.  The growth levels are not there at the moment.  Teagasc is saying that we are at 25% of where we should be regarding grass growth so there is a genuine concern in the industry about the next few weeks.  In 2013, we put a fodder crisis fund in place to bring fodder in from abroad.  It was the first time it ever happened in this State.  We need to look at that option again.  We need to look at the possibility of bringing in fodder, although perhaps not from the UK, which has limited fodder levels as it is facing the same weather conditions.  However, we could bring it in from France from where we imported 300,000 tonnes of haylage in 2013.  It is a really stressful issue for farmers, who do not know where to go.</p> <p>There is a huge issue with the weather.  The climate has turned against us and the depletion of these vast amounts of silage bales in the past few weeks has put farmers under exceptional stress.  Perhaps we need to start planning for the unfortunate event that took place in 2013.  We need to put in place, or talk about putting in place, a scheme.  I have been hearing from hauliers and have been talking to farming organisations.  The cost of bringing in one load of stuff from the UK is between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300.  If that is the cost, it is unsustainable.  It just cannot work.  The only way it can work is if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine helps supplement the cost, as it did in 2013.  It is a big issue out there and I hope the Leader of the House might in his wisdom raise the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine because we need to start planning.  If we fail to plan, we could be stuck in the situation we had in 2013 when we brought in the feed in May, which was a bit too late.</p></speech>

I offer our sympathy to the Russian people on these tragic deaths.</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Catherine Ardagh on the issue of DEIS status.

It is an issue that requires further analysis by the Department.  We are all united in wanting to ensure every child has the opportunity to realise his or her potential, including through changes to DEIS status.  Many of us have raised the issues outlined with the Minister.  I cannot understand, for example, why some schools in Cork city have not been given DEIS funding.  However, a total of 79 schools were added to the scheme last year.  The objective of the scheme is to improve literacy and numeracy levels and ensure an increase in school completion numbers and access to education for those who most need it.  Last year new methodology was put in place by the Department which incorporated CSO figures.  It is important that the development of a new monitoring unit is worked on.  I agree with the Senator that issues need to be ironed out.  I am happy to work with her to increase the number of schools participating in the scheme and the budget for it.  The home-school liaison service has an important role to play, particularly in schools with a high absenteeism rate and a low participation rate.  I have taught in a school and been director of adult education.  It is important to support this service and work with schools in disadvantaged communities.  It is also important to encourage all students to use these schemes and services.  Home-school liaison teachers play a vital and pivotal role in many schools.  They do specialised work and have a vocation, although I might get in trouble for saying that.  Their role goes beyond the normal interaction in the classroom and I commend the work being done.  I call on all Ministers, irrespective of their ideology, to increase the number of home-school liaison teachers in schools.</p> <p>Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Terry Leyden referred to the expulsion of a Russian diplomat.  The T&aacute;naiste brought a position paper to the Cabinet this morning and the Government decided to expel one Russian diplomat as part of a European-wide solidarity stance with the United Kingdom.  I do not believe for one second that it is anti-Russian.  This is about ensuring we will all stand in solidarity as Europeans; it is not about east versus west.

Either way, I am amenable to both.  However, it is important that we stand against the use of chemical weapons.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell also raised the important issue of adult education.  I will be happy to schedule a debate on it.  The school completion rate and the level of access to third level and further education have improved.  The Senator's former role was in the education system and I agree with him.  As a former director of adult education, I fully subscribe to and believe in the importance of returning to education of whatever hue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People of all ages returning to education, at FETAC level or not, is to be commended and encouraged.  </p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of Translarna which she has raised before in the House.  There is a High Court case pending as the Senator knows quite well.  The HSE has made it clear it is willing to look at any resubmission of an application by the company in question.  There was a limited introduction across Europe and a number of trials are being carried out.  It is important, given the small number of people affected, that every effort is made to expedite its sanctioning and use.  I would be happy to take up the matter with the Minister.  To be fair, there is a court case pending and I do not want to get into it right now.</p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of the works on Leinster House.  The Cathaoirleach quite rightly said it is a matter for the commission.  We will be happy to discuss it as part of the debate.  Members of the House are on the commission.  </p><p>Senator Byrne raised a number of issues.  She wished Leinster and Munster well at the weekend.  Sport unites us.  Perhaps it also divides us but it unites us more than it divides us.  We wish all our Irish teams well.  I commend all the volunteers on Daffodil Day who were out in their droves across the country.  I thank the volunteers and pay tribute to all involved in Daffodil Day.  It is a huge day of awareness of cancer.  I commend the Irish Cancer Society and its chief executive, former Senator, Averil Power, for the work it is doing.  We need to see that issue continue to be at the forefront of what we do.</p><p>Senators Murnane O'Connor, Reilly and Conway-Walsh also raised the issue of World Autism Awareness Week.  It is important to stand in solidarity with all families and organisations that have worked this week to light our country blue.  The Cork Association for Autism is doing huge work.  This week Cork Airport announced a new programme introducing a series of books to help children with autism to travel and to make it easier.  It is to be commended.  Senator Reilly also raised the issue of his Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill and the need to have a Government strategy.  I assure the House it is not this House that is delaying that Bill.  It is the other House.  We need to put pressure on it.  It is also important to continue investment in autism services and ensure we allow families to have access to treatment and diagnosis in a more timely way.  </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of the North and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I saw the remarks his leader made in the hallowed halls of Queens University last night.  The Government has always been very clear about our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and our determination, as I have said here before, as a co-guarantor of that Agreement, to ensure the effective operation of all institutions.</p><p>Notwithstanding the remarks the Senator has made, it is important to get all parties back into talks so we can have a resumption of government from Stormont.  The Government has indicated that to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, and the UK Government.  That is the preferred route for all of us.  It is the best route for the people in the North.  It is also very much about the importance of having Government making decisions for the people in the North of our country.  I would be happy to have the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, come back to the House to have discussions on the Brexit issue, which continues and is evolving as we go along.  It is our intent to have that discussion after Easter.  We had hoped to have it before the Easter recess. </p><p>I have addressed Senator Leyden's comments on the tragic deaths.  I join with Senator Mulherin, as I did last week, in welcoming the visit of Pope Francis to our country.  He is a most welcome visitor.  It will not be a visit by a Head of State; he is attending a specific event.  His itinerary might be limited but I hope he travels beyond Dublin.  It would be a wonderful act by the leader of the Catholic Church to travel to the Archdiocese of Armagh, which is where the future cardinal is.  Senators Mulherin and Mullen also referred to Knock shrine, which would be a wonderful place for him to visit.

Rather than focusing on the political end, we should look at the management end.  The Senator spoke about a triage nurse.  I had the recent experience of having a family member in an emergency department.  They had to wait for a triage nurse and had to wait for a doctor to discharge them.  Having worked in the health system, as Senator Gavan did, I do not know why the nurse cannot discharge the patient.  A nurse may have more competency than the junior doctor who has to do it.  There is a management structure and a process that needs to be changed in our health system.  We focus on the health system.  We are spending over &euro;12 billion on health.  There is something radically wrong when the case the Senator outlined has taken place in our health system.  I would love to hear solutions to that.  We are spending more than &euro;12 billion on our health system and yet doctors, nurses, catering assistants, porters, radiographers and others complain.  What is wrong?  The system is broken.  That is why a cross-party committee produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I agree it is time for solutions rather than coming in and blaming politicians.  I do not think we should always just blame politicians.  There is a management that is not working.  Let us have an honest debate about our health system.</p><p>Senator McDowell spoke about the MetroLink proposal.  The public consultation process will continue until 11 May.  I read the remarks of Mr. Aidan Foley of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, who is open to hearing from anybody on the process.  We are spending &euro;3 billion, planning for the future.</p></speech>

I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House.</p></speech>

On Sunday, 18 March I retweeted what I thought to be a genuine tweet without having read the full content of that tweet.  A number of follow-up tweets from me were wholly inappropriate and I deeply regret that.  I want again to apologise for any and all offence and hurt that was caused by my Twitter activity.  It was never my intention to cause any more hurt to those already in deep distress.  I want to put on the record my most sincere apologies to the family of the late Brian Stack.</p> <p>A Chathaoirligh and the House, I appreciate the time afforded to me for this apology.
