We will reduce the number of suitable candidates proposed by the Judicial Appointments Commission for each vacancy to the lowest number advised as constitutionally and legally permissible by the Attorney General, but in any event not more than three candidates to be shortlisted by the Judicial Appointments Commission for any vacancy.</blockquote> <p>Also, the scheme for the Bill recently published by the Government says:</p><blockquote><i>It is a requirement that Government is in a position to retain a substantive choice as part of the exercise of the executive discretion under Article 35 of the Constitution. The choice that Government must have given its role under the Constitution is satisfied by the provision whereby the Commission recommends three names.</i></blockquote> <p>The Constitution gives to the Government, and the Government alone, the right to select, from eligible persons, people who are to be appointed to the Judiciary.  That is simple.  The Government has the right, for instance, among High Court judges at the moment or Court of Appeal judges, to appoint any of them to the Supreme Court as it considers right.  That right cannot be taken away from the Government.  It cannot be subject to a process, which seems on the face of it, to deprive the Government of that discretion.  There is nothing in law that this House or the other House can do.  No Bill or Act can change the situation that if one is eligible to be appointed to the Supreme Court, as a matter of law, the Government is entitled to make the appointment.  There is a huge attempt being made to suggest that somehow, by changing the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which was to give advice to the Government on the suitability of candidates to a judicial appointments commission with a small shortlist, the Government will be constrained to appoint from the shortlist.  It will not and it cannot be.  </p><p>The other great illusion that has been put forward to the people of Ireland is that it is somehow wrong for the Attorney General, the Minister for justice or the Taoiseach of the day to say, for instance, to an eminent solicitor or barrister, &quot;We believe you should be appointed to the Bench.&quot;  The procedure has been generally that those people who apply to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, if they are approved by the board, are subsequently appointed.  On occasion it has happened that people have been appointed without any involvement of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, from being in the position of a lay practitioner, to the superior courts.  That is the first thing I wanted to say.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The second thing that I wanted to say relates to the Minister, Deputy Ross, who has been championing the cause of a lay majority on a judicial appointments advisory commission.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i>of Monday, 21 November 2016, &quot;Mr Ross said the programme for Government sets out a commitment to reform the way judges are selected which would take the process out of the hands of politicians.&quot;  That is untrue and constitutionally infirm and impermissible.  I will not use a term that would involve going further than that, but I will say it is untrue as a proposition of law.<br/><br/>I remind the House that we are talking about a common law system and a common law Judiciary.  Ireland is the only state in the common law world in which a government has ever proposed having a lay majority on an advisory board.  It is of some significance that such a change has not been proposed in America or anywhere else with a common law system.  Under the proposed new scheme, which has not applied heretofore, a judge of the High Court who is willing to become a Supreme Court judge or a Court of Appeal judge is supposed to submit to being interviewed by seven lay people who, in turn, are supposed to look at everybody else and select three people, thereby possibly excluding that judge from first consideration by the Cabinet.  This is an attack on a system that has worked extremely well.  I do not want to push it any further than to say that this proposal will not produce better candidates for the Judiciary.  It will politicise promotions within the Judiciary.  This process will discourage many people who would be good judges or good candidates for promotion to a higher court from applying for such positions.  This Bill is misconceived.<br/><br/>I remind the House that before he became a Minister, Deputy Ross introduced the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Judicial Appointments) Bill 2013, which proposed that the Government would have no role in the selection of judges.  He suggested that this would be done by a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Believe it or not, he proposed from the Opposition benches that Government supporters would have to be in a minority on that committee.  Deputy Ross introduced his Bill in 2013 in an effort to depoliticise the appointment of judges, but the Bill in question proposed to hand that responsibility to elected politicians.  When he spoke in the D&aacute;il in support of the Bill, he said the Oireachtas committee could debate the merits of individual candidates for the Judiciary.  He is now saying as Minister that he wants to take responsibility for the appointment of judges out of the hands of politicians.  I suggest that the Government should reconsider carefully whether the scheme of the Bill that has now been published will disimprove the quality of our Judiciary, inhibit people from seeking selection and remove the perfectly reasonable faculty of the Government of the day to select people from among serving High Court judges for appointment to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court and without having to go through any process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator McDowell for raising this matter which I am pleased to address on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, who apologises for not being here today.  The Government's general scheme of a judicial appointments commission Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny, in conjunction with Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Bill, at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The T&aacute;naiste intends to take account of the feedback from that meeting when she introduces improved and elaborated proposals in a Bill that is to be published at an early stage for further discussion and examination by both Houses.  The Government's proposals arise in the first instance from policy consideration of the responses to a 2014 public consultation and call for submissions on the need for the existing provisions for eligibility for judicial appointment to be reformed.</p> <p>A commitment to the establishment of a new judicial appointments commission was made in the 2016 programme for Government and as part of the confidence and supply arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  The design of the Government proposals, which allow for a lay majority of one and a lay chair, will provide for a much-needed critical mass of non-judicial and non-legal people in the selection process and will ensure there is a wider set of expertise and experience among the lay people who will be represented on the commission.  It seems there are no difficulties with the lay chair and lay majority concepts in the jurisdictions of England and Wales and Scotland, where judicial procedures have been fully reformed in recent times.  In line with a commitment in the programme for Government, the Chief Justice will be a member of the commission.  As the most senior member of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice will make a critical and highly influential input into determinations on the suitability of candidates for judicial office.  I believe the overall balance proposed by the Government is correct.</p> <p>No one will disagree that the Judiciary can play an important role and make a hugely significant input in the judicial selection process on the basis of its unique knowledge, skills and experience.  The T&aacute;naiste acknowledged this specifically at last week's joint committee discussion.  The Government's proposals, which deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, will reduce from seven to three the minimum number of names the commission will recommend to the Government for appointment.  There will be two additional names to correspond with each additional vacancy.  As the Senator may have noticed, the T&aacute;naiste said last week that she intends to include in the legislation a prohibition on canvassing, which will prevent any person, candidate, applicant or otherwise from seeking to interfere with or compromise in any way the selection procedures.</p> <p>It needs to be emphasised that judicial selection is an administrative or non-judicial function, as opposed to a judicial function.  The formal function of appointing judges by the President is not one of Presidential discretion, but is to be performed only on the advice of the Government in conformity with Article 13.9 of the Constitution.  The current proposal to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board with a modernised Commission will not change anything from a constitutional point of view.  It is now a standard international model to have judicial appointments commissions in place to select and recommend candidates, while executives remain responsible for the formal act of appointing judges.  Building on the enactment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation in 1995, it is clearly a matter for these Houses to consider what should go into legislation to reform the appointments system.  It is a matter for the Government and any Member of this or the other House, as the case may be, to propose to the Houses what should be in such legislation.</p> <p>Nothing in the reforms proposed by the Government impinges on the independence of the Judiciary.  Equally, nothing in the proposals could impinge on the constitutional prerogative of the Government to advise the President on appointments.  The proposed legislation enhances the independence of the Judiciary in a number of ways, for example, by establishing a body to design and conduct independent and professional selection processes leading to the recommendation to the Government of the names of proposed appointees to judicial office.  Engagement with key stakeholders is continuing.  Senators will be aware that the establishment or amendment of a judicial selection system through legislation is a matter for the Oireachtas alone.  There is no authority other than the Oireachtas on what the new legislative arrangements may be.  It is the Government&rsquo;s prerogative to bring proposals to the Oireachtas for enactment.  That is an objective we are determined to realise.  We should always acknowledge and value the enduring independence of the Irish Judiciary which has provided a constitutional structure that has enabled this State to withstand enormous political and economic threats to its existence and stability.</p></speech>

The words read by the Minister of State skirt around that issue.  At least he has indicated some willingness on the part of the T&aacute;naiste to consider refining the scheme of the Bill as published.  That is a good thing, whereas the suggestion in the words the Minister of State has given us today that there should be "a prohibition on canvassing" for judicial appointment is an alarming proposition.  If somebody wants to be considered by the Government for appointment to the courts, he or she has an entitlement to indicate that to the Government.  These Houses have absolutely no right to prevent people from informing the Government of their desire to be appointed to a position.  It cannot be criminalised, made unlawful or made an offence.  I believe the Government should go back to the drawing board with these proposals.  The fundamental question it should ask itself is whether we will have a better Judiciary or a far worse Judiciary if these new proposals are enacted.</p></speech>

We normally allow eight minutes.  We have already taken 12 minutes.  I am sure the Senator will have more to say on it - he will have his day in court, so to speak - when the T&aacute;naiste's Bill comes before this House.  I ask the Minister of State to speak briefly in conclusion.</p></speech>

I am aware that the judicial appointments review committee, which is a committee of senior judges, submitted its views on this scheme recently.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste intends to meet representatives of the committee soon to discuss the matter further.  This might help.  I thank the Senator again for bringing this very important matter to the floor of the House today.</p></speech>

According to the Minister's response, the Courts Service also invests in a small proportion of tobacco stocks on a passive basis.  </p><p>Following the recent commercial decision by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to exit from its legacy tobacco investments, it is now, more than ever, untenable for a Department or Government agency to have investments in this industry.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, have each acknowledged and shared my concerns regarding the investment of taxpayer's funds in the tobacco industry.  It must not be forgotten that the companies in which the Department of Justice and Equality has investments are the same companies that threatened to sue the former Minister for Health and current Fine Gael Senator James Reilly and his successor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for doing their job with regard to cigarette packaging and advertising.  </p><p>In response to Deputy Jack Chambers, the Minister acknowledged that no guidelines are in place in her Department regarding such investments.  The Minister further acknowledged that she was not aware of all of the investments made by organisations that are in receipt of grant funding from her Department.  There must be a commitment to divest from such investments and guidelines must be put in place to ensure that no future investments in tobacco stocks are made.  These guidelines should be Department-wide and prohibit any investment in tobacco companies.  </p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste appreciates the Senator's interest in the subject.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the Courts Service, in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998, is responsible for the management and administration of the courts and the provision of support services for judges.  It is in this capacity that the Courts Services has a role in the management and investment of court funds, which are held in trust by the courts on behalf of wards of court, minors and other beneficiaries.  The Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice has responsibility for the management and investment of funds.  The funds managed by that office are those that are held under the control of the courts and are managed in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the beneficiaries who include various categories of litigant, persons who are wards of court and minors who have been awarded damages by the courts.  The investment committee oversees the implementation of investment strategies.  It comprises members of the Judiciary, county registrars, court officers, Courts Service officials and independent external members.  The committee is chaired by the President of the High Court.  The funds are invested in line with the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958 and subsequent orders.  In accordance with that Act and based on independent investment advice, the Courts Service invests a proportion of these funds in equities and shares on a passive basis, which means that the funds are invested, in line with FTSE All-World index, across a very wide range of diversified funds in the best interests of the beneficiaries.  As of 12 November 2016, the percentage allocation within the FTSE All-World index to tobacco stocks was 1.51%.  The Senator will appreciate that the fund is operated independently of the Department of Justice and Equality and in the best interests of the beneficiaries.  The Department has no role in managing or directing investments.  It should be noted that court funds are not public funds and are not under the control of the Government.  </p> <p>The Department of Justice and Equality understands that ISIF management and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, board&rsquo;s investment committee are currently reviewing the sustainability and responsible investment policy to examine the potential of adding to the list of excluded investment categories, so as to consider excluding investment in tobacco companies.  This process is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.</p> <p>In regard to the common investment fund, CIF, the T&aacute;naiste has been informed it holds a small proportion of tobacco-related stocks as part of a dividend reinvestment scheme which gives unit holders, namely, charities, the choice of receiving dividend income in cash or reinvesting back into the fund.  The Charities Regulatory Authority has oversight of the CIF, which is independently managed and the T&aacute;naiste has been informed that it is currently reviewing all legacy matters, including those relating to the CIF and ethical indices will form part of that review process.</p></speech>

I believe that the 1.51% allocation for stocks in tobacco companies is too much.  I am aware of the NTMA's willingness to divest of its tobacco stocks but my question relates to the CIF.  While I appreciate what the Minister of State has said, I will continue to pursue this issue and will work with others to bring a motion of resolution before the Seanad seeking a full divestment and the implementation of guidelines to ensure that no further investments in tobacco companies will form part of any portfolio within this State.</p></speech>

As of 12 December 2016, only a very small part of those funds were invested in tobacco stocks.  It should be noted that court funds are not public funds and are not controlled by the Government.  As the Senator will appreciate, the funds are operated independently of the Department of Justice and Equality in the best interests of the beneficiaries.  The Department has no role in managing or directing investments.  However, the review currently under way by ISIF management and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA board&rsquo;s investment committee, in terms of excluding certain investment categories, including tobacco companies, will be of interest.  The T&aacute;naiste has arranged for its findings to be brought to the attention of the Courts Service and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Similarly, the review by the Charities Regulatory Authority of the CIF will also be relevant and the Courts Service will be kept informed of any developments in this area.</p> <p>Before I leave I wish to congratulate the new Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Martin Groves, on his appointment.</p></speech>

While mental health is an issue that affects all of us at one time or another, I want to talk about two groups who have specific needs with regard to mental health, namely, young people and people who are homeless.</p> <p>I came across a situation recently involving a 12 year old boy who is suffering from panic attacks.  He has not attended school for the past 18 months because of his anxiety and is unable to leave his home.  He had been on a waiting list for months to see a psychologist but by the time an appointment came, he was unable to make the journey to Mullingar, which is 30 miles from his home.  Months later, after several failed appointments, he still has not received the intervention he and his family so desperately need.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that intervention had arrived in a timely fashion, I have no doubt the child would be in school today.  Instead, there is now a risk that his life opportunities have been thwarted.  There are many similar situations in which young people have difficulty accessing mental health services in Athlone and throughout the country.</p><p>Accessible and informal mental health services play an essential role in preventing mental health problems in vulnerable young people.  The economic benefit of local rapid-response mental health services has been proven.  The personal benefit is incalculable.  Services, such as those provided by Jigsaw, which are free and do not require GP referral, are informal and therefore attractive to young people.  I urge the Minister of State to make Athlone a priority for the development of the next Jigsaw service since the town is the largest in the midlands.</p><p>Another group who suffer disproportionately are the homeless.  Up to 47% of homeless people have been diagnosed with at least one mental health problem.  Recently, I have been in discussions with the Midlands Simon Community.  Those running the service have explained to me that it is not uncommon for homeless people to face two, three or even four such challenges.  For example, they may have a mental health diagnosis, an addiction, a history of abuse and a brain injury.  Each time the Midlands Simon Community attempts to access services on behalf of a client, the service provider states it cannot accept the client because of an addiction issue that needs to be resolved.  The service provider also states it cannot accept someone who has a brain injury or someone who is actively suicidal.  It seems there is no joined-up thinking yet and no appreciation of how hard life is for people.  There is little appreciation that some people have multiple hardships and simply do not fit neatly into one box or another.</p><p>We need more accessible services but we also need special tertiary services for people with complex needs in order that someone who has fallen into addiction as a way of coping with trauma can be helped.  Every community in Ireland has been afflicted by suicide or self-harm and the emotional turmoil associated with such ideation does not confine itself to business hours.  My concern is that someone who is suicidal and who turns up outside normal hours often has nowhere to go.  No one who is suicidal should be turned away.  I am aware of a number of cases in which people have sought help or tried to get a place in a psychiatric hospital only to be told they would have to get the underlying addiction treated first.</p><p>For some, the place on an addiction service has come too late.  I am passionate about this issue.  Not a single parish in the country has avoided the devastation of suicide.  The tragedy is that all those deaths were avoidable.  Were Ireland to take mental health as seriously as we have taken road deaths, for example, we would be a healthier and safer country in which to live.</p></speech>

I agree that people who are suicidal or who have mental health problems should never be turned away, whether it is morning, noon or night.</p> <p>Improving access to mental health services is a key priority of the Minister.  In many cases, mental health issues are ongoing and may require immediate treatment at any time, day or night.  Significant work is under way in this area.  It is important that I outline what is in place at present in order that we can identify what we need to do in future.</p> <p>The current provision of out-of hours mental health care involves various interlinked components, for example, access via community mental health teams during normal working hours, that is, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. between Monday and Friday.  During this period, access is also available through emergency departments.  If necessary, this involves the existing liaison psychiatric services for hospitals or alternative arrangements at local level.  There is psychiatric-consultant-led cover in place in hospital emergency departments for both normal working hours and the weekend period.</p> <p>The national clinical programme for the assessment and management of self-harm was initiated by the HSE in 2014 and is being developed on an ongoing basis.  We already have seen the positive effects because while we discuss suicide, self-harm is probably more prevalent overall.  The HSE has indicated that weekend access is provided in nine of the 17 mental health areas, with a further seven areas having partial cover.  The HSE has prioritised the provision of improved out-of-hours liaison and seven-day responses for all people with mental health issues as a key priority under the national service plan this year.  Services for all adults and those under 18 years of age are being developed in the light of significant new investment for mental health.  This is balanced against an acknowledged difficulty for the executive in securing suitably qualified and experienced staff for the care programme.</p> <p>My objective, and that of the HSE, is to improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for all children and adults, including better access outside of normal working hours via emergency departments.  The HSE is keen to ensure that each region provides access to a weekend service for people currently attending the service.  In recognition of this, a service improvement project with a dedicated project manager was set up in November last year.  Data on timely access to services are collected for each team on a monthly basis.  Thus far, the data indicate that 68% of children referred are seen within 12 weeks.  Obviously, we need to see this number reduced further.  In addition, a total of 74% of working age adults and 97% of older adults are seen within one week.  This illustrates the improved response times for those with mental health problems.</p> <p>Work is under way by the HSE to determine the existing level of service provision and to examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate model of service delivery for use in the Irish context in order to enhance the seven-day services.  In addition, the HSE is progressing a detailed plan for provision of seven-day services throughout all HSE mental health service areas.  We are keen to avoid a situation whereby some services in certain areas provide a fantastic service and provide 24-7 cover, while other areas do not even have a seven-day service.  For now, the priority is to identify the gaps.  Earlier, I referred to the nine areas that have full cover and the seven areas that have partial cover.  Currently, we are working on identifying and providing a plan to fill in the gaps in these areas.  In tandem, we are working to deliver a detailed plan for provision of 24-7 care but it is important that we walk before we can run.</p> <p>The Senator referred to specific people and areas.  An additional &euro;2 million in ongoing funding was made available in 2016 to address the specific mental health needs of homeless persons in Dublin.  This is part of the response to and recognition of difficult cases.  To identify service needs of people with substance misuse, including alcohol and drugs, alongside mental illness, a clinical programme for dual diagnosis was initiated last year.  To date a programme manager has been appointed to oversee the clinical programme.  In addition, a clinical lead has been identified at interview and will be seconded pending discussions with the local addiction services.  I will continue to work with the HSE on this area, taking account of agreed policy and evolving service priorities and resource availability overall.</p> <p>I wish to specifically touch on the area of young people, which is a key priority.  Senator McFadden referred to the task force.  All the work under way at the moment will benefit all our people and society.  The four key objectives of the task force are to improve awareness of our services, to improve accessibility of our services, such as the development of the seven-day week and 24-7 services, to align our services in order that public, private, community, voluntary and online services are all working together and are all aligned and to work towards supporting younger people to build up their own resilience in order that they can deal with the many stresses and pressures they face.  I hope these young people will be able to take these skills with them later life.  I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p></speech>

While I also accept and acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State to the issue, there is a serious need for 24-7 emergency care for people with mental health issues.</p> <p>The Midlands Simon Community obviously is based in the midlands and recently, it had a client in emergency accommodation who was taken to a psychiatric service because he was suicidal.  The person was sent home or back to the emergency accommodation.  The Midlands Simon Community then had to monitor that person all night to ensure that he did not self-harm.</p> <p>The Simon Communities and other similar organisations do not have the facilities or money to put staff in place.  It is not appropriate to have one member of staff in emergency accommodation to monitor someone with a mental health issue.  That person cannot be expected to do that job and look out for others in the service as well.</p> <p>Another area that needs to be examined is funding and training for staff in organisations like the Midlands Simon Community and other organisations.  It is also important that no one is turned away from a psychiatric service.  A lady who visited my clinic last year went thrice to St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar to state she was suicidal.  Each time she was sent away and told she was not.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If someone is trying to commit a person, that is one matter, but if a person turns up, stating he or she is suicidal, the person should never be turned away.</p></speech>

Nobody should ever be turned away, day or night.  Whether the person has a substance abuse problem or whatever the issue is, the person should always receive that support.</p> <p>This year we will spend &euro;853 million on the mental health services.  A total of &euro;15 million was allocated in this year's budget which will develop into &euro;35 million worth of spending next year.  Every year we are developing new services.  Every year we are hiring new staff.</p> <p>A total of 1,550 positions have been approved in recent years.  While not all have been filled and we have a difficulty in that area, a lot of work is under way to try and fill them.  If we do not have the staff, we cannot provide 24-7 services.  The priority is to ensure we can hire staff.</p> <p>The National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, has a budget in excess of &euro;11 million.  The funding goes to support many of the organisations provided they can show where their funding is going and they provide the service they say they do.  Training forms part of what that funding is provided for, if the Senators wants clarity on that.</p> <p>On the Jigsaw network, this year we will develop a further five new Jigsaw projects in Cork, Limerick and Dublin.  The HSE is actively engaging with Jigsaw to develop a new programme whereby other counties and areas can actively engage with organisation.  I would encourage the Senator to engage with her local organisations and the local HSE to get as much groundwork done as possible because when the conversation has finished between the HSE and Jigsaw will be the time to put her case forward.  I am sure the Senator has a strong case.</p></speech>

It is disappointing, therefore, that the Minister has reduced this consultation to only four weeks.  In my experience as a county councillor, I have never seen such a short consultation period, be it for a planning permission or statutory consultation.  Indeed, a recent consultation in my home area of Stepaside on a new park had a pre-consultation period of six weeks with a statutory consultation of at least eight weeks still to follow.</p> <p>I must ask the Minister, therefore, what is the rush.  It is often said that bad decisions are made in haste and I am sure the Minister, like me, is keen that the new proposals agreed on for school admissions are the correct ones, and ones that will stand the test of time.  Schools, parents, prospective parents, churches and teachers' groups need proper time to discuss the proposals and to draft submissions that accurately reflect their preferences or possible concerns.  Such submissions may also have to be made following internal consultations, including the carrying out of surveys of parents or other groups.  The shortened four-week period, which clashes with a February mid-term break, puts many people and groups in a position where they are under pressure to complete a submission, especially given that many of those who hope to make a submission are doing so voluntarily in their own time.</p> <p>Needless to say, my office has been inundated with representations on this shortened consultation period, with particular concern from those involved in education involving minority faiths - the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church as well as the Jewish and Muslim faiths - not to mention those from a Roman Catholic or secular background who do not believe that they have been given sufficient time to make a meaningful contribution.  As the role of religion in admissions raises legal and constitutional issues, stakeholders may need to obtain legal advice to inform their submissions.  The shortened period will prevent stakeholders from obtaining this advice in sufficient time to formulate their submissions.</p> <p>The implications of the measures proposed by the Minister are extremely serious for all faith-based schools, especially minority faith-based schools.  The current proposals represent a fundamental shift in Irish education policy which merits careful and serious consideration by all the stakeholders in education.  It is important the Minister hears from the widest possible range of stakeholders who will be impacted by the proposals.</p> <p>I am broadly supportive of the Minister's efforts.  Indeed, I come from the generation that is possibly most affected by the current policies.  Among my friends and peers in Dublin, the topic of securing a school place for a child now dominates conversation, even more so than possible house purchases, wedding plans and other such grown-up topics.  However, the short period permitted for consultation prevents the various stakeholders from engaging in a meaningful and genuine consultation with the Minister, suggesting, perhaps, that the matter has been pre-determined.  In the interests of proper consultation, I would appeal one last time to the Minister to extend this consultation period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#E00400"><p>I thank Senator Richmond for raising this issue.  This is an important issue and it has been considerably debated.  As the Senator will be aware, the Labour Party's Bill was introduced last year, involving a deadline of 12 months which is coming up in June of this year, where one particular proposal was outlined by the Labour Party.  It was agreed by the D&aacute;il that we would have parallel tracks, one track being the admissions policy, for which we have the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, and the other being continuing consultation, which has been under way since June in terms of the Oireachtas committee, on the Labour Party's Bill, which deals with only one option.  I was keen to broaden that consideration in order that when the D&aacute;il and Seanad would come to consider these Bills, we would have the benefit of a broad consultation and I would have the opportunity to hear the views of stakeholders within the education system and bring that to bear on the various Committee Stage and Report Stage discussions.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, this is only concerned with primary schools.  This concerns the admission policies to more than 3,000 primary schools.  It comes from the growing sense of frustration for parents that at times they cannot get access to their local school, they may find children coming from a very far distance to get preference over a child who lives beside the school or they may be under pressure, as they see it, to baptise their child when that is not their preference.</p> <p>To try to resolve this, I have set out four separate options.  The first, much along the lines of the Labour Party Bill, is a catchment approach where one could only have preference exercised by a denominational school within that catchment area.  The second is similar in that it would look at the nearest school of that denomination and one could only exercise preference for a child in that denomination if it was the closest school of that denomination.  The third is a quota system where there would be a limited quota over which preference could be given.  The fourth is an outright prohibition on religion as a criterion for admission, but making sure that there could still be a capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p> <p>The reason I have had a consultation is I am mindful of the possible pitfalls and unintended consequences and it has been clear that some other parties in the House have expressed the intention to put forward amendments, not only to the Labour Party's Bill but to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which is on a tight schedule because many want to see that implemented for the coming school year, which is a correct ambition.  I am keen to see the twin-track approach respected and I hope that can be done.</p> <p>To clarify, the ten to 12 week consultation was the entire consultation.  I envisaged a period during which written submissions could be made and we could assess those.  That would be followed by that assessment internally.  There could then be the necessity of meetings with individual groups which raise particular issues.  My ambition was that, in setting a ten to 12 week period, we would be in a position by the end of April to deal with the issues if they came up under the Labour Party's Bill, which I believe is the correct approach.  If the issues were to arise earlier, with some party seeking to have these dealt with in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, then we would be in a position to present a properly evaluated position by the Department on this issue.  It is timely that we bring these forward.</p> <p>I am conscious of the points the Senator makes.  I will consider the issue he raises of extending the period but I emphasise that there is a certain sense of urgency with this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are two Bills currently before the House that will be progressing to Committee Stage.  The Labour Party's Bill is expected to go to Committee Stage some time after June and the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will be dealt with before then.  There is a strong sense of the need to get views into the Department.  I know that when deadlines are set for submissions there is often a tendency for people to leave it to the very end of the period before they make a submission.  I will bear in mind what the Senator has said and his expression of genuine concerns because we do want to give people the opportunity to make submissions.  I will consider what he has said but I would ask that all of those who are interested in making a submission to make a strong effort now to get views together, carry out assessments and be in a position to submit them before the deadline.  That said, I will consider the possibility of extending it.</p></speech>

The committee is currently in the process of evaluating that Bill.  Clearly it is appropriate that my Department and the stakeholders that report to it would be in a position to collate views as well so that I, as Minister, can bring the wisdom of the education stakeholders and the Department to bear on the debate that is under way.</p> <p>This issue is not just confined to one area and it reflects the fact that at primary level, 96% of schools are denominational but at this stage, one third of marriages are occurring outside of any denominational religion.  It signals that there are people of no religion who want different educational options.  There are also many Catholics who would prefer to see other options being made available.  We are responding to change but we need to do it in a way that is sensitive to traditions and to the respect, constitutional and otherwise, for religious, denominational schools and the rights of those schools.  That is the importance of this issue.</p></speech>

Many of the groups concerned are not leaving things until the last minute.  I outlined earlier the reason for the delays, namely, that it takes a lot of effort, time, people and moving parts to get a proper submission prepared.</p> <p>As the Minister said himself, this is a very complicated issue.  I am supportive of the general idea and I do not want my contribution to be interpreted otherwise.  However, I feel that a four-week period for written submissions is too short, especially in the context of the obstacles I have outlined.

Mr. McGowan-Smyth served as Clerk of this House for 15 years, from 1958 to 1973, after which he left to pursue a career in the European Parliament.  He published two books, including one entitled <i>The Theory and Practice of the Irish Senate</i>.  It would do Members, including myself, no harm to read that particular book.  It provides a good insight into the workings of the House.</p><p>I propose to convey the sympathy of the House to Mr. McGowan-Smyth's wife, Christine.  I propose that Members now stand and observe a minute's silence.</p></speech>

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p> <p>I wish to mention a matter I have raised many times in this Chamber, that is, the housing crisis and this Government's lack of action on it.  The issues relating to the crisis include spiralling rent costs, a rushed and poorly-executed rent cap strategy and a flawed first-time buyers' grant in respect of which only 21 contractors throughout the country have registered to date.  Today, I wish to raise another failure of this Government.  I refer to the repair-and-leasing scheme, which is designed to bring vacant and unused houses back into use by allowing councils to enter into long-term leases with property owners to allow the latter to refurbish properties and let them out to tenants.  So far, however, the Government has only allocated &euro;6 million for refurbishing 150 properties when there are more than 40,000 vacant properties in the greater Dublin area alone.  With a severe lack of housing supply in the market, every effort must be made to ensure that idle properties are brought back into the market and that every avenue is explored to increase the supply.  My constituency office is continually inundated with housing queries from constituents.  There are more than 3,500 vacant and unused properties in Dublin South-Central alone.  It makes sense that measures would be introduced to get vacant properties back on the market and to put long-term leases in place to provide for extra social housing nationwide.  The repair-and-leasing scheme is a quick solution, but it should only be operated in parallel with the construction of new builds.  We all know that supply is the elephant in the room with regard to the housing crisis.  I urge the Minister to increase the funding to the repair and lease scheme and to ensure that more funding is given to local authorities, as a matter of urgency, in order that they might build new homes, especially in the Dublin area.</p></speech>

It is not easy to get everything that everybody wants.  However, on a number of occasions, I have asked for the Minister for Defence to come before us in order that we might discuss the current state of the Defence Forces.  One of issues of immediate concern is that the Defence Forces annual report used to be published in May or June.  Matters have been allowed to slide to the point where it is now late October before it is published.  This constrains any discussion or debate on that report at the annual conference of the representative bodies.  That is totally unfair.  The Defence Forces are in a serious state.  The climate survey shows that.  We have seriously unhappy people in our Defence Forces and, in light of the job they do, that is grossly unfair.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Not only do we need to talk to him about the climate survey; we also need to hear what plans are being put in place in the event that there is the re-establishment of Border controls.  The Leader and I both know that the moment a camera is installed at a Border crossing anywhere in the country, some security measures will be required to protect it.  While I understand the Minister is probably busy and that the Leader has a lot on his plate, I ask that we have such a debate and that we be notified in good time in order that we will be able to prepare for it.</p></speech>

This is an issue of national importance, yet, as reported in one European newspaper this morning, most of the questions asked yesterday were aimed at disproving the Commission's ruling in order to score political points against other parties.  The ruling is watertight and was well researched.  It finally disposed of the idea that it was all a misunderstanding of the application of Irish sovereign tax law.  The Commission exposed the arrangement as having been calculated, contrived and unique.  It is very plain and simple: absolutely no methodology whatsoever was applied to the manner in which the tax rulings were made.  That is the major problem.  The only major challenge yesterday was to whether the figure of &euro;13 billion was due to Ireland alone or to an array of EU and other countries.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il's argument in this regard was destroyed.  Commissioner Vestager responded by saying, "A large majority of the unpaid taxes would be due in Ireland," not in another European country.  The robust defence offered by her exposes the folly of the Government's decision to appeal.  The public has heard about the attempts of Ministers to challenge the report; they must now hear about the giant waste of taxpayers' money that will take place.  It will take up to six years and cost millions in lawyers' fees, all just to save face.  The Commissioner's ruling was reached with the help of hundreds of lawyers.  From listening to her yesterday, I am extremely confident that the work done within the Commission has been thoroughly researched and that it was not just based on a whim.  I want the Minister for Finance to explain to the House how the taxpayer will gain from refusing the &euro;13 billion in unpaid taxes and instead spending millions on a doomed appeal that may be ongoing after the Government and many Members have left.  I want him to explain it in as forthright and clear a manner as Commissioner Vestager explained the Commission's position yesterday.  The public is asking the question and deserves an answer.  I do not buy the argument that we need to appeal and that if we do not do so, it will somehow cut off multinationals from investing in this country because they need clarity on taxation issues.  We have a responsibility to have methodologies in place to ensure fair tax is paid.  While we certainly offer tax incentives, we need to ensure there is fair taxation across all multinationals and indigenous businesses to give everybody a fair chance.</p></speech>

I also very much welcome the report.  I welcome the Taoiseach's indication that the Government will act on its recommendations, that Travellers are <i>de facto</i>a separate ethnic group, that this is not a gift to be bestowed on them but a fact the State ought to formally acknowledge, preferably by way of a statement by the Taoiseach to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The report strongly encourages that this step be taken at the earliest possible date in 2017.  It also states the Government should then conduct a review in consultation with Traveller representative groups of legislative or policy changes required on the foot of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  As the Chairman of the committee said in launching the report, this cannot be a false dawn.  There was a very similar report in 2014, following which no action was taken.  We are already behind our neighbours in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland who have recognised Irish Travellers as an ethnic minority.  Historically, international bodies have also recognised and continue to recognise the Traveller community as an ethnic minority and consistently recommended that the State do likewise.  We know that the recognition of Traveller ethnicity would not be the panacea to all issues faced by members of that community.  It would not fix the fact that Traveller women, on average, die 11 years earlier than settled women, that suicide rates are six times higher than the national average among the Traveller community and that there are shocking infant mortality rates.  However, the recognition of Traveller ethnicity would be a huge step forward.  I will be delighted if the Leader allows time in the Seanad for us to debate the issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality and welcome the pending recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p></speech>

The first is an old one, namely, that of Airbnb and the change in the nature of the city as a result of Airbnb lettings, especially within the city centre area.  I have received several e-mails about the matter, of which I will give the House just a flavour:</p><blockquote>Three new houses built in the last two years in my lane are being rented out on short-term lets.  All are Airbnb.<br /><br />Airbnb properties are changing the nature of my street.  Do I have any rights?<br /><br />A hotel [another development] would nearly have been a better choice.  At least then there would be staff to interact with.</blockquote> <p>A series of questions have been raised with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government about the number of enforcement actions being taken by local authorities across the country regarding the changing of housing units into properties to be let through Airbnb.  I refer to properties that were previously long-term lets.  The answer from the Minister has been that the local authorities do not keep such data.  I raised the issue just before Christmas when the Minister was in the House and he referred me to Circular PL12/2/2016, a letter he had circulated to all local authorities on An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision is clear: there is a need for planning permission when units are being rented long term as, basically, they are being operated as hotels.  Unfortunately, however, in the letter the Minister does not ask local authorities to be proactive in dealing with the matter; he just asks them to act where it is brought to their attention.  According to the lowest estimates, approximately 1,600 long-term lets in the Dublin area that were being rented by families have been moved to Airbnb.  I have heard Deputy Fergus O'Dowd raise the issue as it was affecting Drogheda and elsewhere in County Louth.  I have heard other Deputies speak about the position in counties Wicklow, Meath and Kildare.  Senator Denis Landy has raised the issue as it is affecting his area.  If we are to have a Rebuilding Ireland strategy, we cannot have a quick fix.  We must instruct the local authorities to be proactive.  One can have far more units put back on the letting market by being proactive in planning enforcement.  I, therefore, ask the Leader of the House take up the issue with the Minister who I believe has very good intentions.  Setting up a committee to produce a set of proposals in the first quarter of 2017 is not sufficient.  We need action.</p><p>Briefly-----</p></speech>

When the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, was in the House, I referred to the DART underground project.  He said it was a cornerstone of traffic management and public transport services within the city.  I made him aware of several planning applications along the DART underground line which obviously he ignored.  I raised the issue with the National Transport Authority.  Unfortunately, I was again ignored.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I raised it with Dublin City Council and now we see live planning applications on the line in question that will prevent the construction of the DART underground.  I am firmly of the belief that Dublin is being neglected.  There is no long-term planning being done by the Minister, Deputy Ross, in respect of it.  He has cancelled new greenways and new cycle routes and now, through his neglect, we will possibly lose the major infrastructure proposal that is the DART underground project.  The Minister must come before the House at the earliest opportunity in order to answer Senators questions and to discuss the specific needs of the greater Dublin area in the context of public transport, cycleways, greenways and the protection of pedestrians on our streets.</p></speech>

The lack of a dedicated obstetrics clinic at the hospital has become a significant risk factor.  According to the HSE's assessment, it equates to an extreme risk.  However, the HSE also states that the risk is managed well.  In this day and age, an approach where the risk is managed well is one that is very unsatisfactory.  This is not the way in which we should proceed.  There is always the possibility that the risk will not be managed well on a particular day and the latter would undoubtedly end in tragedy for someone involved.  In addition, those who are scheduled for minor surgeries regularly have their operations cancelled at short notice because of an unexpected obstetrics emergency.  There is then a double impact on patients as a result of no clinic being available.  We are now at a critical stage in respect of this matter.  Business cases have been submitted to the agency from the hospital outlining the need for this clinic but, as yet, no action has been taken.  It is not acceptable that we are trying to manage risk at one of our major regional hospitals.  By providing an obstetrics clinic at University Hospital Kerry, we would, essentially, be removing the risk that at this point in time is being managed.  As already stated, it only takes one minor mistake for a managed risk to turn into tragedy.  This is a matter on which we need to hear from the Minister for Health.  The Leader may state that it should be raised on the Commencement and I will take him up on that.  I am sure, in early course, the Minister for Health will be before the House in any event.</p></speech>

In response to a parliamentary question submitted by Deputy Jack Chambers, the T&aacute;naiste confirmed that the common investment fund holds a small proportion of tobacco-related stocks as part of a dividend reinvestment scheme that affords charities the choice of receiving investment income in cash by reinvesting it in the fund.  She also confirmed that the Courts Service invests in a small proportion of tobacco stocks on a passive basis.  In light of the decision made by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, shortly before Christmas to exit from its legacy tobacco investments, it is imperative that we have a full divestment of all taxpayer moneys from tobacco companies.  It frustrates me somewhat to have to bring such a Commencement debate before this House.  It is worth remembering that tobacco use in Ireland is a leading cause of preventable deaths, with approximately 6,000 deaths each year from the direct effects of tobacco.  As well as the human and personal tragedies of each death, tobacco is the cause of an enormous drain on our health system.  The direct cost, an estimated &euro;500 million per year, does not include lost productivity from ill-health and other huge drains on our public services.  There are approximately 31,000 admissions each year that are directly related to tobacco illnesses.  Each admission costs &euro;5,400, which equates to a staggering &euro;164 million per year.  The ISIF decision came as a result of pressure from within this House and from my party colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is a welcome decision and one which is entirely in line with the tobacco-free Ireland plan, which was launched by Senator Reilly when he was Minister for Health.  While I acknowledge the small nature of these investments, I also acknowledge the monumental efforts made by Members of this Parliament in combating the negative effects of tobacco use in this country.  It beggar's belief that we would have a Government Department with financial interests in any major tobacco corporation.  I intend to continue to pursue this issue and to bring a motion of resolution before the Seanad seeking a full divestment and the implementation of guidelines to ensure no further investment in tobacco by a Government Department or any body under its remit.</p></speech>

The Senator already raised this specific issue on the Commencement of the House and, as such, there has been a duplication.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt this time.  Any issue raised on the Commencement should not be regurgitated on the Order of Business because it defeats the whole purpose of raising points.  I am sure Senator McDowell has something new and innovative to offer.</p></speech>

It is approximately five years since regulations were introduced by the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government banning the letting of what are commonly called bedsits.  As a result, a huge number of tenants in bedsit accommodation found that it was no longer appropriate.  It became a criminal offence for landlords to maintain those properties in the condition they were at the time.  An awful lot of the properties were made the subject of evictions and were then sold redevelopment.  One of the curious features of this is that some 10,000 or 12,000 people were affected by that massive clearance of tenants.  A strange phenomenon is that, at the same time, the number of people sharing houses in Dublin and in every city in Ireland increased.  These individuals share the same bathrooms as their housemates.  Objectively, very little changed in one sense but the effect of the regulations to which I refer was to drive out the most vulnerable tenants and those with the least money and resources.  It also removed the first step on the ladder for people migrating to the cities in the context of accessing accommodation.</p> <p>It is a curious irony that this was done in the interest of housing standards at a time when a crisis was developing.  That crisis has led to many people being unable to find accommodation and there is a shortage of separate units available in a city.  I ask the Leader to consider asking the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, or a Minister of State at his Department, to come to the House to explain why that to which I refer was done and who takes responsibility for the fact that, in the long term, it probably caused homelessness and that it certainly drove up rents.  Second, and more importantly because I am not only interested in a retrospective blame game, will the Leader call the Minister to tell us if the rule is still being enforced.  If there are bedsits still in existence, are housing inspectors prosecuting people for maintaining them?  At the very least, should a moratorium on the enforcement of those regulations be considered rather than driving people out of the lowest-rung-of-the-ladder-type homes during a housing crisis, which has been the unintended effect of this intervention in the housing market?</p></speech>

In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, I read about the talks between the HSE and Vertex on pricing and the pricing agreement on Orkambi, the drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  There are over 500 patients in Ireland who are dependent on this drug.  Unfortunately, the HSE and the company involved failed to reach agreement in the past 24 hours.  The HSE negotiating team has forwarded the issue to the senior management of the HSE to see if it can make a decision on the matter.  The original estimated cost was to be somewhere around &euro;400 million and the HSE went in with an opening offer of &euro;75 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It worked out at approximately &euro;159,000 per patient.  The drug is available in other countries, including Germany, the USA and Austria.  Perhaps the HSE might talk to the authorities in these countries to see how they negotiated the price.  The Minister has spoken to other health Ministers, but, at this stage, it is a very serious issue, given that so many people are dependent on the availability of the drug.</p></speech>

Who uses the public bus service?  If we think about it, it is used by old people, young people, those who are sick, those living in rural towns and those on low incomes who do not have private transport.  They are facing the prospect of losing key parts of the service.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who must be vying for the title of the worst Minister with responsibility for transport in the history of the State, continues to insist that he will not intervene.  However, hard-pressed Bus &Eacute;ireann workers who have been the victims of the hard-right ideology of competition at all costs are facing the loss of their jobs, while we are facing the potential loss of the public bus service provided by the company.  I am calling on the Minister to come to the House, although I know that he will not do so, and on our colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il who have the power to do so to insist that he engage with the trade unions, with which he is refusing to engage.  They have a simple request - that all of the key stakeholders, the National Transport Authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the unions, sit down together to work out how we can fix the company.  Unbelievably, the Minister is still insisting that it has nothing to do with him, that it is purely an industrial relations matter, even though everyone in this Chamber knows that is not the case.  For the sake of all of the people I have mentioned who are facing the hardship of industrial strife and the potential loss of services, I call on those with power in this Chamber, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Members, to insist that the Minister get up off his behind and do something.</p></speech>

However, I am very conscious that it is easy to criticise President Trump; in fact, it is something of a global pastime.  What worries me is that we do not seem to challenge other elite people in authority in the same way.  Perhaps it is time to have the debate on the media for which I have often called to see how they could help and better serve us in that regard.  For example, when the former President Mrs. Mary Robinson was interviewed on "Morning Ireland" this morning about President Trump's executive order, she availed of the opportunity to talk about another executive order he had introduced - the Mexico city policy.  This is the policy that stops American tax dollars from being used to fund abortions in developing countries.  The former President was given a completely free run to give an extremely partisan interpretation of what the move would mean on the ground.  She was introduced as one being of the so-called Elders, the same Elders who had been silent on the issue of forced abortions in China and the horrendous abuses in the abortion industry worldwide.  There is no question but that the Mexico city policy will save, not cost, lives.  The former President does not seem to understand the principle of the fungibility of money; how, by giving money for maternal health services with which nobody could disagree, those engaged in the killing of unborn children are able to free other resources for these horrible deeds.  The real issue is the way in which those on the left are never challenged on the claims they make.  We have reached the point where there is no international outcry, not even a debate, for example, when people are forcibly euthanised against their will and even physically restrained as the injection is administered, as we learned happened recently in the Netherlands.  By all means, let us challenge President Trump and the bad things he does, but in so doing let us not delude ourselves for one minute that we are asking the same hard questions of others in authority who are doing bad things.</p></speech>

As there is an extra two minutes of daylight a day, it will improve us, but, obviously, without Government action, the position will not improve significantly.  On the back of a report prepared in Denmark by the Happiness Research Institute, mental health campaigners are calling on all of us to switch off Facebook for the month of February.  I doubt that we will be able to do it, as politicians, but it has certainly been found that there is a 55% increase in mental well-being once we stay away from the dreaded social media that eat up our time.  This morning we delivered a petition from Uplift, Mental Health Reform and Lust for Life on the #inourhourofneed campaign to the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, at the gates of Leinster House.</p></speech>

Many thousands of signatures were collected to demand the provision of mental health services 24/7, something about which we have been talking for so long, as well as implementation of A Vision for Change as soon as possible.  Just a few minutes ago daughters in the Greaney family from County Cork, whose parents died tragically - the husband had been helped in the Central Mental Hospital - said we needed access to mental health services 24/7 to stem the epidemic affecting every county.  Will the Leader ask the Minister of State to address the Chamber to update us on the promised provision of emergency services 24/7 for those in need?</p></speech>

I join the Cathaoirleach on behalf of everyone in the House in paying tribute to a former Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Jack McGowan-Smyth, who died at the very honourable age of 94 years.  As the Cathaoirleach rightly said, he was Clerk of the Seanad for 15 years and served with distinction.  The Cathaoirleach has made reference to the fact that he was the author of two books, of one of which we should all be aware, <i>The Theory and Practice of the Irish Senate</i>.  To his wife, Christine, and extended family, I send our sympathy, our comhbhr&oacute;n, on his sad passing.</p><p>I will be happy to have the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, come to the House to discuss the matter raised by Senator Catherine Ardagh.  It is fair to say the Minister, in the budget and the action plan for housing, has increased the moneys available for house refurbishment.  In that context, I am disappointed to hear that in the Senator's constituency moneys have not been available.  In my constituency of Cork South-Central and that of Senator Colm Burke, Cork North-Central, we have seen Cork City Council putting national moneys aside for the refurbishment of houses.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter.  The Senator is right that there is a need for us to expedite the refurbishment of vacant houses.  There is no reason for houses to remain vacant in many parts of the country for an inordinate length of time.  I share the Senator's concern in that regard.</p><p>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell referred to the Defence Forces.  I assure him that the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, has given a commitment to come to the House to discuss the issue.  To be fair to him, he has been a very good Minister of State with responsibility for defence who has been willing to work with all stakeholders in the Defence Forces.  We have seen an increase in the budget.  The issue of pay is one the Senator has addressed repeatedly in the House.  He represents his nominating body quite well and it is important that he do so, but it is equally important that we recognise that, with the restoration of pay and conditions, the Government is also recruiting to the Defence Forces.  I hope the Senator welcome this.  He makes a fair point that there is a need for a wider debate on the role of the Defence Forces in a new European Union post-Brexit and dealing with conflict around the world.  I will be happy for the Minister of State to come to the House to discuss the issue and thank the Senator for raising it.</p><p>I was going to say Senator Rose Conway-Walsh was back to her old &quot;chestnut&quot;, but that would be the wrong word to use.  She referred to Commissioner Vestager's appearance yesterday at the finance committee to discuss the Apple ruling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people's views on this issue differ from those of the Senator.

I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, on this matter last week.  He is working on it and is willing to come to the House to discuss it.  The necessary piece of work is in progress and is evolving.  I will be happy to bring the Minister of State to the House when it reaches a certain point.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys raised the question of Airbnb, with which we have to come to terms as a society at national and local authority levels.  He is right when he suggests that Airbnb is taking much-needed beds and properties out of the system.  I am aware that local authorities in many parts of the world, including London and Paris, have issues with Airbnb in respect of planning, the charging of hotel rates and costs.  I suppose the issue of taxation is a general point as well.  I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys spoke about DART underground and Senator Gavan spoke about Bus &Eacute;ireann, both of which relate to the Minister, Deputy Ross.

If those mechanisms do not work, the Minister should be allowed to intervene if necessary.  I think the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il must have undertaken opinion polls regarding the Minister, Deputy Ross.

He highlighted the issue of risk management.  I commend him for that.  I would like to pick up on one reference he made to the hospital.  Clinics are being held in the hospital.  I understand that the issue is one of shared theatre space.  I might be wrong in that regard.  There is not an exclusive theatre for the particular obstetric issue to which he referred.  I will be happy to ask the office of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to deal with the Senator regarding the issue he raised.</p> <p>As Leader of the House, I will not in any way prevent Senator Swanick from bringing forward the issue of divestment of shares in the tobacco industry.  We all subscribe to the issue of a tobacco-free Ireland.  I commend the Senator on the work he has been doing to promulgate an alternative to cigarette smoke at all times.  We can talk about having time set aside at the appropriate time.</p> <p>Senator McDowell raised the bedsit regulations that were introduced in 2013.  I know the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, asked for them to be reviewed in 2014.  Bob Jordan, who is now an adviser for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, made the point at the time that the elimination of bedsits was not necessarily the problem.  Senator McDowell made an interesting point about how we can increase capacity.  It is one we should look at.  I will put in a request for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House.</p> <p>We cannot compromise on standards when it comes to the space, the type and quality of accommodation and the actual physical environment where people live.  Those of us who are engaged in constituency politics will know that the conditions in some cases are absolutely appalling.  I appreciate that this is not Senator McDowell's view, to be fair.  I hope that if we relax the conditions, we are not allowing for the squalor to come back.  The Senator made a good point about who inspects these properties.  The Health Information and Quality Authority looks at things like health and safety, hygiene and food hygiene.  It sometimes strikes me that apartments and other forms of living accommodation are not inspected.  I do not want to bring big brother into it.  I have seen some absolutely unacceptable accommodation recently.  The points made by Senator McDowell can be considered when we have a debate on housing in a couple of weeks or as soon as we can.</p> <p>Senator Byrne spoke about Orkambi, which is used to treat cystic fibrosis.  It is important for the Minister to engage with all of us, but especially with Vertex on how to keep the price down so that this drug is affordable and accessible for people.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House in this regard.</p> <p>Senator Gavan mentioned the issues at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I appreciate that we need a public bus system.  We need public transport.  I think the language we use is important.  We can scare people by talking about routes being gone.  Senator Gavan knows well that this is not going to happen.  He can give me all the Sinn F&eacute;in spin he wants.</p></speech>

I can circulate a copy of that speech to the Senator.  There is also a commitment to providing alternatives, but I hope it will not come to that.  My view is that we need to have a public service bus transport company.  I will work with others to ensure we have such a company.  We will have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House.</p> <p>It is important for me as Leader of the House to say that the management and the unions in Bus &Eacute;ireann will sit down and engage in conversations, talks and discussions about the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is not just about the people who use the bus service; it is also about the workers who work and engage in Bus &Eacute;ireann every day on behalf of all of us.  To be fair to them, they have taken a pay cut over the years as well.  I think there needs to be a discussion and a conversation.  We cannot engage in megaphone diplomacy through television, radio and the newspapers.  Those involved need to sit around the table.  That is the principle we need to get to.</p></speech>

I take his point about human rights across the world.  The Members of this House, like the members of the Government, should stand up for human rights, regardless of whether we are dealing with the leaders of Russia, China, Japan, England, the United Kingdom or any other country.  It is unfortunate that the new leader of the United States has got off to a bad start in the way he has driven fear and division.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am all for democracy.

The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and in fairness, her predecessor, Kathleen Lynch, have prioritised mental health services.  We have as a result seen an increase in the budget for them.  There is now a proposal that there be weekend access in 17 mental health areas, with partial cover being provided in a further seven.  It is important that we recognise mental health issues do not end at 5 p.m. on a Friday or at 4 p.m. on a bank holiday Monday.  We accept that there is a need to provide a mental health service 24-7.  We must work to provide a service that is inclusive of all people and deals with all issues.  It is important that we recognise the Minister of State has secured additional funding to meet specific needs, be it for the homeless or those with mental health issues in our homes, families and communities.  They are members of our families and friends.  They are people who work with us and in all walks of life.  They do not only include people who are anonymous but people whom we know and with whom we can identify.  We need to understand they have real needs and it is important that we make progress.

The Bill includes some provisions which relate specifically to my health promotion portfolio.  When it comes to health promotion and encouraging behavioural change in relation to tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy diets, what we need is a whole of government and a whole of society approach.  This is crucial if we are to be successful in stemming the tide of non-communicable diseases and their impact on our population.</p><p>Healthy Ireland, the national framework, aims to make it easier for more people to stay healthy, stay out of hospital and make positive changes that will enhance their lives.  Part 5 of this Bill aims to progress the Healthy Ireland agenda by making amendments to the legislation that introduces standardised packaging of tobacco.  Standardised packaging is just one of the many important public health measures we are introducing in order to reduce the number of deaths of Irish people from non-communicable diseases.  The Bill has five Parts, with 16 sections.  Part 1 sets out the Title to the Bill.  All Parts will be commenced on enactment.</p><p>Part 2 amends the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995 to allow for the payment of fees to members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, formerly the Irish Medicines Board.  This is in line with the practice of other similar boards, where fees are paid to board members in order to attract individuals of the highest calibre and expertise to apply for board membership, for example, to the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  Currently, under section 8(7) of the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, as amended, only the chairman of the authority is entitled to a fee.  There is an onerous responsibility and a significant time commitment placed on members of the authority.  Some people may be self-employed and, without the modest fee that will be paid under this amendment, it would be very difficult for them to give the time commitment involved.  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer relating to paying board members of the authority, as it is mainly self-funding.  The fee approved for payment to each board member, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is &euro;7,695 per annum.  The additional cost to the authority will be approximately &euro;61,560 per annum.  However, some members may choose to waive their fee and the one person, one salary system will also apply to members who are in receipt of a salary from the public service.</p><p>Part 3 of this Bill proposes to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 in order to exclude certain <i>ex gratia</i>payments which have, or will in the future, be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by Government for the purposes of assessment of means under the nursing homes support scheme, commonly known as the fair deal scheme.  The fair deal scheme is a very important scheme that provides financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable to everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  All applicants to the scheme must undergo a financial assessment which is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the scheme will contribute to the cost of care.  The scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment to ensure that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care and to ensure that an applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his or her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State pension, whichever is greater.</p><p>This proposed amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act is a critically important provision for many of our senior citizens, as it will exempt payments made to persons under <i>ex gratia</i>schemes approved by Government from being included in the assessment for State support under the fair deal scheme.  This provision applies to persons who have received awards under four schemes: the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, which has made awards to around 400 women; the Lourdes hospital redress board, involving 119 women; the Lourdes hospital payment scheme, which compensated women who were excluded from the redress board on age grounds alone and relates to 47 women; and payments made either by the Government or by the German Contergan Foundation to 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide.</p><p>I am also particularly pleased that the Bill proposes to amend section 36 of the 2009 Act to provide for the Minister to make regulations to allow an exemption for other similar groups that may in the future receive <i>ex gratia</i>awards, provided that the Government has approved the scheme. This future-proofing is an important and significant feature of this part of the legislation.  For any individual who has received an <i>ex gratia</i>payment under a Government-approved scheme, it is a very important principle that, on reaching a more senior stage of their life, people should not be in any way disadvantaged financially when it comes to making an application under the fair deal scheme.  In summary, the proposed amendments to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are key, age-related provisions for people who have received an <i>ex gratia</i>award and who now in their older years are seeking supports under the nursing homes support scheme.</p><p>Part 4 of the Bill amends Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The purpose of this proposed amendment is to allow the HSE to consider reimbursing over-the-counter products, where appropriate.  The amendment corrects an anomaly in existing legislation, where current rules only allow medicines that are prescription-only to be supplied in the community drugs schemes.  This anomaly affects a number of products that were prescription only and are now over the counter, as well as some over-the-counter items that have long been available in the schemes.  The 2013 Act gives a temporary reprieve on supplying over-the-counter medicines until 2018 and the amendment I have proposed will make this permanent.  This means that some very useful medicines, such as emergency contraception and nicotine replacement, will continue to be available on the drug payment scheme, medical card scheme and other schemes.  Patients will, however, still need an authorisation to get an approved over-the-counter product under the various schemes.  This applies to all schemes and to both over-the-counter and prescription-only items.  This is a very important control, both clinically and for the financial operation and governance of the schemes.</p><p>Specifically regarding access to emergency hormonal contraception, there are a number of important points that have been carefully considered by the Department.  First, it is important to note that medical card holders already have access to emergency contraception.  It is currently available free to medical card patients, provided they get a prescription first.  It is also available as an over-the-counter treatment, so any person can go into a pharmacy and buy it without a prescription.  In the 12 months to August 2016, just under 13,000 emergency hormonal contraceptive prescriptions were dispensed across all the schemes, and over 12,000 of these were on the medical card scheme.  The barrier, therefore, for medical card patients in getting emergency contraceptive as soon as possible is not access, as over 12,000 people per year go to their doctor and then to the pharmacy.</p><p>The issue is when women need emergency contraception but cannot get a prescription in time to get the treatment, for example, it might be at the weekend, they cannot get an urgent appointment with their GP or they cannot afford to buy the product.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I share the concerns that have been raised by some Deputies in the D&aacute;il over timely access to treatment for medical card holders.  I fully accept that there should not be unnecessary barriers to women getting this treatment and this is being addressed.  The Minister for Health has instructed officials to change the process for supplying emergency hormonal contraception to medical card holders as a matter of urgency and work on the development of service and clinical structures is under way.</p><p>Much of the IT infrastructure needed was trialled in the recent minor ailments pilot, in which pharmacies treated medical card patients with over-the-counter medicines for minor conditions, without needing to see a GP.  In line with the Minister&rsquo;s instructions, the HSE is developing the operational structures to implement this service safely and effectively, including procedures for identifying pharmacies in compliance with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s professional practice guidelines for dispensing over-the-counter emergency contraception, as is done for the vaccination programmes and also secure claiming and verification processes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is expected that the measures for emergency contraception will be in place in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>Senators will appreciate that significant steps have already been taken to remove barriers to timely treatment for medical card holders for both emergency contraception and over-the-counter products in general.  </p><p>Concerns also have been raised about the availability of emergency contraception to women where a pharmacist may not be able to provide the treatment or may have personal reasons for not wishing to do so.  The statutory code of conduct for pharmacists requires that where they are unable to provide a service, pharmacists take reasonable action to ensure the patient's care is not jeopardised.  In practice, the patient should be referred to another pharmacist, pharmacy or health service.  All pharmacists must subscribe to this code.  If a patient is unhappy with the conduct of a pharmacy or pharmacist in this or any other matter, he or she should contact the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which regulates the profession.</p><p>There is also provision in the Bill to remove the unintentionally restrictive provision referred to in paragraph (a), which excludes products authorised by the European Medicines Agency and parallel imports from the medical card and community drugs schemes.  Parallel importation is the importation from a European Union, EU, member state or a country within the European Economic Area, EEA, of a medicinal product which is essentially similar to a product already authorised in Ireland, by an importer who is someone other than the importer appointed by the marketing authorisation holder of the product on the Irish market.  The parallel trade of medicinal products is based on the principle of the free movement of goods within the Internal Market of the EU.  It was never the intention to exclude such products and any such inference would be contrary to free trade principles.</p><p>For the information of the Senators I would point out that the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill noted that "Allowing reimbursement of certain over-the-counter medicines under the GMS and community drug schemes will give rise to some additional cost from loss of prescription charges over time, but this is not expected to be significant."  However, this is not correct.  My officials have confirmed that there are in fact no additional costs arising from the amendments proposed in Part 4.</p><p>Part 5 of this Bill holds a particular interest for me in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion.  It seeks to amend the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015, which is a significant tobacco control measure.  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the former Minister for Health, now Senator, James Reilly in enacting this important public health legislation.  I know that introducing this legislation is of great importance to Senator Reilly and I assure him and all the Senators of my commitment and that of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensuring this legislation is commenced fully in the near future.</p><p>The aim of the legislation is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers; make health warnings more prominent and prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco.  It gives effect to Ireland's obligations under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  Standardised packaging of tobacco is Ireland's next step towards creating a tobacco-free Ireland.  Evidence indicates that tobacco packaging is a critically important form of promotion.  This is more relevant in Ireland, where we have comprehensive advertising and marketing restrictions.  We know that branding works, particularly on children.  If the tobacco industry did not addict our children, its industry would disappear within a generation.  Given that 78% of smokers in a survey said they started smoking before they reached the age of 18, it is clear that our children are targeted to replace those consumers who die or quit.</p><p>The amendments to the 2015 Act put forward in this Bill are of a technical and practical nature and some seek to provide basic information to the consumer.  These amendments will permit the following elements to be included on tobacco retail packaging: text to indicate the type and weight or number of tobacco products contained in the packet; the inclusion of a tab to allow consumers to reseal the pack excluding cigarette packs; the inclusion of a calibration mark, which may be necessary for the automated production of the packaging; contact details of the manufacturer and additional information on cigar bands.  The amendments also set out new transitional times to reflect the time that has elapsed since this Bill was initiated in the D&aacute;il.  The original timeframe for the manufacture of the new standardised packaging from 20 May 2016 has now passed.  The approach taken in the Bill is in line with the original intention of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015.  It is my intention to give key stakeholders, including the tobacco industry, adequate notice of the commencement date referred to in the Bill.  The amendments set out in this Bill will enable Ireland to proceed with the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products.  The objective of this measure and many other tobacco control measures is of course to dissuade people from starting to smoke, to encourage current smokers to quit and ultimately to save lives.  It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption in Ireland and not one measure in isolation.  All of the measures outlined in our tobacco policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, will have a role in reducing the prevalence of smoking in Ireland.</p><p>This Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill serves to make important changes to four Acts in the interests of equity or, in some cases, patient safety and of course the tobacco legislation is to help protect public health.  I hope Senators will give their support to the Bill.  I therefore commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I welcome the amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, which underpins the fair deal scheme, to exclude <i>ex gratia</i>payments to patients of the Lourdes Hospital redress scheme, the Lourdes Hospital payment scheme, the symphysiotomy payment scheme and schemes for individuals disabled by thalidomide, as well as the Magdalen laundry redress scheme that was catered for in a previous Act in 2009.</p><p>Separately I acknowledge the importance of including several over-the-counter medications under the general medical service, GMS, scheme for people with medical and long-term illness cards.  It includes nicotine replacement therapy and emergency contraception.  Unfortunately, however, prescription charges are not covered in this legislation and as we are all aware, prescription charges have increased in recent years from 50 cent per item to &euro;2.50 per item.  I believe this sole action discriminates against elderly patients who have many core mobility issues and are on multiple drugs but not of their own free will.  I have always advocated a flat prescription fee or, ideally, no prescription fee should be put in place because in that way people who are vulnerable will not be jeopardised.  This charge diminishes the quality of life of elderly citizens.  As for the nicotine replacement therapy, it is worth remembering that there are almost 31,000 hospital admissions per year for cigarette-related illnesses in this country at a cost of &euro;5,400 per admission.  This equates to a staggering &euro;164 million per year.  To put this in perspective, the Minister afforded &euro;40 million to the winter initiative. </p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the introduction of legislation to allow the Minister to make regulations to add certain elements to tobacco packaging and we published our legislation on this issue in 2012.  Cigarette companies use marketing techniques to deliberately target young people.  The Marlboro brand, identified by its iconic red chevron, is worth $21 billion, which is truly staggering.  </p><p>In September 2015 the Seanad passed a Second Stage reading of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, the Longer Healthy Living Bill, introduced by the Independent Senator, Professor John Crown.  The Bill was supported through Second Stage by Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Labour, Fine Gael and the Independent benches.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, did not oppose it and highlighted a few suggestions including minor technical changes to improve it.  During that debate the Minister stated &quot;In terms of recruitment, there is an international shortage of consultants, doctors and nurses.&quot;  I have been examining the retirement of key personnel in the health service.  It has now reached the point where significant changes are required.  There are too many times when critical professionals within the health services are forced to retire due to their age and for no other reason.  Our current health system is embattled by staff shortages, shortage of senior consultants, not enough general practitioners and a dearth of highly qualified specialist nursing staff.  As Professor Crown said during the debate &quot;Are we so flush with trained, experienced staff that we can afford to offload them involuntarily?&quot;  Since being elected to the Seanad I have engaged widely on this topic and while it does not address conditions, pay or otherwise, it is an evidence-based solution to an ever increasing problem.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is my intention to submit extensive amendments on Committee Stage which will be designed to allow health professionals to postpone their retirement with the mutual agreement of their respective employers in the HSE, organisations funded directly by it, the Department of Health and all other major health service providers.

I am seeking to incorporate them into the amendments I will be tabling on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#R00200"><p>As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill amends several Acts, including the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015.</p> <p>Like my colleague, I welcome the amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and its application to persons who have received compensation awards under the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, the Lourdes hospital redress board scheme and the Lourdes hospital payment scheme, as well as payments made to survivors of thalidomide.  A small number of people, around 600, benefited from these schemes.  In the case of a recipient who is over 70 years and has these moneys on deposit, will they be taken into account when calculating his or her entitlement to a medical card?  I have recently come across cases of pensioners over 70 years who may have a pension of &euro;450 per week but who may have more requirements, whether it be for medical or other care.</p> <p>An old structure is in place for determining what interest a person is deemed to have earned on such moneys.  We all know that the interest one earns on deposits is now extremely small, but there has been no adjustment made for several years to take account of this.  I have encountered people who were not able to qualify for a medical card because of the interest they were deemed to be earning when, in fact, they were earning nothing.  Will the Minister of State examine this issue and incorporate it into the Bill?  I might be wrong, but it is my understanding the Bill does not deal with it.  Most of those who received compensation under the schemes in question are now over 70 years.  It is an issue to be examined from the point of view of entitlement to a medical card.</p> <p>On standardised packaging, it is important all tobacco products carry adequate health warnings.  The manufacturing industry raised its concerns with me about the date of operation.  The Minister of State clarified that the commencement date would be set in a statutory instrument or regulation as opposed to being the date the Bill was passed.  The industry has a lead-in time for the production of packaging and will require additional time.  The Minister of State has clarified the issue.</p> <p>It is important that every aspect of advising people of the risks of smoking be outlined clearly.  Every week we come across cases of people with an illness or cancer as a direct result of smoking for a long time.  A significant number of people commence smoking before they reach the age of 18 years.  While it is more difficult to encourage smokers to stop, it is only right that we discourage people, particularly younger people, from taking it up.  For several years there has been an increase in the number of young girls who are smoking.  While it may have levelled off, it needs to be monitored to ensure the legislation put in place and the information made available has an effect.</p> <p>On the prescription charge which medical card patients must pay, it was introduced at a time when people in Ireland were consuming more medication per head of population than in any other European country.  In 2000 the State&rsquo;s annual bill for medications was &euro;500 million; it is now over &euro;2 billion.  There may be cases of people receiving medication under the medical card scheme and not using them.  It might be interesting for the Department or the HSE to carry out some research on the effect of the prescription charge in the acquiring of medication.  From what I understand, it has had an effect.  Should the limit be increased to take into account the fact that older people require more support?  More research needs to carried out.  We need to get the message across that drugs should be used effectively.  Will we end up in a situation several years from now where, no matter what drug is prescribed, they will have no medical effect?  It is a growing problem, particularly in the United States.</p> <p>I welcome the legislation as it amends key legislative provisions.  It is important that it be progressed to ensure it will come into effect as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#R00300"><p>I welcome the Bill on several fronts.  Obviously, the most important aspect of it is the Part which refers to the plain packaging of tobacco and the potential health benefits this amendment can deliver.  Ireland has been a world leader in enacting progressive legislation to reduce tobacco consumption.  This is certainly another measure that will continue that strategy.</p> <p>This legislation has been called for by many public health organisations for many years, including the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and ASH Ireland, among others.  Sinn F&eacute;in gives its absolute support to the legislation.  Its wish is for it to pass through the House and be signed into law without delay.  We are all too aware of how intensively the unscrupulous global tobacco companies lobby to protect their interests.  It is admirable that such a firm line has been and is being taken by the Government to enact this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It would be remiss of me, however, when talking about this issue not to reference another extremely important public health Act that is currently working its way through this House and hopefully will come before us soon, namely, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  The same firm and principled line needs to be taken in respect of the intrusive lobby being instigated by global alcohol firms.  We have been world leaders in advancing progressive public health legislation to reduce tobacco consumption.  Let us treat the alcohol industry in the same manner in the interest of our health and the health of our future generations.  The Minister of State will have Sinn F&eacute;in's firm support in this manner in both instances. </p><p>Getting back to standardised packaging, I see it as imperative that we deal with this legislation in as timely a fashion as possible.  Plain packaging is shown to reduce the appeal of tobacco products, increase the effectiveness of health warnings, reduce the ability of profiteering companies to mislead the public about the effects of smoking and bring consumption down.  It also ties in with the idea of visibility in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  We know young children can name the brands of popular beer, with this measure they would hopefully not be able to recognise the name of the most popular brands of cigarettes.</p><p>One of the biggest threats to this type of legislation and indeed the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 is the possible ratification of global trade deals such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, by this Government.  Little thought is given to the ramifications that this legislation can embed.  I specifically refer to the international state dispute mechanism, ISDS, contained as part of these deals.  Provision is given to global companies to sue governments when, in their greedy eyes, inhibitive legislation prevents them making profit.  These deals are wrong, against public interest and should be resisted by all well meaning parties to put people and our society first.  Sinn F&eacute;in will certainly continue to lead the fight against these backroom deals and keep informing the public of their ills. </p><p>With relation to the general medical services scheme, GMS, and prescriptions aspects of the Bill, I would first like to outline Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s firm recognition of the importance of ensuring that over-the-counter medicines continue to be available under the GMS and community drug schemes.  Public health and affordability of such medicines is our primary objective.  Prescription fees continue to push many ill citizens beyond the poverty barrier and leave them choosing between essential food on the table or accessing their medicines.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see these fees abolished in full over a measured timeframe.  In the meantime, some medicines that are currently dispensed on a prescription basis could be switched to a non-prescription basis.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, regulates these medicines and we would again request this authority to review which drugs could be transferred to a non-prescription footing.  This would immediately cease fees on certain medicines for struggling families and individuals.</p><p>I would urge a certain caution, however, in the whole area of prescription and non-prescription drugs.  This week RTE aired an extremely thought-provoking documentary on over-the-counter drug consumption.  I am particularly cognisant of prescriptions for persons who present to GPs with mental health issues.  At recent dual diagnosis conferences, held throughout the Thirty-two Counties and hosted by Sinn F&eacute;in, I was taken by the comments from the consultant psychiatrist in the HSE.  What he said is well known, and we need to educate people about this.  He said that short-term prescriptions work, but in the long-term they will do more damage and become addictive.  Education is the key here and we need to roll that out nationwide.  We should always remember that drugs, prescription or otherwise, are poisons and their overuse will have detrimental health repercussions.  </p><p>The fair deal scheme has had public attention recently for all the wrong reasons.  In my health statement last week I referred to the comments of the senior HSE management towards elderly patients, suggesting that they were taking up hospital beds to protect their finances, and I again want to outline my disgust at this uncompassionate and untrue statement.  Getting away from that, the exclusion of funds received through the Magdalen laundries, Lourdes hospital and symphysiotomy schemes as financial means for accessing nursing home care is extremely welcome.  It is a caring, compassionate and, dare I say, republican thing to do.  It is the right thing to do for citizens who have suffered so much in our past.</p><p>As a party which promotes the interests of workers' rights, we absolutely respect the right to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  Therefore, we do not have any issue with board members of the HPRA receiving remuneration for work carried out on behalf of the authority.  We would just ask that in light of many controversies uncovered over recent years with public agency bodies and funds, transparent oversight procedures are put in place to manage the payment of such moneys.  I acknowledge also that one person, one salary will apply and that approximately half of the existing members would be subject to this principle.</p><p>To conclude, certainly from my viewpoint, the most important change as part of this legislation is the plain packaging of tobacco products.  I would like us to follow the strategy of Finland which recently announced that it aims to have the country tobacco free by 2040.  The Minister of State has said a generation, which I believe is approximately 25 years, but it could happen in a generation if we put our minds to it.  This would require further measures similar to those in Finland, such as increasing the price, introducing licences with a cost for sellers, banning of advertising, health promotion measures and limiting the public spaces and areas where smoking can take place.  I know the Minister of State will be taking on the wrath of more corporations and probably thinks there is enough to do with the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, but she will be practised and well-rehearsed at that, so I encourage her to go for it.</p><p>My final words will be on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  It is the next public health measure that we need to emphasise to improve our nation's health.  I again encourage all Senators in this House to do what is right by the people and not what is right for the corporate interest.  I applaud the Minister of State.  Go raibh maith agat. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commend the legislation, which we are very supportive of.  It addresses a number of important key issues.  I particularly welcome the measures taken in respect of those who have been identified under the thalidomide scheme, the Lourdes hospital payments scheme, the symphysiotomy scheme and of women who were residents of certain institutions.  I have a number of concerns about the symphysiotomy scheme overall and how it has been administered but that is not a matter for today.</p> <p>Today we should recognise a positive gesture in terms of access to the fair deal scheme.  There are, however, two wider issues that need to be pointed out.  First, what measures or information schemes are there to ensure people are made aware of this measure and aware of some of the other specific things included and covered in their scheme?  I know there has been concern in the past about women who have been eligible for previous schemes and who are now living abroad but who may potentially be thinking about returning to Ireland to retire.  Many such women and their families may be currently resident in the UK and elsewhere.  What plans are there to ensure awareness of this measure and of the other supports and social protection provisions that can be accessed by such women?</p> <p>I would also really like to point out that, while this Bill identifies specific schemes, we need to look to a wider principle.  Over the next year I hope to work with others across the House to consider some of the wider principles of redress and how we engage in redress or restorative justice for institutional violence or wrongs of various forms.  This Bill is an example of the kind of good practice that we would want to include in that, along with other important principles, such as really re-examining the use of waivers as we currently have them and the principle of first person testimony and how it is reflected.  I welcome this very much.</p> <p>I welcome discussion on the pricing and supply of medical goods.  Particular concern has been highlighted with regard to the morning after pill and emergency contraception.  I am aware that it is something the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Kate O'Connell, has raised and championed at various points.  As a pharmacist, she understands the issue very well.  I am also aware that there are groups, including a very good and vibrant campaigning group called Real-Productive Health, which have really sought to put this on the agenda.  I may table amendments to the Bill to move this issue a little further along, but I am not sure if I will.  The Minister of State spoke to it earlier, but could she clarify exactly if it is now the case that over-the-counter drugs will definitely be available without a prescription to medical card holders?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While it is available without a prescription, I suggest that medical card holders would be able to get it on the medical card scheme without a doctor's prescription.  Obtaining a doctor's prescription is a considerable problem with a time-sensitive issue and requires securing a doctor's appointment and getting the consultation.  It causes serious concern and with respect, I suggest that the fact that 12,000 people may have used it and achieved a prescription is not an indication that there are no obstacles.  We only know that 12,000 people have got a prescription.  We do not know how many may have found themselves delayed from accessing it, whether it was 5,000, 4,000 or 10,000, and because of our laws in other areas we do not know what the consequences might be and we have no way of measuring those who did not access emergency contraception and who dealt with the consequences of that in whatever way.  That is information we do not have.</p><p>Many, including me, believe there are real problems with the conscientious objection clause as it is currently operating where pharmacists are concerned.  As the Minister of State rightly said, this is the pharmaceutical industry's own administration.  It is something which we have lobbied them about in the past.  There are concerns which relate to the State, including whether the alternate provisions, which are being recommended by those pharmacists who are exercising that objection, are adequate.  Perhaps we need to have an examination of whether alternate provisions are feasible.  In rural areas, do they reflect the transport constraints, particularly on weekends?</p><p>Another concern I have in that regard arises on Sundays in rural areas in particular.  While pharmacists have a Sunday rota in some parts of the country to ensure a pharmacist is always available, that is not the case in other parts of the country.  This is something on which I might consider an amendment or the Minister of State might tell me of other ways in which the introduction of a Sunday rota system might be addressed.  Again, I would like to welcome that and seek a little more clarification on how the Minister of State envisages this fitting in with the other provisions mentioned that are being considered by the Minister, Deputy Harris, to increase and support access to these vital and time-sensitive measures.</p><p>My last point is on the regulation and setting of a standardised maximum price.  We know that with emergency contraception, the price of the same drug can vary from &euro;25 up to &euro;70.  These are amounts which are not readily available to many of our citizens and certainly not necessarily readily available within a matter of hours.  The Minister of State might let us know what she is thinking in terms of the standardised maximum pricing and how to address the case of medical card holders.</p><p>I want to echo others in giving my full-hearted support - and I believe that of the rest of our group - to plain packaging and these important measures on plain packaging.  I again raise the question, as others have, of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 as the matter of plain packaging underscores the question of the power of suggestion, advertisement and visibility.  It is a reminder to us that persistent suggestion, which we have in many cases in our lives, including the easy visibility of alcohol products in spaces such as grocery stores, is an issue and a concern.  It underscores all the evidence which shows the power of that suggestion and I will conclude by stating I support it.  We also will provide strong support to the Minister of State on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  I urge that we move expeditiously through this because I share the same concerns regarding the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.  If we move towards its full implementation, we will leave ourselves open and regulation is now imperative because unfortunately, new regulation will face new obstacles and new threats in the future.</p></speech>

I refer to and agree with the point Senator Colm Burke raised on prescription drug costs and the charge being allocated or ascribed to medical card patients.  At a time when our population is getting older, is living longer and is in need of more complex and varied health care and medical intervention and given the economy is now more prosperous, through her good offices with the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Minister of State might consider how we could improve this section because Senator Burke is right.  While the issue of over the counter and prescription drugs was raised on "Prime Time", we did not need such a programme to know we probably are a nation that is oversubscribing to prescriptions and to painkillers.  That is a matter on which we also might have a debate in the House in order that we can have a holistic approach to it.</p> <p>I wish to speak today on the issue of health promotion.  There is an expectation and a view taken by some that it is up to the State or others to bring about behavioural change, be that in tackling obesity, on the issue of tobacco or on the issue of alcohol.  There is a combined approach to be taken by the individual person in tandem with family, community, Government and so on.  I note "Operation Transformation" is appearing on our television screens at present.  As the Minister of State noted in her contribution, it provides a six-week window in which people focus on changing bad diets.  It is not a fad or a six-week programme but is a life-changing experience that we need to promote and pursue.  We have seen the significant impact that Tobacco Free Ireland has brought and I refer to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's smoking ban, Senator James Reilly's banning of smoking in cars and in playgrounds and the overarching plain packaging proposals to make Ireland tobacco free.</p> <p>I listened to Senator Devine speaking about powerful industry lobbyists.  I assure her that as a Member of this Seanad and a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, industry does not play any role in how I make my decision.</p></speech>

I hope that Bill will return and will be passed.  As a nation, we have a relationship with alcohol that needs to be changed and addressed.  There is the issue of the price of alcohol and we all support minimum unit pricing.  At least I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will support it since they had a minority report in the report from the Joint Committee on Health and Children two years ago.  There is the issue of how we make alcohol available, price it and promote it.  We also have an issue with availability.  The abolition of the groceries order by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was a huge mistake because alcohol is now to be found in shops, petrol stations and forecourts.  I visited the United States before Christmas and in certain states, one could walk into supermarkets with no alcohol in them, which is good.  Obviously we are not going to go back to that but I am just making the point.</p> <p>The other point we need to consider, which is arising frequently in my office is the issue of the fair deal scheme and how we can make it accessible.  If we can tweak it any more, it would be important to do that.  As a former Chairman of the Committee on Health and Children, I had the huge pleasure - I use that word deliberately - of dealing with the Irish Medicines Board, now the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  The people who worked there and who appeared before our committee were of the highest calibre.</p> <p>I listened to Senator Higgins's remarks on the whole issue of regulation.  We need regulation and to have a robust, strict regulatory regime regarding medicines and medical devices.  That is my worry in the context of the new regime in America and the new President.  If one listens back to his remarks with leaders of business, he spoke about the cost of medicine the other day at a press briefing.  We cannot allow a situation to happen where regulation is diminished in the areas of medicines, products and devices.  The Minister of State is doing a wonderful job and is really setting a high standard for other Ministers in terms of health promotion.  I will make one final appeal on the issue of vaccination and vaccines.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a nation, we need to be proactive, whether it is on the flu jab, the HPV vaccine or whatever.

Cuireann m&eacute; f&eacute;in agus Sinn F&eacute;in f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo, go h&aacute;irithe na for&aacute;lacha a bhaineann le pac&aacute;isti&uacute; tobac.

While this is welcome legislation, it is clear more legislation is required to tackle the worst of our health problems.  I note there are six distinct parts of this Bill, many of which are designed to close off loopholes or remedy anomalies in the system at present.  Unfortunately, there are many other anomalies in the working out of health services, which need to be addressed.  Perhaps it is something that will be taken on board through the next Stages of the Bill.</p> <p>One such anomaly is the issue in the west where people presenting with acute alcoholism are not entitled to care based on that alone.  GPs are no longer able to refer patients with an alcohol addiction to the HSE services unless they have been diagnosed with a co-morbid mental health illness.  This meant that over Christmas, people were being turned away from the present services, which is a totally unsatisfactory situation.  This was communicated before Christmas in a HSE west e-mail to the service providers.  Galway has a population of 75,000 people but only one full-time and one part-time counsellor for adult problem drinkers.  Waterford, in comparison, has a population of 47,000 but five counsellors for drinkers, as well as one outreach worker and a number of other personnel.</p> <p>Turning to the hospital situation, a sick relative of Sinn F&eacute;in Councillor Gabriel Cronnelly was admitted to University Hospital Galway, UHG, over the weekend.  He was admitted on Friday evening with an illness and was not placed in a bed until 9.30 p.m. on Saturday evening.  At the same time, there were 43 people on trolleys in the same hospital.  I take on board what has been said about health awareness and making people aware of the situation but the fact of the matter is the primary health care services are in dire need of more resources in areas like Connemara.  Those primary health care centres need to be fully staffed and rolled out properly.  Cuts are being experienced to basic services such as that of the physiotherapist in Connemara, who has not been replaced.  People are being brought into the acute system because of issues in the primary care system.  </p> <p>I attended the hospital in Galway recently for a minor situation and the staff there were absolutely brilliant.  Without the professionalism and compassion of the hospital staff who do their utmost to put patients on trolleys at ease as best they can, there would be a revolution.  As of this morning, there are 35 people on trolleys in the same hospital.  Doctors and nurses are not only holding the health service together, they are effectively ameliorating the worst effects of Government neglect through their care.  This is something we need to come back to.  I call on the Minister of State to implore the senior Minister to have a look at the hospital situation in Galway.  I have stated a feasibility study is needed into the need for a new hospital-----</p></speech>

UHG has lists of more than 30,000 outpatients awaiting appointments, of whom 4,700 or more have been waiting for more than 12 months.</p> <p>I have another issue, which I am not sure can be addressed in this Bill, but is something the Minister of State might consider.  I understand there is a working group on the fair deal programme, which is looking at an issue that particularly affects farmers.  The Minister of State is from an agricultural background and is very aware of farming issues.  Assets of the farm are being used in the calculation of the fair deal package.  It was raised with me yesterday at the farmer's protest that a working group is supposed to be looking into this and coming up with a solution.  Perhaps this miscellaneous provisions Bill will be an opportunity to address this anomaly and the Minister of State might revert to us and let us know whether that working group has come to a conclusion on how to address those issues.  It would seem to be the right thing to do because there are reports that farmers' land is causing an issue where it is not really an asset when they are running a farm at a loss.  It is an issue of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  There was also a highly insulting claim about this issue in an internal e-mail that farming families were leaving relatives on hospital beds to avoid any financial penalties they may suffer under the fair deal scheme.  I hope that reported action will happen and that this anomaly can be remedied.  Let us not forget the average farm family income is &euro;26,000.  </p> <p>I welcome the drug reimbursement aspect of the Bill.  I draw attention to the fact that the HSE has failed to reach an agreement on the Orkambi drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  An initial figure offered by the drugs company Vertex was &euro;159,000 per patient.  The HSE estimated this would cost the State &euro;400 million over three years.  This is obviously a big figure and we hope this can be resolved.  The Minister of State should take on board some of my suggestions.  It might be something the Minister of State can address in the Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister of State takes the suggestions I am making in a positive light and will come back to us on Committee Stage with any suggestions she has.  </p></speech>

The provisions in this Bill will allay the fears of the recipients of the <i>ex gratia</i>awards that have been approved by Government.  It would be most unfair if people who receive such an award were then disadvantaged in their financial assessment for support under the nursing home support scheme by virtue of receiving an award.  I hope this will give peace of mind to the individuals concerned and their families.</p><p>Some raised the question regarding medical cards.  The Bill today makes proposals on the amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 or the fair deal scheme and accordingly it does not relate to the eligibility for medical cards.  I assure Senators that where questions have been asked that were not relevant to the Bill, I will bring the message to the Minister and the Health Service Executive, which is the relevant body, and we can ensure Senators' opinions are carried to the right areas.  On the issue of support for accessing services by women who have had a symphysiotomy, services for them are facilitated by symphysiotomy liaison officers, who are based around the country and the provision of a medical card is included in that.  I hope that provides some clarity.  </p><p>With regard to public health, it is important to remind ourselves why tobacco control measures like this one are so important.  A total of 23% of Irish people are daily and occasional smokers and 8% of our ten to 17 year olds smoke.  While the reduction in these figures over the past number of years is significant and welcome, we are a long way from reaching our 5% prevalence rate set out in our Tobacco Free Ireland policy.  Nearly 6,000 Irish people are killed annually by smoking.  The human cost of smoking in Ireland today is overwhelming.  In the Tobacco Free Ireland policy, we aim to be tobacco free by 2020.  The minimum rate is a 5% prevalence rate, which is set out in that policy.</p><p>Less important but still significant is the economic cost of smoking in Ireland.  Annual health care costs associated with it are &euro;506 million; lost productivity costs are &euro;1 billion and the cost of litter associated with smoking is &euro;69 million.  This economic assessment undertaken on behalf of the Department of Health also estimates the costs associated with the deterioration in an individual's ability to live a full life.  The value of loss associated with this deterioration has been estimated as being more than &euro;9 billion annually.  These costs are very significant and show how reducing smoking in Ireland can both improve the health and well-being of the people and reduce the cost to taxpayers in dealing with the impact of smoking in the longer term.  While work must continue on reducing smoking rates, we can be proud of what we have achieved over the past couple of decades.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I refer to such measures as the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in 2004, the ban on point-of-sale display and advertising in 2009, picture warnings in 2013 and the ban on smoking in cars in which children were present in 2016.  These measures have contributed to increasing awareness and reducing the harm caused in Ireland by tobacco, but we will not and cannot stop there.  Standardised packaging is the subject of one of a number of recommendations set out in Tobacco Free Ireland.  I am committed to ensuring we will continue to implement this policy to ensure our children and our children's children will get to experience a tobacco-free Ireland.  I ask all Senators to support not only the standardised packaging measure being discussed but all future tobacco control measures implemented by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and me.</p><p>The provision included in the Bill to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 is also intended to benefit the health of the population.  It provides that, when considered appropriate in the interests of patient safety or public health, over-the-counter medicines can continue to be reimbursed for medical card holders after May 2018.  This means that products such as nicotine replacement products and emergency contraception can continue to be provided under the medical card scheme.  The amendment to the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995 will allow the payment of fees to members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority in line with the arrangements made in other boards in order to continue to attract experts of the highest calibre to apply for board membership at no additional cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions on Second Stage and look forward to further constructive examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I reiterate that the relevant points that will not be dealt with in this legislation will be taken on board and conveyed to the Minister and the Health Service Executive.</p></speech>

I am seeking to address this concern in amendment No. 2, which clarifies beyond doubt the intention that the controller must keep records of all knowledge development box, KDB, applications received, issued, refused and reviewed.  The only discretion available to the controller relates to the form and manner in which records will be kept.  For example, they may be kept in hard copy or electronically.  I trust that this amendment facilitates the withdrawal of amendment No. 3 in the names of Senators Mac Lochlainn and Devine.  When Senator Mac Lochlainn raised this issue on Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, said she would seek clarification and come back to the House with an amendment to ensure all records must be kept.

The effect of amendment No. 4 will be to replace the existing section 18 of the Bill in its entirety.  This amendment and amendment No. 18, which amends section 103 of the 1992 Act, deal comprehensively with the reporting requirements on the controller under all enactments under his supervision.</p> <p>Senators will recall that during the Committee Stage debate on this Bill, concerns were raised that the controller's annual report will be submitted to the Minister only.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, indicated in response that she would introduce an amendment to ensure the wider circulation of the controller's annual report on KDB activities.  The effect of amendments Nos. 4 and 18, which align all the controller's annual reporting requirements, will be to ensure the Bill provides for the controller's annual report on KDB activities to be submitted to the Minister in the first instance.  Importantly, the Minister in turn will lay the report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe these amendments address the concerns behind amendment No. 5, in the names of Senators Mac Lochlainn and Devine, and amendment No. 10, in names of Senators Higgins and Black.</p></speech>

I recognise that amendment No. 2 was introduced in recognition of the valid points that were made by Senator Mac Lochlainn on Committee Stage regarding the importance of keeping records.  I appreciate that there was some recognition of that.  I recognise that amendments have been proposed in a few areas of this Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for that.</p> <p>I am concerned about one aspect of amendment No. 4.  I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the key changes he is making in this amendment.  How does he consider that they are addressing the concerns we raised on Second and Committee Stages?  As I see it, the key change is that the KDB report: "shall include statistical information in a form, and regarding such matters, as the Minister may direct".  Does the Minister of State believe this provision will address the geographical and regional distribution question that was raised by many Senators on Second and Committee Stages and which is the subject of amendment No. 9 in my name?</p> <p>I have also tabled amendment No. 10, which proposes that the KDB report will include: "such general information as to the operation of the scheme as may be appropriate or relevant".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Minister of State indicate how he sees his amendment will address the concerns of amendments Nos. 9 and 10?</p><p>Does the Minister of State believe the statistical information could cover amendment No. 7 also?  Amendment No. 7 reflects the fact that, under our patents regulation, when they are filed, they are categorised.  There is an extraordinarily detailed set of categories in the national report in respect of patents.  We may not necessarily need to take on board those same categorisations but what I am attempting to do in amendment No. 7 is to ensure information is collected as to the sectors.  If pharmaceuticals or medical devices are key areas of growth or if we are looking for innovation in food production, it would be useful and necessary if the Minister knew research and development was taking place under those sectorial headings.  Nobody is looking for precise information as to the exact areas of innovation.  Instead, they want to know the areas in which research and development is taking place to ensure sectors prioritised by the State under the Action Plan for Jobs and other initiatives receive funding.  It would also ensure research priority areas in our higher education institutions are being complemented.  The amendment provides for the collection of useful information which can help in planning and providing the bigger picture as to what is happening in the State.  I have left it very wide as an amendment to allow it to be incorporated in the legislation, even in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 is also open in seeking figures in respect of the geographical or regional distribution of applications.  Today, the Government launched the Action Plan for Jobs.  One of its key points is regional distribution.  To grow business, as well as an active and vibrant economy leading to employment, we must ensure there is a regional distribution and an all-Ireland approach without parts of the country being left behind.  To ascertain whether the knowledge development box is proving to be complementary to that goal of regional action, it would be useful if we had geographical and regional information as to where research and development is taking place.</p><p>Those are two key points.  These are reasonable amendments.  I understand they may fall, so this is my opportunity to speak to them.  I apologise for speaking to them at some length.  Will the Minister of State clarify how he sees these specific points being addressed?  Does he see them falling under the remit of statistical information?  Will the statistical information the Minister will be able to direct or require be qualitative as well as quantitative?</p></speech>

Today, there was a presentation in the Oireachtas on innovation hubs in different parts of Ireland.  The problem is when reduced corporation tax and responsibility is introduced.  We have seen where this has, unfortunately, been abused in the past with loopholes emerging.  The taxpayer and the citizen want to see the maximum level of accountability on this matter.</p> <p>Coming from the regions, the Minister of State will appreciate that balanced regional development is a significant issue for people from there.  When significant tax incentives are given to companies, we must ensure the benefits and job creation are spread geographically across the State.  In fairness, the Government&rsquo;s amendments show it has listened to the concerns expressed on Committee Stage and has attempted to address the issues raised.</p> <p>The wording, however, in amendment No. 4 is too vague.  It states, &ldquo;The KDB report shall include statistical information in a form, and regarding such matters, as the Minister may direct.&rdquo;  On the last day we debated this, the Minister stated the Government did not want to give away some of the sensitive commercial information about some of the companies applying.  Accordingly, one might not want to give a specific address, for example.  However, if one used one&rsquo;s imagination, there is a way of identifying how this incentive benefits the region without giving away sensitive commercial information.  It has not happened.</p> <p>Our core concern has not been addressed and I cannot support the amendment.  It is too vague and will not give us the information we require.  If the Minister of State indicates he would be willing to address this issue in the D&aacute;il to ensure statistical information is provided which clearly demonstrates how this incentive will be availed of across the regions, we could look at that measure.  However, if no such guarantee is made, unfortunately, we cannot support this amendment.</p></speech>

(1) The Minister shall, as part of the annual Budget process, produce a report on the operation of the KDB including a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and its impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate for corporations.<br /><br />(2) The Minister shall ensure appropriate annual information exchange between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate the publication of information on the cost of this initiative, including the cost to date for the Exchequer in revenues forgone, as part of the annual budgetary process.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The Minister did not get a chance to answer my questions about the meaning of amendment No. 4 which is now part of the Bill, but I am sure he will do so at the next opportunity he gets.</p><p>These amendments contain two different sets of proposals.  Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 are variations.  In all these amendments I have tried to put forward several variations.  The Department met me to discuss these matters, which I appreciate.  Would the Minister consider whether there is any version of these amendments he could take on board?  The amendments are in respect of the annual budgetary process.  We know that tax measures such as the certificate issued to companies which allows them pay 6.25% on research and development versus 12.5% has potentially a high value but is also a significant cost to the Exchequer.  It is very important for us to have information about the cost of the knowledge development box.  The figures are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>In amendment No. 13 I ask that &quot;The Minister shall ensure appropriate annual information exchange between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate&quot; our having specific &quot;information on the cost of this initiative&quot;.  I understand that the cost-benefit analysis may take place within the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners but in this amendment I ask that the Minister ensure the exchange of information happens and is made publicly available as part of the annual budgetary process to enable us to assess the cost of the knowledge development box certificate, whether it is &euro;20 million, &euro;200 million or &euro;2 billion, and rank that and set it against other measures we may wish to consider and their potential cost-benefit outcome.  My colleague and I, for example, support the idea that we need to invest in third level and research institutions, particularly the institutes of technology which are very underfunded for research.  We may wish to support greater partnership for innovation in those areas, especially at a key moment of opportunity and change in the world of higher education globally.  This is to ensure we, and all those who support the knowledge development box, can stand over the value it gives and its cost when we make budgetary decisions.</p><p>One of my amendments concerns the information exchange and the other refers to a report, but I would be willing to withdraw that if necessary because I understand there is another report.  I recognise that in amendment No. 18 the Government is going some way towards a report but I am concerned that the amendment refers to accounts of moneys received and paid under this Act but does not cover revenues forgone in respect of the value of the tax reduction measures from 12.5% to 6.25%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are speaking ahead to amendment No. 18 but it relates very directly to this amendment.  If the Minister of State's interpretation of amendment No. 18 is to ensure we would have that information, it would make it easier for me not to press amendment No. 12.  </p><p>Amendment No. 11 is a combination of the two.  I am asking the Minister of State to indicate if he will support amendment No. 11, which includes both of these proposals, amendment No. 12 or amendment No. 13, which is a very mild amendment in terms of pure information exchange.</p><p>Amendment No. 14 is in respect of the report, which I acknowledge the Government has included in amendment No. 18.  It provides that the report would be presented to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and that it would be discussed at that committee.  That is a very useful and appropriate forum for scrutiny of it.  I am not demanding that we have full Oireachtas debate on this report annually but it is appropriate to have it discussed at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is not clear in amendment No. 18 if the report will include a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and the delivery of effective tax rates for corporations, which is an ongoing area of concern for the Government as it has made clear.  It is important, especially since we have sought and achieved OECD compatibility in terms of this measure, to ascertain how it relates to other measures and how we can ensure it becomes part of a wider standard-setting narrative in terms of all of our tax expenditure measures and pushing it forward.</p><p>The proposals in amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 are almost a separate topic.  I apologise for speaking at such length but the grouping of the amendments by the Bills Office requires it.  Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 are three variants of the same essential demand.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would indicate if he can support any of them.  I have tried to frame this as widely as possible to give as much scope and discretion to the Government in respect of it.  This is part of the Action Plan for Jobs, which we talked about earlier, and the fact that as a small nation we need a joined-up approach in what we do in the areas of enterprise and innovation.  We need to make sure that every major cog in the wheel, especially a cog that has potentially significant costs, such as the KDB, fits into the wider strategy and picture and the action plan and the kinds of measures the Government claims to be very committed to in the action plan.  If we have an absolute lacuna of knowledge of where a KDB fits in to things and if we do not have a joined-up approach, it is hard to track what is happening with our companies and with our investment in enterprise and innovation.  These amendments ask that any companies applying for the KDB certificate should indicate whether they are in receipt of other grants, subsidies, tax incentives or any similar enterprise or research and development supports from a public or semi-State body.  We are not asking for detail on what supports, where and how they were applied for or the amounts.  This is a very simple request to know whether they have received those supports in the past.  The second part asks that companies applying for such supports in the future and other enterprise and development supports would indicate if they had previously received a KDB certificate.  It is a two-way measure.  It is about joining the dots.  We want to know if companies receiving enterprise grants into which we are putting money are then going on to deliver research and development, thereby benefitting from the KDB.  It will be valuable to the Government to know whether companies that go to Enterprise Ireland or the IDA and move into a phase of production, for example a scaling up of operations, had previously benefitted from the KDB certificate.  It will strengthen the hands of anybody who wants to defend the KDB certificate if they can show a connection between companies whose research and development has been supported and the fact they are now being supported to move into a period of production.  To my mind, that information is very simple and valuable information that allows us to chart the route.  </p><p>The proposals in amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 are almost a separate topic.

We want to know if companies receiving enterprise grants, who we are putting money into, are then going on to deliver research and development, thereby benefitting from the KDB.  It will only be valuable to the Government to be able to know that if companies go to htEnterprise Ireland or the IDA and they move into a phase of production, for example a scaling up of operations, did those companies previously benefit from the KDB certificate.  It will certainly strengthen the hands of anybody who wants to defend the KDB certificate if they can show a connection between companies whose research and development has been supported and the fact they are now being supported to move into a period of production.  To my mind, that information is very simple and valuable information that allows us to chart the route.  </p><p>We have limited time on Report Stage.  I still have serious concerns about the end stage in our current trajectory for companies.  I have also mentioned this to the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, in respect of the 10% capital gains tax rate for those who are selling their companies.  I worry we are taking companies on a long journey and then encouraging a cash-out culture.  It is a kind of start-up to cash-out culture, which is a real danger.  If we want to encourage real innovation, not simply entrepreneurship and speculation, but entrepreneurship that is innovation, we need to encourage companies to move to production and grow.  That is the practice we should be rewarding and supporting.  Prizes for innovation have recently been won in Europe by long-established companies.  Skytek has been established since the 1990s and has now moved to a new phase of innovation.  Companies that are long-established are often also capable of innovation.  It is companies such as Skytek that are winning European innovation awards 20 and 30 years into their existence on this island.  They are the kinds of companies we need to be nurturing.  I worry that under the current regime, companies like Skytek could have been sold and would have been encouraged to be sold at an earlier stage and would not have reached the scale where they are now one of the main companies used by NASA and others.  That is a wider point.  </p><p>Information on the level or frequency of the intersection with the knowledge development box or the other enterprise or research development initiatives might be made available to the Minister.  I do not mean that it should be publicly available but it should be made available to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to inform overall jobs, enterprise and innovation strategies.  I am asking that the Minister will have the information he or she needs on where the overlap is between the many schemes administered in this country in respect of enterprise and innovation so that will inform the big picture and form part of a national strategy.</p><p>These are extremely reasonable amendments.  If there is a problem with the third part of that amendment, it is separated.  I would appreciate an indication from the Minister of State as to which of these amendments he wishes to support and in which form he wishes to support them.  I do not really see how there can be any case against having this information in a useful manner. </p></speech>

I commend Senator Higgins.  One of the primary responsibilities of legislators is to scrutinise legislation and strengthen accountability.  I cannot see how the Government can object to any of these amendments.  Regardless of the Government's position on Apple and other things that have come before, there is serious concern in Ireland, Europe and globally about how tax incentives materialised and how accountants who work for companies or corporations influence decision making and legislation.  The evidence is there internationally.  It is the responsibility of us in the Houses to be sure of the intent.  The intent to incentivise businesses looking at research and development to create jobs, which are very important to an economy, is good but the balance needs to be there.  The legislation, as it is presented, does not have that balance.  The legislation goes further than the original but the commitments are too vague.  Senator Higgins has done tremendous work in trying to ensure as much as possible that the intent of the legislation and the initiative achieves its objectives and that companies are using it well.</p> <p>I look forward to the Minister of State's response.  I assume he will support all of these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#HH00100"><p>Before I speak on amendments Nos. 11 to 18, inclusive, I wish to reassure Senator Higgins in light of the comments she has made.  One does not want to be too descriptive regarding the issues about which she spoke.  That is important.  If one is too descriptive, one confines oneself.  Two years down the road, things could be very different and different information could be needed.  In this regard, I draw her attention to the catch-all situation about which I have spoken and which is provided for in section 18(2).  Subsection (2) provides for the KDB Bill report to include information on such matters as the Minister may direct.  In addition, section 18(4)(h) provides for the KDB report to include such other statistical information as prescribed by the Minister.  I wish to allay fears about this because I know Senator Higgins has done much work on the Bill and has been in constant contact with the Department.</p><p>I move to amendments Nos. 11 to 17, inclusive, which are quite interesting.  I have listened to the rationale for the amendments tabled by Senators Higgins and Black but I do not propose to accept them.  I will explain why.  It might be useful to remind Senators of the intention behind the Bill.  The Bill proposes the introduction of the KDB certification scheme for SMEs.  The scheme is to be administered by the Patents Office.  The process before the office involves the examination of applications to ensure that the invention, the subject of the application, meets the criteria of being novel, non-obvious and useful.  At the end of this process, if the application meets these criteria, the office will grant a certificate.  If not, the office will not issue a certificate.  A certificate provides the gateway for SMEs to apply for the 6.25% corporate tax rate on profits arising from the invention.  Granting of a KDB certificate does not, however, guarantee that the SME will qualify for this lower rate of corporation tax.  The Revenue Commissioners will have to consider taxation returns on the basis of the provisions that apply to the KDB scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2015, which came into effect on 1 January 2016.  Revenue will, as always, have the ability to obtain the necessary information about the KDB to provide reliable information to the Government on the use of the KDB, including information on revenue forgone to the Exchequer.</p><p>I fully understand the Senators' desire to ensure ongoing monitoring and evaluation of existing schemes in the areas of research, enterprise and taxation.  This is necessary to protect taxpayers' money and ensure that new schemes introduced provide the State with value for money.  It is extremely important that we get value for money.  I assure the Senators that the process of monitoring and evaluating all our research, enterprise and taxation schemes is ongoing with regular reviews.  It must be as it is in the interest of taxpayers to have that transparency.  In the case of the KDB, I remind Senators that the report on the taxation expenditures published with the budget in October 2015 provides for an <i>ex ante</i>evaluation of the KDB scheme.  The evaluation outlines the basis of the best estimate of tax forgone of &euro;50 million.  The &euro;50 million is in respect of all aspects of the KDB, not just the certification scheme aimed at SMEs.</p><p>On 18 January, my Department published a report on the economic and enterprise impacts from public investment in research and development in Ireland.  The study presents evidence that points to a clear link between company engagement in research and development and stronger sales, exports and employment performance.  This includes both Irish and foreign-owned firms supported by our enterprise agencies.</p><p>I remind Senators that this is a good Bill because it will increase Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct investment, which is extremely important.  I have just come back from a two-day trade mission to Dubai this morning, and the interest in Ireland regarding foreign direct investment and the interest in our indigenous companies is second to none.  Research and development, which Senators have spoken about, is extremely important in every area because of the types of industries we have in Ireland, whether in med-tech, IT or whatever.  The Government is investing in research and development.  The Bill is important because it benefits our small businesses, about which Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke.  Small businesses are very important in his constituency in Donegal.  They are the backbone of the economy in rural Ireland.  Giving small businesses this access is extremely important because we must ensure that innovation is the top priority.  I have seen in my job that entrepreneurship is ripe.  If all these elements are in place - this Bill, the companies that come in, irrespective of where they come from - it will increase investment in the country.  What is also very important is that this will create jobs, which I think most Senators want.  I can go into a little more detail afterwards if Senators have further questions about this.</p></speech>

These rules apply to the knowledge development box.  The evaluation will take place within five years of the introduction of the scheme, and that is important for Senators.  I think it was a concern for Senator Higgins specifically.  It is also important to point out that the review of the overall KDB scheme will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>Regarding amendments Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, I remind Senators that the controller will publish annually information on the activities of the Patents Office regarding the KDB certification scheme.  This information will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will therefore be in the public domain, which is something about which I think Senators had concerns.  Revenue will therefore have access to the controller's report to the Minister.  The information, however, will be statistical and not financial in nature and will relate to the KDB certificates only.  Information on linkages with other tax measures and revenue foregone will not be known to the controller or the Minister.  Such matters are, I believe, the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>I move to amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive.  Given the nature of the process I have just described before the Patents Office, these amendments do not have any place in the Bill.  It is open to SMEs to avail of support and incentives that apply under various research and enterprise programmes.  As Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business, I fully encourage SMEs to avail of the available supports in place, build capacity and provide jobs, which is what we are talking about and which is very much central to the Bill.</p> <p>As I mentioned, evaluation of research and enterprise effectiveness occurs on an ongoing basis.  This is the appropriate manner in which to undertake such evaluations.  Requiring a company to indicate if it has ever received a grant subsidy or other support is part of the KDB certification scheme.  The amendments would add to the burden of such companies and would not add value.  The reality is that the focus should be solely on the project in front of the controller.  If the project is good enough, it will be approved on the evaluation of the controller.  The facts in front of the controller should be sufficient for him or her to decide if the project should get a patent and a certificate.  The less of that-----</p></speech>

Am I right in saying the Minister said that a cost-benefit analysis of the knowledge development box scheme would be considered within five years?  I wish to clarify if that is correct.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#JJ00100"><p>Perhaps the Minister could follow it up and indicate the current policy of the Government in terms of when it envisages carrying out that evaluation.  If it is in five years, that would be of concern.  I again point out there is a real concern about the commitment we have to equality budgeting and ensuring we know the cost-benefit balance to which we have committed.  Even the Government has committed to a two third to one third ratio, for example, in respect of expenditure, tax measures and so forth.  I presume that information will be made available annually, even if a full cost-benefit analysis takes longer.  I was concerned by that and would like clarification on it.  Obviously, we would need to know if, for example, the knowledge development box was to result in billions being taken out of the Exchequer, because that would be of high relevance to our annual budgeting process, both in terms of the ratio between expenditure and tax measures and the equality budgeting commitment.  That is important to clarify.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Department has come some way to meeting us and that it is putting forward the report.  Again, I would suggest that before this goes to the D&aacute;il, it may be good to give an indicative list.  Unfortunately, our group is not represented in the other House but I think it would be valuable to produce an indicative list of the kind of statistical information and other information the Minister would require or expect in that annual report.  It is certainly not comforting to me that the Government would regard it as excessive to have a simple test.  It could be as simple as a box to be ticked which states "Yes" or "No" with regard to whether a company has received previous expenditure measures.</p> <p>When we talk about jobs, we need to be rigorous.  I want jobs and I want this to translate into jobs.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, was very clear that this is for research and development and is not directly related to jobs, but that it is believed it has that outcome.  However, we are denying ourselves the evidence to show there is a link between the knowledge development box and the creation of employment.  If people go to Enterprise Ireland or the IDA and say they want to open a factory and produce a device, we currently have no way of knowing that the factory and that production has in any way benefited from the knowledge development box.  I know I will be told the knowledge development box has contributed to the creation of employment and enterprise, but I will be told it hypothetically and not based on evidence.  It is a bad sign if a company's commitment to research and development is so slight that the idea of ticking a box to indicate it previously received grants is too onerous or a disincentive, particularly given the supposed commitment to working with Enterprise Ireland and all the many robust and important benefits and systems we have to encourage companies to grow.  It is a very mild measure.</p> <p>I note for the record that when the Government seeks to defend the knowledge development box in the future by refusing these amendments, it has denied itself the evidence on that.  It will not be good enough to say research and development leads to jobs based on some figures from other countries when we have a significant research and development initiative that we are funding and subsidising from the Exchequer but we have not bothered to make a link between other areas of employment or enterprise and anything that leads to production or jobs.  The knowledge development box will be floating, separate from any joining of the dots with other enterprise measures.  Any Minister who says we believe the knowledge development box led to this or that employment has denied himself or herself the evidence for that.  The hypothetical will not be good enough in the future.</p> <p>It is unfortunate the Minister of State and the Department seem to be willing to deny themselves evidence for this important platform.  If we are serious about the economy, enterprise and innovation, we need to be serious about the evidence and about the measures.  We need to ensure the building blocks fit into each other and work together.  I want Ireland to be a centre for research, development and innovation, but to achieve that, we cannot simply be throwing pennies into a wishing well and accrediting good things that may or may not happen to the pennies we have thrown in the wishing well.  This is an important and simple proposal which would strengthen the hands of the Minister of State and future Ministers who support it.  I regret the Minister of State is not able to support the amendments, in particular any one of amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, which I believe are very reasonable.</p></speech>

They are doing a project as part of their placement in Stormont.  I am sure some of my colleagues would be interested in something similar happening in this Parliament.  I met the delegation earlier today.  I hope they enjoy their visit to Leinster House and that they will find some benefit from how this House and the Lower House work.  I call the Minister of State to respond.</p></speech>

Ireland is already a centre of excellence for innovation.  This is why Ireland has been so successful on the world stage and why entrepreneurship is alive and well.  This is why <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>has said Ireland is now the best centre in the EU for entrepreneurship.  That is something we should be very proud of.  It is that entrepreneurship and innovation which is driving jobs in the country at present.  The research and development that is ongoing, whether at indigenous company or multinational level, is extremely important.</p><p>This Bill will complement what we are all talking about.  We should keep talking up our country because we have a good thing to talk about.  Our reputation is enhanced all over the world, wherever we go.  We are the fastest growing economy in Europe.  Our unemployment figures have come down to 7.1% today and I believe they will continue to fall.  The 2017 Action Plan for Jobs was published this morning with the aim of creating 45,000 jobs this year.  This will be done through the innovative companies that continue to strive, even with the challenges and difficulties in the economy at present.</p><p>With regard to accountability, the Senator asked that the annual report would go before the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I suggest the proper place to scrutinise such things is the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach where there would be an opportunity to scrutinise it with the Minister for Finance, given this relates to taxation.</p><p>With regard to amendment No. 15, I reiterate that we are trying to cut down on red tape and bureaucracy.  We have to put faith in the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has vast experience.  It is only right that he would see what is on paper in front of him and make his evaluation on the information that is available.  Some of this information could be on that but it is important we keep it as tight as possible.</p></speech>

That is where I am coming from in this regard.  I hope this Bill will progress further because it is important legislation and it is an important part of the vision we have for Ireland.  We need to ensure we have more research and development and that we encourage more people to get into research and development, particularly in the patent and invention sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1398" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#MM00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I will be sharing time with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  I am pleased to move the Convictions for Certain Sexual Offences (Apology and Exoneration) Bill 2016.  Less than two years ago the people of this Republic came together and declared that all citizens should be treated equally no matter who they love.  On 23 May 2015 we became the first country in the world to allow same sex couples to marry.  That day we all reflected on how far we had come as a country and as a society.  We were also allowed a brief moment to pat ourselves on the back.  The world stood and watched the good news coming from Ireland beamed into their homes.  It was a powerful expression of who we now are; an open, free and tolerant country and people, able to celebrate and embrace the richness of human diversity.</p> <p>On that day I also thought of people who were gone; people who had passed on.  I thought of gay friends of mine who had passed away and who had not lived long enough to see that day of days.  I thought of those who, for the bulk if not all of their lives, were isolated, alienated, discriminated against, persecuted and, in some cases, prosecuted for being who they were and are.  I also thought of colleagues like Senator Norris, whose personal courage and, at times, sheer bloody-mindedness helped usher in legislative changes and changes in societal attitudes and opinions.  Senator Norris cannot be here today but I know that he is following this debate attentively.</p> <p>This State inherited from Britain the draconian laws we applied to sexual acts between consenting men.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a State, we applied and enforced those laws, with varying levels of enthusiasm, for decades.  It is impossible to be certain of the number of convictions that took place under what I have described as anachronistic legislation relating to acts of "gross indecency" and so on.  Such phrases are now, thankfully, in the past.  It is most likely that the numbers are in the high hundreds, perhaps more.  The point is not, ostensibly, the number of people convicted of offences but the chilling effect that the criminalisation of LGBT citizens had - the paralysing fear of being found out, always having to look over one's shoulder and having to pretend to be someone one was not so as not to bring shame on one's family.  That completely destroyed countless lives in this country.  I often wonder how many good people were lost to this country through emigration, not as a direct result of economic misery but of the deep seated and suffocating conservatism of post-independence Ireland and its official policy of hostility to gay citizens.  It is impossible to know.</p><p>While we cannot right the wrongs of the past, we must acknowledge that we have come a long way as a society in a relatively short space of time and have made Ireland a better, more equal and tolerant place.  Many people who are Members of this House are responsible for that including Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in when he was Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality with responsibility for equality, as well as Senators Bacik, Norris, Buttimer and others.  </p><p>When I sat the leaving certificate exams in 1993, sexual acts between same-sex couples were illegal.  By the time I got to college in September of that year, gay men were finally liberated and were no longer made into criminals simply for having a sex life.  Shortly after that the employment laws were amended and we have seen a raft of other legislative changes in the past 24 years that have objectively made this country a much better, more tolerant and inclusive place.</p><p>An important element of our drive towards equality is the need to come to terms with our past.  I firmly believe those Irish citizens - our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins and friends - who were harassed and tormented by a State culture that officially treated them with cruelty, hostility, derision and ridicule are owed an apology.  As was done in the UK, we should apologise to and exonerate those who were convicted of sexual offences carried out before the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1993.  Those people would be innocent of committing any crime today.  Turing's law, as it has become known in the UK, was passed yesterday but unlike the proposition before us today, it provides for a pardon.  We have not provided for such for a very good reason.  We believe that to do so would imply that what gay men did was wrong and it was not.  The Bill before us today provides for an apology and an exoneration.  It also goes much further than that.  It will, if accepted by the Government and passed in both Houses, officially acknowledge that the offences and prosecutions involved were "improperly discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and in breach of personal privacy and autonomy".  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and to his senior colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality - who has a very strong track record as a legislator in this area and as a campaigner and advocate for equality - to not just agree not to oppose this Bill but to accept it, its central ambition and the manner and spirit in which it is being tabled here today.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton and his ministerial colleagues are concerned about elements of the Bill, I suggest that we should take it to Committee Stage with the minimum of delay.  We were 26 years behind the UK in decriminalising homosexuality.  Let us not be left far behind again and let us act now.  If there are any technical issues with the Bill, let us discuss them in a spirit of openness in order to achieve what most of us in this House would wish to achieve.  I acknowledge that nothing we do today can make up for the hurt and cruelty visited on LGBT citizens throughout our history.  Moreover, there is still some way to go before we can say with certainty that we have reached what we might term "full equality" in this country.  However, in apologising for what we did in the past and recognising that it was wrong, we can go some way towards righting those wrongs and healing those wounds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1410" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#NN00200"><p>I am proud to support Senator Nash's Bill.  I congratulate him on the work he has done to bring this important legislation before the House.  At the heart of this Bill is an essential understanding of what equality really means.  Equality is not a sense that one privileged group in society can hand down rights to another group in society.  That is not what equality means.  It is not in the gift of one group to allow another group to be themselves.  Equality is very different to that.  It is an understanding that we are all equal in every sense and that if any group is deemed or perceived to be lesser, then we do everything in our power to override, undermine, fix and change that.</p> <p>Over the last number of years when the Labour Party was in government with Fine Gael, we managed to achieve quite a number of things in the sphere of LGBT rights.  Marriage equality is an obvious one, as is the Children and Family Relationships Act.  There are now mandatory anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic policies in all of our schools and we also enacted the Gender Recognition Act and amended section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  These were five commitments by the Labour Party which were achieved in government.</p> <p>What we are doing here is acknowledging that while we have achieved a huge amount in the recent years, we must right the wrongs of the past.  We have to admit that our legislative provisions before 1993 were wrong and that they undermined people's rights.  We have to acknowledge that, as a State, and apologise for it.  The legislative provisions at that time and the constitutional provisions, until very recently, made people feel lesser.  They made people feel second best and not a full and complete part of this Republic.  I say this in the context of the current worldwide situation because often we can be quite complacent about the advancement of the human rights and equality agenda across this State and across Europe.  As we look around the world today we see the new political dispensation in Russia and we see the new political situation in the USA, where the Vice President has stated openly his belief that LGBT people can be corrected by some bizarre form of medical intervention.  This is the new political dynamic that we are facing in the United States of America.  We are saying quite clearly today in Seanad &Eacute;ireann that this Republic, standing on the edge of Europe, believes that not only do LGBT not need to be corrected but that the fact that LGBT people were not full, complete and absolutely equal members of this Republic in the past is something for which we must apologise.  We must be absolutely determined to ensure that we advance this agenda further.  It is not correct to suggest that because we had a successful marriage equality referendum or because other legislation has been passed - even this valuable Bill - this will make it easy for members of the LGBT community to come to terms with themselves and to come out to their family and friends in various parts of Ireland.  There is still a very dark road ahead, unfortunately, for many young and not-so-young people who still feel as if they live in an Ireland that does not accept them.  It is like saying that because the Civil Rights Act was passed in America in the 1960s, African Americans are completely equal in the eyes of all citizens and all states in America.  That is not the case.  </p> <p>What we must do in this Republic and in these Houses of the Oireachtas, is ensure that every single Bill that we can pass or Act that we can correct is so passed or corrected.  We must also apologise for the wrongs of the past.  Just like Senator Nash, I sat my leaving certificate exams in the early 1990s.  It is unbelievable to think that at the very same time, my contemporaries or people older than me were criminalised for being who they were and for the love that they felt.  I know that the younger generation -those younger than us - find that absolutely unbelievable.  What was remarkable at the time of the referendum was the fact that young people, regardless of background, gender or where they were from, found it remarkable that before 1993, engaging in homosexual activity was a criminal act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the Minister of State feels strongly about this.  I congratulate him for the work he has done heretofore in his equality brief.  We have met on a number of different occasions on various different issues.  He is a person of deep commitment to equality.  As Senator Nash has said, when issues like this come before this House there is often a temptation for Governments to pick holes in things.  There is a temptation sometimes for Opposition parties to play politics.  In this instance, the Minister of State will acknowledge that Senator Nash has brought forward legislation that is well crafted and has the right motivation behind it.  What the Minister of State and his office can do is take it in that spirit and if it needs to be tweaked, changed or improved that can be done at a different Stage of the legislative process.  </p><p>This House can stand together proudly, collectively and across party, in this Republic and send a message to the rest of the world.  Let us not pretend this agenda is going the same direction in every single part of the world because it is not.  It is going backwards.  It is going backwards in America, Russia and right across the world in many respects.  If this House was to restate its absolute commitment to equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters across this land, it would be a powerful symbol at this moment in time.  I commend Senator Nash on the work he has done and I commend my Labour colleagues on supporting this Bill.  I commend people across this House who are standing in solidarity with the Bill and the Minister of State's endeavours to bring this to the fore.  It will mean an awful lot for people who lived in the shadows of this State before 1993.  None of us can understand what a measure such as this passed in the House today will mean for people who lived in those dark days.</p></speech>

I commend Senators Nash and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on bringing forward what I think is very important legislation.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about the 1990s, which was when we sat our leaving certificate exams.  I shared Belfield with Senator Nash when we were both student activists and it was quite shocking.  Senator Higgins was also there.  She is down there.  It is amazing.

Former Senator and Leader of the Seanad, Senator Manning, was our lecturer at the time.  This is exceptionally important legislation.  It is funny when one talks about apology because the word "sorry" is only one word but it means so much to so many people.  It is not a difficult word to say or a difficult concept to express.  We saw the Taoiseach in one of his proudest moments when he stood up in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and gave a heartfelt and sincere apology to the victims of sexual abuse.  There are certain things we need to do as a society.  I tabled a motion here last week on history and I believe that in order to look to the future, one has to understand the past.  The wrongs that have happened in the past need to be acknowledged and a proper structure put in place to rectify them.  I agree with what has been said about the principle of a pardon because it would not be appropriate because it is, in a sense, acknowledging that somebody has done something wrong.  It is absolutely appropriate that there should be an apology.  I am absolutely delighted, on behalf of the Fine Gael group of Senators, as their spokesperson on justice to fully endorse the Bill.  My understanding is that the Minister will not oppose it.  If there is tweaking to be done, it will only be of a technical nature to ensure everything stands up to whatever scrutiny the Attorney General and others may give to it.  There may not even be any.</p> <p>What a week it has been in world politics.  We have seen what only a couple of years ago one would have thought was a dream or a horrible nightmare.  That is the reality.  Politicians are regularly accused of not fulfilling their promises but what is going on in the United States at the moment is over-fulfilling promises.  It is creating a new definition of political promise and delivery upon promise and rhetoric and all that is going on.  The people who will suffer as a result are the people at the margins.  The people who have suffered bigotry and all that goes with it in the past are the people who will suffer most with what is going on.  What we achieved here with the marriage equality referendum was world renowned.  We set a standard and a template for what Ireland, as a small country, can achieve.  When we talk, we might only be throwing a pebble into a big ocean but pebbles can have ripple effects.  Doing the right thing is always a must.  Ripple effects can change society, lives and world thinking.  We are a small country but we are a country with a proud tradition and a proud record.  The referendum on marriage equality had an impact.  It had a ripple effect throughout the world.  Doing the right thing is what we should always strive to do.  Setting international standards in terms of equality, recognising what has happened in the past and putting the structures in place to say the simple word "sorry" is something we should definitely come together and unite on in this House.  I sincerely hope the work Senator Nash has done to bring this Bill to the floor of the House will receive unanimous support and that we will see this Bill becoming an Act signed by our President and becoming part of who we are and part of the structures of society.  </p> <p>I wish the Bill well.  I look forward to engaging on the Bill, both on Committee and Report Stage, and hopefully will be here to welcome its passing when it is passed by this House.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear Senator Nash mentioning our colleague, Senator Norris, who cannot be with us, and to remember the great work he did in this regard for decades when he was a lone voice in championing people who had an alternative view of sexuality at the time.</p> <p>Someone wrote "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there."  It is very hard to retrospectively forgive or understand people for committing what were considered crimes at the time.  Members have talked about when they sat their leaving certificate exams.

We remember how people who were different or gay in the community were treated abominably.  They were laughed at and shunned.  What miserable, horrible lives many of them had to live.  Many of them left the country because of the way they were treated.  That is the way things were at the time.  It was very unfortunate and wrong.  This Bill would give some form of comfort and redress to people who were on the wrong side of things in those days.  The poet, Philip Larkin, said that sex came to Britain sometime between<i></i>the end of the ban on <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>and the Beatles' first LP.  I do not think it came to County Kerry quite as fast as that.</p><p>My party has a good record in terms of the general thinking behind this Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 1989 a Fianna F&aacute;il Government steered through the Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act 1989 which made it an offence to stir up hatred against a group or persons on a number of specific grounds, including their sexual orientation.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who in 1993 brought forward the seminal Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act which finally brought to an end the unfair criminalisation of homosexual practices.  It is worth noting that this legislation was introduced in the teeth of a poll conducted by <i>The Sunday Press</i>which showed that over 50% of the population were opposed to a change in the law.  We also resisted attempts to set a discriminatory age of consent which ensured effective equality, regardless of sexual orientation.<br/><br/>The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation.  It was closely followed by the ground-breaking Equal Status Act which was initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and took effect in October 2000.  There is a long list of other Acts to which my party contributed and of which I am proud.  I am proud to support this Private Member's Bill which is progressive.  Other Members have said we are entering into an unknown political scenario.  The regressive, backward-looking approach in the largest and most powerful democracy in the world must concern us.  It is extraordinary that in the country which gave us Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy President Trump was elected.  We must admit that he was democratically elected, but I hope, like many big storms, the wind will peter out after a while.  It is early days yet and we live in hope.<br/><br/>It is great to support the Bill.  It is frightening to think that great Irish people like Oscar Wilde who was a genius were criminalised.  He had such a horrible end to his talented life because of the narrow-mindedness which obtained in his day.  We welcome the Bill which we will support on every Stage.</p></speech>

I refer particularly to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex, LGBTQI, community in Uganda and Russia who face horrific levels of oppression and violence.  I express my solidarity with LGBT Americans who have taken to the streets of their cities.  Our brothers and sisters, friends, allies and communities, wherever they are in the world, should know that they are not alone.  Their persecutors should also know that we do not accept their violence or hate which we will overcome with love and compassion.</p> <p>On Friday, 27 June 1969 members of the LGBT community engaged in physical action on the streets of New York City to assert their rights to equality and justice.  Contrary to a whitewashed narrative, the Stonewall riots were led initially by women, black, trans and homeless citizens.  Seven weeks later, on 14 August 1969, the government in London deployed British troops to the streets of Derry and Belfast and soldiers would soon shoot 26 unarmed civil rights protesters off the streets of Derry.  I am a proud beneficiary of the LGBTQI community.  I am also a republican, a socialist, an internationalist, a feminist and an environmentalist.  These are struggles that interconnect and parallel, sharing a demand for self-determination.  When we talk about LGBT rights on this island, we are talking about partitioned rights.  The rights of the LGBTQI community, like all other communities which transcend the Border, continue to be partitioned.</p> <p>Our national outlook is islandwide and global in that it is inclusive of the diaspora across the world.  Marriage equality must be extended with immediacy to citizens and residents across the Border.  No thinking person in this Chamber could stand over the fact that LGBTQI people can marry in Dundalk but not in Newry.  If anyone in this Chamber is in any doubt as to why the lights are off in Stormont, just look this way.  All-island marriage equality is alongside a Bill of Rights and an Acht na Gaeilge, as well as respect, diversity and equality.  The civil marriage referendum redefined what it meant to be Irish.  It told the world that there was no single proposition for Irish identity, only diversity.  It is in that spirit we can build a new Ireland, a reunified Ireland, not only at peace from the gun but also one in which citizens would be at peace in their lives, free from scapegoating and the search for the other.  We cannot escape from the fact that partition continues to place a ceiling on imagination for this island.  It crushed a cultural movement and split the national movement from the labour movement.  It triggered a counter-revolution and copperfastened two deeply conservative states in which religious control and censorship were the order of the day.  The political establishment in the State facilitated that grip to control our laws, the education system, the health care system and even our consenting sex lives.</p> <p>In 1993 I was 15 months old when homosexuality was decriminalised.  I cannot give personal expression to the impact of criminalisation on the LGBTQI community, but I can understand the taboo it created.  It created an unwillingness on the part of establishment politicians to deal with the likes of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin city's cultural and social space for lesbian and gay men.  One thinks of issues such as giving a real and a genuine response to the HIV crisis, homophobia and public beatings of gay men.  One thinks of various sexual offences, including rape, that were allowed through a legal get-out clause because of the laws criminalising gay men and that air of criminality.  Both before and since the referendum on civil marriage equality, my boyfriend and I spoke and have spoken about what prospects would be if the referendum were to fail or had failed.  Our discussion centred on whether we would stay in Ireland.  Thankfully, I cannot answer that question.  How many people have we lost to Ireland because of criminalisation?  Can anyone tell me how many lesbians and gay men left the State because of that air of criminality?</p> <p>We still do not seem to consider the consequences of criminalisation.  Take, for example, the individual who is addicted to drugs and dealt with in the justice rather than the health system, which plays into the hands of individuals who seek to marginalise and feel comfortable in calling someone a &ldquo;junkie&rdquo;.  We need to think about the impact of criminalisation on certain sections of our society and the impact it creates for all of us.  We need to redefine it in the interests of the public good.</p> <p>Irish women and the LGBTQI community share, in the most unfortunate commonality, the historical and contemporary criminalisation of their bodies and lives.  Today women who seek out what should rightfully be theirs are also considered criminal.  Young people, particularly after the marriage referendum, identify with that shared sense of oppression and marginalisation.  A message is emerging loud and clear that Irish women and our society deserve better.  Older generations are advancing a narrative which lays bare the misogyny and deeply ingrained sense of prejudice faced by women since the foundation of the State.  There was the horror of institutional abuse in the industrial schools and the Magdalen laundries, as well as the symphysiotomy scandal, the Neary scandal and the Bethany Home scandal.  There were cases like those of Louise O'Keeffe and Senator David Norris which were pursued all the way to the European court by the State which also intimidated other victims to drop their court cases.  For me, the referendum on civil marriage equality acted as an apology to the LGBTQI community.  I believe the repeal of the eighth amendment would do the same for women.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill and thank Senator Gerald Nash for bringing it forward.  The fearlessness, enthusiasm and energy of LGBTQI people who were forced to endure criminalisation have empowered my activism and others of my generation.  In everything I do I attempt to acknowledge their struggle, for which I thank them.</p></speech>

While an apology and exoneration will do little for the men prosecuted under the relevant Acts, it would be an important step for us to recognise the indefensibility of those prosecutions and attempt to rectify the damage that was done by the State to gay men and those close to them in the past.  It seems surreal at a time of such increasing acceptance of the LGBTQI+ community in this country that it was only in 1993 that homosexual acts were decriminalised in Ireland with the passage of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 1993, which passed Final Stages in this House only 24 years ago in June.</p> <p>It is a sad reality that, historically, Ireland's record on LGBTQI+ equality has been a noticeable stain on our record of commitment to human rights.  However, in what is surely one of the most welcome political developments of recent years, we have seen a reversal of this trend and increased recognition of the civil equality of our LGBTQI+ citizens.  This is evidenced by the major legislative initiatives in recent years, such as legislation on civil partnership in 2010, the passage of the historic Gender Recognition Bill in 2015 and that incredible day for politics in this country two years ago when Ireland became the first country in the world to enshrine civil marriage rights for same-sex couples in its Constitution by popular vote.</p> <p>Of course, I am not the first person in this House to pay tribute to that day in May.  I often hear my colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas paying tribute to what happened on that day and the positive and progressive shift that it showed, hailing it as a landmark day for Irish politics and the true achievement of equality for our LGBTQI+ citizens.  While in many ways I share that sentiment and I fully recognise what a special day that was for many people, I often feel that, because there is such a strong perception that equality was secured for LGBTQI+ people with the marriage referendum, the urgency of the fight for LGBTQI+ advancement and our ongoing commitment to always be looking for avenues to improve the lives of LGBTQI+ citizens has dissipated somewhat.</p> <p>It is easy to look at the referendum result and think that civil marriage rights for LGBTQI+ people was the apex of the fight for equality for a long marginalised community.  It is much harder to view the result of that referendum as simply a significant marker in a much longer process, that while increasing civil equality is important, it is by no means the only way we can measure the true equality of LGBTQI+ people in the State.  If we start to expand the markers by which we measure that equality, we can start to see just how much more work needs to be done to help our LGBTQI+ citizens.  For example, our transgender citizens under the age of 18 and those who identify as gender non-binary are still not adequately accommodated for under the Gender Recognition Act 2015.  This needs to be changed and I call on the Government to consider such changes as we approach the Act's review period.</p> <p>Another issue is that while I welcome the recent decision by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to lift the lifetime ban of MSM blood donation, I have to ask why he has decided to maintain a one-year deferral period when, as far as I can tell, there is no scientific evidence to justify such a deferral and, indeed, many European countries do not have one in place.  The continued existence of such a ban is discriminatory and stigmatising and will in practice exclude many MSM who wish to donate blood.</p> <p>I would like to applaud the Government of Malta for being the first European country to ban gay conversion therapy last month.  It would be a significant statement of Ireland's commitment to LGBT equality if the Oireachtas were to consider enacting a similar ban.</p> <p>Another issue relates to the worrying statistics relating to LGBT homelessness, mental health, LGBT+ sex education and suicide.  Last year a paper entitled Swimming with Sharks, was published by the University of Queensland.  It documents the very detrimental and damaging impact that the "No" campaign during the marriage referendum had on the mental health and well-being of those in the Irish LGBT community.  In light of this and the concern and statistics, we should be considerate and target national efforts to deal with these problems.</p> <p>Another worrying statistic is the recent increasing levels of HIV prevalence among MSM, with 377 new cases in 2014, and the rise of trends such as chemsex.  As a result, we should be debating how to expand the availability of and information relating to the preventive drug PrEP and improving LGBT+ specific sexual education in schools.</p> <p>I was also recently contacted by a retired Trinity College lecturer whose same-sex partner's pension entitlements where denied as the lecturer had not been married by the age of 60, despite the fact that civil partnerships were not even legal before he turned 60.  I understand that this extraordinarily unfair administrative anomaly will be dealt with by Senator Bacik's recently introduced Pensions (Equal Pension Treatment in Occupational Benefit Scheme) (Amendment) Bill 2016 which is welcome.</p> <p>I do not raise these issues to paint a negative picture of how the State treats LBGT+ people.  I simply want to raise the point that when we are considering how we can make amends to LGBT+ citizens who were wronged by the State in the past, as this worthy Bill does, we should also take the opportunity to consider how we can best support Irish LGBT+ people in the here and now, and in the future.  All of the challenges that faced the LGBT+ community in this country were not solved on 22 May 2015.  All the challenges that face that same community today will not be solved by the passage of this legislation.  However, they represent significant markers in a process that, if coupled with concerted efforts and attitude changes across a range of policy areas, small and large, will strengthen the equality of our LGBT+ citizens in the future.  I am proud to support the Bill.</p></speech>

It is a really important issue.</p> <p>I was in my office when I heard the contribution of Senator Ned O'Sullivan.  It was eloquent, well put together and thought-provoking and touched on many points.  It begged me to get up here quick and partake in this debate.  It was my intention to come but I was delayed.  I was also here for Senator Warfield's valid contribution.  Those were two compelling cases as to why we should be supporting this Bill.</p> <p>What are we talking about here?   The explanatory memorandum states this Bill, in effect, is to provide for, "an apology to and exoneration of persons convicted of consensual same-sex sexual acts, on the grounds that prosecutions for such offences were improperly discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and in breach of personal privacy and autonomy."  That is what it is about, and an apology is only a word.  The Bill is to be welcomed but what is needed is more than an apology.  There has to be a recognition that a wrong was done and that there was discrimination.  People were hurt, disappointed and let down by the State.</p> <p>The explanatory memorandum further states that the Bill, "provides that a person convicted of any such offence receives an apology and exoneration and an acknowledgement that the offences concerned and prosecutions for those offences were improperly discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and infringed personal privacy and autonomy."  That is extraordinary.</p> <p>What I am more concerned about, and seeking clarify on, is that the explanatory memorandum further states that the Bill does not confer any statutory rights on any person, does not create a cause of action or cause the fresh accrual of a cause of action, and does not impose any liability on the State or any person.  What are we really saying?  Is it all words?  It is only an apology, but there is no liability or potential case for anyone else to seek redress.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will be already familiar with the redress legislation that was brought in by a previous Government.  That recognised the hurt, the violation and the abuse of citizens in this country.  The State brought in a redress scheme.  That will not put all wrongs right but it is there and has been established.  It is an important point.</p> <p>I am supportive.  I am also mindful of the great work that Senator Norris, who is not with us today, has done in this area.  We need to recognise his work but also that of many others who silently go about as advocates and assist and support, in their own quiet and private way, the rights of people.  All politicians, of all sides, do that in both Houses of the Oireachtas and there are various reasons for how they operate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ultimately we want equality, fairness and justice.  An apology simply is not enough.  Through our legislation, through offering opportunities and through education, employment law and everything else, we have to demonstrate time and time again that we are about equality for all people regardless of their differences.  We must celebrate that diversity that enriches our society and life.  That has to be echoed through all legislation we put through both sides of this House.  I am happy to commit myself at this point to support this legislation at every Stage.  It is positive and progressive and while it may not go far enough, it is a big start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-01a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020100002#RR00200"><p>I will speak today on behalf of my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who regrets she cannot be present due to other business but she is very interested in this issue.  I also thank Senators Nash, Bacik, Humphreys and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for introducing this Bill.</p> <p>The Bill before the House today is very interesting.  Its stated purpose is to provide for an apology and exoneration of people convicted of certain same-sex sexual acts.  The Bill is similar in sentiment but very different in effect to that of the UK Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which provides for a disregard of such convictions and that jurisdiction's Policing and Crime Bill 2015 which I understand has been recently enacted and is known as Alan Turing's law.  It will grant a pardon to any person who has a conviction disregarded under the 2012 procedures to which Senator Nash already has alluded.  Alan Turing's life was portrayed recently in "The Imitation Game".  If one saw that, one would see the injustice that was meted out to him in the end.  Mention also was made of Oscar Wilde earlier and I wish to join in recognising the work of Senator Norris in this area in the past.</p> <p>There is no system of disregarding convictions in Ireland at present.  Legislation was enacted last year which enables minor convictions to be regarded as spent after a number of years but this simply means that the convicted person does not usually - but there are exceptions - have to disclose those convictions, for example when applying for a job.  The record of the conviction is not deleted.  The apology and exoneration proposed in the Senators' Bill would be appear to be purely of declaratory nature.  It is to some degree along the lines of the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013.  However, that Act provides for an amnesty for those convicted of being absent without leave or who were dismissed from the Defence Forces pursuant to emergency powers in force at that time while fighting for Allied forces during the Second World War.  The Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013's approach to an amnesty for each relevant person involved an acknowledgement that the treatment they received as a consequence of their actions was unduly harsh, an apology for such treatment and an exoneration in respect of those acts which occurred in the special circumstances of the Second World War.</p> <p>The disregard of a conviction in the UK in such cases is for offences under their relevant legislation and involves an application that must be considered by the Home Secretary.  The conditions of the disregard are that the act was consensual, that the other person involved was 16 or older and that the act would not now be an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 of sexual activity in a public lavatory.  As well as the information required for such an application to be considered, the UK Act also sets out the procedure to be followed by the Home Secretary in considering it.  If a disregard is granted, all records of the offence are deleted and it has the effect that the conviction never occurred.  I understand that the authorities in Northern Ireland are preparing to implement the 2015 Bill, now enacted, and that their intention is that a pardon will automatically follow a disregard in a one-step system.  </p> <p>Turning to the detail of the current Bill, it is clear that it is significantly different from the formalised approach I have just outlined.  Section 1 of the Bill sets out the now abolished offences to which the Bill would apply.  These are the Act for the Punishment of the Vice of Buggery (Ireland) 1634, section 16 of the Offences Against the Person (Ireland) Act 1829, section 61 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861 and section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.  The 1634 Act was repealed by the 1829 Act, which in turn was replaced by the 1861 Act.  The 1861 and 1885 offences, which dealt with sodomy and gross indecency between men, applied to both consensual and non-consensual acts and were repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for an apology and exoneration to those convicted of an offence listed under section 1, as well as an acknowledgment that the offences occurred and prosecutions were improperly discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and infringed personal privacy and autonomy.  Section 2 also confirms that the Bill will not confer any right on any persons, create a cause of action, as the Senator just mentioned, or impose a liability on the State.  Section 3 exempts from the application of the Bill offences where the other person involved was under 17 years of age or lacked capacity to consent.  </p> <p>There are a number of other points that the T&aacute;naiste and I wish to raise on the Bill as currently drafted.  In drawing these points to Members' attention, I am informed by preliminary advice that has been received from the Office of the Attorney General.  There are aspects of the Bill which we believe require further consideration and some of which may give rise to unintended consequences.  As Senators have said, some of these issues can and will be dealt on Committee Stage where the details can be tweaked.  The point which gives rise to the most significant issue of concern is that the Bill, as currently constructed, will extend an apology and exoneration to persons who were convicted of non-consensual same-sex sexual acts.  Although the objective of the Bill, as set out in the Long Title, is to provide for an apology and exoneration to persons convicted of consensual same-sex sexual acts, the Bill in fact extends beyond the boundaries of that objective in the manner outlined above.  This would have very serious implications, not least for the victims of such crimes.  I am sure the Senators sponsoring this Bill will give careful consideration as to how this issue might be dealt with.  It may be that the declaratory effect of the Bill can be clarified.</p> <p>The UK takes a different approach, which is to look at each case individually and ensure that those convictions that related to non-consensual activity were not the subject of an improper apology and exoneration.  Of course, this is in a context where the UK system will have real legal effect.  However, there would be practical difficulties with this approach, not least of which would be the fact that more than 23 years, and in many cases potentially far longer, would have passed since any case was initiated and that difficulties would arise in terms of dividing the cases into those where consent was an issue and where it was not.</p> <p>The Senators&rsquo; Bill also seeks to extend its provisions to convictions which took place prior to the creation of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann.  This brings up the very difficult question of legal theory, which is unclear as to whether legislation can operate so as to grant an apology and exoneration to those convicted by courts established prior to the foundation of the State.  Finally, while the Bill specifies that no rights are conferred on any person or liability imposed on the State by the provisions of the Bill, the precise legal effect of an apology and exoneration is not clear beyond a declaration of the sentiments of section 2 of the Bill.  Despite the concerns expressed, the Government does not, of course, oppose the principle of the Bill.  These issues are raised simply to highlight the areas which the Government believes require further consideration if the Bill is to achieve its purpose and not have unintended consequences.  All legislation goes through this process and this is why we are here debating legislation.  I am sure the Senators sponsoring the Bill will reflect on these issues and consider how best they might be dealt with as the Bill progresses.</p> <p>It was a proud day for Ireland when the Act of 1993 came into force and decriminalised consensual sexual acts between men.  It marked the beginning of a fairer and more modern Ireland which seeks to incorporate all its citizens, with their similarities and differences, into a united and respectful society.  That process of reform is continuing this evening when the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will return to the D&aacute;il to begin the Report Stage of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015.  The Bill marks a significant legislative development in the law of sexual offences and seeks to protect the vulnerable.  The Bill will introduce, for the first time, a statutory definition of consent and a non-exhaustive list of situations where a person does not consent to a sexual act.  These provisions reflect both the common law position and the experience in terms of issues that arise at the trial of such cases.  Consent is at the heart of every lawful sexual act and this is why the Government is concerned as to the impact of any unintended consequences of the Senators' Bill, particularly on the victim, if exoneration was to be given to someone who had committed rape.</p> <p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, together with the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016, will provide victims, and in particular vulnerable victims - into which category all victims of sexual crime fall - with greater protection from offences and greater support as they navigate their way through the criminal justice system.  This work emphasises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling sexual crime and to improving the lot of the victim, which has too often been forgotten in the past.  These Bills are a result of periods of careful reflection together with engagement with civil society organisations representing victims and the criminal justice agencies that advise on the practical considerations of the implementation of the legislation.</p> <p>I again thank the Senators for bringing forward this Bill and very much welcome the debate here today.</p></speech>

This is an important proposal from an historic perspective and for those men still alive, and their families, who are affected by its provisions.</p> <p>I must, unfortunately, introduce a discordant note in pointing out that Senator Ruane's contribution was very negative, given the gargantuan changes we have seen.</p></speech>

That was disappointing when one considers the monumental amount of change that has been brought forward in recent years, especially by the last Government.  We have moved from a time when people were prosecuted and imprisoned to a point when we can celebrate equality.  I think today of friends who are living abroad and do not want to return to Ireland because of the way they were treated here in the past.  I salute them.  I think of the many people who are scared to come out, older people in particular, in our communities.  This tremendous day is for all of them.  As Senator Boyhan said, it is a day for the people who quietly advocate, push and prod, and make equality happen in a nondescript way.  Equally, it is a day for those persons who push and advocate in a public way.  I thank the people in the many different organisations who do that every day.

I am entitled to my view and to express it here as a Member of the House.</p> <p>The purpose of this Bill is to enhance equality, fairness and justice for those people were been hurt and let down, not just by the State but also by the church and society over a period of time.  It is about addressing the injustice of the way in which people viewed gay people and the way we were treated by the State, the church and society.  Fortunately, we have moved on from that and this Bill serves as another symbol of progression towards full equality.  I share Senator Ruane's view that we did not put the roof on the house when we passed the marriage equality legislation.  However, to focus on what this and the previous Government have not done is very unfair.  Without their efforts, we would not have the progress on the road to equality we have seen.  We would not have had the changes around marriage equality, adoption, inheritance and tax law and blood donations.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, drove the latter change.  I reject any negative connotations to what we have done and are doing in this regard.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, as well as his predecessors, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, did important work which saw changes in the school curriculum to cover homophobic bullying and so on.  Those changes were achieved by the Department working with BeLonG To and other partners.</p> <p>Important changes have happened and continue to happen.  That is why I am passionate about being positive today.  We fought for that change.  I remember today former Deputy John Lyons, who worked quietly with me to push Ministers in the last D&aacute;il on the issue of gender recognition.  I am unapologetic in wanting to celebrate the positivity of the changes we have seen.</p></speech>

We did not sit quietly by; we worked hard to achieve things.  That is why today is important for people like John Lyons, who is no longer in the Oireachtas.  This Bill is about our friends, our people and ourselves.  It is about those of us who were told we were not equal under the laws of the land and could not have relationships.  We were pushed underground and told we were lesser.  That is why this Bill is welcome.  It is a celebration of those people who have died and cannot be here today.  I celebrate, too, Senator Norris and all the work he has done, especially his ground-breaking action in going to the European Court of Human Rights to challenge the norm in the eyes of the State.

We have had progressive government, which built a platform for an Ireland where people are equal.  The contribution Senator Ruane made was overtly negative around blood donations and pension provisions.  The last Government changed inheritance and tax law under the Finance Acts to ensure equal treatment of all citizens.</p> <p>The Bill before us today is about making a difference in people's lives.  It may not be tangible to those who do not understand but to the men, like me and many others, who were criminalised under our law, it draws a line at one level and gives hope to a new generation.  I hope we will never have to come back to Bills and debates like these.  What happened on 23 May last year made us equal by a vote of the people.  It was not done by the courts or the Oireachtas; it was the people who made that decision.  I salute all those who worked quietly in the past to create a movement, such as that in Cork in the 1980s, which led to our being able to celebrate our equality today.  I speak as a gay man and Member of our Parliament, conscious of the legacy of our State and recognising the improvements we have made in the lives of our people.  Like Senator Ruane, I am conscious that we can never be complacent, because there is a generation who looks to us to continue on the road to equality.  However, to infer there has been no progress is unfair.</p></speech>

I commend my colleagues in the Labour Party group, Senators Nash and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, on proposing and seconding this important Bill.  I am very proud to stand as leader of the Labour Party group and speak in support of these proposals.  There is no need for discord in this debate because we are all on the same side, which has not always been the case in respect of important social issues since I have been a Member of this House.  It is great to see the Bill being supported on all sides of the Chamber.  While we might disagree about how much or how little remains to be done or about the tone of the debate, we are all in agreement on the need to ensure we build on the equality measures that have already passed over successive years, another of which we are celebrating today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On behalf of the Labour Senators, I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive comments on the Bill.  It is fair to say we will take on board the comments he has made and we look forward to the expeditious progression of the Bill through this House and the D&aacute;il.  We note his comments about the Bill's potential consequences, particularly the need to ensure that victims are not in any way compromised, which is very important.</p><p>I note also the importance of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 which will be debated in the D&aacute;il tonight and tomorrow and which will return to the Seanad next week.  However, the Bill is declaratory; it does not seek to expunge convictions from the record but acknowledges the wrong done to so many men over so many decades in the past through being convicted of acts that are no longer criminal and which were consensual and did not involve persons under the age of 17.  The legislation is very clear about that and it provides an apology and exoneration to those who were convicted in the past who may no longer be alive.</p><p>The Minister of State referred to the Turing law, which is coming into force in Britain this week and which allows for posthumous pardons for those convicted of these offences and who are now dead and for an application procedure for those who are alive but who still carry convictions in respect of offences which are no longer known to the law.  It also allows for statutory pardons.  As the Minister of State said, the law in question involves a very different and cumbersome application procedure.  The Bill before the House has a very different purpose.</p><p>The Minister of State also raised interesting procedural points about past offences under the law of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann.  I am sure we can debate these on Committee Stage.  The important point today is to celebrate the fact that we are all here in support of this Bill and the important principle it contains, which will make a real difference to so many people.</p><p>Many Senators have paid tribute to Senator David Norris and his work.  He has sent a personal message that he is very sorry he cannot be here.  Just recently, I had the privilege of hearing Senator Norris speak very eloquently about his experience of taking the famous case which led to the European Court of Human Rights judgment and, ultimately, to decriminalisation in 1993, a matter about which others have spoken.  Senator Norris also spoke publicly at a meeting we held in Trinity College - I had never heard him speak about this before - regarding his work providing character references, along with many other people, for men who were being prosecuted in the courts of this country in the 1970s under the 1885 Act for offences such as that relating to gross indecency, about which Senator Ned O'Sullivan spoke.  Subsequently, we published some of the transcripts of those hearings.  This had a very real effect on so many individuals.</p><p>In the appalling judgment he delivered in the Supreme Court in the 1980s in the Norris case - a judgment recently described as the worst ever delivered by the Supreme Court - the then Chief Justice O'Higgins spoke about the damaging practice of homosexuality and the fact that he regarded it as harmful to both the institution of marriage and the health of individuals.  This was appalling language which had no place - or rather should have had no place - in 1980s Ireland and which, of course, has no place in the Ireland of 2017.  Looking back at this, we can understand the radical transformation that has come about in the lives of LGBT people in Ireland in recent decades since decriminalisation occurred in 1993 and the other statutory changes that we detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  The level of statutory change has been immense and culminated in the wonderful, historic passage of the marriage equality referendum in May 2015, about which we have all spoken.  Ireland was the first country internationally to pass marriage equality by way of popular vote.  That was hugely significant.</p><p>There are legacy issues, however, and Senator Ruane referred to these.  The issues in question relate to anomalies in our laws.  The Bill seeks to address one of these, namely, the fact that there are still people living in Ireland who carry convictions on their records that they should no longer have to carry.  The State should acknowledge and address that matter.  That is what we seek to do in the Bill.  There are other anomalies too, and Senator Ruane spoke of these also.  She referred to the case of David Parris, also a Trinity College colleague of mine, before the European Court of Justice.  Unfortunately, the case did not result in the change in the law he had hoped to bring about whereby, again, an anomalous discrimination would have been cleared up.  The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, which I published before Christmas, which I hope we will debate in the House before too long and which I hope the Government will also support, would address this anomaly and legacy issue for a very small number of LGBT individuals whose partners will not be eligible under current law to qualify for survivor pensions due to what is called an anti-gold digger clause in pensions that requires people to have married before a particular age.  In David Parris's case, the Trinity College pension scheme stipulates the age of 60.  He reached the age of 60 before he was legally able to marry or enter civil partnership with his long-term partner.  This is all very much on the public record.  I hope the Pensions (Amendment) Bill will be supported by the Government.</p><p>These are legacy issues.  Happily, in Ireland we have moved to a position where we can talk about huge progress, radical transformation and equality.  We do have to be mindful, as Senator Warfield so eloquently said, that there are many LGBT people living in countries such as Uganda and Russia and many other countries around the world where there is no such equality and where people still live in fear of expressing their sexuality.  Even in Ireland, my colleague in Trinity College, Professor Mark Bell, recently published on the ongoing concerns about ongoing discrimination in the workplace that LGBT persons, particularly transgender persons, in Ireland experience.  In 2013, the Fundamental Rights Agency survey of Ireland found 20% of LGBT people across the EU reported experiencing workplace discrimination.  In Ireland, the figure is 18% but rose to 29% among transgender people.  The LGBTI Ireland report for 2016 made similar findings, with 17% of respondents saying they had experienced LGBTI bullying in their workplaces.  Therefore, we need to be mindful of the real-life experiences of LGBT people and the fact that legal change does not always bring about the desired cultural change or have the same impact on the ground.  We must be mindful that if one looks at Equality Tribunal decisions, one finds very few cases being taken relating to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, despite relatively high levels of reporting of such discrimination.  Clearly, therefore, there is a disconnection between people's experiences of discrimination and their willingness to take cases.  We must be concerned about whether people still feel they have to be silenced in some way about their sexual orientation.</p><p>Our Bill started life as Private Members' legislation to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, which I introduced in the previous Seanad and which culminated in the passage of the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015.  This is an important change that will, we hope, end the chilling effect particularly for LGBT teachers and employees in religious-run workplaces.  Clearly, however, there is still much work to be done to change the culture.</p><p>On that cautiously positive note, I again thank the Minister of State for expressing his support for this important Bill and thank all our colleagues.  Senator Nash will conclude the debate and will also thank everyone, but I thank everyone who has spoken so far for expressing the strong support of their own parties or groups for this important legislation.</p></speech>

The declaration by the people of Ireland that day was the first such popular vote anywhere in the world for marriage equality.  It was a clear statement heard by the world that Ireland has progressed from a closed, judgmental and socially-regressive place to an open, accepting and progressive society.  Minority groups living in Ireland saw this as a hugely positive act by the people of our country and it gave them great hope for the future that all sections of society and minority groups living in Ireland would be given an opportunity to play an equal and inclusive role in a new, modern and bright Ireland.  I welcome this Bill, commend Senator Nash and his colleagues on bringing it forward.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State has indicated Government support and that the House will not be divided - as I read - it at this stage.</p><p>Unfortunately, we must be upfront and truthful about the many wrongs that were carried out by this State against vulnerable and minority groups in the past.  I could think of the women in Magdalen laundries, the women in Bethany Homes, children in industrial schools and people with disabilities.  The list could go on and on.  A group of our citizens that was treated disgracefully in the past is the group at which this Bill is aimed, namely, our homosexual and LGBT community.  The Bill will strengthen and reinforce the abolition of previous apparent sexual offences such as buggery and offences against the persons, but we know today that these were never criminal acts.  We know the offences outlined were discriminatory, contrary to human dignity and designedly alien to people's human rights.  This treatment was wrong.  It destroyed peoples' lives and was quite frankly abhorrent.</p><p>In 1895, one of Ireland's most celebrated wordsmiths, Oscar Wilde, was sentenced to two years' hard labour in England for the so-called crime of being a homosexual - for loving another man.  It feels appropriate during this debate on this important Bill to read a few lines from Oscar Wilde's great poem and rebuke to the society that imprisoned him and criminalised him.  I refer, of course, to &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;.  He stated in that incredible poem:</p><blockquote>I know not whether Laws be right,<br /><br />Or whether Laws be wrong; <br /><br />All that we know who lie in gaol<br /><br />Is that the wall is strong;<br /><br />And that each day is like a year,<br /><br />A year whose days are long.<br /><br />But this I know, that every Law<br /><br />That men have made for Man,<br /><br />Since first Man took his brother's life,<br /><br />And the sad world began,<br /><br />But straws the wheat and saves the chaff<br /><br />With a most evil fan.<br /><br />This too I know&mdash;and wise it were<br /><br />If each could know the same&mdash; <br /><br />That every prison that men build<br /><br />Is built with bricks of shame,<br /><br />And bound with bars lest Christ should see <br /><br />How men their brothers maim.</blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">  Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That poem still rings true today.  It raises the hairs on the back of my neck.  That was his incredible response in those dark days to the international global society, not just in Britain, that criminalised and condemned human beings because they loved another human of the same sex.  The Bill deals with that legacy and seeks to ensure not one single Irish citizen will continue to carry a burden on his or her shoulders because of what happened in those dark days with the criminalisation by the State of the homosexual LGBT community, the only future for the vast majority of whose members was emigration.  I presume the numbers of Irish citizens who were forced to move abroad or who suffered from mental health issues and died by suicide as a result of these laws are incalculable, but we must never allow a situation such as this to develop again.</p><p>What should happen now?  A heartfelt State apology is an immediate necessity.  We must also recognise that on a part of the island marriage equality is still not allowed.  That is wrong and further proof of the need to push for a united Ireland.  Citizens of the Six Counties are equally as deserving of the human right to marriage equality.  All parties should support a demand for marriage equality in the North in the same way that the campaign was conducted here.  It was an incredibly vibrant and positive campaign that was grassroots-led and lifted all of our hearts.  I will never forget that incredible day in Dublin Castle.</p><p>Let me finish with a thought on which everybody should reflect.  The ethnicity of Travellers has not been recognised, while refugees languish in direct provision centres with little hope of a change to the system.  I spoke about learning lessons.  I plead with the Government to ensure history is not repeated in the case of Travellers and refugees.  In time the country will be judged on how we treated minorities and protected the most vulnerable.  We need to deliver on the ideals of the Proclamation.  We need to deliver a thirty-two county republic in which all citizens will be looked after equally.</p></speech>

It was not right; it was an injustice, particularly when Senator Lynn Ruane was not in the Chamber to hear them.  She had every right to say what she felt.  This is a democratic society.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill presented by Senator Gerald Nash.  I thank him and the Labour Party for introducing it.  It is really appreciated.  The Bill asks the State to exonerate and apologise to gay men who were convicted of sexual offences before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993.  Ireland is continually changing and we are all striving to make it a better place in which to live and work and, more importantly, to be who we are.  We demonstrated in the marriage equality referendum that we were more tolerant, more open and a more inclusive nation, one that would embrace all citizens equally.  It is devastating to think there were thousands of people who were unable to live their lives openly with those whom they loved with the protections offered by the State.  During my campaign to be elected to this House I stated repeatedly that, as a nation, we should be judged on how we treated citizens.  While it may have been a sign of the times, it was certainly not excusable.  The men in question suffered not just at the hands of the law but also hostility in their communities.  This was a great injustice to them, their partners, friends and families.  It was heartbreaking.  We know that the Bill will not change what happened in the past, but it will be a small step in acknowledging the wrongs inflicted on gay men.  It will also send a strong message to young LGBT people that they will be supported by their fellow citizens and that, as a nation, we are not afraid to say sorry for past mistakes.  </p> <p>I commend Senator Gerald Nash for bringing forward the Bill and welcome the Government's decision not to block it, for which I thank the Minister.  As we all know, it is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

What happened in the past was unjust in the very particular way laws reached into the right to relationships, bodily automony, physical freedom and privacy of the individual.  They were not simply wrong; they also represented the deep over-reach of the State.  It is appropriate that we are taking the time to ensure they are fully addressed and that the wrong is recognised.  From my reading of the Bill, it seems to be quite clear that it is addressing the rights of consenting adults.  This is written into the text in different ways, including in respect of those under 17 years.  The provisions of the Bill achieve a good balance in terms of nuance.  I am very happy to support the Bill and look forward to supporting its passage through the House.</p> <p>We need to have an ambition for equality which is not a badge we can simply wear.  I am sure all Members have badges, piles of leaflets and papers from the various campaigns in which they have been involved, including the marriage equality campaign, but it goes further.  If we did not have an ambition for equality, we might have stopped with Senator David Norris's landmark campaign to ensure decriminalisation, but it drove us further.  There was the introduction in the 1990s of equality legislation by the then Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  It is also important to mark that legislation.  With respect, I suggest that was a Government that also put down an important marker for equality by introducing the very structures for the legislation now in place.  We might have stopped with the introduction of civil partnership, but we were ambitious and ploughed on to marriage equality and transgender recognition legislation.  We simply cannot say the parade is finished or that we have reached our goal.  We need to keep seeking ways to deeply embed equality in society.  It is a service to each other when we recognise and identify new ways to drive forward the equality agenda.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe that some of the concrete and practical suggestions put forward by Senators Warfield and Ruane and others are part of that ambition.  This Bill is an important step in that regard.</p><p>We talk about driving forward.  The Bill is also important because it is reaching backwards.  We need to ensure we reach backwards to address the wrongs of the past.  We need to ensure we put down a marker that the past ground and positions held were not simply wrong at the time but were altogether wrong and remain wrong.  They were not simply a product of their moment but something we can look back on now and recognise as having been wrong.  We need to mark the past ground as unacceptable and as a place where we cannot go again.</p><p>We need to be aware that things can move backwards as well as forwards.  That is why we need to put a marker down on the earth.  Let us consider the situation now.  These are worrying times.  People have talked about the LGBT community coming under pressure globally, especially in Russia.  We have seen that Russia has recently decriminalised domestic violence.  That is an example of how things can move backwards.  That is why it is important for us to make this significant marker.  The ILGA has listed 73 countries in which LGBTQI activities are illegal.  That is a marker.  Ireland can be and should be a leader in championing LGBT rights on a global level.</p><p>I am happy to support the Bill.  I look forward to the next steps.  I am also looking forward to our championing and marking of these issues, including in the areas of refugee rights.  That is another area where LGBT rights need to be respected and promoted in an active way.  I imagine the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, whose work overlaps into that area, will seek to do that as well.</p><p>Colleagues have mentioned the question of those who have emigrated.  In many cases they felt forced to emigrate because of their treatment in society.  We know that when a law is negative, it signals permission to the rest of society to discriminate as well.</p><p>This is also a practical measure.  We have seen how a criminal measure changes things.  Recently, in America, we have seen how a criminal marker in the past is being used as an excuse for future discrimination.  There may be a practical component to the Bill as well.</p></speech>

Depending on how we progress, this could be considered a landmark evening for the Chamber.  Much of what is positive about Irish politics, including the effects on the transformation of our society in recent decades, has emanated from legislative propositions that started their journeys in this House.</p> <p>I am satisfied that the Minister of State is personally committed to advancing this legislation.  Not only does he understand the principle of the legislation, but he fully endorses its ambition.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the declaratory effect.  He has got it in one.  The Bill is declaratory by nature and by effect, and deliberately so.</p> <p>I was involved in the campaign for an amnesty for members of the Defence Forces who deserted to fight with the British Army during the Second World War.  These people were fighting the forces of fascism.  It is a fascinating story and a fascinating period in our history.  I worked with representative bodies, former soldiers, interests in the UK and the former Minister, Mr. Shatter, to resolve the matter.</p> <p>We have examined the matter closely.  We have examined the impact of the legislation in considering the approach we would take.</p> <p>The Minister of State raised significant concerns relating to non-consensual acts.  It was never the intention of this Bill that there would be an apology to or an exoneration of anyone involved in convictions pertaining to non-consensual acts.  I trust the Minister of State accepts that.  I know he and his officials will be available to address these issues.  When we are drafting and crafting legislation, we have to be mindful of unintended consequences of particular provisions.  That is why we have a robust legislative process.  I am happy to work with the Minister of State on that.  We have no difficulty in working with the Minister of State and officials to clarify the intentions of elements of the Bill.  If the Minister of State believes it can be improved on the advice of the Attorney General, then we are open to suggestions.</p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State, given his good nature and his interest in this area, to ensure the Bill is not sent to the place where Bills are sent to die.  I can never prevent myself from smiling somewhat at the phrase "new politics".  One of the unintended consequences &ndash; perhaps it is intended &ndash; of new politics is that we are suddenly submerged with a high level and a large amount of legislation that has to go somewhere.  Unfortunately, sometimes it is sent to committees to die.</p> <p>I gather from the demeanour of the Minister of State and others that this legislation will go where it is required to go, that is, Committee Stage.  The Minister of State could utilise an example involving Senator Bacik and me.  Senator Bacik developed the Competition (Amendment) Bill last year.  She worked closely with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and officials to get the legislation right to bring it to a point whereby it has gone through all stages in the Seanad.  It will be in the D&aacute;il shortly.  I hope it will be law by summer.</p> <p>I thank colleagues for their support for the legislation.  At one point, the House was in danger of seeing peace breaking out.  However, Senators Ruane and Buttimer put paid to that.  I mean that in the best possible way.  I thank all Senators for their support.  I know Senator Buttimer is passionate about this entire agenda, as is everyone, including Senator Ruane.  Senator Warfield referred to Uganda.  We should be mindful of the fact that we can have such debates in the Chamber as well as debates on issues, policies and principles.  We live in a democratic society.  Unfortunately, that is not the case in Uganda and in many other countries.  It is not only in Uganda where we can see how global winds in this area have been diminished.  We need only look at the United States and Russia and the concerns of citizens in those places at the moment.  They are concerned at the appalling vista in one of the world's largest, most significant and important democracies.</p> <p>In recent years, we have had a good record of coming to terms with our past.  For example, I was involved in setting up the Neary or symphysiotomy redress scheme.  I was proud to be part of the Government that apologised to those who were victims of clerical sexual abuse.  The Taoiseach performed a great service to the nation.  One of his proudest days was the day he stood up in the D&aacute;il to express his sorrow and to apologise on behalf of the people to those who were the victims of clerical sexual abuse.</p> <p>The marriage equality referendum represented a landmark for us in terms of the country reaching adulthood.  The adoption of legislation to provide for an apology to gay men who were criminalised by this society and to provide for an exoneration of those gay men would mark our maturity as a nation.  I am keen for the Minister of State to consider that and to engage with us positively to move this legislation expeditiously through the process.  Together, we can develop the legislation such that we can be proud to stand over it.  It would send a strong message to those affected by the cruel laws that were on the Statue Book.  The message is that these people did not have to live in the shadows, that the country now treats them as equal citizens and that we should never have treated them in the way we did.</p></speech>
