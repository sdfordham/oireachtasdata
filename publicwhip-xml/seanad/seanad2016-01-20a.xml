    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#A00500"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this Commencement matter to be taken today.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p> <p>The situation for the people of County Roscommon is very grave and serious.  A three-person commission, under the chairman, Jack Keyes, to review the boundaries of County Roscommon for the purposes of a possible amalgamation with County Westmeath.  The commission is based in the civic offices in Mullingar.  It may be an indication of a certain bias that the boundary review secretary is based on Mount Street.  </p> <p>A serious campaign has been established.  Last week, 1,600 people attended a meeting in South Roscommon, chaired by Councillor Tony Ward and attended by other councillors, including Paddy Kilduff, John Naughten, John Keogh, Ivan Connaghton and Lawrence Fallon, who are the councillors elected for the south Roscommon area and the municipal area of Athlone, which is in Roscommon.</p> <p>I compliment the Save Roscommon campaign for its work in opposing the proposals of the boundary commission and the councillors who are very much involved in the campaign, not only in South Roscommon but throughout the county of Roscommon.  All 18 councillors are unanimous in their opposition to the proposal being made.  It is important that the Government gets a clear message that the people of Roscommon will not permit the annexation of part of County Roscommon. It is important that all public representatives, especially those running in the general election, are unequivocal in their opposition to this land grab.  The Fianna F&aacute;il candidate, Councillor Eugene Murphy, has made his support for the Save Roscommon campaign quite clear.</p> <p>What is the rationale for the boundary commission?  Who initiated it?  Why was it initiated?  At whose request was it initiated?  The panel consists of three not particularly wise men from the east; it does not even have the gender balance required for electoral purposes.  </p> <p>Can the Minister of State quantify the loss of income or potential income to Roscommon County Council of this proposal?  Has she considered the additional investment required in Roscommon if the proposal goes ahead, such as building new area offices and all of the other requirements?  The Connacht side of Athlone was annexed years ago, in the early part of the last century.  If any amalgamation is to take place, the more logical step would be that the area of Athlone west of the River Shannon in Connacht, where the diocese of Elphin reaches the edge of the bridge in Athlone, would be a natural boundary with the new area of Monksland and would give it a stronger identity.  </p> <p>Whatever happens, we are where we are.  We would be satisfied if we retained what we have.  Monksland has been prioritised by Roscommon County Council for investment.  In 1975 Don Panoz brought the &Eacute;lan Corporation, now trading as Alkermes Pharma Ireland limited, to the area.  In the 40 years since, a vast tract of land has been transformed and investment has taken place in industrial infrastructure, roads, paths and social housing in the south Roscommon area.  There is also a primary care centre.  The area has been developed for industry and has attracted Jazz Pharmaceuticals.  It has ready access to the M50.  County Roscommon is a gateway for jobs.</p> <p>We are making this case and I know the Minister of State is acting for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, today.  I propose that the boundary commission be disbanded and we develop our county as it is.  In the 1920s, our country was divided into two areas, one comprising 26 counties and the other six counties.  Can the Minister of State, who is from Cork, imagine how I, as somebody born and bred in County Roscommon, feel about the idea that a large portion of our county would be transferred to another county, thereby depriving the people of Roscommon of their identity?</p> <p>It is a very serious situation.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to transfer the matter elsewhere.  The decision will not be made until March, which is, of course, very convenient because the general election will be over.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Whoever comes in to the Office of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I am making the appeal in this House.

I hope that the Minister of State will convey this message to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Taoiseach.  The message is: "Hands off Roscommon."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  As the Senator will probably know, we are going through the same process in Cork, but it is within one county as opposed to two counties.  There are views on either side of that question as well.  The Senator should know that it is not only Roscommon where this applies.</p> <p>As he rightly pointed out, I am taking the matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  The Minister is keen for me to update the House on the matter.  As Members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford on 19 June last.  In the case of Athlone, the committee has been asked to carry out a review of the boundary between County Westmeath and County Roscommon and make recommendations with respect to that boundary which it considers to be necessary in the interests of effective local government.</p> <p>The main rationale for undertaking the review of boundaries in Athlone is that the 2011 census showed a significant Athlone environs population in County Roscommon.  The question that arises is the proportional relationship between administrative jurisdictions and the current settlement and development position.  I imagine the Senator is well aware of all those arguments.  Bringing an entire town or city within a single local authority area can eliminate or prevent anomalies and distortions of divided administration, service provision, regulatory and enforcement responsibility and electoral representation.  Potential problems can also include differing policies and practices between authorities in respect of matters such as planning, rating and other changes that can impact negatively on town centres.  Possible differences in standards of service delivery can also be avoided.  Consolidation of administrative responsibility can also strengthen the economic performance of a town by ensuring a single authority working on its behalf.</p> <p>Athlone is now an important economic hub for a wide hinterland and it has the potential to act as a major economic growth and employment centre at the heart of the country.  That can benefit the people of all the surrounding counties irrespective of what side of an administrative boundary they reside.  The Athlone boundary committee has been established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991 and, in accordance with section 28(3), it is independent in the performance of its functions.  While it would be inappropriate, therefore, for me to comment on the substantive matter under examination, I would like to take the opportunity to address some misconceptions that have been reported recently on this issue.</p> <p>Firstly, neither the Government - as the wording of the Commencement matter seems to suggest - nor the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is proposing that the boundary be changed.  The task of examining and analysing the issue has been entrusted to the independent boundary committee and it is that group which will consider and report on the matter.  At that stage, it will be open to the Minster of the day to suggest the alteration of a boundary by order, having regard to the report in question.  In this context, it is clear the matter will not be decided finally by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but by the Oireachtas.  In accordance with the 1991 Act, a draft of any order made by the Minister providing for a boundary alteration must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The order cannot be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  This would normally follow a submission to Government and would be unlikely to arise unless the independent statutory committee proposed a boundary alteration.  The Members in this House as well as their colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will, therefore, have an opportunity to examine any draft order that might come before them and it will not proceed unless approved by a positive resolution of both Houses.  Moreover, any boundary alteration proposal would apply purely to the local government administrative jurisdiction.  Contrary to an impression that has been given by a degree of publicity, a boundary alteration, were it to take place, would have no effect whatsoever on sporting affiliations, such as, for example, how GAA clubs are organised.  Indeed there are notable examples in the North and South of where GAA club affiliations depart from local government boundaries and where clubs located in one county compete in a neighbouring county.</p> <p>The establishment of independent statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Westmeath and Roscommon and elsewhere is a natural development, building on the measures announced in the action plan for effective local government in 2012 and subsequently provided for in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  I hope this is of some benefit to the Senator.</p> <p>Feedback thus far suggests that the revised structures and measures implemented by this Government are generally operating well and I imagine the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will look forward to studying the various reports, including the report relating to counties Westmeath and Roscommon, to assess whether further adjustment is necessary.  No decision has been taken yet.</p></speech>

If Roscommon is deprived of the rates that are generated in the Monksland area, it will put the funding of County Roscommon in serious jeopardy.  There is no question about that.  If that area is annexed from Roscommon, the rates will be collected and spent in that area.  By the way, the Connacht side of Athlone is one of the most deprived areas in the country.  Indeed it is no great credit to the county council in Westmeath that the area has been neglected.  The people there would be far better off if the area was transferred under the responsibility of Roscommon County Council.  It would be more logical; to Connacht for Connacht, not to hell or to Connacht.</p> <p>I am unsure whether the Minister of State is aware of the deep feeling on the matter - perhaps she is aware of it in Cork.  I appeal to all the candidates of all the parties, including Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Renua and Fianna F&aacute;il, to come together, unite and make this one of the issues, along with the hospital and other issues, of the general election campaign.  No candidate can go before the people without committing to support the retention of our beloved County Roscommon.</p></speech>

However, no one can be certain that this will happen.  I imagine the arguments made by public representatives and the public in general will be taken into consideration.  In the event, that is one of the elements that will have to be considered.</p> <p>As I have said, no decision has been made.  There has been no definitive instruction in terms of a "Yes" or "No".  It is simply an overview to take a look at what is best in terms of effectiveness in respect of local government and what is best for the county in terms of economic development.  As Senator Leyden rightly pointed out there are areas in every county which have an abundance of wealth and other areas which are greatly deprived.  This type of adjustment has to be taken into consideration as well.</p></speech>

Equally important, I have found her to be a listening Minister of State who persists and perseveres, sometimes against the head, as she did in the case of community nursing homes - I am keen to put that on the record.  The nursing homes in Abbeyleix and Shaen in Portlaoise were earmarked for closure, but, thanks to the intervention of the Minister State, Deputy Lynch, she was able to secure the funding to invest in these important community nursing homes.  This ensures they were upgraded and brought up the HIQA standard and rules.  She saved the day for the elderly and the communities of Laois.  I wish to acknowledge that on the record today.</p> <p>Today, I have a bleak warning for the Minister of State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Whelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The National Ambulance Service, NAS, is overstretched, under-resourced and understaffed to the point of lives being put at risk.  I make no bones about saying that.  It is a difficult job at the best of times and a stressful one on a good day.  It is intense work.  The service is often the lifeline between the community and life-saving medical intervention at a hospital, including surgery.</p><p>The service cannot cope with the demands being placed on it.  I do not raise this matter lightly and I have witnessed what is happening at first hand.  How is it possible that a hospital as large as the one in Portlaoise, which serves a large catchment area that includes south Kildare, north Tipperary and the entire midlands, is often left without any ambulance cover whatsoever?  That is the reality.  In the past fortnight, ambulances from Portlaoise were dispatched to places as far away as Enniscorthy to pick up the slack resulting from a lack of ambulances covering Kilkenny, Carlow and Waterford.  How can this be possible?  Ambulances from Portlaoise have been dispatched to Carrick-on-Suir in south Tipperary, leaving the midlands without ambulance cover for hours on end.  This is not acceptable or sustainable.</p><p>Ambulance drivers and paramedics are at their wits' end and are being stretched beyond belief.  I witnessed this before Christmas at a commemoration of UN veterans in Portlaoise.  A man collapsed at the event within a mile of Portlaoise hospital but there was still no ambulance after 45 minutes because the vehicles had been dispatched to elsewhere.  However, paramedics who had been attending the commemoration - it was an Army and Air Corps event - had the skills and training necessary to resuscitate and save him.  He had to be brought to hospital in a car after they deemed him fit to be moved.  No ambulance was available.  I am not making up stories or crying wolf.  The ambulance service cannot operate at its current staffing and resourcing levels.</p><p>This issue is feeding into doubts about the future of and safety and staffing levels at Portlaoise hospital.  There are question marks over the 24-7 accident and emergency unit.  In an unprecedented move this week, Laois general practitioners, GPs, raised questions about why the HSE had not come forward with a plan to commit to the hospital's future status, including a 24-7 accident and emergency service of which the ambulance service would be a core part.  That announcement was supposed to be made in September but the issue has been fudged and long-fingered until after the election.  This is not acceptable and I will not countenance any situation in which the ambulance service in Portlaoise is diminished or under-resourced further or where there is any question of a threat of undermining the hospital's status, its 24-7 accident and emergency service and the proper resourcing and staffing of same.</p></speech>

In my personal experience and that of a close family member, however, the ambulance or pre-hospital care was fascinating and incredible.  The Senator is right about staff ensuring that people are stabilised by the time they reach hospital instead of facing into the awful dash that is usually the case following a serious incident.</p> <p>I am pleased to be able to outline to the House current developments in pre-hospital emergency care services in the midlands and nationally.  The NAS is working to ensure the provision of high-quality and timely pre-hospital emergency care services, using all available resources as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p> <p>As with any complex modern health service, development and modernisation form an ongoing process as technology and clinical standards change.  A significant and ongoing reform programme has been under way in recent years.  Funding of &euro;7.2 million has been provided this year to ensure that response times are maintained, including &euro;2 million to recruit and train extra staff and expand the community first responder scheme, which trains local volunteer groups to respond to cardiac emergencies.  Last year saw the opening of the national emergency operations centre, NEOC, in Tallaght and the establishment of a single national control system.  This project is delivering improved technology to improve response times.  Developments such as national digital radio, national computer-aided dispatch, mobile data and electronic patient care reporting will allow the NAS to deploy resources more effectively and efficiently.</p> <p>The emergency aeromedical support service, EAS, was permanently established in 2015.  It ensures that seriously ill or injured people in remote areas have timely access to appropriate clinical care.  While targeted mainly in the west where road networks may not allow for timely transport to hospital, the EAS can be tasked anywhere in the State.  More than 1,200 EAS missions have been completed since June 2012.  The intermediate care service, ICS, which was set up to provide transfer for non-emergency patients between hospitals, allows emergency vehicles to focus on emergency calls.  In October 2015, 88% of the inter-hospital transfers previously carried out by ambulances were handled by the ICS.</p> <p>It is important to note that the model of service delivery for our ambulance service has changed.  It is no longer considered appropriate for an ambulance station to provide services only to its own area.  For this reason, the ambulance service is moving to dynamic deployment, whereby all resources in a region are deployed across that region as a single fleet in response to demand.  This means that, in the midlands, services are provided across the region from Tullamore to Edenderry, Longford, Mullingar, Athlone, Birr and Portlaoise.  Services in the region have been enhanced with additional staff based at Edenderry ambulance station in order to provide additional cover.  The introduction of a rapid response vehicle in Tullamore further augments services.  New rostering arrangements for the region have been agreed between the NAS and trade unions and will lead to greater efficiencies in the service.</p> <p>The Senator can rest assured that the Government intends to drive further improvements in pre-hospital emergency care that will benefit the people of the midlands and the rest of the country.  From personal experience, I know those involved to be an incredible group of people who deserve our support.  I hope that, with our finances improving, we will be able to invest in the service further.</p></speech>

I also second her sentiments regarding the professionalism, commitment and hard and vital work of ambulance crews.  However, I have first-hand knowledge of the crews in Portlaoise being understaffed and overstretched.  I understand them operating within a region or catchment area, but I cannot understand how Enniscorthy and Carrick-on-Suir fall into Portlaoise's area.  It does not make sense, either in terms of safety or the useful deployment of resources and services.</p> <p>In the case that I mentioned, a man collapsed - almost fatally - within a mile of the hospital on a Sunday morning but no ambulance was available.  That makes no sense.  There are issues with resourcing and staffing.  While a central hub in Tallaght may work efficiently and effectively from an accounting point of view, we must consider whether it is effective from the point of view of patient safety and patient care, with particular regard to the status of Portlaoise hospital and the demands placed on it by the size of the population that it serves.</p></speech>

Our thoughts should be with the two parents in question as well as other parents.  The concentration on Portlaoise and the midlands area must be continued.  It will include the ambulance service.</p> <p>The Senator is right to raise this issue, as additional investment is required.  With the economy improving, I hope that this investment will be made available.</p></speech>

I wish to preface my remarks by stating that, in general, the State has been well served by the Judiciary since its foundation.  I am aware there are issues such as, for example, whether we would be better served by having the continental inquisitorial system rather than blindly following the very costly adversarial system we have, which is a throwback to our colonial occupation.  There is also an issue around appointing multimillionaire barristers to the Judiciary.  There should be a debate on a system whereby people, on foot of education and appropriate qualifications, would see the Judiciary as a career in itself and enter it through those educational qualifications.</p> <p>My purpose this morning is to inquire about the position with the judicial council.  It is over ten years since a group of members of the Oireachtas justice committee visited the United States to look at the Judicial Council of Massachusetts.  We returned quite enthused about it.  We met with the supreme court justice there who told us how the state's judiciary was accountable to its peers through the judicial council system.  Subsequently, I inquired about it on a number of occasions, as it was a decision of the Government to pursue that course.  However, it was opposed by some elements within the Judiciary.  Is it still being stalled or opposed by vested interests?  I heard the comments of the Supreme Court Chief Justice in this regard and she appears to be quite supportive of the idea.  In particular, I am anxious to know what precautions have been put in place in the absence of a judicial council.</p> <p>The economic downturn affected people rather badly because of the large amount of liquidity they had financially.  Many were heavily borrowed and lost a great deal through investments.  There were questions as to whether some would be bankrupt or become insolvent, although I have not seen much evidence of that.  There is no reason to believe that the Judiciary would have been immune from the effects of the downturn.  The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct are clear.  Under principle 2.5, a judge shall disqualify himself or herself if it may appear to a reasonable observer that the judge is unable to decide the matter impartially.  This would include, for example, where the judge or a member of the judge's family has an economic interest in the outcome of the matter in controversy.  There have been suggestions, which might be untrue, that some judges, like people throughout society, were heavily borrowed and if they were adjudicating on bank creditors appearing before them there would appear to be an element, perhaps, of conflict of interest.</p> <p>I am sure the judge would disqualify themselves from hearing such cases but in the absence of a judicial council we cannot rely on that.  Given the severity with which the downturn has affected people, it is important that the Government would have taken some initiatives but, given how slow the Government was to deal with the bankruptcy and insolvency issue, I am not confident that it has done that.  Principle 4.7 of the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct is very interesting.  It states that a judge shall inform himself or herself about the judge's personal and fiduciary financial interests and shall make reasonable efforts to be informed about the financial interests of members of the judge's family.</p> <p>In conclusion, in a republic everybody is equal before the law.  There should be no unaccountable elites anywhere in our society.  I am seeking an accountability system in this area.  We saw what happened with Justice Hugh O'Flaherty who resigned, very honourably, in circumstances where most people said that what he did was perhaps wrong but was not a resigning matter.  Another judge, Judge Brian Curtin, did not resign and got a considerable amount of money from the State in circumstances where it appeared that there should have been no hesitation in a resignation.  The independence of the Judiciary is fundamental, but that independence is not just independence from the Executive but also from other influence.  Will the Minister outline to the House the precautions this Government has taken to ensure that nothing untoward might have happened during the course of this difficult economic climate, in which many people found themselves in straitened financial circumstances before the courts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his interesting contribution.  I am not certain that much of it has anything to do with the question in hand, but I take his point.  I am never certain about the equality before the law either.  If there was true equality before the law, those who are called as witnesses would not have their title disclosed when they are called.  It has an undue influence from time to time, as if somehow their evidence is more pertinent than that of the rest of us old sops who do not have any titles.  With regard to the American system, while this might be a good idea I am not sure that we would take on many of its other practices.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who cannot be here today, I acknowledge the importance of the matters to which the Senator refers.  We are very lucky in this country that our Judiciary is independent and acts with great integrity.  We can all agree that an independent Judiciary, the integrity of which is beyond question, is fundamental to the working of our democracy and essential in terms of upholding the rule of law upon which all our citizens rely.  The Senator will be aware that Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution states that a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his or her removal.  This constitutional process has been extended by statute to the question of removal and dismissal of Circuit and District Court judges.  That is an improvement.  Otherwise, with the exception of statutory provisions dealing with investigating and reprimanding judges of the District Court, there is no means of investigating or dealing with allegations which are not sufficiently serious to merit the invocation of the constitutional provisions.  Both this and previous Governments have been conscious of the fact that there is a need for an alternative structure to be put in place to deal with allegations of this nature and the development of such a structure is a key driver behind the Judicial Council Bill.</p> <p>The current draft of the Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council and board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.  It will also provide a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct.  In this context, a judicial conduct committee, which will have lay representation, will be established.  Finally, it will facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges through a judicial studies committee and through the establishment of judicial support committees.  I assure the Senator that there is no hidden agenda behind the fact that the Bill has yet to be published.  It is a regrettable reality that the finalisation of the Bill has had to give way to other pressing priorities in the legislative area, but the Government remains firmly of the view that it is of the utmost importance that this legislation be advanced within a speedy time frame.  I should add that the various drafts of the Bill have benefited from review by the Judiciary, who have considered it as part of the work of the interim judicial council which has been established pending the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.</p> <p>Finally, with specific reference to the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, those principles enshrine key values relating to independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety, equality, competence and diligence which, in many ways, are self-evident characteristics of a properly functioning judicial system.  It is to be anticipated that any future guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics will be reflective of those principles.  This would not be surprising since the Government would have every confidence that judicial conduct, at present, accords with these principles and, indeed, the Government would not support any implication that values such as independence and integrity are not intrinsic to the way in which our courts operate.  I believe the Senator would agree with that.</p></speech>

She will get her chance to speak.  It is obvious to any objective observer why she did not address that in her reply.  She mentioned no timeframe.  We know it is going to fall, so in fact it has been long-fingered.  It is reminiscent of the dereliction of this and the last Government in failing to implement the recommendations of the report from the Competition Authority in 2006 which specified that increased competition was needed for consumers of legal services.  The troika and others emphasised that, and I know the members of the troika were still pressing it at their most recent meeting here.  This is evidence of a failure to recognise what the priorities should be.  The Minister of State's reply rings very hollow.  She stated that it was "of the utmost importance that the legislation be advanced within a speedy timeframe," but we have been bloody well waiting ten years for it.  Whoever writes this kind of gobbledegook should be brought to heel.  If someone in the House takes the matter seriously, it is not good enough to come back with a reply like this.  It does the Minister of State no justice.  I know it is not her fault, as she is in the Department of Health, but it reflects badly on the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are very well aware from the report last year that we have a dysfunctional Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

We should be very conscious of that.  We are fortunate with the people who work in the administration of democracy in this country.  There are other countries we could name here, of which the Senator will know a few, that are not as fortunate in their civil and public servants as we are.  I was reared with the ethos that one should never judge others by one's own standards.  No one sitting on our benches every day of the week to administer justice operates only in his or her own self-interest.</p></speech>

It was more efficient and effective.  I am not speaking on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Leader could consider it in light of the current situation and the fact that an election is pending, which makes it more difficult to keep the House going than in normal times.</p> <p>Regarding the review of the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, the appointment of the former Chief Justice and Attorney General, John Murray, will bring great experience to the field.  However, the scope of the review has been restricted to access to the phone records of journalists, and does not include politicians.  Why would a politician's phone be tapped?  Why has the situation been left in doubt?  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to extend the scope of the review.  It has been brought to my attention that some legal firms are very concerned about client confidentiality.  A solicitor who feels his phone is being tapped has contacted me.  I ask the Minister to extend the remit of the review to politicians and members of the legal profession, whether barristers or solicitors.  Confining it to journalists is an inadequate response to the situation.  Approximately 6,000 phones were tapped in 2014.  It is a terrible infringement of human rights that confidential phone calls can be interfered with and listened to and the information distributed around GSOC and whoever else is involved.</p> <p>The Minister has taken the issue seriously by appointing the former Chief Justice, John Murray.  The remit of the review could be extended further to allow for the concerns expressed to me by members of the legal profession to be dealt with.  The relationship between a solicitor or barrister and a client is very special.  It is like a confessional situation and should not be infringed by the State, GSOC or any other agency of the State.</p></speech>

I look forward to replies from colleagues.  I hope that by the end of the week, if I have agreement from all group leaders, we can table the motion as an all-party motion from all Senators on this very important and pressing issue for so many people across Ireland.</p><p>I welcome the fact that former Chief Justice, John Murray, is to conduct a review of the legislation allowing access to journalists' phone records.  I note that the review is somewhat circumscribed and limited in its remit and that there is a time limit of three months on it.  It is important that we have a tight timeframe.  It might be difficult to expand its remit and still expect a report within three months.  Clearly, there are concerns that are broader than the issue of access by GSOC to journalists' phone records.  I note the revelations in <i>The Irish Times</i>today that 62,000 requests or applications were made, mostly by members of the Garda, for access to phone and Internet data over five years to the end of 2012, so clearly there is a bigger issue here.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The impact of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 needs to be considered in more detail and I welcome that the Data Protection Commissioner has announced an audit of Garda and GSOC access to phone data.  There are other reviews ongoing or which will be put in train apart from the review announced yesterday.  I welcome the assurance of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, that she has not personally authorised tapping of journalists' phone calls.  It is important we know that.  I also welcome the news that the new chairperson of the GSOC, the eminent former High Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, has said the ombudsman acted within the law at all times.  A number of issues are being brought to light around surveillance, access to phone records and Internet data which deserve further consideration.</p><p>I also welcome the approval for publication of the statute law revision Bill 2016 which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced yesterday.  This Bill will repeal 300 pieces of outdated legislation and is an important tidying up or codification of our statute law, which is an issue about which I have spoken many times.</p><p>Tonight in the House I look forward to introducing a very important Private Members' Bill in Labour Party Private Members' time which I will be proposing and Senator Aideen Hayden will be seconding, namely, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2016 which seeks to expand the rights of collective bargaining for workers.  It is a Bill that has been sought by trade unions for some years.  I have been working on it for some years and I know the introduction of the Bill is being welcomed by SIPTU, the NUJ and Irish Equity, among others.  Colleagues will be aware that the operation of the Competition Act 2002, in particular, restricts the capacity of unions to negotiate on behalf of freelance members, such as freelance actors or journalists, in setting pay rates.  The Bill seeks to exempt certain groups of workers from the prohibition in competition law against price fixing.  We are trying to take the middle ground to ensure there is no detriment to the consumer because the Competition Act is concerned with consumer protection.  I am happy to provide a briefing on the Bill to any Members who wish to have one in advance of its introduction at 5 p.m.  Members of the unions affected will be present in the Gallery tonight to see the Bill debated on Second Stage.  It is an important plank of the Labour Party policy and it should receive a general welcome from across the House as well as from the Minister.</p></speech>

We will all be out on the hustings in the next couple of weeks or months seeking the support of city and county councillors to re-elect us to this House and we cannot face them without at least doing them the courtesy of pursuing one of these motions.  I suggest motion 10, tabled by the Government and with an amendment by myself and Senators Barrett, Quinn and Norris.  It is the very least we can do, and if we are not going to do it, I ask the Leader to explain why.  I have no fear of facing the country and standing up for the people I represent and who represent their localities.  I have no fear whatsoever about fighting their corner for them.

It came as a result of a meeting with the Alcohol Health Alliance, which is spearheaded by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and Alcohol Action Ireland.  If anybody wishes to look at the lobbying register, it will be very clear that the meeting was about Drinkaware, although in the newspapers this morning, Drinkaware was trying to distance itself from the drinks industry.  Drinkaware is 100% funded by the drinks industry and is the drinks industry in costume.  The announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills is about the work of any guise or costume the drinks industry chooses to wear.  Will the Leader to convey our thanks and appreciation to the Minister for Education and Skills and to make this point clear?</p> <p>Will the Leader also ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if he would consider talking to the Road Safety Authority to ask it to cease its relationship with the drinks industry because it is absurd that it has any relationship with the drinks industry given the road safety issues we were discussing in this House yesterday?  There is no place for the drinks industry to be using the bodies of the State to say it is doing their work while, on the other hand, blocking the essential work that is happening on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill which is currently progressing through this House.  Will the Leader to take his example from the HSE, something we do not hear every day in this House?  The HSE came out with a policy last year ceasing all relationship with the drinks industry.  It has a role which is to make money for its shareholders and it should go ahead and do that but it should not be involved in public health or public awareness campaigns as it has no role to play in those.</p></speech>

Narrowing the tax base and taking so many people out of it, even at a time of boom, came back to haunt that Government.  The current Government has been putting forward the view, particularly in recent months, that it is going to manage the national finances prudently, but that seems to have been blown out of the water by the IMF report that is in the newspapers today raising serious concerns, which apply to all parties going into this general election, about further reductions in or erosion to the tax base.  Deputy Michael McGrath, when launching the Fianna F&aacute;il position on finance last week, made it clear that we were not going to engage in auction politics but would ensure we would act in the national interest in the matter of the financing of the State.  Despite the fact we put forward proposals on easing the tax burden on those experiencing financial adversity through the USC, we believe we have taken a very prudent course.  I do not believe the people will take well to the attempts by the Labour Party and Fine Gael to buy off votes in the forthcoming general election by further eroding the tax base.  Who is going to pay for the services?  Without a sufficiently coherent and viable tax base, who will pay for more schools, better hospital services and better services generally to help those with a disability and those who are unable to fend for themselves?  I am putting this on the record because after the general election - and please God I will be back in this House - I hope I will not be saying "I told you so" in the context of a downturn in economic performance.  We are on a knife edge economically.  We rely on a weak euro and on dynamic UK and US economies, but international economic commentators are pointing out that the world is going into a downturn.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fact, some economists, particularly those attached to the Royal Bank of Scotland in the past few weeks, have advised investors to sell everything, including shares and bonds.  They have put forward an apocalyptic scenario.  I do not subscribe to that view but, then again, maybe I am something of an optimist and hoping that things will work out.  I am merely putting it on the record.  I would be interested in the Leader's response.</p></speech>

The matter relates to the 123 complaints that were made in relation to emergency accommodation.  Those complaints and their outcome were made available to RTE under an FOI request.  What perhaps was not brought into the public domain was the acknowledgement by all concerned that the complaints had been fully investigated and resolved in a timely fashion.  It is important to acknowledge the professional role played by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, which acts on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities in what have been difficult circumstances over the past two years in the area of homelessness, and to say that the 123 complaints related not solely to private accommodation but to accommodation provided by statutory providers and NGOs as well.  Those were 123 complaints out of approximately 9,000 unique placements in the Dublin region for homeless emergency accommodation and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive is playing a valuable role in homelessness in the city of Dublin.</p> <p>I welcome a recent announcement by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that mediation between landlords and tenants which is conducted through the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, will now be free.  This is an important step forward in the landlord and tenant relationship.  It encourages a non-aggressive approach in an effort to bring understanding between the parties which, quite often, is most needed between landlords and tenants when there are conflicts.  It is important to bear in mind that most landlord and tenant relationships are happy and never end up in conflict.  Encouraging the use of mediation is important because one is dealing with a home and ensuring that the relationship between the landlord and tenant goes forward in an amicable manner is best achieved by mediation.</p> <p>I also welcome another issue that went slightly unnoticed.  Mortgage interest relief has been increased to 100% for landlords who rent their properties to tenants who are in receipt of social welfare, whether it be rent supplement, housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, payments.  As far back as 2002, fewer than 50% of landlords were willing to rent to tenants on social welfare.  We really need to address that issue.  The bottom line is it is difficult for tenants in receipt of social welfare supports to obtain housing and anything that can be done to encourage landlords in that direction is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

It is interesting to hear Senators from the other side talk about issues surrounding homelessness and that type of thing.  What did the Senators expect when the Government built no houses during its lifetime?  I refer to five years where the housing stock throughout every local authority has been allowed to decline and does not meet the demand.  The Government was bound to end up with this crisis, it was foreseen and the Government has not dealt with it.  The same may be said of hospitals.  In Wexford General Hospital, for example, I have experience recently of where young children looking for an appointment for routine issues with a paediatrician are waiting eight months.  </p> <p>Some issues are not so routine.  I refer to girls who had the HPV vaccine where the HSE is in denial of the consequences, with many suffering chronic fatigue and other issues and having to wait eight months when they are having difficulty in attending school.  It may well be past the start of the following school year, in September, before they will be seen by a consultant to get treatment for their condition.  It simply is not good enough.  </p> <p>We have seen issues in the bankruptcy area and in the banks, where those on mortgages are at the mercy of the Judiciary.  On the banks, it is simply not good enough.  This Government has failed to stand by the ordinary person, whether he or she is in need of housing, whether he or she is in need of some sort of fairness from the system with regard to his or her borrowings, or whether he or she needs medical attention.  It is an area of dereliction over five years.</p> <p>I will comment on the point made by Senator Leyden with regard to GSOC.  We all realise that we are living in times where our security and safety was never more challenged.  This applies right across the western world, and particularly in Africa and the Arab world.  The Garda must be equipped to carry out surveillance within a defined area to protect people's safety, and there should be no exclusions from that for politicians, journalists or anybody else.  That should be prioritised.  It will be too late if we have a number of people killed because of a failure of intelligence to be able to introduce precautions or protect us against this.  Given the times in which we live, we need to circumscribe the area where phones can be tapped and the type of information that can be obtained, and then ensure that applies evenhandedly and fairly and is subject subsequently to review.</p></speech>

No doubt this will further enhance the improvement of the urban environment and further revitalisation.  This sustainable development recognises that our towns are the engine of the regional economy and are very important for our further growth.  When there was a scheme for urban backlands regeneration 20 years or more ago, it did considerable good but it was not fully taken up in many towns.  It is important at this time that this grant aid is coming from the European Regional Development Fund and I greatly welcome it.</p> <p>As regards our electorate, the Leader will be aware that my views, and perhaps his own and others' views, are very well known to the Minister.  Now that so many have found that matters are improving for them, and they have greatly assisted in many ways, it may be past time that segment of our electorate saw improvements too given the cutbacks, etc., that they suffered in recent years when we were going through such a recession.  They continue to make a valuable contribution.  I would urge the Leader that we deal next week with that all-party motion, No. 75, motion 10, which is on the Order Paper.</p></speech>

I have been working on this for the past year and a half.  I consulted comprehensively with the SNAs, trade unions, principals, school boards of management, the Department of Education and Skills, disability groups, children's groups, students and parents.  Indeed, I was delighted that more than 2,500 SNAs responded to an online survey I undertook.  In all, I make 13 recommendations in the report.  The first point that struck me was that the minimum qualifications required at present to be an SNA in school are a mere three Ds in the junior certificate.  In fact, when I looked at the survey, 99% of the SNAs in schools at present have far in excess of secondary education.  Indeed, some have degrees, some have master's and a few who responded had PhDs.  The level of qualification is far higher.  One of my main recommendations is that we apply standardisation and demand a level of qualification to be an SNA in a school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Moran:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2388"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2388&amp;amp;pid=MaryMoran&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is striking that throughout the whole survey and report there is evidence of different standards and expectations for SNAs in schools throughout the State.  Many SNAs report that they do feel respected in their work, but there were some who had concerns which will need to be addressed.  I will be asking the Department of Education and Skills to take stock immediately of the recommendations in the report.  One area of particular concern is the primary role of the SNA and the care needs of children.  In some cases SNAs are being asked to supervise children when the teachers are out, to take the classroom and undertake duties that are not part of the SNA role.  Other concerns are SNAs reporting that they are carrying out medical procedures, including catheterisation, for which they have no training.  This is an urgent measure which will need to be addressed.</p><p>I welcome to the House the civic, social and political education, CSPE students and their teachers from St. Louis secondary school in Dundalk.

When the country was on its knees in 2012 and we were haemorrhaging jobs, the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched with a target of helping to foster an environment in which to create 100,000 jobs between then and 2016.  Thankfully the target was reached and surpassed and we are seeing the growth of 135,000 jobs created since 2012.  The ambitious targets which have been set in the fifth annual plan, the first phase of this new action plan for 2016 to 2020, are for 200,000 extra jobs by the year 2020.</p> <p>There are some interesting concepts within the plan which are to be welcomed, including a commitment that by 2017 all Government transactions with businesses will be available online.  This will impact on 370 Government transactions with 185,000 businesses throughout the State.  Following the roll-out of the regional plans, further actions to support regional growth will be supported by &euro;530 million in funding.</p> <p>Despite all the good news and the 1,200 new jobs announced today by various companies in the State, there are still problems in parts of the State and we need to accelerate measures to spread the recovery into the regions and into the more peripheral towns and villages.  In this context it would be appropriate to invite the Minister to the House for a final debate during the lifetime of the Seanad to discuss the &euro;150 million in new funding to be made available for research and development.  The debate might also give us all more guidance on how we can assist and help companies in our regions to draw down and leverage these funds.</p></speech>

I approached Mr. Barroso and he said "No", that he was going to stay away from that issue.  However, an interesting development occurred during the past week.  The disadvantage of Easter falling on a date which could change in range by 35 days from one year to the next has resulted in the Archbishop of Canterbury calling on the different European churches to get together on the matter.  This year in particular, from Ireland's perspective, with St. Patrick's Day and Easter falling so close together, the school holidays are stretching to three weeks.  I understand it cannot be dealt with in this House, but it is a matter on which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could approach Europe, or indeed the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe could initiate the discussion.  It could be asked if there is a future on the subject and if something could be done.  Engagement would be needed with churches, such as the Coptic Church and the Church of England among others, and with the Pope.  There would be many benefits to fixing the date of Easter and it would be a shame to just ignore it and not do anything about it.</p> <p>I turn now to the ban in the United States of America on soap body washes and toothpastes which contain microbeads.  I did not know a lot about microbeads but they do not get filtered by wastewater treatment plants.  The beads are discharged directly into rivers, lakes and the oceans.  Microbeads are highly damaging to the natural environment and its wildlife.  Natural alternatives exist and banning the use of microbeads in personal care products makes sense.  The Wildlife Conservation Society has called for this and we should also consider a ban.  The United States of America has banned their use but we still allow microbeads and we should consider what might be done about the situation.</p></speech>

Perhaps some of us may be back, but that is in the lap of the gods.  </p><p>The Senator also raised, as did Senators Walsh and Bacik, the review of GSOC's access to telephone records.  There is genuine concern about the balance in our law between the important freedom of journalists to pursue legitimate matters of public interest and, indeed, the basic right of persons not to have their personal information improperly disclosed.  While bodies investigating crime need to have the appropriate statutory powers available to them to carry out their duties, we need to examine the balance in respect of the integrity or the legitimacy of the journalistic activity being carried out in the public interest.  The Senator has welcomed, as have all Senators, the appointment of the judge to look into this situation and carry out a review.  The matter needs to be reviewed.  I hope the judge will have sufficient time to come back with a report that will be acceptable to all.</p><p>Senator Bacik mentioned the motion on cystic fibrosis that we will table next week, hopefully with the support of all parties.

This was raised by a number of Senators during yesterday's Order of Business, when they welcomed the allocations.  I certainly welcome the &euro;4 million allocation to my own city of Waterford from the fund.</p> <p>Senator van Turnhout mentioned the Drinkaware campaign and the drinks industry.  She welcomed the decision made by the Minister of Education and Skills to refuse access to schools  for Drinkaware.  The Senator pointed out that there is no room for the drinks industry in schools and when it comes to road safety.  </p> <p>Senator Mooney mentioned the narrowing of the tax base.  Of course we look at what the European institutions advise in terms of narrowing the tax base.  It is the Government's policy to create more and better jobs and to get more people at work.  The more people we have at work, the more money we have for the services that the Senator talked about and for all our public services.  The recovery is fragile; there is no question about it, as the Senator said.  We need stability to make progress on work and the tax base, rather than instability and chaos, which is what we would have if some parties were in power.  I note what he has said about the tax base.</p> <p>Senator Hayden referred to accommodation for homeless people and outlined many relevant facts.  She commended the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on its excellent work in this area. </p> <p>Senator Walsh, who is not here at present, called for a new Government.  That is a decision for the people to make and will happen fairly soon.  I remind him that his party is still a party of high tax and high spending.  The people will decide whether to return this Government to power or bring in a new one, as he suggests.</p> <p>Senator Moran mentioned the report on special needs assistants.  We look forward to reading the report and its recommendations.  I do not know whether it will be possible to have a debate on the issue before the end of term, but I recommend that everyone read the report when it is published.  Senator Mullins called for a debate on the Action Plan for Jobs and welcomed the new funding of &euro;150 million for research and development.</p> <p>There have been requests for a number of debates to be held in the House.  We will have a full schedule next week in terms of legislation, so it will be difficult to slot in statements on various issues.  I will do my best to see how we can facilitate that.</p> <p>Senator Quinn mentioned the possibility of having a fixed date for Easter.  It is an issue that I have read about and it was raised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.  It is right that we should initiate discussions in Europe on that.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Minister.  The Senator also mentioned microbeads in soap and toothpaste, which have recently been banned in America, and particularly their effects on wildlife.  He has raised the matter at an opportune time, because we will debate the Heritage Bill later today.  The Senator will have an opportunity to mention the issue to the Minister during that debate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#P00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Seanad on the subject of flooding and flood risk management.  I look forward to a constructive discussion and debate which will inform the Government&rsquo;s approach to managing flood risk in the future.</p> <p>As we all know, flooding is a natural phenomenon and in recent weeks we have all seen the devastating impact it can have on communities.  At the start of this debate, my first thoughts and words must be with those who have suffered because of the dreadful storms and floods of the last month.  I refer in particular to those families whose homes have been flooded, marooned or evacuated, those whose livelihoods have been threatened and those who have spent long, anxious days and nights, over a holiday period during what should have been a joyous period for many families, waiting and assessing the possible impact of the latest weather forecast. </p> <p>The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Government Ministers and I have visited many of those affected, witnessing at first hand the devastation to their peace of mind and, unfortunately, in many cases their property.  The impacts of flooding do not discriminate and all parts of society were affected.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government stands with the people and communities affected and will give them every support and assistance possible as they set about rebuilding their lives, but will also go further in considering the long-term measures we can take to, where possible, protect communities and mitigate against the impact of flooding.</p> <p>I want to mention, in particular, the local volunteers who gave up their own comfort and time with their families over the Christmas period to give practical and emotional support to their neighbours and communities.  The true strength of people sometimes shines in its best light during the worst of circumstances.  We all saw this from people helping with sandbagging, providing clothes, drinks, meals and accommodation.  There is no doubt that, without that support, the impact of the floods would have been more serious.  </p> <p>The Government&rsquo;s response has involved almost every arm of the State.  In particular, I acknowledge the outstanding work and dedication of the staff of the local authorities, Met &Eacute;ireann, the Office of Public Works, OPW, members of our Defence Forces, the Civil Defence, the Coast Guard and the Irish Red Cross, which worked endlessly and tirelessly throughout Christmas in the most difficult of circumstances.</p> <p>Of particular note has been the extent of the inter-agency co-operation which includes the Defence Forces.  There have been approximately 2,700 Defence Forces deployments throughout the period of severe weather to assist local authorities.  In addition, local authorities continue to work together to share resources, staff, plant and equipment, including pumps and sandbags.  The floods led to almost 600 households being evacuated.  It is no comfort to those waiting to reoccupy their homes that the co-ordinated response by communities and Government prevented even greater damage from being inflicted.</p> <p>Since the start of December, ESB Networks has reconnected over 350,000 customers, often in very poor weather conditions.  Irish Water responded to 200 incidents where there was a risk to the delivery of drinking water and wastewater services.  The storms resulted in 15,000 calls for assistance to local authority helplines.  From the start of these storms, the Government made clear it would and, indeed, did provide all necessary help and support to the communities affected not alone in terms of the immediate practical and physical help I referred to earlier, but also the practical financial assistance that was required.</p> <p>For example, the Department of Social Protection was available in affected areas to advise on the vital financial help available through the humanitarian assistance scheme.  At the start of this week, emergency payments have been made to some 360 households, with expenditure of over &euro;344,000 to date.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has introduced several critical measures to address the impact of the storms and flooding on farms.  These include relaxing the rules around the movement of livestock, guidance on flooded slurry tanks, the deferral of inspections and the provision of emergency feed.  In view of the likely long-term damage to fodder supplies, a fodder aid scheme for flooded areas has also been introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  </p> <p>As Senators on both sides of the House will know, small businesses were badly hit, particularly those that could not access flood insurance.  The Government targeted those businesses with a simple, but effective, scheme operated by the Irish Red Cross.  I again reiterate my thanks to it for facilitating the scheme.  The Government initially made &euro;5 million available to that scheme for businesses, and has now extended it to include community, voluntary and sporting organisations which suffered flood damage.  At the start of this week, the Irish Red Cross indicated that a total of 219 applications have been received and &euro;530,000 has been disbursed so far under the first stage of the scheme.  Getting immediate payments to people, albeit relatively small payments, without having to jump through too many bureaucratic hoops was the Government's priority, which could not have been facilitated without the co-operation of local authorities and the Irish Red Cross.  </p> <p>Dealing with a flooding event requires resources during the event and after for the associated clean-up.  Undoubtedly, the greatest burden and responsibility for the clean-up will fall on local authorities.  In addition to the &euro;18 million already allocated, the Government has asked local authorities to estimate the damage caused to public infrastructure.  Many roads and bridges were damaged or, in some instances, swept away.  Once compiled, the Government has made it clear that this will be addressed in terms of the funding required by local authorities.  </p> <p>Under the Government&rsquo;s new capital investment plan, the programme of investment will be stepped up considerably, with over &euro;430 million earmarked for flood defences by 2021.  I want to be very clear about this because some people have sought to make a political gain out of this crisis.  We will spend more on flood defences over the next five years than we, as a country, have spent over the past 20 years.  For what is it is worth, that includes the entire period of the Celtic tiger.  We are investing in flood defences and there is no shortfall of money.  People should stop scaring the public.  It would be nice if some were here to listen to us.</p> <p>In the next six years, the Government will invest more in flood defences than has been invested by Governments over the past 20 years.  That is our record in government.  The Government has already committed to schemes in Bandon and Crossmolina, two areas that were significantly impacted by flooding in recent weeks.  As a country, we have to prepare ourselves for extreme weather and become more resilient to the impacts of climate change.  We cannot hide from its reality.  </p> <p>Considerable progress has been made by the OPW on the CFRAM programme, Ireland's first national flood management plan.  This includes over 300 locations where the OPW is assessing whether flood defensive measures are required and feasible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This programme is central to the assessment of flood risk, planning for flood risk management and the subsequent implementation of feasible flood mitigation measures.</p><p>Following extensive public consultation, the CFRAM flood risk management plans will be finalised by the end of the year.  People have mentioned how these are required by the EU floods directive.  While we are happy to move towards compliance, we are going further by factoring in climate change and carrying out more consultation with communities than is required by the directive to ensure that we get the schemes right.</p><p>The CFRAM programme involves six study areas, one being the Shannon catchment, and has involved the OPW modelling 2,075 km of river.  The River Shannon co-ordination group, established by the Taoiseach in recent weeks, will draw on the full technical expertise of the OPW and co-ordinate the flood risk-related work of relevant bodies from local level to Departments and other State agencies.  The group's terms of reference will be published in the coming days.  It will have the necessary powers.  Its primary function will be to get on with the job of delivering flood relief plans in the 66 areas of the Shannon that have been identified as being at risk of flooding.  It will also ensure that each of the agencies involved publishes its work plans.  We will publish the minutes of the group's meetings, with those meetings occurring on a quarterly basis at least.  Furthermore, we will give the group the power and authority to make recommendations to the Government on legislative or regulatory changes.</p><p>Work on the CFRAM programme will contribute to the new flood forecasting and warning service.  It is vital that we have a long-term forecasting system, which we currently do not.  On 5 January, the Government decision to proceed with this service was announced.  We must also ensure that our planning system gives sufficient consideration to flood risk.  I have engaged with Senators on this matter in the past year and a half.  We know about the legacy of bad planning.  We must ensure that our planning system gives sufficient consideration to flood risk.  The OPW's CFRAM maps will be central to informing on the risks of flood plains and development.  It means that more evidence and greater common sense will have to be applied to planning decisions, which entails complying with the flood risk planning guidelines that were published in 2009.</p><p>The State's investment in new flood defences and its reforming of planning will deliver benefits to local communities that were traditionally affected by flooding.  Last week, I joined the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers in meeting the CEOs of the insurance industry to communicate to them the benefits of the OPW's flood defence schemes.  The meeting was constructive and the industry has agreed to provide additional data on the provision of cover and to consider further the particular issue of cover for areas protected where the State has invested in flood defences.  The industry must examine the question of demountables again.  Sometimes, they are the best or only viable solution.  They worked in towns during the recent storms.  It is not acceptable that insurance cover is not available where demountables have been installed and work.  I hope that the insurance industry will reflect on this, which it has undertaken to do.</p><p>A broader review by the Department of Finance of options for insurance for properties in flood areas is under way.  This will examine international best practice.  Whoever is in government this summer will have policy options, which I hope will be acted upon.  The Department's work in this regard, along with the current phase of engagement with the industry, will provide us with those policy options.</p><p>In recent weeks, I have visited many of the worst affected towns, from Bandon and Skibbereen to Crossmolina, Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown, Ballinasloe and, several times, Athlone.  I also visited areas in my constituency.  Besides showing me the devastation from flooding and the strength of people and communities, these visits highlighted how more than anything during these events people wanted an assurance that the Government could provide them with support in response to the flooding and that it was planning to mitigate the risk from flooding in the future.  I want to offer people that assurance.  The Government can provide it, and has done so.  It has responded with people and by supporting communities.  It has provided the funding for prioritised investment of feasible flood defence schemes and other flood protection measures.  This year, it will compete the plans, through the CFRAM programme, that will inform the prioritised investment.  I assure Senators on all sides of the House that the Government is working with those affected by flooding as they rebuild their lives, communities and businesses.</p><p>I thank the Senators who approached me - others will do so today - with examples of the practical actions that are required and feedback from their communities.  I assure the House of my willingness to work with all Senators in the interests of getting this right.  I pay tribute again to all of the agencies, volunteers and communities who worked so hard and gave so much support to one another in recent weeks.  Their efforts prevented even more devastating impacts from flooding.  They are the real heroes of what has been a national crisis.  I look forward to a constructive and informative debate.</p></speech>

One cannot imagine how awful it has been for them unless one walks in their shoes.  For many, their homes will never be the same again.</p> <p>I will draw on the Minister of State's point about climate change.  Globally, 2014 was the warmest year since records started.  December 2015 was the wettest month ever recorded in Ireland.  Climate change is happening under our noses.  It has not gained traction with most people in Ireland, but we must face up to it and take action.  Even though we are only 4.5 million people, we should be able to give the world leadership in reducing CO2 submissions and stopping the use of fossil fuels as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Turning to my personal experience, there was serious flooding in 2014 in Nutgrove Avenue close to where I live.  I heard about it on the 8 a.m. news.  I went there immediately.  Nutgrove Avenue and the roads leading from it were completely flooded.  People's homes were devastated.  Six or seven little businesses were flooded and could no longer operate.  As a business person, I had empathy for them.  It was shocking to see.</p> <p>I called D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council immediately.  An engineer and another gentleman came out to the site.  Fortunately, I had trained in building construction and understood what had happened.  The culvert's screen for scrub and branches on the Little Dargle river in Loreto Park had become blocked, preventing water from flowing freely.</p> <p>From then on, I worked closely with Mr. Paul Faughnan, the senior executive engineer for the council.  In the following months, he undertook a study of the area's flooding.  He concurred with me that a new screen was required.  I am delighted to say that, three months ago, a state-of-the-art screen was installed on the culvert on the Little Dargle river in Loreto Park.  The Minister of State referred to bad planning and so on, but defence mechanisms must be put in place immediately.  I knew that the old screen was not up to scratch to prevent flooding.  Manholes had also been blocked.  Keeping those clear is a case of simple housekeeping.  Porous covers have now been put on them.  That will allow water to drain away more freely.  The new screen for the culvert is of a high quality and was not cheap.  It is magnificent to look at, a work of art and modern.  Anyone could see that it was well designed and that there would be no further flooding.</p> <p>During the floods across Ireland, a Nutgrove Avenue resident, Mrs. Honora Fitzsimons, rang to thank me for my help in getting the new culvert screen installed.  She stated that she could now rest easy at night.  Mr. Robbie Campbell of Campbell Motors and Mr. Peter Phelan, whose livelihoods were put in jeopardy by the 2014 flooding, have thanked me for fighting their corner.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M.

I am confident there will be no more flooding in Loreto Avenue because of what has been installed on the Little Dargle river.  I thank them sincerely.  The people can now sleep and rest at night.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is one of the most important debates we have had given that many communities have suffered much due to the flood event.  My two colleagues, Senator Michael Mullen and Senator Hildegarde Naughten, who will contribute after me, are in the middle of it on the River Shannon and in Galway, in particular.   Like Senator Mary White, I compliment the Minister of State on the work done recently on the River Dargle.  This issue is so serious that party politics does not come into it when looking for somebody to blame, apart maybe from the Lord above.</p> <p>Climate change is very important.  COP21 and the agreement signed in Paris by all the various countries and our Climate Change Bill will have a major role to play.  That puts the onus on the Minister right down to the people in the community.  The Minister of State thanked the people in the community.  People are helping each other and farmers are looking after one another's stock which has been moved from farm to farm.  Neighbours, local authorities and the Defence Forces are all pulling together.  Having said that, there is an onus on each of us to look at climate change and the Climate Change Bill.  The plan is being drawn up with all of the sectors and all the Departments coming together to ensure we do our best because prevention is better than the cure.  I acknowledge the work that has been done.  As the Minister of State said, more will be invested in five years than has been invested for the past 20 years.  It is not as if rain does not happen, because it does.  We have to ensure we look to work with the climate and work with the rivers.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, the people work with the rivers.  A particular project there, the exact name of which does not come to mind, is room for the river.  That is a very important project being undertaken by the Dutch people.  It was developed in conjunction with the local community and local knowledge.  We have seen people standing on places that have not flooded for 20 years.  The cause of that flooding is climate change and we have to ensure that we take the issue seriously.</p> <p>Responding to the flooding caused by storm Desmond, the Government announced the provision of &euro;5 million in emergency funding and that &euro;8 million was being made available to local authorities.  One of the other speakers complimented the Minister of State on how fast he reacted to ensure that funding was made available quickly to the people on the ground.  Last year, the Government started the final part of its proactive planning programme to develop feasible flood risk management solutions for 300 areas across the country at most significant risk from flooding.  The Minister of State mentioned the CFRAM programme.  In all my time in local government, the CFRAM programme is one of the most important ones that has been initiated.  There is the CFRAM programme, the core implementation strategy and the Government flood risk policy which is being implemented by the various steering groups.  This has involved the surveying and modelling of a 6,700 km watercourse and the production of approximately 40,000 individual flood maps, including those required by EU directive, as the Minister of State said.  All of these are available online and people can go into them and check their local areas.</p> <p>Extensive public consultation, including local knowledge, is very important as is communities working together.  This includes meeting with the local representatives and local authority councillors to ensure implementation of the CFRAM programme and exhibiting and proactively discussing draft flood maps to gain additional knowledge which informs that development.  I am aware the Minster of State is actively engaged in doing that with the flood risk management plans and 300 areas are on target to be completed by 2016.  The &euro;430 million provided in the six year programme for flood defences is welcome.  Coming from Galway, I have heard people say the Government is working on it.  Many people have asked if money is being made available.  I said &euro;430 million is being made available over five years and it is welcome.  The European Investment Bank has agreed to provide &euro;200 million in investment to Ireland to tackle flood prevention.  The Minister is in Brussels today meeting officials about flood risk management because of the suffering Ireland has endured.  </p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the meeting with the insurance industry.  I listened to them on the radio.  Not providing insurance cover where flood defence schemes are working is a cop out.  It is asking people to pay money for nothing.  Such schemes have worked in other European countries.  The demountables work and the insurance companies should be made to insure people who have them.  It is a cop out and they should go by international best practice.  I hope they will come back to the Minister of State with that message; otherwise, legislation will have to be introduced to make them do it.  If one cannot use the carrot, the stick will have to be used.</p> <p>The River Shannon basin management co-ordination group was mentioned by the Minister of State.  My colleagues will probably mention it too.  This week, it was tasked with overseeing the River Shannon.  We are being given powers to recommend legislative changes to Government.  That is important.  Setting up talking shops is one thing but the Minister of State has ensured that the River Shannon co-ordination group has teeth.  It will oversee the roll-out of the flood defence measures in areas highlighted by his office and the works done by the CFRAM.  It will meet on a quarterly basis and publish its work and will be tasked with overseeing the delivery of 66 flood plans.  The Minister of State has done much work in his short period in office.  He has a lot more to do and, hopefully, he will be here again to do it in the years to come.  I thank the Opposition for acknowledging the work he has done since coming into office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#R00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the State.  Like many other Senators, I start by offering my sympathy to those who were affected by flooding across the country in recent weeks.  I commend all those who worked relentlessly to help defend homes, to help bring supplies, to rescue people and animals and all those involved in the clean up as the flood waters recede.</p> <p>The devastation visited upon people has been colossal.  We have seen it on the news every day.  Politicians of all political persuasions and none have been wellie deep with those communities.  It is nice that we are using our wellies other than for the National Ploughing Championships and Electric Picnic and that we are getting down and dirty and seeing the effects.  People appreciate that because they need to see that we, as legislators, understand what is happening in their real lives.</p> <p>It is important to realise that this is not the first time there has been flooding.  It has happened on many occasions and it is not likely to be the last time it happens.  I agree with other Senators that it cannot be an issue we make politics out of because people living with the effects of flooding do not want to see this issue as a political ping pong ball or used as a battering ram back and forth.  At the same time, it is important that we remember that the political decisions we make in this House, and which have been made in the past, have effects in terms of what has happened and what will happen in the future.  It has been thrashed out in the media, in political houses, in council chambers and at dinner tables right across the State that under planning laws developers were allowed to build on flood plains.  For example, in 2003, a proposal to introduce a ban on building on flood plains was rejected by the Government.  We must be serious about these issues.  Last month, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht urged a ban on future building on flood plains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kathryn Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now the onus is on the Government and legislators to respond and act on that.  As other Senators mentioned, it is to our great shame that insurance companies are not providing flood insurance for home owners and businesses.  In parts of Dublin, where major flood defences were constructed, the fact that insurance companies are not providing insurance or are only doing so at a prohibitive cost is unacceptable.  I agree with Senator Keane that it is a cop out.  This is an important issue.<br/><br/>Earlier this month it was reported in the national press that progress reports from the OPW reveal that almost 20 major flood defence schemes that are necessary to protect built-up areas are behind schedule.  The Minister of State mentioned these in his speech.  The national press reported that some schemes across several counties are up to two years overdue because of delays in completing detailed designs or failure to appoint consultants to oversee the projects.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on that?  It is very important that we inform the public if anything has happened since then in order that the correct information is available, particularly for the relevant communities.  Can we be given information on the completion of designs, appointment of consultants and the current position of those projects in view of the delays that were reported?<br/><br/>With regard to agriculture, will the Minister of State refer briefly to the effects of flooding on farming and, for example, on grass quality, although he might not be totally <i>au fait</i>with this issue?  Flooding and wet weather are costly for agriculture because they cause delays in, and a reduction of, the crop harvest and can cause significant damage to grassland.  The type of sward, degree of weed infestation, the duration of flooding, soil type, amount of silt and debris and the flow rate of water determine the effects the flooding will have in terms of pasture damage and the subsequent recovery.  Teagasc has warned, for example, that what will result in many flooded areas is a reduction in the quality of silage.  The onslaught of flooding over a prolonged period is especially worrying because of the effects that will become evident in the months later in the year.  That is when it will hit home for many farmers.<br/><br/>The Minister of State mentioned some of this in his opening statement but what interactions have taken place with farming organisations?  Coupled with the work that has been done with homes and small businesses, what impact analysis is taking place on the effects on farmers?  The terrible effects of the flooding that will become apparent later in the year in terms of crop yields, harvests and livestock must be assessed.  Will there be an income plunge for farmers due to the increased costs associated with dealing with the flooding and the effects on grass or crop quality?  Indeed, my local newspaper reports today that a Teagasc adviser, David Colbourne, warned that the level of flooding over recent weeks means we might not get the return of high-quality productive grasses.  There are also the effects on the silage yield later in the year.  I welcome the schemes that have been put in place by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  That will help in some way to compensate farmers.  However, like those homes that are in danger of repeat flooding, these issues are likely to recur and the farming community, which often has difficulty accessing bank credit, particularly in times of need, requires some reassurance and guidance, especially when it takes months for the effects to be felt.  This issue might fall off the political radar or there might be something else happening, so farmers must ensure their voices will be heard and that the effects of the flooding will be offset.<br/><br/>I have given my observations and posed a few questions to the Minister of State.  As other Senators have said, it is important we do not play political ping-pong with this issue.  This affects people's lives.  While we are out canvassing, many people might forget about this issue, but it is still the daily reality for many people.  We must ensure we carry out the future planning and that it is consistently on the radar.  We are legislators and that is our job, first and foremost.</p></speech>

In 1912, my grandfather moved from Mill Street after being flooded for three years in a row.  He moved 300 yards into the town.  Critically, it was a house that was 50 ft. higher above sea level.  On 29 December last, 103 years later, Mill Street flooded again.</p> <p>First, I commend the Minister of State on everything he has done.  He was out in the middle of it all, seeing what the problems were when they were happening.  He did not send officials out.  He went out himself, and that is very important because when I spoke to the Minister of State, and I will do so again, he understood what we were talking about.  This is critical in terms of trying to resolve a problem that will face us every year from now on.  There is no question about that.</p> <p>I also wish to express my recognition of, and sorrow for, the misery that has been visited on people throughout the country.  The flooding has been ongoing for nearly two months in some areas.  Senator Reilly is right that we tend to forget about it.  The debate in my council last Monday was about whether it had enough salt for the rest of the year, as the council had used 100 tonnes of salt each night in recent nights.  The debate moves on very quickly.  However, what is left behind must be picked up by the people who are in the houses that have been flooded and who must deal with the aftermath.</p> <p>I also commend all the services that were out working on this.  The Minister of State referred to this.  Many local authority staff were looking forward to a break at Christmas.  Indeed, the holidays of most local authority staff finish on 31 December and many of them were taking their remaining leave days over the Christmas period.  That all stopped once this problem started, and to a man and woman they got involved.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, was in my home town and in Clonmel on New Year's Day.  Staff who had not been to bed at all the previous night were out with him to show him what had happened and to explain the situation.  I commend those people along with the voluntary agencies, such as the Red Cross.  There is a great group in my area called Carrick-on-Suir River Rescue.  It did tremendous work getting people out of their houses.  Indeed, its own premises was flooded and it lost much of its equipment.  It must be borne in mind that on 29 December 2015, a total of 81 mm of rain fell in Carrick-on-Suir.  It was the highest amount of rainfall in the country.  It equates to a month's rain for a winter month and it fell in one night.  It was going to be difficult for the system to deal with that.  I also commend the national co-ordination team and, more particularly, the county co-ordinating teams.  They met around the clock and, in my county, the team issued information every three hours.</p> <p>The work being done by the Government to tackle this issue is important and essential.  The Minister of State outlined the amount of money being invested in it.  The Shannon did not flood for the first time in 2015.  It has been flooding since before the foundation of the State.  Many people have made promises about it, but this Government is putting money into it.  I know most about my home town.  In 1996, I stood in houses along the quays in Carrick-on-Suir with the former Minister, the late Hugh Coveney.  We were wearing waders.  On that day the late Minister, Hugh Coveney, gave a commitment that we would have a flood scheme.  We have such a scheme and it has worked very well.  However, on the night of 29 December 2015 it did not work.  That was because 81 mm of rain fell.  A culvert that is not as wide as the reporter's desk in front of us turned into a 3.5 ft river flowing down the N24 from the Clonmel side of the town into the town.  It went in behind the walls and flowed not for an hour or two but for 15 hours.  If flowed behind the walls and flooded all the houses we thought were safe.  There was another problem.  There are subterranean pumps but they tripped out and failed.  They were supposed to take the surface water that comes normally and naturally from the flow off.  They failed and the water rose and flooded the houses.  That was our problem.</p> <p>The other issue, specifically in my town but also generally, is that Irish Water now has responsibility for storm water and for sewerage.  In some towns in this country - I know this because I was present at the start when we installed the sewage treatment plant the last time the Labour Party and Fine Gael were in government - some of the network is mixed up.  I will go no further than that, but it is mixed up and must be sorted out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a fact.  If it is happening in my town, then it is happening in other towns.</p><p>The road network has been badly damaged.  Springs have come up through roads that never had springs before.  I travelled a road not two miles from my house and what I saw was like a geyser coming up.  The spring came up almost 3 ft. into the air from the road.  Extensive damage has been done and it must be rectified.</p><p>I wish to discuss the financial supports that are available.  I commend the Government on the work done to provide support and on the fact that &euro;18 million has been made available to local authorities.</p><p>We had to take people out of their houses.  People in local authority houses were offered accommodation, as were other people.  Everyone was sorted out in terms of when they had to leave their houses.  The local authority houses will be repaired.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, assured people in my town that the funding would be available and the houses would be repaired.  The private houses under insurance will be repaired, but they will not get insurance again.</p><p>I was in the house of a 71-year-old widow.  The worst flood ever in Carrick-on-Suir and in the country was in 1947.  I only know the story of the great snow of 1947 from my late father.  He told me how it all melted in three days.  In Graiguenamanagh - it may have been the day the Minister of State was there - a 90-year-old man featured in the media.  He said the last time he had seen water like it was in 1947.  At the time it moved through quickly, because the ground was not waterlogged.  In 1947 the highest water level ever was recorded in my town of Carrick-on-Suir.</p><p>Senator Keane mentioned local knowledge.  In 1957 a woman's father-in-law brought a fisherman to the plot where her family intended to build a house and asked him what level he would advise for building the house.  They built the house above the level the fishermen advised and it never flooded.  It did not flood in 1996, when the two houses next to it were flooded.  However, on 29 December 2015 it was flooded.  The woman's flood insurance was removed by her company in 2012 for no reason.  She had no flood insurance.  The flood insurance cover of the two houses next to her which were flooded in 2009 was restored and the people there can now claim against their insurance, but she cannot claim anything.  The Minister of State met representatives of the insurance companies.  I call on him to tell them that story the next time they meet, because that is absolutely disgraceful.  This woman was left with nothing.  Most of her family have gone from the town, there is no insurance and her house was destroyed.</p><p>I have some practical suggestions.  We can never fill enough sandbags.  They are not going to decay or go away.  They can be ready in the depots.  Every place needed more sandbags.  The Minister of State should ensure this happens.  When we had a crisis with freezing weather in 2010 there was not enough salt in the country.  Some of us began to find out about places in Russia that we had never heard of.  We brought in salt, built depots and put the salt in them.  Now, we have enough salt for a freeze lasting up to three weeks in Tipperary without bringing in another load of salt.  We need pumps on stand-by in every area where there is flooding and they should be stored in the depots.  We should not have to go looking for them when a pump fails, as happened in my town; they should be on stand-by.  We need to put the finance into these areas.  It does not represent a large outlay and we need to do it.</p><p>We also need to look at a proper separation between storm drains and sewerage in every town.  Above all, we need to go back to what happened.  I am referring to tidal water and I realise the Minister of State understands that.  I also realise that in some parts of the country, no matter what we do, some fields will flood.  In 1997, the late former Minister Noel Davern came to our town when we had the provisions to start the flood relief scheme.  I put it to him at a town council meeting that the natural flood plains of the River Suir, which start three miles south of the town, should be put into a set-aside scheme for farmers.  Under such a scheme farmers would be allowed to use the land in the summer for grazing and would be paid to allow the water in when the river could not hold it.  That would prevent the river from flooding the streets in the town.  His response was to laugh at me.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is one of the solutions for the River Suir.  Such a scheme should be established there, as it has been for many other rivers.  I have spoken to other Ministers on the matter.</p></speech>

We need to bring the insurance companies to heel.  What they are doing is unacceptable.  On the way up to Dublin yesterday I listened to a consumer rights agent speaking about car insurance.  They are doing it in that sector as well.  In the case I referred to earlier, a company withdrew insurance from a woman who had lived in a house from 1957 to 2012 without being flooded, and she was left, on 29 December 2015, with her house under three feet of water and no insurance.  That is unacceptable in any man's book.  I call on the Minister of State to take up that issue.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the assistance of my friend and colleague Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice, who is in the Visitors' Gallery with a representative of the Carrick-on-Shannon Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. John Dunne, who has corresponded with the Minister of State on behalf of the Carrick-on-Shannon Chamber of Commerce.  I will read out some of the relevant sections of the letter received by the Minister of State, and I would be grateful if the Minister of State responded to them.</p> <p>I received a briefing from Fianna F&aacute;il, which I will not read into the record because it is not overly complimentary to the Minister of State, with whom I get along well on a personal basis, although those involved are simply making political points.  They call on the Minister of State to see to it that the Government supports affected property owners by ensuring adequate information transfer between the Office of Public Works and the insurance industry.  This would help homeowners to access home insurance after flooding issues have been rectified.  We suggest that the &euro;15 million humanitarian relief package is unlikely to be enough, given the scale of the catastrophe.</p> <p>There is another question for the Minister of State to address in the document.  Has any progress been made in progressing major flood defence systems throughout the country?  I have in mind the repair of flood defences in Cork, Galway, Waterford and the Shannon region which were damaged during the last storms in 2014.  Again, the Minister of State can clarify the matter, but I understand that the relevant budget has been underspent this year by some &euro;14.5 million.  At least, that is what those involved tell me.  I imagine the Minister of State will be able to answer those questions adequately.</p> <p>We must not forget the upper Shannon.  All of the discussions until now have been about what has happened on the lower Shannon from Athlone into the two lakes, Lough Ree and Lough Derg, and down into Limerick.  However, there has been serious flooding in my capital town of Carrick-on-Shannon, as well as Leitrim Village, some four miles from Drumshanbo.  Much of this was outlined in the letter sent to the Minister of State on 18 January.  A number of proposals were put forward, but I will single out one or two in particular.  The ESB has been given responsibility for the maintenance of Lough Allen.  The ESB maintains the level at 48.15 m between 1 October and 1 April.  Normally the level is 48.15 m, but the proposal is that Lough Allen would be closed for navigation purposes between 1 October and 1 April.  This would allow for any flooding to be absorbed by the lough.  From October through to December - it happened again in January - the level in Lough Allen increased by 6 ft.  It went from 48.15 m to 51.5 m or 51.8 m.  As a direct result of the water being allowed to go over the sluice gates - the sluice gates were shut - Leitrim Village and Carrick-on-Shannon, in particular, were severely affected.  Mr. Dunne has pointed out in the letter that the town of Carrick-on-Shannon has lost approximately &euro;1.5 million in business.  That is a vast amount of money by any standards, but particularly for a county such as Leitrim with a relatively low population - Carrick-on-Shannon is the least populated county town in the country.  The Minister of State will understand the devastation that it has created, especially for small businesses.</p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister of State got his officials to deal with this letter as a matter of urgency.  The chamber has put forward seven points covering what can be done to alleviate flooding in future in the Carrick-on-Shannon and Roosky areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.115" nospeaker="true" time="10:30:00" ><p>There is a very specific proposal which the chamber made to the ESB.  Given that the ESB as responsibility for it, I am not sure whether the Minister of State and the OPW are able to direct the company or whether they are in negotiations with it.  One of the ways the Minister of State could help alleviate flooding in future - I understand, from a meeting held with it earlier today, that the ESB is not against the proposal - would be to provide what is called "sheet piling" along the route from the sluice gate at Ballintra in Drumshanbo, which has been in place since the beginning of the hydroelectric scheme of 1926.  The gate was provided to regulate the flow of water out of Lough Allen, which was originally to be used as a reservoir for the generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha.  As a result of the development in tourism over the last 20 years, local lobbying resulted in the reopening of the Lough Allen canal which, as the Minister of State will know, links up with the Shannon-Erne waterway at Leitrim village.  What was done opened up the entire north Shannon area for boating.  I understand that some 150 boats go through the locks into Lough Allen between April and October each year.  From October onward, there is very little boat traffic on the canal.  It would go a long way towards alleviating any future flooding problems if Lough Allen were closed to navigation between October and April and if the levels were allowed to rise.  In fact, the levels would probably be lowered as a result.  Specifically, if sheet piling were placed between the lock at Ballintra and the Galley Bridge, a stretch of water that runs for a mile to a mile and a half after the Shannon leaves Lough Allen, it would go a long way towards alleviating the flooding further down in Leitrim village and Carrick-on-Shannon.</p><p>At present, the ESB is saying it wants to maintain the levels at 48.5 m because it is afraid the embankments will burst if too much water is allowed out of Lough Allen into the Shannon at that point.  John Dunne and Deputy Fitzmaurice have highlighted the fact that if the ESB puts in the interlocking sheet piling system it has put in place in other parts of the country, this would alleviate, to a considerable degree, any threat of the embankments bursting because permanent structures would be in place.  It is not a very long stretch but it is a significant one.  If one thinks about it, 6 ft of water has gone over the sluice gates between October and December.  At one point, that water had nowhere else to go but down into Leitrim village and Carrick-on-Shannon.  There is no doubt that along with the other proposals in the letter, into which I will not go now as they are very technical, this is a manageable, low-cost approach.  It includes, for example, clearance of trees from channels in the vicinity of Jamestown Weir.  Jamestown is the next village after Carrick-on-Shannon.  The letter also suggests the use of the Albert Canal for flood conveyance by bypassing the restrictions at Jamestown Weir and Charlestown.  This would require the installation of simple penstocks at the lock gates, which would only be used once the 12 sluices at Jamestown Weir were open.  That means it would be used to truncate peak flows only and would not increase the likelihood of siltation in the canal.  That is just one example of the detail into which the group has gone.  It also talks about widening the channel at the Leitrim bank opposite Charlestown by 10 m and suggests this would be carried out above summer water levels.  As a result, it would not impact on normal levels or spawning areas and could minimise the risk of siltation.</p><p>I compliment Deputy Fitzmaurice, my colleague, Deputy Cowen, and others who attended a widely publicised meeting with the European Commission.  It addressed this perception that habitat directives are more important than people and that fish, endangered species and insects are of more concern.  That has been knocked on the head now.  That was the word that came back.  There is a flexibility within the habitats directive and I would be grateful if the Minister of State would address that issue.  Certainly, that was the message that came back from the meeting.  The flexibility is there to allow drainage in particular areas.  I am thinking in particular of the initiative at Kinvara to open a channel to the Atlantic which would allow the water to flow out.  I have attended the ESB briefings and I recall talking to its representatives about this entire problem.  It reminded me of an old clich&eacute; my late father used.  When I was a child he used to say that he met a woman who used to say "Let us kneel down and say a decade of the rosary for de Valera and the draining of the Shannon".  That saying dates back to the foundation of the State.  It is not a simple matter of drainage as the Minister of State knows.  However, there is a problem with the Shannon.  It is like a saucer.  If the water pours in, it has nowhere to go and the surrounding area floods.  There are ancillary works which, as the Minister of State knows well, can be carried out.</p><p>My final plea to the Minister of State is the most important.  Mr. John Dunne made sure that I would say this to the Minister of State and I agree that I should.  The Minister of State has visited every town and locale throughout the country except Carrick-on-Shannon.  At the time of the flooding, he was not in Carrick-on-Shannon.  In fact, there was no representative there.</p></speech>

He has been to places all over the country.  We are asking him, however, to take the time to meet the local flood committee and the chamber of commerce in Carrick-on-Shannon in light of the proposals they have put forward to him and in order that he might be able to implement some or all of them.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for his input.  I acknowledge that he has been out there doing the best he could in difficult and unprecedented circumstances.

I express my appreciation of the energy he has brought to dealing with problem by visiting as many places as possible.  There were unnatural expectations that Ministers could act the part of King Canute by appearing wherever there were floods to wave them back.  However, the problem has much deeper roots.  There is a case detailed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>today of a supermarket in Cork where the claimants for the planning permission had contradictory advice as to whether the area where it is to be built is located on a flood plain.  This happens all the time.  Regarding turloughs in south Galway, it has been known for many decades that water goes underground and one does not know where it is going to rise again.  That must be something people note when they plan their buildings.</p><p>We have to examine the question of hydroelectric power.  There were statements that the Shannon meets only 2% of our electricity needs at this stage.  If there are environmental consequences of the kind we have seen, should it be switched off during the winter?  Is it a piece of industrial archaeology?  What do current energy prices tell us about the viability of hydroelectricity?  If we add in the social costs we have seen, it might change the balance.  There are other ways to generate electricity which do not involve the flooding of people's houses.  There was an irony when the Minister of State was addressing how we would cope with these problems.  When there were ESB announcements of how much water it intended to release downstream, RTE was then going straight to people downstream who said they might get by that night.  There has to be some co-ordination there.  The legal case is the one between UCC and the ESB where the ESB was judged to be 70% responsible for the flooding in Cork city in 2009.  What is the future of hydro?  Should the reservoirs be emptied to cater for the winter floods rather than to wait for the crisis where a dam might burst and water has to be let through following which a phone call is made to people who are downstream to see how they cope?</p><p>The leading economic research on this matter, which has stood the test of time, was carried out by the US Army Corps of Engineers, at the invitation of the Government of the day, following the flooding caused by the Shannon in the 1950s.  I think the project was led by a Lt. Colonel Rydell.  He said the case then was to move people's residences to higher ground.  At that stage in the 1950s, not much happened in agriculture in the winter in any event and there was no great economic loss.  While the pattern of agriculture may have changed, the report is still authoritative.</p><p>Like the Minister of State and the Taoiseach, I am disappointed at the response of the insurance industry.  As the Minister of State said, we have put money into Kilkenny, Fermoy and Clonmel.  Is the insurance industry seriously saying that there was no statistical reduction in the probability of flooding?  Insurance is about risk.  We had discussions with the Minister of State's ministerial colleague on safety on the roads yesterday.  The insurance industry must bring itself up to date in the context of the assessment of risk.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D. Barrett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2370"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2370&amp;amp;pid=SeanDBarrett&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has not been particularly good at doing that.  It discounted the portable defences against flooding, even though the Minister of State has shown they have been extremely effective where they have been tried.  The UK evidence is that they are better than sandbags because the latter leak and these portable defences against flooding do not.  Let us have the insurance industry carry out proper actuarial work and reward the OPW, other agencies and, indeed, the taxpayer, who has put a great deal of investment into flood prevention programmes which, apparently, are not resulting in any reduction in people's insurance liabilities in the case of flooding.  In some cases, they are not preventing companies from refusing to insure properties.  It seems strange in view of recent events but there are places where the investment programmes relating to flood defences are highly unpopular.  I am thinking of the Clontarf and the James Larkin causeway in this regard.  It appears a level of construction was taking place to prevent floods that are impossible to predict.  Perhaps more resources should be allocated where they are needed.<br/><br/>A final point that arose in our recent debates on climate change relates to the advisory committee.  The committee's chairman, Professor John Fitzgerald, said earlier today that it will be independent.  However, the criticism in this House was that the climate change advisory committee is overloaded with economists and short on experts who have studied climate change.  It also needs to be independent of the Environmental Protection Agency.  We want independent advice.  One of the issues that arose during the banking inquiry was that when the Department of Finance did not like the advice from the ESRI, it's officials phoned the latter to complain.  We do not want that.  We want all views, including contrarian ones, to be brought to bear on this problem.<br/><br/>I compliment the Minister of State on placing on record the two schemes that are up and running, with &euro;344,000 made available to the 360 households and &euro;530,000 for small business.  In the period of despair people experienced, they did not think that money was going to arrive and they felt almost alone in coping with the problem.  I am glad those numbers are now on the record and that those facilities are still open to compensate people.  It is an area in which we will have to do a great deal of planning regarding where we build and how we protect against floods.  Even though it was, as the Minister of State said, an exceptional December in terms of rain, lessons have been learned.  The legal judgment in the ESB <i>v.</i><font color="#FF0000"></font>UCC case, which was the biggest case of flooding, will be extremely important to explore.  I gather it runs to over 300 pages.  The university was judged to be 30% responsible and the ESB 70% responsible for that flood.  If we do not do work like that, the moral hazard problem will assert itself.  We will have these emergencies and everyone will want to know why the Minister is not there.  We have to take measures to anticipate flooding and deal with it and to apportion the blame appropriately when that is necessary.</p></speech>

I have been in regular contact with him regarding flooding and I commend him on the Trojan work he is doing.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate this issue today in the Seanad.</p> <p>Where certain well-known areas of the country were subject to occasional flooding in the past, it now seems that there are larger areas that are not immune.  There are two issues here, which the Minister of State has highlighted, namely, global warming and planning.  Global warming is a fact; we can now see its effects.  We have seen commentary from experts in recent weeks on what it holds in store and areas that were previously unaffected by flooding may now be prone to it.  Experts warn that Ireland and the UK will be the most affected in Europe by river flooding and it is important that we make the necessary preparations.  In that light, I welcome the &euro;430 million committed by Government over the next five years for flood alleviation measures.  That is more than was spent in the past 20 years, for the better part of which Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  It is important to note the work of this Government.  I also welcome planning guidelines that will make it more difficult to build in areas prone to flooding.  I commend the Minister on the Environment, Community and Local Government for his consideration of a blanket ban on building on flood plains.  I also commend the Minister of State on the flood-mapping exercise and consultation his Department is carrying out.  When complete, this will enable the Department to devise a plan for much-needed flood defences right across the country.</p> <p>The area in which I live, Claregalway, was particularly affected by flooding caused by the River Clare and by local turloughs.  It is now just past the anniversary of the flooding that occurred in 2009 and that decimated parts of the area.  I pay tribute to all the council workers, volunteers, and people from the Civil Defence who came out and gave of their time and energy, day and night, to help people in the local community.  I visited families in Claregalway during the recent flooding and their properties were nearly under water again.  The Minister of State has been excellent in following up on the planned flood relief works on the Clare river.  The latest information is that it will commence in the first quarter of this year.  However, the residents are seeking a date when people will be on site carrying out the final phase of these works, which are sorely needed.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the lack of insurance cover, which has also been raised by my colleagues this afternoon.  I will again use Claregalway as an example.  Parts of that area were flooded in 2009 and the properties there have been uninsurable since.  While it is vital that the Clare river flood works commence as soon as possible, it is also vital that when they are complete, these people will get insurance.  Many of the houses I visited were bought during the so-called boom.  They are very expensive, the mortgages on them are enormous and many properties are, to all intents and purposes, worthless.  I welcome the meeting the Taoiseach and the Minister of State held with the insurance industry.  It was a very worthwhile exercise.  One cannot expect an insurer to insure a house that is prone to flooding.  Insurance is an estimation of risk and some of these homes are always at risk and uninsurable.  We should, however, expect the insurance industry to insure houses that have been subject to proper flood alleviation works.  I distinctly remember having a similar discussion two years ago.  I know the Minister of State understands that there is little point in works being carried out if the insurance industry is not happy with these works.  Conversely, the insurance industry cannot dictate unreasonable or unreachable standards.  </p> <p>There are too many Departments involved in and regulations relating to flood management at various levels.  For example, the recent EU directive stipulates that any flood relief work permitted by the Office of Public Works must be reviewed by another Department.  In Ireland's case, that Department is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This has slowed down the process of approval for the Clare river works, for example.  The Minister of State has assured me that these works will proceed with due haste.  I was interested to hear in recent weeks that the Commission said it is not in any way responsible for any delay in approving flood alleviation works.  In respect of any work that might impact on the natural environment, which is nearly everything, a plethora of EU directives must be considered or obeyed.  That is a simple fact.  EU regulations slowed down approval for the Clare river project.  That is just one example of the delays we have been experiencing.</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State on his great work to date and look forward to the roll-out of these major flood alleviation projects.</p></speech>

I also commend him on his prompt response on the ground.  On 27 December, two days after Christmas, I had to text him about a very urgent situation in Labane in Galway, just south of my home, where a woman feared for her life as the floods were rising.  She also had depression, which made the situation worse.  My purpose in standing here today is to talk to the Minister of State about what works well.  He knows there is a serious problem across the country.  Half of Ireland has been under water.  With climate change now a reality - and one that is not going to go away - we must look afresh at our country.  I am delighted the Minister of State is present for this debate.  One lesson we must learn is that anyone whose property was flooded in 2009 and again in 2015 was, let us face it, let down by the State.  Any works that rely on the election cycle will fail the people.  The State must assume responsibility for the work that needs to be done, regardless of the Government that is in power.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2009 we had a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and in 2015 we have a Fine Gael-led Government and, between the two, people fell.  </p><p>We have some good news stories.  I can talk about homes in Moneymore and Oranmore in my own parish that were flooded and in terrible shape in 2009.  They did not re-flood because the works were done by the OPW and here is how it happened.  I called a public meeting of all the farmers and homeowners in that area, which was also attended by the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the county council.  The OPW agreed to lead.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service could see the misery these people were in but the local river needed to be dredged and the National Parks and Wildlife Service obliged in this respect.  One wonderful farmer, Mr. John Brennan, led the farmers and worked with the OPW.  Over a series of years those drainage works were done and the water was taken to the sea.  It worked and those people are deeply grateful.  There were some successful works in Claregalway but others were not successful and some works were not finished.  I am delighted to hear that the final phase is under way but it was a miss.  </p><p>I am very concerned about the humanitarian fund and that it might be means tested.  This happened after 2009, when people failed to get the support they needed.  There was one loss of life - through suicide - as a result of the very slow relocation process and this is well known locally.  It really saddened me that, although every public representative in Galway represented that family for three years, as soon as the loss of life happened the family got the home.  </p><p>The good news, which I put on the record last week, is that re-planting native trees in upland areas and incentivising farmers to be flood protectors are working in other countries.  In Wales there is a project called the Pontbren project, led by Bangor University and farmers.  By planting only 5% of their uplands and hilly areas with broadleaf native species of tree they have improved the situation as regards flooding by 29%.  We need to look very seriously at doing that here.  The woodland league has brought the information to me that native trees, with their deep roots, can absorb water 67 times faster than grasslands.  South Galway is ruined.  I am the chair of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee society and the water is now up to the thatch in Coole Park.  I brought in pictures of when we brought in Sir Bob Geldof recently to help us.  He is fronting a documentary on Yeats but the only way we could show Yeats's home to him was in a boat.  Coole Park, the former home of Lady Gregory, is absolutely ruined and the water is up on the autograph tree where all the famous poets and literary figures to whom she was a patron have signed their names.  If Derrybrien and Slieve Aughty were replanted with native trees they would soak the water before it flowed downhill.  Even saplings of only two years old act as natural flooding absorbers.</p><p>We need to incentivise our farmers to be flood protectors because the farmers own the land and there is a lot of goodwill out there to improve this.  I listened to Senators Landy and Mooney and they all have mountains and hilly areas in their environs so let us plant these trees.  We must get Coillte on side; the Minister has a problem in this regard.  Coillte owns 1.2 acres of our forest areas but they are planting conifers for the timber crop.  They do not have deep roots and are not a native species.  The Minister has to mix it.</p><p>A report of COFORD and UCD states that we want 30% broadleaf criteria so the Minister should be planting native varieties such as oak, mountain ash and willow by afforestation and new planting on virgin ground and reforestation after clear felling or harvesting a tree crop.  There are other native varieties so I ask the Minister to seriously look at these criteria.  Coillte is a semi-State agency.  It owes the State as well as its shareholders.  Climate change is upon us and is not going away so the State needs to look at sustainable solutions.  We know drainage works by bringing the water to the sea and that flood defences help but now we must work with our environment.  The Minister of State is the best man to place this information before because he has a bit of vision.  He is a worker and he is not afraid to take the lead.  How can we ignore the importance of this evidence?  It is also working in Norway and they have 50% less flooding because they are heeding the evidence for planting trees with deep roots in upland areas.  They are our native species and we were traditionally a woodland people.</p></speech>

Flooding may have abated for the moment but it certainly has not gone away and it will be back.  A hard rain has fallen and it will keep coming back until we deal with it with some purpose, some vision and serious sustainable and long-term strategies.  Present company excluded, I am surprised we have not been drowned and flooded for a second time with the amount of crocodile tears that have flowed in the past six weeks from people talking out of both sides of their mouths and being dishonest by telling people there can be quick-fix solutions and it can all be sorted with flood defences, dredging and drainage.  In some instances the drainage works of the past have caused flooding on neighbours' land and adjacent properties in towns and villages.  The flood defences worked in Carrick-on-Suir, as Senator Denis Landy outlined, and in other towns such as Clonmel and Fermoy but they also certainly caused flooding further downstream.  We see on an ongoing basis with the Shannon that we solve a problem in one spot by opening up the sluice, the weir or the dam but we flood Cork or Athlone or towns further down.  We have to stop being selfish and pretending that this will do and that this is the answer.  There are people playing to the gallery on this and who just want to make an electoral and political football out of it but we cannot deal with it in this way.  There have been very good ideas today and Senators Fidelma Healy Eames, Denis Landy and others have come forward with some good suggestions.  I am glad the Minister of State is here as he is a listening Minister and someone who will take these suggestions up and try to implement some of them.  However, we must have a holistic approach.</p> <p>In some instances I do not agree with the Minister that it is just a natural phenomenon and a matter of climate change.  Some of it is man-made and we are causing some of the flooding ourselves.  In some cases it is State agencies which are responsible.  The ESB has a role and the OPW and Coillte have roles.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has a role but it seems to me that, in some instances, they do not all sing from the same hymnsheet and they certainly do not co-operate with, assist and support each other.  In some cases, some of their objectives and purposes are at odds and we must address this.  This was clearly shown at the height of the flooding when Bord na M&oacute;na was draining bogs and pumping water into an already flooded Shannon basin.</p></speech>

I propose that Bord na M&oacute;na take the water from the Shannon and flood the cut-away midlands bogs as wetlands, as habitats and as reserves, as a safety valve for flooding when it occurs.  Can the Minister address the issue of Garryhinch reservoir, which we have pursued here for the past number of years?  Garryhinch reservoir is a feasible and live proposal.  It is a valid and sustainable proposal but Irish Water has rubbished it because it does not suit it.  They want to build a pipeline from the Shannon direct to Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Whelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is short-sighted and it is stupid in the extreme.  We need a reservoir to have redundant capacity, to address situations such as flooding and to have an overflow capacity.  What if, as has already proven to be the case, there was contamination at source during periods of flooding?  With floods, often there is contamination as a result of the presence of debris and sewerage.  What then would be the position with the pipeline if the safety valve of a reservoir were not put in place?<br/><br/>On the other hand, in light of the weather extremes we are experiencing, droughts will occur.  We must build in capacity so that we have redundant capacity for farming, families, factories and foreign direct investment.  I am glad <i>The Irish Times</i>has supported my campaign in this regard.  It reported that it is a fallacy to consider building an &euro;800 million water pipeline from the Shannon without including the reservoir.  I ask the Minister of State to address that and to assure the public that it is a live prospect, is still under consideration and is a matter that will be addressed by the next Government, not by Irish Water.<br/><br/>We must also be honest.  When this project was first mooted, some of those who are now crying crocodile tears about the Shannon basin being flooded informed me that we would not get a drop of their water.  Where is the sense in that?  Can they not look beyond the end of their noses, their political catchment areas and their electoral constituencies in order to see what is best for the common good?  We must take a holistic approach.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach and the Government that there should not be a single Shannon authority.  We must at least have everyone working to common purpose.  We must have a catchment approach, from source to sea.  I urge the Minister of State to actively pursue the reinstatement of agencies such as the Barrow Drainage Board.  We need to re-establish such entities because in the past they facilitated co-operation among the local authorities along the expanse of the river, from Laois down to Waterford, in Carlow, Kildare, Offaly and everywhere in between.  As a result of such co-operation, the issues of bank maintenance and dredging used to be addressed.  Outdoor staff from the local authorities maintained the culverts and drains and ensured that shores remained unblocked.  We have stopped all that kind of work in a rush to lay off local authority staff and move towards privatisation.  Who now has responsibility to keep shores, culverts and tributaries clear?  Flooding is often caused by man-made impediments, such as bridges and weirs not being maintained and culverts and shores not being kept open and cleaned.  We all have a responsibility in this regard.  We have got to stop pretending.  One's heart goes out to the families which had to endure this all through Christmas and into the new year.  How stressful it must have been.  Only for the intervention of volunteers and great organisations, such as the fire service and the Civil Defence, people would certainly have been far worse off.  That said, there is scope for improved co-operation between the local authorities.  Some parts of the country were not affected at all or not as badly affected.  I believe they could have deployed fire tenders, Civil Defence personnel and pumps to the areas worse affected.  We must have a little more joined-up thinking.<br/><br/>This problem is here to stay unless we adopt a sustainable, long-term strategic response.  Dredging, the erection of defences and drainage alone will not do.  Climate change is here.  We have proof of it.  It is not all down to nature.  Man has played a role in this and we can at least interfere positively.  However, there is no point in Bord na M&oacute;na doing one thing, the ESB doing the opposite and Irish Water stating it has nothing to do with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1161" speakername="John Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#X00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Senator Whelan has basically covered everything in a nutshell.  I have visited areas in Ballinasloe, Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle that were flooded - these areas are always prone to flooding - and I am aware that there is no one solution in terms of solving this problem.  I know one woman who has been a captive in her home for five or six weeks as a result of flooding.  She has not been able to use her toilet for six weeks.  She cannot use the dishwasher, the washing machine or anything else.  The house is surrounded by sandbags and she is constantly having family members in to try to keep the seeping water away from her front door.</p> <p>I raised this issue before the Seanad broke for the Christmas recess.  I stated that Athlone is a town prone to flooding and that it would be flooded.  I highlighted the fact that there is a company based in Athlone called Global Flood Solutions but nobody from Government made contact with the proprietor to see what could he do to solve the problem around the town.  He is selling his product all over the world and yet the Government, which was reactive rather than proactive, would not do business with him.  There are other companies in County Galway that provide similar products that were in touch with me and nobody has been in contact with them.  Last year, when Foynes in Limerick was under threat of flooding, the OPW went to Global Flood Solutions and invested in its product.  That product worked and saved Foynes from flooding.  We need to involve companies that have expertise and ensure that they are part of the solution.</p> <p>Senator Barrett mentioned insurance, a matter to which I will also refer.  Those whose properties were flooded will not get insurance unless the Government intervenes.  I am aware of one business - a pub - in my locality that was flooded and to which &euro;2,500 worth of damage was done.  It is not a great deal but it is still &euro;2,500.  The insurance policy covers the business for fire, flooding and public liability but if the owners make a claim for flooding, they will never get insurance again.  They are in an awful predicament.  What should they do?</p> <p>Finally, Senator Whelan mentioned the fire service - our emergency service.  I have great faith in the fire service but, unfortunately, during the flooding crisis throughout the country, some local authorities were refusing to let the fire service - which has expertise when it comes to flooding - out because of the cost involved.  It is important that the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, should make a ministerial intervention on this matter and inform local authorities that the fire service should be deployed in all cases of emergency, including flooding.</p></speech>

Everybody was caught unprepared by the extent of the extreme weather over Christmas.  The Minister of State was out doing his best to address it.  Understandably, there is a great deal of anger throughout the country, particularly in areas that had previously been flooded.  I refer, for example, to Athlone, which was also badly flooded in 2009.</p> <p>What is important at this stage is that we focus on the future.  We cannot control the weather.  Unfortunately, the reality of life is that, with climate change, extreme weather events will become more frequent.  As the flood waters have receded, it is important that we maintain our resolve.  There has been a focus on this issue for the past two months because of the flooding that has taken place throughout the country.  There was just as big a focus on it in 2009 and on other occasions when major flooding events occurred but sometimes the problem is that the agenda moves on and the media and the politicians switch their focus to other issues.  It is essential that does not happen in this instances because we are going to experience further extreme weather events in the coming years.  It is essential to put the investment and preparation in place now in order to ensure that we can help people cope.  We cannot control the weather but we can certainly prepare and help people to protect their homes and businesses more effectively in the future.</p> <p>Suggestions have been made across the House on various different ways in which this can be done.  The issue of insurance has been mentioned.  There should be universal insurance cover for flooding.  It is no different to community rating for health insurance purposes.  I have heard some of the insurance companies state that, in the case of flooding, that they do not want to cover those at risk, they do not cover certainties and they only cover events that are unlikely or less likely to happen.  That is not the case in the health insurance market.  An insurer cannot state it is refusing health insurance because of one's medical history.  Even if somebody has serious medical issues or a genetically inherited illness runs in his or her family, as a society we believe that everybody should be entitled to health insurance.  That means the rest of us, those who are healthy, pay more but we believe that this is a societal value worth upholding and that nobody should be left on their own when bad health hits.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The same should apply in situations like this.  Of course, we need to ensure more effective planning in order that we do not build on flood plains.  Some of the decisions made in the past were absolutely disgraceful.  They are not the fault of the unfortunate people living in houses now that should never have been built and perhaps there is a need to consider relocation, but we cannot to say to them that they are on their own.  There is a need to step up to find a solution.  The Government should force the insurance companies to cover everybody.  The UK has a levy for this purpose and we should fight for that principle here.  I urge the Minister of State to prioritise that.</p><p>Improved flood protection measures are required throughout the country.  Major schemes should be undertaken to protect areas under threat such as Athlone.  Individuals property owners should be helped.  I have corresponded with the Minister of State's Department and the Office of Public Works over the past two years about householders in Sutton, Baldoyle and elsewhere.  There are only two or three houses on the coast road from Baldoyle to Portmarnock.  Fingal County Council and the OPW accept that they are at risk of flooding and they have been flooded several times, but the householders have been told there is no justification for a major flood protection scheme because there are only two or three houses on the road.  As they have pointed out to me, if they want to insulate their homes, they can get a grant for that purpose but they cannot for flood protection.  A mix of large flood protection schemes where they are justified in densely populated areas, towns and villages and smaller schemes for vulnerable homes, which are highlighted on OPW maps, is needed.  Let us at least have a scheme that enables householders to do their best to protect their own homes.  I have pushed this issue for the past two years and I hope the resolve is there to address it.</p><p>Most of the attention currently is on fluvial flooding but protections against tidal flooding are also necessary.  It must be ensured investment is put in place.  There are great plans in the Department for flood protection measures throughout the county and it is essential the funding they require is provided.  Major flood protection schemes should be undertaken in a way that both provides the necessary protection against flooding but also preserves existing amenities.  In this context, I refer to Clontarf.  Everybody wants proper flood relief measures to protect homes and businesses, but the initial proposals that were brought forward, as Dublin City Council has admitted, took no account of the overall environment.  It was proposed to build a large wall that would block off the sea.  The promenade is full every day, from first thing in the morning to late at night with people jogging, walking and cycling, and it would not have been used because it would have been cut off from the road.  Women, in particular, said they would not walk where they could not be seen.  The schemes, therefore, need to be environmentally sensitive as well.  They should provide the necessary protection while also preserving amenities.  There is another issue on a different stretch of that road between Clontarf and Raheny where there is significant community concern about the way flood protection measures have been undertaken.  A crude, cheap concrete wall was erected which has blocked beautiful views of the sea that passers-by could enjoy.  There is no longer any view and people are upset about that.  There is no history of tidal flooding in the area.  I conducted a site visit with the engineers involved last week and they admitted that the risk is from river flooding caused by water emerging from St. Anne's Park.  The new scheme cannot deal with that and they said that people will have to live with that, yet a huge wall has been erected to protect against a low tidal risk.  There is a tidal flooding risk elsewhere, but that particular stretch of coastline is protected by Dollymount and Bull Island and there is little wave action because of silting and so on.  The height of the wall is not necessary.  Officials need to be smart about these issues and not come up with a crude, one-size-fits-all approach.  They should work with communities to arrive at solutions that will work.</p><p>I urge the Minister of State to take those issues on board.  He has taken control of them over the past two months and I urge him to continue to work on them as the waters recede and maintain them as a priority in order that those who have been flooded for a second or third time recently do not have to go through that experience again.</p></speech>

He interacted well with communities to give them reassurance.  It is appropriate that we have this discussion in order that the members of the public who were badly impacted during Christmas and whose lives were made miserable by the awful floods can see the Government is taking this issue seriously.  This is the first Government in the history of the State to tackle the issue head on and to deal with it in a proactive way.  It will invest money such as the &euro;450 million that has been allocated over the next number of years for a variety of solutions.  It is evident from previous contributions that one size does not fit all and there is no easy solution to all the problems, but joined-up thinking is needed with communities and experts working together to reduce the impact of flooding, because global warming is here to stay and we will have to deal with flooding on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>County Galway was seriously impacted because of a diverse range of issues.  Senator Barrett alluded to the turloughs in south Galway and Deputies from the area have been in touch with the Minister of State with a variety of solutions and suggestions.  Funding will be made available for the Dunkellin river project, which is welcome, and I hope An Bord Plean&aacute;la will approve it by the end of February.  I have been hearing about that project since I was a small boy and that was not today or yesterday.  I hope there will be action on that in the coming year.</p> <p>The Minister of State was correct to pay tribute to all the people who helped during the recent crisis, including the staff of local authorities, the Civil Defence, other organisations and, in particular, local volunteers who demonstrated their concern for their fellow citizens and helped to make their lives a little more bearable.</p> <p>South-east Galway, Athlone and County Roscommon were heavily impacted by the flooding caused by the River Shannon.  I will not go into this because it has been referred to but I welcome the establishment of the River Shannon co-ordination group by the Taoiseach.  I am not concerned about who heads it up or whether the OPW is the lead agency as long as all the groups that have a direct involvement and interest in the river are on board to work in the public interest and to ensure the work that needs to be done and the decisions that need to be made are made in the public interest to ensure the livelihoods and homes of people in this area.  As well as drawing on the technical expertise of the various groups, I urge them to draw on local knowledge and experience.  There is nobody better than those on the ground who have experienced flooding through the decades to provide valuable information.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for visiting Ballinasloe on 23 December 2015 and for meeting the people who were impacted.  The visit was much appreciated, as was the announcement for funding for work on the Deer Park river.  The county council applied for funding and he immediately approved that.  That will have an impact.  Ballinasloe is an interesting case.  The flooding in 2009 impacted approximately 160 homes and businesses.  The floods on this occasion were worse but the number of premises impacted reduced to approximately 20 because of the investment made in 2012 to build a defence wall, which protects the homes in Derrymullen.  It saved 120 houses from being impacted this time.  Work done on the East Bridge also helped.  That was a positive investment by the State but more needs to be done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Michael Tully of the Ballinasloe Flood Alleviation Group made a fine presentation during the Minister of State's visit.

I need to flesh this out a bit more.  I will bring a number of matters to the Minister of State's attention on their behalf.  The CFRAM proposals are closely aligned to what the Ballinasloe Flood Alleviation Group has put forward regarding the Station Road bund.  The group proposes that it could be put in place for a cost of &euro;480,000, and seeks funding under the small schemes project.  It has a favourable cost-benefit analysis of 1.85.  The work could be done immediately.</p> <p>Two additional flood eyes on the east bridge need to be opened.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise the issue of flooding with the Minister of State, who has been to Galway and knows that south Galway was particularly badly affected.  We badly need a resolution.  Any proposal for flood relief measures in south Galway should be sensible and realistic and should provide a real assurance to local families, businesses, farmers and all the people who have lost their livelihoods that they will be protected from the onslaught of further flooding into the future.  I have already raised the issue in the Seanad.  The human rights of flood victims should come ahead of any environmental considerations.</p><p>While I have no interest in interfering in the planning process, more can and should be done to ensure peace of mind for victims across Galway and other flooded regions across the country.  I propose, in the first instance, that time limits be introduced for An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions regarding flood relief measures.  The Minister of State has heard much about the Dunkellin river.  Understandably, there is much anger and frustration on the part of people living along the river and the Aggard stream due to the delay in decision making.  The river was last dredged during the English occupation.  My father said the last time he was aware that it was cleaned, they parked their vans in his father's garage in Athenry.  It was some time ago.  The fact that people are still awaiting a decision on whether the scheme can go ahead is ludicrous.  To lose their homes and possessions on a regular basis is a terrible experience that nobody should have to endure.  We should take all possible measures to alleviate the stress heaped upon the families and victims of such significant destruction as a result of flooding.  Time limits for decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be a step in the right direction.</p><p>A local authority housing estate in my home town in Athenry, Caheroyan, was flooded as a result of the rainfall in December.  It caused major stress to families.  A cessation of rental payments for these people would be adequate to enable them to make any repairs they need to do in their gardens and compensate them for the turf they have lost from their sheds and all the damage that has been done.  It would be a welcome goodwill gesture on the Minister of State's part if he could liaise with his Cabinet colleagues to see that it happens.</p><p>I raise the possibility of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, contributing to compensation for the area most affected.  I am particularly thinking of Labane, Cahermore, Ballinstague and all the way to Kinvara.  A very eminent academic was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>this week as saying that TII had picked the least suitable route for the M18.  It is plausible to assume that TII exacerbated the floods in Labane, Ardrahan and Ballinstague, given the interference with the geology of the area and the fact that there has possibly been some re-engineering of the drainage in the area in order to allow the motorway to go ahead.  Somebody mentioned to me that they were going through a succession of turloughs in the area.</p></speech>

The people affected by flooding in south Galway need workable solutions.  The time for talking is over.  I would welcome any action that can be taken regarding my proposals.

I would appreciate it if the Minister of State considered my suggestions.</p></speech>

Some very good points have been made.  The Minister of State has been actively engaged in a situation in Clonahinchy in County Clare, and I fear that as a result of the trauma many of our colleagues around the country have suffered, the problems in Clonahinchy will be a lower priority.  The Minister of State very kindly visited the area, which is near Quilty in County Clare.  He also met a delegation from Clonahinchy and kindly supported a feasibility study to identify a resolution to the issues that affect the residents.  I want the Minister of State to give a commitment here that he will not forget about it and that dealing with the problems in this area will not be put on the long finger.  Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate a timeframe in which he will study the recommendations of the feasibility study that was delivered to him in November.</p></speech>

I thank Senators from all sides of the House for what has been largely a constructive and informative debate.  I will try to deal with as many of the issues as possible.</p> <p>Senator White and others raised the issue of climate change, and I fully agree with her.  We cannot ignore it and pretend it is not happening.  That is why I am very proud that our national flood plan, CFRAM, goes beyond the EU floods directive, which requires us to put in place a national flood plan, and factors climate change forecasts into the model, which will, one hopes, future-proof the country.  It is a prudent and important measure.  I am glad to hear of the improvements carried out by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and I hope it is of comfort to Senator White's community.</p> <p>Senator Keane strongly emphasised the point about climate change.  I am proud that we have the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, which I see as more of a first step than a destination.  My office has established a climate change adaptation plan, and there is an onus on all of us in public bodies to implement it as quickly as possible.  Senator Keane referenced the Dutch.  We are engaging with Dutch experts who have been here on an ongoing basis, examining what we are doing.  We are learning from them and, I am proud to say, in some areas they are learning from us.  There is a good engagement.</p> <p>A number of Senators raised the issue of insurance.  The insurance industry needs to realise that demountable flood barriers, which can be put up and taken down, are not substandard short cuts that are used just because they are cheaper.  They work.  In some areas, they are the only type of defence that will work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Fermoy, for example, there is a demountable which, if it was left in place the whole time, would divide the town in two.  One cannot build a wall across a main road or bridge and shut down the town.  The demountable barrier worked in Fermoy and they work in other countries.  However, in other countries insurance companies provide cover where demountables are used.  One Senator made the suggestion that people working in the insurance industry need to familiarise themselves with demountables.  Certainly, anything that we can do in the OPW to help that happen we are pleased to do.  At our meeting last week, the insurance companies undertook to review their position on demountables and they are due to report back at the end of this week.  In addition, the Department of Finance is examining best international practice.<br/><br/>I take the point that Senator Power made about the UK system.  That system took about six years to be introduced but it does not include business and a lot of businesses here were impacted as well.  I think it is a model we should look at.  We should not rule anything out because we cannot spend nearly &euro;500 million over the next five years and have the taxpayer, effectively, paying twice.  I mean they would have to pay through insurance premia and then through direct tax.  Therefore, we have to get this right and I hope last week's meeting was a good start.<br/><br/>In terms of the Shannon group, it will have teeth and Senator Keane raised the same point.  It will have an opportunity to make legislative and regulatory suggestions to Government.  Its minutes will be published so people will know exactly what it is talking about.  It can appear before Oireachtas committees, probably the relevant committee being the Oireachtas environment committee.  It will meet on at least a quarterly basis.  All of the agencies involved in the Shannon region will have to publish work plans for the next three, six and 12 months.  The initiative will bring the missing piece of greater co-ordination and exchange of information, and I again emphasise that point.  We have published the flood plans for the 66 areas along the Shannon.  If there is a need for regulatory or legislative change, and people have referenced the ESB and the likes, then the group will have to look at such matters so it is not a talking shop.  We are not ruling out a single Shannon authority but we are not going to get bogged down now, when people need immediate solutions, in trying to set up something that could end up taking a number of years to do.  We should let this group get on with its work and it can do so pretty immediately.<br/><br/>Senator Reilly raised the issue of scheme delays.  Flood relief schemes take a long time.  Senator Whelan made the point that we cannot have politicians going around promising people that flood relief schemes will happen tomorrow.  I was at pains not to do that because the average lead-in time for a flood relief scheme to be identified as being needed to the time it is fully delivered is about five years.  The work that has been done by the CFRAM process will reduce the period by two years so the average time should be about three years.  These schemes are major capital schemes.  They go on people's lands.  They require planning and procurement but we have to get on with them as quickly as possible.  We publish an updated list of where all of our schemes are on the OPW's website so I will not go through each and everyone of them now.<br/><br/>I take the points made about farming.  I have met the IFA on a number of occasions, as has the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have tried to show a flexibility in terms of inspections.  We have tried to show support in terms of fodder.  Obviously the Minister has introduced a number of measures.  He is keeping a watching brief on some of the issues that Senator Reilly raised that may become apparent as the flood waters continue to recede.  <br/><br/>I take the point that Senator Landy made about Carrick-on-Suir very seriously.  Obviously he knows the area well and I agree with him that we cannot allow, as a number of Senators have said, for flooding to be forgotten as the agenda moves on.  We, in the OPW, have worked on flooding for a hell of a long time and I have worked very hard on it in my time as Minister of State.  It is very hard to grab headlines and get people to talk about the issue until a flood comes.  I can assure the Senator that between now and the summer that the OPW will work on publishing the 300 flood plans for the entire country and all the areas affected.  That will be our primary concern.  I agree with him that after every storm there is a need for review which is happening now.  I refer to things like making sure pumps and sandbags are available.  The Senator made a point about storm water and sewage which is something that we will look at.  I also take the point he made about a 71-year-old widow.  There is also a role for an ombudsman who could look at cases where people are being treated unfairly.  That is something I will bring up in my ongoing engagement.<br/><br/>I wish to assure Senator Mooney that I have not just not visited Carrick-on-Shannon.  When more than half of the country is underwater one cannot visit everywhere.  I have visited as many places as possible in as many disparate parts of the country as possible to get an overall feel for the issue.  I am not against visiting Carrick-on-Shannon.  Obviously we know the cycle one is coming into, in terms of this Government nearing the end of its mandate.  I am eager to examine in detail the letter that the Senator has told me I should have received about 48 hours ago.  I have just received it and I shall look at it.  I know that Deputy Fitzmaurice and the man from the chamber of commerce had to go elsewhere.  I thank them for being here.  I am sure they will follow this matter.  <br/><br/><b>Senator Paschal Mooney:</b>By the way, the invitation was meant in the best spirit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#AA00200"><p>That is fine.  It was said that we need to have a better exchange of information with the insurance companies with which I agree.  That is why we have made provision for a memorandum of understanding.  Where we complete a scheme we provide the information to Insurance Ireland so that it can pass that on to the companies which can be factored into the commercial decision-making process.</p> <p>I do not accept that the humanitarian scheme has been inadequately funded purely because of the figures that I have put on the record.  The Department of Social Protection's scheme has a budget of &euro;10 million of which &euro;344,000 has been drawn down.  The Irish Red Cross has a budget of &euro;5 million of which &euro;530,000 has been drawn down.  The councils have been given a clean-up budget of &euro;18 million.  The Government has made it clear that it will provide the funding that is necessary for the roads and infrastructure, as the damage becomes apparent.  My office also runs a minor works scheme where local authorities, and only local authorities, can apply for up to &euro;500,000 for relatively minor works that can make quite a substantial difference.  I assure the Senator that I shall take the contents of the letter very seriously and my officials will revert to him.   </p></speech>

Anywhere I went I invited Oireachtas Members of all political hues to attend because I believe rain and floods are not party political issues.  I am somewhat frustrated, at this stage, that there has been scaremongering about budgetary matters.  Let us be very clear.  We are spending more on flood relief in the next years as a country - &euro;430 million - than we did in the past 20 years and right throughout the Celtic tiger period.  Every year, as people know, there is a need for multi-annual budgets.  One can say one will start a flood relief scheme now but the bills might fall due next year.  There has been an increase in flood relief spending this year compared with last year.  I know that we are in an electoral cycle.  There are loads of political issues that I look forward to debating with political parties but I ask them not to make partisan political points about flood funding, particularly when they are factually incorrect.  </p></speech>

Although the Bill is called the Heritage Bill, it is not confined to dealing with heritage matters but introduces important changes across a range of areas.  </p> <p>By way of summary, Part 2 of the Bill deals with amendments to the Canals Act 1986, to ensure there Is a robust framework for the making of by-laws to regulate the use of boats on canals, and the management of canals and canal property.  These changes will enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage waterways for the benefit of all users.</p> <p>Part 3 of the Bill introduces important changes to the cutting and burning of vegetation and provides clarification of the powers of authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a result of the recommendations contained in the report of the critical review of the Heritage Council in 2012, which was approved by Government, Part 4 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Heritage Act 1995.  The proposed changes refine the role of the Heritage Council, allowing for a more streamlined board structure and provide for greater engagement with local communities.  I am happy to go through the Bill in more detail.</p><p>The amendments to the Canals Act 1986 are primarily enabling provisions to allow Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate boating on canals and to manage the use of canals.  Waterways Ireland was established in 1999 under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  It is charged with the management, maintenance, development and restoration of Ireland's inland waterways, principally for recreation purposes.  Waterways Ireland manages 1,000 km of waterways in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the Shannon navigations, the Erne system, the lower Bann, the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal, the Barrow navigations and the Shannon-Erne waterway.  Our waterways are a wonderful public resource which make a vital contribution to tourism by attracting people from around Ireland and from abroad.  There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways that are managed by Waterways Ireland.  The proposed changes will allow Waterways Ireland to proactively manage the Royal and Grand canals and the Barrow navigations.</p><p>Sections 2,5 and 6 are technical amendments which include updating ministerial titles and changing references to the Commissioner of Public Works to Waterways Ireland and codifying the changes made to the Canals Act 1986 by the Maritime Safety Act 2005 and other legislation.  Section 3 substitutes section 5 of the Canals Act 1986 and restates the provisions of section 5 of the Canals Act 1986 defining the general duties of Waterways Ireland and of C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann.  In this section, Waterways Ireland is being substituted for the Commissioner of Public Works.</p><p>Section 4 substitutes section 7 and section 7(a), inserted by section 56 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005, of the Canals Act 1986 and creates new provisions for the making of by-laws to regulate the use of boats on the canals and canal property.  More specifically, section 7 provides for: the regulation of the type or class of boat which may be used on the canals; the issue of permits and licences to regulate the use of boats on the canals and canal property; the closing to navigation of any part of the canals; the regulation of berths and moorings and the placing of buoys on the canals or other canal property; the regulation and care of animals on the canals and other canal property; and the charging and fixing of fees, tolls and charges.</p><p>New sections are created at 7B to 7E, inclusive.  Section 7B provides for the appointment and powers of authorised officers for the regulation and management of the canals and canal property.  Section 7C provides for the issuing of search warrants by a judge of the District Court in certain circumstances.  Section 7D contains specific provisions on the service of directions.  Section 7E provides that proceedings for an offence under the Canals Act may be prosecuted summarily by Waterways Ireland and may be instituted within 12 months from the date of offence.</p><p>Section 5 provides for a number of other miscellaneous amendments which are mostly of a technical nature, including: updating the references to the titles of the various Ministers in the Act to reflect the current position; changing to Waterways Ireland those references to the Commissioner of Public Works in respect of functions transferred to Waterways Ireland under the British-Irish Agreement Acts 1999-2005; and providing for the deletion of section 13, which expired three years after the vesting day.  Together, the former provide for a more modern, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework - underpinned by legislation - which will allow Waterways Ireland to manage the canals efficiently and effectively and in all of our interests.</p><p>Part 3 contains important changes to the Wildlife Acts.  Specifically, section 8 relates to burning and hedge cutting.  Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts currently prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, during the closed period from 1 March to 31 August each year.  Vegetation such as that found in hedgerows and scrub is an important wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.  In that regard, I decided that there should be a review of the current legislative provisions to ensure that they remain both effective and balanced.</p><p>Stakeholders had sought an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40.  I announced a consultation process in November 2014 which provided that opportunity.  I received almost 200 submissions from various representative and Government bodies, elected representatives and members of the public.  The submissions received ranged from detailed papers from stakeholders to individuals expressing support for one outcome or another.</p></speech>

The changes that are included in section 8 of the Bill, to be introduced on a pilot two year basis, will allow for a more managed approach to the vegetation management issues which regularly arise.  The pilot measures include allowing managed hedge cutting, under strict criteria, during August to help ensure issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  Power will also be given to me, as Minister, to allow for controlled burning in certain areas around the country, to be specified by regulation, during March, should it be necessary, for example, due to adverse weather conditions. These two measures are designed to introduce a limited amount of flexibility to help with land management and to ensure that a fair and balanced system is in place, while ensuring the protection of biodiversity.</p> <p>It is important to underline to the House these provisions will operate on a pilot basis for two years.

In addition, my Department will monitor activity under these provisions and an assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing these measures beyond the pilot phase.  In that context, my Department will work towards gathering the data required to underpin such a decision.  This will include data in regard to bird nesting and the level and impact of cutting and burning.  I consider that these provisions provide a pragmatic approach which will help to address some of the challenges faced by those living In rural areas.  I want to strike a balance.  While hedgerows and upland areas are very important in terms of wildlife habitat, they also need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.  I also intend to launch a public awareness process so that all stakeholders, including local authorities, landowners and members of the public are fully informed on the restrictions on hedge cutting and burning.</p> <p>Following legal advice on the issue I have also taken the opportunity, in section 10 of the Bill, to clarify the powers of authorised officers of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Wildlife Acts.  National Parks and Wildlife Service officials of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are authorised officers in respect of investigating breaches of the various provisions of the Wildlife Acts.  These new provisions clarify their powers in this regard and brings them very much into line with how the powers of authorised persons under the more modern European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 are expressed and set out in the law.</p> <p>Section 11 updates the penalties for offences under the Wildlife Acts and introduces fixed payment notices for certain offences under the Wildlife Acts.  Finally, in section 9 there are some minor amendments to the wording of a subsection in section 40 of the Wildlife Acts updating the collective citation for fisheries legislation and replacing the references to the Central Fisheries Board which is now Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p> <p>Part 4 deals with amendments to the Heritage Act 1995.  The amendments proposed in Part 4 are based on the recommendations of the critical review of the Heritage Council, which was carried out by my Department in the context of the public service reform plan.  Section 12(1)(a) refocuses the activities and functions of the Heritage Council, with particular emphasis on engagement with communities and local authorities.  Section 12(1)(b) introduces the non-remuneration of members of the board, while continuing their entitlement to expenses incurred in discharge of their duties as board members.  Section 12(1)(c) provides for a reduction in the size of the board of the Heritage Council to between eight and ten members, excluding the chairperson.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It ensures a gender balance by having a minimum requirement of four females and four male members and reduces the quorum necessary to five, including the chairperson, to reflect the smaller board.  It removes the requirement for the Heritage Council to establish statutory standing committees on wildlife, archaeology, architectural heritage and inland waterways.  In general, these changes will allow for a more effective and efficient operation of the Heritage Council and a more streamlined approach to how it carries out its primary functions.</p><p>I will reiterate that the changes proposed to the Canals Act are mainly enabling provisions to provide for a robust regulatory framework for the use of boats on canals.  They are designed to bring clarity and enhance the management of the canals.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of Waterways Ireland, in particular the way it has responded in challenging conditions in recent months.</p><p>Regarding hedge cutting and the burning of vegetation, the changes are designed to introduce a limited amount of flexibility and to ensure that a fair and balanced system is in place while protecting biodiversity.  The co-operation of all stakeholders is essential in the successful protection and management of our natural environment.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work of the Heritage Council and its commitment to the review process, which led to the proposed changes.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to outline the provisions of the Bill and I look forward to hearing the Senators' views on the Bill's contents.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil s&iacute; faoi bhr&uacute; i mbliana agus go bhfuil go leor oibre idir l&aacute;mha aici le linn chom&oacute;radh 1916, agus gu&iacute;m gach rath uirthi san obair sin.  I acknowledge the Minister's workload this year, given the commemorations.  I wish her well with that.</p> <p>The Bill is short, but important for a number of reasons.  A welcome review was conducted of the Heritage Council.  Based on the 2011 Government plan to re-evaluate State agencies, the organisation's effectiveness and efficiencies were examined.  Two options were on the table: merge the Heritage Council with another body or leave it as a stand-alone organisation.  Opting for the latter was the right decision.  It is an important organisation and can play a pivotal role.  Perhaps this year is significant for a number of reasons, but the main one is the celebration of our heritage.  The council will play a key role in that regard.  I agree with the Minister that its role should knit more closely with local authorities' in particular.  My local authority has a heritage officer, who does excellent work.  A closer knit between local authorities and the Heritage Council would be welcome.  The council could also play a more active role in engaging with schools, in particular primary schools.  This suggestion could be taken on board, although budgetary constraints on the council may affect it.</p> <p>The other legislation that is being tidied up includes the Canals Act 1986.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the passage of this Bill through the Seanad.  I have received correspondence, particularly in recent days, regarding the proposed changes to section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976.  Senator Norris made one or two comments.  People contacted me about this issue yesterday and today.  I have read some of the submissions, including those made during the public consultation process.  That process was the right approach to take, as the submissions evaluated by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht highlighted other aspects for consideration, for example, road safety, including the safety of cyclists and runners.  I run and walk up and down many country roads with overgrown hedges and so on.  They pose dangers.</p> <p>Another dimension is the agricultural one.  A submission was made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  Rural Ireland has many hedges and we need to protect the wildlife that live within those, but a level of common sense must be adopted instead of rigid and strict guidelines.  The Department's submission pointed out that, although an element of road safety legislation had put the onus for cutting hedges on landowners, this was not possible because of the constraints applied by the Wildlife Act.  One Act was working against another.  This has to be tidied up.</p> <p>I am unsure as to what level of consultation or what data will be used in forming the regulations, so the Minister might explain today or during later Stages.  Some submissions were made by rural councillors, for example, Mr. S&eacute;amus Cosa&iacute; Fitzgerald of the Minister's own party in Kerry and Mr. Brendan Cronin, also in Kerry.  Councillor Michael Gleeson made a good submission.  Councillors Joe Fox, Martina Kinane and, in County Kerry, Johnny and Danny Healy-Rae made submissions, as did Councillor Paddy Meade.  These were cross-party councillors from rural Ireland making submissions in support of extending the cutting season for hedgerows and so forth.</p> <p>I come from a rural part of the country in County Donegal that has many farmers who are restricted from cutting back hedges.  This is raising road safety concerns.  The council is statutorily allowed to cut hedges, but the ultimate onus is on the landowner, not the local authority.  Tidying up this legislation is important.  Some of the organisations that have raised concerns have done so for valid reasons.  We must protect our wildlife.  I tried to find data on the impact of cutting hedges over a longer period - 1 March to 31 August - but was unable to do so.  Flexibility and common sense are required.  We will support that approach and will not impose constraints on the Bill's passage through the Seanad.</p></speech>

I was the runner.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill, which will implement the recommendations arising from the 2012 critical review of the Heritage Council.  It provides for certain sensitive matters relating to our waterways, wildlife and the Heritage Council.  It amends the Canals Act 1986, creating provisions facilitating the making of by-laws for the regulation of the use of the canals and other canal property.  This is welcome.  It also provides for the regulation of cutting and burning of vegetation at certain times of the year and concerns the powers of the authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eamonn Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2382"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2382&amp;amp;pid=EamonnCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill also concerns the function of the Heritage Council and the structure of the board in its current form.</p><p>The amendments to the Canal Act 1986 are contained in Part 2 of the Bill, as the Minister mentioned.  These concern the duties of Waterways Ireland, which is taking over responsibility from the Commissioner of Public Works.  All existing references to the Canals Act 1986 will change to references to Waterways Ireland.  The Bill provides for the making of certain by-laws for the care, maintenance and control of the canals and the regulation of canal use.  This is something we very much welcome, when one sees all sorts of different boats or carriages going up and down the canals.  We also welcome the amendments concerning the appointment and the powers of the authorised officers, who will be able to take action.  I do not wish to refer to all sections of the Heritage Bill, because they will be replaced in this new Act and are only of a technical nature.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill amends section 40 of the Wildlife Acts in relation to the cutting, digging up and burning of vegetation on uncultivated land.  I can understand the wildlife people, because when one travels around the country, and even in the rural part of Dublin where I live, it is lovely to see all the birds during the spring, through the autumn and even into the winter.  Currently there is a closed season from 1 March to 31 August for the burning of vegetation.  This allows for the protection of bird life during the nesting season in early spring and the protection of vegetation and wildlife habitats during the summer months of growth and reproduction.  In 2015, a review of burning and cutting controls was put to public consultation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In its report, the importance of wildlife habitats, hedgerows and scrub was acknowledged.  It was also said that they need to be managed in the interests of farming and biodiversity.</p><p>There are two sides to the story when it comes to hedgerows.  Landowners and their representatives had often stated that the closed period was too inflexible and should be amended to take account of land management issues, which we can understand.  The Bill introduces a two-year pilot period.  I am delighted that the Minister has taken that into consideration and she will make strict regulations permitting the burning of vegetation during this specified time or at times in March and in specified areas of the State.  In addition, permission will be given to landowners to cut, grub or destroy vegetation in hedges or ditches during August subject to strict restrictions or conditions specified in the regulations.  The Bill also clarifies the powers of authorised officers, updates penalties for offences under the Wildlife Acts and provides for the introduction of fixed payment notices and associated matters.</p><p>The Heritage Bill 2016 proposes to refocus certain functions and activities of the Heritage Council, including how it engages with communities and public authorities, and it deals with the size and composition of the board and its remuneration.  In Part 4 of the Bill, amendments are made to the 1995 Act, including the introduction of a stronger role for the Heritage Council, the removal of payment of remuneration to the council members, changes to its composition and quorum, and the removal of the obligation to establish specific standing committees.  Currently, the Heritage Council is obliged to "co-operate with public authorities, educational bodies and other organisations and persons in the promotion of the functions of the Council".  Section 12 of this Bill provides that it will now be a function of the council to "co-operate with, engage with, advise and support public authorities, local communities and persons in relation to the functions of the Council".  Currently, members of the council and committees of the council are entitled to remuneration and allowances for expenses incurred by them.  The Bill amends the entitlement to remuneration, whereby members of the council or its committees will now only be entitled to allowances for expenses and no remuneration will be paid, which must be welcomed.  Other changes relating to the Heritage Council in the Bill reduce the number of board members to between eight and ten, excluding the Chair, and will address the issue of gender balance.  It is proposed that there will be at least four gentlemen and four ladies on the board.  It also reduces the quorum to five.  The Bill removes the obligation on the council to set up standing committees on each of its areas of responsibility - namely, wildlife, archaeology, architectural heritage, and inland waterways - and refocuses a streamlined council, whose principal function is to facilitate the grant-aiding of heritage from various sources and engage with and support local government and communities in the capacity of building and support.</p><p>While many areas of sensitivity are involved here, and representations have been made to most of us in this House regarding the proposed changes to the Wildlife Act, I am happy that the Minister and her Department have given due consideration to putting in place a fair and balanced system while ensuring the protection of biodiversity.  An assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is made on continuing these measures beyond the pilot period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#DD00200"><p>I would like to address two issues first.  One was raised by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, which has complained about a poor consultation process, despite what the Minister said.  It made a number of other points, but I am sure it has also made them to the Minister.  I want to concentrate on section 40, but Inland Fisheries Ireland has also contacted me.  It approves of paragraph 40(2)(<i>d</i>) about the management of noxious weeds, but suggests  it should be expanded to cover invasive plant species.  I ask the Minister to consider that point, because there is a serious problem with invasive plant species.</p><p>The real problem that concerns me is the fact that the Bill will give the Minister the power to make regulations to permit the burning of vegetation during a specified time or times in March in specified areas of the State and, in addition, to allow landowners or their agents to cut, grub or destroy vegetation in any hedge or ditch during August.  These are very serious matters.  In a press statement, the Minister discussed the submissions received.  She also referred to them in her speech.  However, she failed to mention that the vast majority of them were opposed to section 40 and they were from the most concerned areas - from Birdwatch Ireland, An Taisce and so on.  All these groups opposed section 40.  This is just a gesture for the farmers, coming up to an election.  That is all it is.  It is perfectly naked.</p><p>The Minister said &quot;[m]anaged hedge cutting will be allowed, under strict criteria, during August to help ensure issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled&quot;.  For God's sake, can they not be done at any time of the year?  I was the person in this House who raised the issue of the danger to pedestrians and road traffic from overgrown hedges because I was briefed on it by somebody who was involved in a serious accident, so I know all about it, but it does not have to be done in August.  It is laughable to think of it being done in August when the farmers are harvesting.  They are busy at work.  Why do they need to do it then, which is right in the middle of the nesting season?</p><p>There are a number of threatened birds.  We have already been up before the European court and we have been found guilty.  The Minister actually quoted section 40 as a protection in that case, but the European court found it was not strong enough and was not sufficient.  I do not know what the Minister has to say about that.  Then she has the amazing gall to quote biodiversity.  How in the name of God is the Minister encouraging biodiversity by pulling down the hedgerows that are full of biodiversity, not only in terms of birds' nests, but also seeds, plants, and all that kind of stuff?  Every survey has shown that more intensive hedgerow cutting leads to a catastrophic decline of up to 75% in species of berry and so on, and also in bird life.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How this can be described as biodiversity is beyond me.  We already have section 40, which allows for a wide range of exemptions, so I wonder why the Minister is introducing this.  There is already a catalogue of exemptions from this restriction.  They allow for: the destroying, in the ordinary course of agriculture or forestry, of any vegetation growing on or in any ditch or hedge; the cutting or grubbing of isolated bushes or clumps of gorse, furze or whin or the mowing of isolated growths of fern in the ordinary course of agriculture; the cutting, grubbing or destroying of vegetation in the course of any works being duly carried out for reasons of public health or safety by a Minister of the Government or a body established or regulated by or under that statute; the clearance of vegetation in the course of fisheries development; the destroying of any noxious weeds; the clearance of vegetation in the course of road or other construction; the removal or destruction of vegetation required by a notice served by the Minister under section 62(1) of the Wildlife Act of 1946.  All of these exemptions are already in place.  What is to prevent the Minister implementing them properly?  They are in the targeted areas where it is necessary.  It is not a type of wholesale unlimited destruction of the natural environment.<br/><br/>The closed dates for burning and cutting are based, in a generic way, on what the Department calls &quot;the generally recognised nesting and breeding period for wild birds&quot;.  In fact, there is a strong case for the precautionary principle to be introduced and for an extension of the closed period to protect early nesting and breeding species in the nest building period, not least in the face of climate change which is already affecting the situation here.  A number of birds nest well into August.  I refer, in particularly, to the yellowhammer, which nests into September.  In the case of burning controls on ground nesting birds, the hen harrier nests well into September.  The exemptions are framed so broadly, for example, for public health and safety, and appear to be regulated so poorly that they arguably provide almost a <i>carte blanche</i>for cutting during the closed period already, without any tampering.  I am extremely concerned about this.<br/><br/>With regard to burning, I remember as a child going to the strand in Sandymount to watch Howth burning after the farmers had set a torch to the furze.  It was always very exciting.  However, fire is estimated to have destroyed 16,000 hectares of land in Ireland in 2011.  Despite it being illegal, Coillte has reported that in the space of one week in April 2010, approximately 1,500 areas of forest had been burnt, putting properties, wildlife and habitats at risk.  This is what we have already.  Research carried out on 100 peatland sites in Ireland indicated that burning was evident in 19% of the sites surveyed with severe damage evident in 8% of the cases.<br/><br/>I have also received submissions from An Taisce, which is opposed to this.  In less than one day it had 4,000 signatures on a petition against these measures.  Hedgerows are critical to our landscape, which is an important aspect of our tourism.  They are important for land protection, including management of soil erosion, land drains and flood management.  They are also critical to biodiversity.  How can the Minister continue to mention biodiversity in this Bill, when it is mentioned so often in the situation referred to by An Taisce?  Seanad &Eacute;ireann is expected in the run up to an election to accept a pig in a poke with this Bill.  We are expected to pass provisions allowing for effective wholesale cutting, grubbing and so forth during the month of August, when many native birds are still nesting, without seeing any associated restricting regulations or any guarantee that such restrictions will be provided.  We are expected to pass the Bill allowing for burning in March without knowing how the areas where it will happen will be selected or how extensive it will be.  The Bill contains a sunset clause of two years but it has an entirely open-ended reactivation clause, so that clause is of no use whatever.  We are told it is a pilot but there is no mechanism to assess it.  Where is the mechanism?  If it is supposed to be a pilot project, surely there should be some provision for assessing the impact.<br/><br/>We are expected to accept section 8(2) of the Bill which provides for wholesale cutting, grubbing and so forth without any clarity about the restrictions, the basis for any restrictions and no guarantee that the proposed regulations will ever be introduced.  By passing this Bill, we will provide for no protection in August, contrary to expert evidence based on the submissions.  I note that the Minister quoted no scientific evidence.  However, the organisations that have briefed me have provided extensive scientific information.  For example, the British Trust for Ornithology provides information on egg laying dates for breeding birds.  This is the most reliable scientific evidence available, since we do not have similar recording of egg laying and nesting activities in Ireland.  We are seeking such data from the Minister.<br/><br/>I return again to the issue of biodiversity.  I have to laugh when a Minister, who is introducing provisions for massive hedge cutting and almost unrestricted burning, talks about biodiversity.  She refers to grubbing.  This grubby little Bill is grubbing out the possibility of biodiversity and is certainly not enhancing it.  I know it will be passed.  That is the mathematics of politics.  However, it will not be passed without my strong objections to it.  They are reasoned objections backed by scientific evidence, which the Minister has failed to produce.  It is a sop to the farming vote for the forthcoming election.</p></speech>

I will not be as eloquent or, indeed, get as worked up as Senator Norris, but I will focus on three general areas of the Bill that are important to the heritage of Ireland - canals, wildlife and the Heritage Council.</p> <p>First, the provisions in Part 4 relate to the Heritage Council.  The council was established to identify, protect, preserve and enhance our national heritage by focusing on areas such as national monuments, architectural objects, archaeological objects, flora, fauna, wildlife, seascapes and parks, to educate the public on these issues and to promote employment and tourism in these areas.  It also seeks to encourage the appreciation of our national heritage by members of the public.  All Members will agree that this is important work.  Our national heritage is key to our identity as a nation and protecting and promoting it are vital.  As such, it is crucial that this work is done in as efficient and effective a manner as possible.  I welcome the aspects of the Bill which seek to streamline and strengthen the Heritage Council.</p> <p>The critical review of the work of the Heritage Council, which was carried out as part of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin's, public service reform plan, made a number of recommendations that are to be implemented in the Bill.  The report proposed two possible options - the abolition of the council or to streamline it.  As the work of the council is so important, I believe that the second option, which the Minister is seeking to implement with this Bill, is the best way forward.  I welcome that board members will no longer receive payment for serving on the board and that they will now only receive remuneration to cover their expenses.  The number of board members is to be reduced while, crucially, maintaining the gender balance.  That is welcome.  I am also pleased that the council will now have to engage in a more effective and productive way with local authorities and local communities.</p> <p>The second area of the Bill I wish to discuss is Part 3, which seeks to amend parts of the Wildlife Act to allow for the cutting of hedgerows in August, on which we have heard all manner of debate, and particularly for an additional month for the burning of vegetation in March.  These months were previously excluded to protect bird life during nesting season and to protect vegetation and habitats during months of growth and reproduction.  I appreciate that a wide public consultation was undertaken before these changes were proposed.  I also appreciate that it is necessary to maintain a balance between the protection of our wildlife and agricultural interests.  However, like other Members, I have received correspondence from a number of environmental agencies and organisations with concerns about parts of the Bill, such as An Taisce, BirdWatch Ireland, the Irish Wildlife Trust and the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland, who have come together to oppose these measures.  They believe the Bill will have a serious impact on a range of wildlife species.  On that, Senator Norris and I agree.  There is an online petition on the issue and at the last glance I took today it had over 7,000 signatures.  However, I accept what the Minister has said about having taken the concerns of the organisations into account.  That is important and welcome.  I ask her to take those concerns into account as the Bill moves forward.</p></speech>

I agree with what Senator Norris said about the wildlife section of the Bill, but I would emphasise its other two parts, namely, canals and the Heritage Council.  We have our Minister, Minister Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n who will look after the same activities in Northern Ireland, and Dawn Livingstone who is the chief executive of Waterways Ireland.  Gender balance has been extremely well achieved.</p><p>I will discuss some of the sections that concern me.  Section 4(<i>c</i>) refers to the closing to navigation of any part of the canals and section 4(<i>g</i>) to the opening to navigation of any parts of the canals.  I would put more emphasis on another part of the section.  There are proposals to extend the Ulster Canal to the scout camp near Belturbet.  I am sure the people of Clones agitate with the Minister to restore the canal.  </p><p>Canals are linear parks and people like Dr. Ian Bath promoted that idea as the goal.  They are not just for the boat people the Minister for State mentioned.  They are a wider amenity.  From reading the documentation, I understand Waterways Ireland costs about &pound;50 million sterling a year and a large part of the emphasis seems to involve trying to bring in some money from boat users.  Perhaps we should consider them in a wider context, not just Belturbet, Clones and so on, but places such as Klibeggan, Mountmellick and the Newry Canal.</p><p>The Northern Ireland report on waterways and their success notes that the Lagan towpath is visited by 1 million people a year.  It is one of the most visited amenities.  Some positive changes might be considered..</p><p>I refer to the property section and the representations made by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland.  It is concerned about authorised officers and people for whom boats are houses.  The relevant section of the Bill states that authorised officers will need a search warrant to come into the part of the boat which is the residence, but how will we deal with situations where an entire vessel is a residence?  There are concerns about that.  A boat may not simply involve part of a very private dwelling; rather, the entire vessel could be a private dwelling.  There is a need for communication on the concerns of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland about the powers of the authorised officers.  I gather it would prefer to deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and further consultation.  It regards 21 days as insufficient and wishes to see the period extended to 60 days.</p><p>The canal system is capable of significant development right through to Lough Neagh.  The Newry canal and what is being done in Belfast were mentioned.  We need to develop a better connection between the Royal Canal and Dublin Port, something that is referred to in the strategic plan for Waterways Ireland.  Perhaps there could be Grand Canal access to the River Liffey.  I see that in a very positive light.</p><p>The Bill is somewhat dismissive of what the Heritage Council has done.  I understand half of the members, or at least a substantial number, take no fee at all, and if they do it would be a sum of &euro;5,000.  Making a gesture by taking away a relatively small fee and reducing the board from 14 to eight members seems to be a case of somebody somewhere wanting to teach the Heritage Council a lesson.  It does valuable work and I am in favour of giving people a pat on the back and commending them.</p><p>The Bill proposes to delete the section that the council shall establish standing committees on wildlife, archaeology, architectural heritage and inland waterways and that it could have members which are not members of the council on those standing committees.  I do not why we do not cherish the Heritage Council more.  I see no great problem in the establishment of such sub-committees. </p><p>The work the Heritage Council has done in Kilkenny and increasing the appreciation of heritage and how it relates to educational bodies are things which I would broadly support.  Its funding is being cut unnecessarily.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the extra time.  I wish the Minister success in her endeavours in canals, wildlife and the work of the Heritage Council.</p></speech>

I refer to the burning of overgrowth and commonages, in particular heather.  Over the years mountains were under-grazed and there was a problem with heather growing too long.  It had to be managed in a proper order.  The fact that this will be reviewed in two years' time is good news.  We can examine how it works out and introduce the scheme on a pilot basis.  The burning of heather in the uplands is very important to control the growth.  Once it is controlled and burned in a managed way, it will be of much more use to the animals that graze it, from a farming point of view, and wildlife.</p> <p>We work very closely with people in commonage areas who are reintroducing grouse, in particular - I have an interest in this in Leitrim.  The groups involved told us if heather is managed and burned in small areas, it will be of much more use to the grouse when they hatch and are being reared on the mountains afterwards.  It will prevent heather from getting too long for sheep farmers and will also be of much more use to them.  When heather is much too long, farmers are penalised and disqualified from certain payments, which we have seen in the past.  From a farming point of view, it is very important that this is managed.</p> <p>My colleagues have mentioned the dangers of overgrowth along the hedges on roadsides where people are walking.  We must continue to encourage people to use the roadways to exercise more, but there is nothing as annoying when one is walking or running along the roadway as getting a slap of a branch on the side of face or a cut on a leg from a briar or whatever else.  It is very important that overgrowth is cut as summer goes on, and August is the ideal time to do that.  Last year, there were problems in my county, Leitrim, whereby a school bus had difficulty in travelling on a very narrow road.  The mirrors on the bus were constantly broken and the driver refused to drive the bus because of the overgrowth which was damaging the vehicle, and the hedge had to be cut on a Saturday.</p> <p>This is a very worthwhile Bill.  It involves a pilot scheme which can be reviewed after two years.  If any changes are needed after that, that will be possible. </p></speech>

Some time ago I had the pleasure of congratulating her on her work, in particular on 1 January at the flag raising ceremony and concert she laid on.  I am afraid that today is not her finest hour.  Like most Senators in this House, I have been contacted by people who have grave concerns about the Bill before the House today.  I thank a colleague of mine in Cork, Councillor Marcia D'Alton, for her efforts regarding what I have about to say.  She stated:</p><blockquote>It is sadly ironic that the Heritage Bill is being debated in the Seanad today - Penguin Awareness Day.  Penguins worldwide are facing extinction due to loss of habitat caused by human practices.  And in Ireland, the numbers of so many upland birds... are exhibiting massive decline also because of loss of habitat caused by human practices.<br /><br />There has been a large cry from the farming and other communities to extend the legally permissible burning season.  It is true that our legal burning season in Ireland is very much shorter than it is, for example, in Scotland and England.  The restrictions on burning were tightened in 2000, primarily to reflect concerns about the nesting season.</blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The letter continues to explain how, since 2000 and despite these restrictions, our uplands have continued to decline.  An assessment prepared by the Government for the European Commission in 2013 found that the upland habitats were in a bad state.  Many birds were breeding in upland habitats listed as areas of critical concern in respect of conservation.</p><p>The most sympathetic of considerations indicates that the current stricter controls on burning are simply not working.  Why is this?  It is because conservation of uplands is not simply about burning.  Vegetation management in the uplands is critically linked to the biodiversity welfare of the uplands.  Too much vegetation is as bad as too little vegetation.  Traditionally, farmers, in particular, sheep farmers, were the caretakers of the uplands.  Their sheep kept vegetation levels down, they burned in small areas regularly and vegetation recovery was possible and cyclical.  Up to 2011, these farmers had the opportunity to be rewarded for such sensitive land management practices through the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  By 2011 REPS was done away with and replaced by the agri-environment options scheme.  Under the scheme, assistance is provided by Teagasc to prepare a plan, but the plan focuses primarily on the restoration of over-grazed areas.  It does not require a farm survey or offer any guidelines on when grazing should occur.  It does not suggest measures to encourage co-operation between farmers with commonage.  It does not include a burning plan.</p><p>The number of upland sheep farmers is in decline.  They simply cannot make the same profits as lowland farmers.  The work is difficult, especially for an ageing population.  Many of these farmers depended on REPS to supplement their income, but the financial benefits under the AEOS are far smaller than under REPS.  Since the number of upland farmers is in decline, the number of sheep is in decline as well.  Therefore, vegetation is not kept as it would be otherwise.</p><p>Another significant issue is that farmers do not control unwanted invasive species on land under the single farm payment scheme.  Penalties may occur, but some species regarded as invasive may act as valuable habitat for native birds and wildlife.  When burning season opens, fewer farmers are trying to control higher vegetation on larger areas of upland during a shorter season.  This leads to large uncontrolled burning.  It is too hot, it targets the wrong species and it occurs over wide areas.  There is a major detrimental impact on the wildlife, and not only birds.  The practice encourages soil erosion, there is much added danger and the areas take a long time to recover.</p><p>We have a major balancing issue but it is not going to be resolved by revision of the heritage legislation today.  All today's Bill does is permit the Minister to make regulations to extend the burning season.  We badly need an improvement management system for the uplands with a genuine understanding of farm management issues and biodiversity issues.  These are intimately related.  The management system needs to be informed by a code of good practice for burning.  This needs to be drawn up in conjunction with farmers and ecologists.  I note we have a code of prescribed burning drawn up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2011, but this is targeted towards facilitating the larger farmer.</p><p>The point being made by Councillor D'Alton is that the Bill is flawed and we should do everything we can to stop it.  She makes reference to the Heritage Council.  My colleague, Senator Barrett, has addressed this point today as well.  She says that despite whatever protestations the Minister may make to the contrary, the council is very much the poor relation when it comes to funding.  Funding from Government to the Heritage Council has been slashed by almost 90% since 2011.  She fears that the changes proposed to the board structure and remuneration would further undermine the invaluable statutory function of the Heritage Council.</p></speech>

With all due respect to her, however, I do not welcome the Bill and it does not enjoy my support.  Indeed, it will not enjoy my support and I am minded to vote against it.  I do not lay the charge at the door of the Minister but I call on her to ensure she does not leave this as her legacy.  She should not allow this to be the last legislation she puts on the Statute Book before the D&aacute;il is dissolved and we go to the country in a general election.</p> <p>Serious issues are at stake.  I have no wish to fall foul of the farming community but certainly I am crying foul today.  The Minister, her officials and those behind this legislation cannot speak out of both sides of their mouths on this matter.  The Minister cannot say that she is in favour of balance and biodiversity while introducing this Bill.  Section 40 is an assault on the landscape and habitat.  It is an assault on conservation, our wildlife and our natural heritage.  I note that the Title of the Bill is rather innocuous - the Heritage Bill 2016.  It is a Trojan horse for an attack on our heritage.  It represents an assault on our natural heritage and landscape.  No one in his right mind would extend the hedge-cutting, hedge-burning and scrub-burning season by a full two months while claiming to have any regard for wildlife, heritage, conservation or habitats.  I strenuously oppose that section and I urge the Minister to reconsider it.  It should be withdrawn and I hope it makes no further progress in this House.  Moreover, I hope it makes no progress in the Lower House and that time betrays and delays it to the point where it falls with the Government and never sees the light of day again.</p> <p>I live in the countryside.  All the decent farmers I know respect the landscape, habitats and nature.  They believe biodiversity is important for food production and the balance of nature.  They know it is important for all other aspects of a sustainable lifestyle in the countryside, including those referred to previously, such as tourism and natural heritage, aspects which attracts so many visitors.</p> <p>I am sick and tired of people speaking out of both sides of their mouths, talking about our natural heritage and how much they respect, love and value it.  This is not valuing our natural heritage, wildlife, flora or fauna.  Is the Minister honestly trying to tell me that the farmers of this country need two further months in the year to tend to hedgerows?  I do not think so.</p> <p>I have heard it all today.  While I have great respect for my colleagues, Senator Eamonn Coghlan and Senator Michael Comiskey, from whom I take advice on agricultural and farming matters, and indeed I take advice on other matters from Senator Coghlan, I did not know until today that hedgerows throughout this country have a habit of attacking people.  It is absurd to suggest that the briary thorns of a blackberry bush amount to just cause to bring in these draconian measures.</p> <p>Everyone should tend to their hedgerows.  The landscape should be maintained and we must have balance, but there is already provision in the case of road safety issues.  If road safety concerns arise, the law already provides for intervention to deal with it.  It is a ruse to suggest there are road safety or pedestrian safety issues.  It is a guise to introduce this measure under a two-year pilot programme.  It will never be clawed back or rolled back.  It will be in place forever.</p> <p>People come to this House week after week saying they are concerned about our heritage.  What about the curlew, the golden plover, the skylark, the meadow pipet, the yellowhammer, the greenfinch and the linnet?  They will be decimated if we desecrate the hedgerows in March and August as proposed in this legislation.  It is absurd.  There has not been adequate consultation.  The Bill was published in Christmas week.  Now, here we are trying to sneak it through in the dying days of the Government and the House.  It is not necessary.  I know of no farmers calling for this measure.  If there are unique examples or extenuating circumstances where hedgerows have to be addressed, there is already provision in law for that to be tackled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Whelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are here talking about green food, green technology, green energy, green economy and green jobs.  It is paying lip service.  There are talks about climate change.  There is nothing green about the provisions in this Bill.  There is nothing pro-heritage in the proposals in section 40.  It is anti-environment, anti-conservation and anti-habitat.  It is an attack on the wildlife and the countryside of this country.  It is not pro-rural Ireland.  Most right-thinking farmers and landowners would agree with me that there is adequate provision in law to address hedgerows in the existing timeframe and if one needs to extend beyond that, one can seek permission to do so as it is allowed.  We are here blue in the face paying lip service to the climate change issue.</p><p>This is a further attack on the countryside.  It is not good for the economy, for the countryside or for our conservation policies.  It is an attack on the landscape, and that is even before I get to the issues around the canal by-laws.  The Minister's predecessor, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Deenihan, tried to introduce those and we saw them off three years ago, and now here we have another Trojan horse attempt to sneak them in before the Government is dissolved.  Those by-laws are not robust by-laws.  They are also draconian by-laws to curb ordinary decent people trying to use the canals of this country.</p><p>I do not agree with this Bill.  It does not enjoy my support and I will not be supporting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#HH00200"><p>D&aacute;r nd&oacute;igh, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.</p> <p>I will address my comments to the contents of Part 4 of the Bill.  Over the past 20 years, the Heritage Council has done excellent work in carrying out the functions that have been assigned to it under the Heritage Act of 1995.  Indeed, in May last I had the pleasure of visiting the information exhibition that was organised by the council specifically for Members of the Oireachtas and it was heartening to listen to representatives of a dozen or so not-for-profit heritage organisations on that occasion extol the changes that the Heritage Council has brought about by using its limited means to work with its local and national partners.  The benefits to communities the length and breadth of the country, in terms of economic activity, job creation and enhancing the quality of rural community life, cannot be over emphasised.  This is work that improved the quality of where we live and it is critical to maintaining and enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland to overseas tourists.</p> <p>However, I believe that a refocusing of activities and functions of the Heritage Council, as is proposed in the Bill, with a particular emphasis on engagement with public authorities and local communities but to the exclusion of educational bodies and other organisations, will adversely affect the work of those educational bodies and other organisations.  I have had a look at the strategic plan for 2012 to 2016 of the Heritage Council and I note that it refers to the importance of working with numerous organisations in order to achieve the outcomes of this plan.  Such bodies and organisations include local authorities, educational bodies and many other bodies, some of which are educational trusts and some of which have a nationwide brief.  While I appreciate the wording in the Bill to amend the Heritage Act 1995 at section 6(3)(b), I strongly believe that the functions of the Heritage Council must also include the original emphasis of engagement with, "educational bodies and other organisations".  The Heritage Council cites bodies, such as the Discovery Programme, the National Biodiversity Data Centre, the Irish Landmark Trust, the Museums Standards Programme, as key partners in enabling it to achieve its outcomes, and most, if not all, of these bodies have educational objectives.  How are we to know in the years ahead that there may not be other not-for-profit public organisations that become involved in important national heritage undertakings that would benefit from the support of the Heritage Council?  These organisations must not be precluded from seeking public support and therefore we need to ensure that the Bill does not eliminate hardworking publicly-motivated bodies.  The Bill's amendment of section 6(3)(b) of the 1995 Act must be further amended to retain the phrase, "educational bodies and other organisations".</p> <p>As a matter of public policy, it is important to include within the requirements, not only of support but of consultation, educational bodies and other organisations, whether they be publicly-funded bodies or private bodies.  As a matter of public policy, why would one deliberately excise a reference to consultation with educational bodies and other organisations?  What mischief is the Minister trying to address by taking it out?  It is good to include consultation with the community and other persons, but why would one take out a reference to educational bodies and other organisations?  What is that designed to achieve?  It seems that can only do mischief.  We should be promoting a culture of consultation with educational bodies and other organisations, and, indeed, the support for those, and for their initiatives, as arises.</p> <p>As to the rest of the Bill, it is a great pity that it proposes to remove the requirement for the Heritage Council to establish statutory standing committees on wildlife, archeology, architectural heritage and inland waterways and given the proposed reduction in the number of board directors, it seems it will not always be possible to have board members or, indeed, standing committee members who are skilled in directing the board to effect policies in all the different heritage areas that are cited at section 6(1) of the 1995 Act.  Of course, I am aware that the Heritage Council will still be able to appoint committees as it requires and that is why I am concentrating my fire, as it were, on the need to change the amendment to section 6(3)(b) of the 1995 Act contained in the Bill so as to reinsert the reference to "educational bodies and other organisations".  It should not really fall to us here in the House to have to propose the amendment.  It is a reasonable, minor amendment that the Minister could bring forward on Committee Stage and I think everybody in the House would support it.  I am requesting the Minister to revisit that section and to reinsert the reference to "educational bodies and other organisations" at section 6(3)(b).  If the Minister is minded to make this amendment - obviously, we will need to propose it if she does not - it will ensure that the Heritage Council does not lose its original focus as it further develops its functions and inclusivity in so many important heritage areas in Ireland.</p></speech>

The amendments to the Canal Act 1986 are primarily enabling provisions to allow for the making of by-laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow navigation.  The existing provisions are very much out of date and the new provisions will allow for better management and better maintenance and control of the canals, which are a fantastic public resource and which, I reiterate, are under-utilised.</p> <p>The proposed amendments will include provisions for the regulation of the canals, the issue of permits or licences to regulate the use of boats on the canals and on canal property, the regulation of the type or class of boat, including the dimensions, which may be used on the canals, and the regulation of berths and moorings and the placing of buoys on the canals or other canal property.  There is nothing nicer to see than a boat navigating the canals.  One sees them in other countries such as the United Kingdom, and the resulting benefits to the communities.</p> <p>On appointment and powers of authorised officers, the Bill provides for powers of entry, the issue of search warrants and the service of directions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Brennan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2360"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2360&amp;amp;pid=TerryBrennan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The legislation will also provide for a number of miscellaneous amendments, mostly of a technical nature, including to section 56 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005 and the consequent repeal of section 56.  It will update the references to the titles of the various Ministers in the Act to reflect the current applying position.  It will amend to "Waterways Ireland" those references to the Commissioners of Public Works relating to the functions transferred to Waterways Ireland by the British-Irish Agreement Acts 1999-2005.  It will provide for the deletion of section 13 - this provision expired three years after the vesting day - and further details on proposed amendments are contained in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Heritage Bill 2016.</p><p>Waterways Ireland is responsible for the management, maintenance and development of over 1,000 km of inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational use.  These waterways include the lower Bann, the Royal and Grand Canals, the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the River Barrow and the River Shannon and further information is available here.</p><p>I want to see our waterways opened up and the North-South link maintained.  I want to see opportunities for employment for small villages and small businesses located on the canals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-20a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016012000002#JJ00200"><p>I thank those Senators who have participated, some of whose contributions have been practical and helpful in regard to canals, wildlife and heritage council elements of the amending legislation.  On the canals, I welcome Senator Barrett's constructive and positive comments as our canals are valuable resources and public amenities.  Like Senator Brennan, I want to see our canals further invested in.  I want to see the Ulster Canal open.  It is the last piece in the jigsaw and I was delighted to get approval from Government last year to commence work on the first stage of the Ulster Canal from Belturbet to Castle Saunderson.  As the canal moves towards Clones on an incremental basis it will open up a whole new area of tourism and greenways and that will be hugely positive for the area.</p><p>Waterways Ireland is proactive in developing the recreational aspects of the canal.  On the powers of authorised officers to enter boats that are permanent dwellings, protection is provided by the requirement to obtain a search warrant which can only be granted by a judge of the District Court.  There was extensive consultation by Waterways Ireland during the consultation period on the draft canal by-laws and over 2,000 submissions were received.  This is evidence of a very positive consultation process.  I have taken note of the comments on the consultation period extending beyond 21 days.</p><p>I welcome Members' support for the provisions clarifying the powers of my Department's authorised officers and for updating penalties for offences under the Wildlife Acts.  In answer to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, there will be a further consultation process regarding the regulations on hedge cutting and burning and we need to get the right balance in achieving road safety, managing our environment and protecting flora and fauna.  I note the concerns of some Members on the impact of the provisions relating to burning and hedge cutting on bird life, especially relating to the nesting period of bird species.  There seems to be some misunderstanding here.  We plan, in a very controlled environment, to move the hedge cutting date from 1 September to 1 August on a pilot basis.  In answer to Senator Craughwell, regulations made on burning will include guidelines on burning in upland areas and will take account of our obligations under the EU nature directives.</p><p>Senator Comiskey is right; if there is proper management of the uplands it will benefit wildlife.  I live in the country and birds and the natural environment surround me so I am very conscious of this.  I want birds to be protected and doing this in a managed and proper way will benefit wildlife.  Senator Norris had a few interesting things to say.  He said that August is the middle of the nesting period.  That is absolute nonsense - August is not in the middle of the nesting period and anybody who lives in the country, or even who lives in a city, should be aware of that.  The hen harrier is a protected species so it is incumbent on a landowner to ensure no harm is done to the hen harrier, no matter what time of the year cutting or burning takes place.  It is very important to note that landowners must take account of the habitats directive and the onus on them to make sure they do not do any damage to wildlife.  People should realise that we depend on our rural dwellers and the farming community to help manage and maintain our countryside.  </p><p>Reference was made to the birds case.  My Department, in conjunction with a number of Government Departments and agencies, has been engaged in a significant programme of work to meet the requirements of this case since the findings were published in 2007 and, as a result of these efforts, the majority of the findings have been addressed to the satisfaction of the European Commission and no fines have been applied against the State.  We must ensure that the changes to the hedge-cutting period in August does not impact on our population of wild birds, including the yellowhammers and many other species that have been mentioned here today.  Any such cutting will be subject to conditions and restrictions which will be specified in regulations on hedgerow husbandry, management and maintenance to protect fauna and flora.  There is a sunset clause in the Bill and I will review the operation of the provision after two years.  My Department will also gather data to underpin the decision and this will include data on bird nesting and the level and impact of cutting.  </p><p>During the consultation process, 188 submissions were received, ranging from detailed submissions to individual, brief points of view.  Stakeholder groups, such as Birdwatch Ireland, An Taisce, the IFA, the ICMSA and Government Departments and local authorities were among those to respond.  Some 102 submissions were received from members of the public, 44 from representative bodies, 29 from other Government Departments and local authorities, eight from elected representatives and five from businesses and consultancies.  </p><p>The changes to the Heritage Council mainly relate to governance procedures and have arisen as a result of a detailed review undertaken in 2012.  I agree that the Heritage Council does great work and is very good at engaging with communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is one of its great strengths.  All of the changes proposed in this Bill have been agreed with the Heritage Council.  I want to reassure the Senators that my Department works very closely with the Heritage Council. </p><p>I say to Senator Craughwell that the councillor gave him wrong information because funding for the Heritage Council has increased by 15% over the past two years.  Its funding remained constant between 2011 and 2013 and has increased since.  As the economy continues to improve I want to see more investment in our heritage.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the supporting comments by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill of the review of the Heritage Council.  The role of the council in terms of heritage, education and awareness is very important and that is why it is an essential part of working with communities, as outlined in the Bill.  </p><p>The Bill has been brought forward with the agreement of the Heritage Council.
