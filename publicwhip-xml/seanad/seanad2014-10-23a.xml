I wish to bring to the attention of the House that between September 2013 and September 2014, 71,251 medical cards were removed.  Of these, over 17,543 were over-70s medical cards.  I am still receiving complaints, queries and requests for assistance from people with long-term illnesses and people over 70 who are still losing their medical cards.  This issue has not gone away and I would like the Minister to address that specific issue in a meaningful way during the forthcoming general debate on health.</p><p>I listened with great dismay and disgust this morning to the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy, Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; and on a programme on Newstalk.  I am absolutely disgusted at the manner in which his party is dealing with these very serious allegations.  We have had our issues with institutional child sexual abuse both in the churches and State institutions.  A light was shone on that and rightly so.  I am at a loss to understand where Sinn F&eacute;in is at on this.  The public is entitled to know.  It is unfortunate that Sinn F&eacute;in representatives are not in the Chamber this morning  ---</p></speech>

I want to know - perhaps the Leader through the Taoiseach can assist on this - how many paedophiles and rapists they banished to towns and villages all over the Republic of Ireland.  How many did they banish?  Who are these people?  Will they furnish a list of these people to the authorities here?  If I go back to my home in Malahide today, I do not know whether there is someone living in that town who is a paedophile, dealt with by this apparent IRA-Sinn F&eacute;in justice.  The public is entitled to know who these people are.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not answer those questions and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's performance this morning was nothing but a disgrace.  I have never heard anything like it, to be frank.  This issue is crucially important.  The Seanad should send out a clear message today that all of us who were democratically elected and who are confirmed democrats call on Sinn F&eacute;in to furnish the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with all of the details it has in its possession.  I further ask that the Taoiseach requests, through the Minister for Justice and Equality, that the Garda Commissioner puts a special investigation in place and that Deputy Adams and others are questioned about what they know.</p><p>Finally, I have raised the issue of Fampyra on numerous occasions in this House.  There are 1,500 multiple sclerosis sufferers in Ireland who cannot access this life-changing drug.  Since 25 July this year, the drug has not been available to people and is still being reviewed.  I have written countless times to the Minister for Health but I cannot get any answers.  I spoke to a lady yesterday who cannot work anymore because her mobility has decreased so much.  She cannot access this drug because it costs &euro;270.  In that context, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business today, calling on the Minister of Health come to the House today for 15 minutes to give an update on the situation regarding Fampyra and to indicate when it will be issued to the 1,500 multiple sclerosis sufferers in this country who deserve it.</p></speech>

I have been given a dossier on the &Aacute;ine Tyrell case, information about which is in the public domain following the trial and conviction of Liam Adams last year.  That case raises disturbing questions about more than one situation in which there appears to have been a cover up of sex abuse allegations and a moving on of perpetrators of sexual abuse.  As Senator O'Brien has said, we have seen that happen within other institutions, particularly the Catholic Church and certain religious orders and it is very disturbing to see it happen within any political party.  Public scrutiny and being open to such scrutiny is an essential part of democratisation.  That is an important point for all political parties.  They must be open to public scrutiny and members of political parties must feel free to express dissatisfaction with their party leadership if they so feel.  All of us who are in parties - with the exception of the members of Sinn F&eacute;in - can express our dissatisfaction openly.  I will say no more on that issue.</p><p>I thank colleagues from both sides of the House who attended the briefing I organised yesterday with SafeIreland, which launched its ManUp campaign against domestic violence this week.  We were delighted to have Lynn Rosenthal in Leinster House yesterday as a guest of SafeIreland.  She is the White House adviser on violence against women and works with Joe Biden, the Vice President.  She is an inspirational women and it was very instructive to hear from her about campaigns against domestic and sexual violence in the US.</p><p>I also commend Senator Power on her motion on Palestine.  I did not get a chance to do so yesterday.  I am very glad that we had the opportunity in the House to express support for that motion which seeks recognition for Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution, which is an important plank of Irish Government's foreign policy in respect of the Middle East.  I am also glad that we will have a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who will give us an update on the situation in Palestine and the Middle East on 26 November.  </p><p>On 5 November we will have a debate on a number of criminal justice matters, including two criminal justice Bills which will be back before the House.  I look forward, during that debate, to raising some of the issues which were raised at an excellent conference I attended on 13 October organised by SECILE - Securing Europe through Counter-terrorism - Impact, Legitimacy, Effectiveness.  SECILE is a really important coalition of academics and practitioners in criminal justice who specifically work on counter-terrorism matters.  They raised a number of important points at that conference about the way in which we legislate to deal with counter-terrorism matters.  The insights I learned at that conference will be of great use during the forthcoming debate on criminal justice, mutual assistance and anti-terrorism legislation on 5 November. </p><p>Finally I wish to put in a plug for the Labour Party's Private Member's motion to be debated on 5 November on a criminal justice matter, specifically on penal reform.  The motion asks the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline her response to the recent papers produced by the expert group and the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on penal reform.  I look forward to the Minister updating the House on developments, many of which are very positive, in the field of penal reform and on her proposals for future change.</p></speech>

The Speaker of the Canadian Senate, Mr. Noel Kinsella, is a great friend of this country.  He has called a meeting of the Senate to show terrorists that democracy will continue in his country.  The Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Mr. Andrew Scheer, also deserves our solidarity following this outrageous attack.</p><p>The Canadian coat of arms includes three golden lions representing England, the lion rampant of Scotland, the Irish harp of Tara, the royal fleurs-de-lis of France and the maple leaf. </p> <p>That parliament was established by Thomas D'Arcy McGee from Carlingford, County Louth.  It is an inclusive, welcoming and multicultural society and deserves the support of this House at this critical time.</p><p>I understand the proceedings on the Seanad motion on the Palestinian issue were covered on the BBC World Service early this morning, again showing the prestige in which the House is held internationally.</p><p>We have now spent &euro;10.1 million on the charging infrastructure for electric cars and &euro;2.26 million on subsidies, which comes to &euro;27,000 for each of the 482 cars in use.  Could we, please, read the small print before embarking on these trendy causes?  We have ended up spending &euro;12.36 million and all Members would find better ways to spend the money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014102300004#C00200"><p>Before I ask the Leader for a debate on the principal issue I wish to raise, I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien in his comments on Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's interview on radio this morning.  It is ironic that the Deputy should say the only way to deal with the issue is in a court of law when the group with which he is associated did not recognise the institutions of the State, North or South, that is, the Garda and the Army.  How many times did members of Sinn F&eacute;in stand in the dock and say they did not recognise the court?  Senator Darragh O'Brien is correct in stating Sinn F&eacute;in must release a list of the people, paedophiles and rapists, who were banished, either North or South, because the safety of children and others was affected.</p><p>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the beef industry.  I have raised on numerous occasions the issue of the low prices farmers are receiving.  Next Monday farmers are being forced to blockade the factories and not to allow animals to enter them in protest at the prices they are receiving.  The prices are &euro;1 per kilo or &euro;350 per carcass lower than what farmers are receiving in Northern Ireland.  The Government has shown its commitment to agriculture in the budget by introducing measures on land leasing and tax reliefs for farmers.  Farmers, however, cannot live on these measure alone; they must also get a fair price.  Since taking office the Minister has worked and has opened up new markets.  In the past two weeks we have seen the largest kill this year, with the slaughter of more than 35,000 animals.  Factories would not be killing this number unless they had the markets for their produce.  The animals are not being slaughtered to be put in cold storage.  As cattle from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are being sold to the same major English supermarkets, why is there a discount on the price of cattle from the South?  The truth is that farmers are being ripped off.  Next Wednesday we will have the third meeting of the beef round table forum which will discuss the meat factories' response to the Dowling report.  I ask members of the forum to ask the right questions and put pressure on the factories to treat farmers in a fair manner.  The current price is unsustainable and farmers will exit the beef industry in their thousands unless something is done.  I wish the IFA and the farming organisations the best of luck during the blockade.  I hope somebody will stands up and take notice.</p></speech>

I know that Senator Pat O'Neill will have greater influence in Brussels in a few weeks' time when his and our friend will take over as Commissioner.  I congratulate Mr. Hogan on his endorsement yesterday and wish him well in the Commission.</p><p>Last night I attended a function in County Roscommon when the freedom of Country Roscommon was given to the well known actor Chris O'Dowd who was there with his lovely wife, Dawn O'Porter.  It was a wonderful occasion to highlight the benefits of living in County Roscommon and a great public relations exercise.  One point that struck me was that because of the new legislation the office holder of the county council was addressed as Cathaoirleach as opposed to mayor.  There is room for flexibility in that regard and I hope there will be some change in the regulations.</p><p>Last night I had the opportunity to watch &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;, a programme I do not watch very often, which was broadcast at 12.25 a.m.  I was absolutely appalled and disappointed that the deliberations of Seanad &Eacute;ireann were totally ignored.  The ejection of three Members of the D&aacute;il dominated the programme which refused to recognise the fact that Senator Averil Power had tabled a motion which was agreed to by the House recommending to the Government the recognition of Palestine as a state.  As Senator Sean D. Barrett said, the work of this House was recognised on the BBC World Service this morning, yet a form of censorship is being operated by those producing &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;.  They refused to recognise the contribution of those in the Seanad Chamber yesterday.  Furthermore, Senator David Norris's Bill was also ignored.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the relevant authorities.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are equal but designated as the Lower and the Upper House.  As the people endorsed the continuation of the Seanad, we are entitled to a fair share of media coverage.  I understand the Oireachtas has a public relations unit which should be representing the Oireachtas in terms of how it is presented to the public.  I condemn the activities of the directors and producers of this programme.  I regard it as a form of censorship by national broadcasters who may think the issues raised in the House yesterday were not in line with the sensibilities of those who are now very senior in RTE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014102300004#C00800"><p>Strangely enough, I received a very prompt response from RTE yesterday on the issue I had raised about our national games.  It does watch what we are doing.  The response was not very constructive, but we will follow up on it.</p><p>Anti-social behaviour is rife.  In a research paper entitled, Tackling anti-social behaviour: international problems, indigenous solutions, Jacinta Cunneen, a research fellow at the University of Limerick, states: &quot;It incorporates diverse low and high-level deviant behaviours with a set of unconnected ideas about risk, crime and management underpinning it&quot;.  In recent years we have seen where people cannot travel on buses or the Luas.  People do not feel safe on O'Connell Street or other streets in Dublin.  What is not carried in the media is that anti-social behaviour is also rife in rural Ireland.  In the past week I have seen in my own town, Carrick-on-Suir, vacant houses being attacked and burned.  In other parts of the country private property has been maliciously attacked for no reason.  Dogs and animals have been taken and killed; in some cases they have been hung over lines and electrocuted or burned.  Elderly people have also been attacked.  The most frightening incident about which I have heard in my many years in public life happened this week in Nenagh, County Tipperary, where a 52 year old man who was out for a walk with his dog was set upon by schoolchildren and almost kicked to death on the street.  That is disgraceful.  The Garda has been doing its best and millions of euro has been invested in CCTV cameras across the country.  We had them installed in Carrick-on-Suir and it has helped in tackling anti-social behaviour.</p></speech>

Before we broke up for the summer recess I tabled an Adjournment matter asking the Minister for Health about the master plan for St. James's.  I remind the House that the Dolphin report asked that a master plan be presented by the hospital chosen to be the site for the new children's hospital.  I since put in a freedom of information request to St. James's for a master plan.  There is no such plan for St. James's.  The last master plan produced by the hospital was in 2008 and there was no mention of a children's hospital in it.  We all know a master plan is a strategy, a ten-year plan for the hospital's use of space and where its specialties will be located.  I wrote to the Minister for Health about this yesterday.  No maternity hospital was mentioned in the master plan.  There is no maternity hospital planned and there is no space for one.  <br/>I welcome the very generous grant of &euro;75 million given by Trinity College Dublin towards a cancer unit at St. James's Hospital, but I ask Trinity College if we can join the dots with the plans for a children's hospital.  We have sold the National Lottery to pay for a children's hospital, which was supposed to cost in the region of &euro;458 million.  At the moment we are looking at an estimate of &euro;650 million for St. James's.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House and have a reasonable debate about St. James's Hospital.I have been told before that it is a done deal.  The board members are before the Committee of Public Accounts today.  It should not be a done deal because there is so much wrong.  <br/>Yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i>, to move slightly away from my subject, the closure of the children's dental clinic at St. James's Hospital was criticised.  Again we are talking about St. James's, this time a HSE-run children's dental clinic at the hospital.  This general anaesthetic clinic treats 3,000 children a year.  It has had to close because, when the original building was demolished due to the construction of the Luas line, they put up a semi-permanent structure which was not deemed suitable, and now it has been closed with no future plans.  Can the Minister for Health please come to the House and give us an answer?  What is going to happen to these children? They have basically been told that they can stay on antibiotics and if the pain really gets bad they can go to a private practice.  I repeat that we have sold the national lottery.  We are now talking about a budget of &euro;650 million.  It would have cost &euro;500 million in Connolly Hospital, where we had enough space.  Again, I urge the Minister for Health to come to the House and take note of this.</p></speech>

In the world of modern medicine we have lots of drugs that can make people a little better and produce remissions - we do not have many drugs that can actually cure a fatal illness - but this drug has been shown to be curative for patients with hepatitis C infection.  Not everybody requires it urgently, but the Irish liver community has identified 100 to 200 patients in whom there is a real proximate risk of death within the next one to two years if this drug is not made available to them.  The drug itself has been associated with an extraordinarily high rate of complete clearance and probable cure of the virus which causes hepatitis C.  It has also been shown to enormously reduce the risk of cancer in patients with hepatitis C.  All of the existing treatments for hepatitis C and related occurrences of cancer, which may result in a necessity for extremely aggressive and expensive treatments, cost money.  Not only is this humane, good science and good medicine, it is also good business.  There should be no foot-dragging about this.  Susan Mitchell from <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>highlighted the issue the other day.  There is a bit of ambiguity in the statement from the Minister over the last 24 hours suggesting that the drug would be made available, but in fact, if one parses it carefully, it looks as though it might be made available if we can get the right price.  We need the Minister for Health to come to the House today and clarify this.<br/>I also want to mention in passing that today is the 39th anniversary of the death of the only doctor who died in the Northern Ireland conflict.  Professor Gordon Hamilton Fairley was blown up in the streets of London by a bomb that was intended for his neighbour, who was a Conservative Party politician.  Hamilton Fairley was the father of oncology in the United Kingdom and a pioneer in the development of immune and other treatments for cancer.  The annual award of the European Society for Medical Oncology, the highest award in Europe that can be given for cancer research, is named after him.  His name is not often spoken and he is largely a forgotten figure.  There are many other forgotten figures in the annals of that particularly tragic and unnecessary conflict, but it is appropriate that his name be recorded in the House on this sad occasion of the 39th anniversary of his death.  This great man died because of an Irish-related issue.</p></speech>

The papers at the weekend reported a spokesperson for Nigeria's national information centre saying that resolution is inching closer, although he did not wish to put a date on it.  Despite last week's announcement of a ceasefire, it is still a very delicate situation.  One security source reported that many of these girls are in camps scattered along the vast desert bordering Chad, an area that has very little reach from either Nigeria or Chad.  Given the very fragmented nature of Boko Haram, a resolution is far from certain.  I am sure the Leader and Members here will join with me in hoping for the most positive outcome in the shortest possible time for these girls.</p></speech>

When I asked the question yesterday, the Leader was not aware that the merger had collapsed.  That is obviously unfortunate.  We need to get all the parties back to the table again, in my view.  I am a strong, enthusiastic supporter of a technological university.  I believe it needs to a multi-campus one.  I do not believe that politicians in opposition should in any way use this to attack the Government or attack the Minister.  I am absolutely of the view that the Government parties are committed to making this happen.  We now need to put in place a process that can deliver on this very important issue.</p> <p>I imagine the Leader of the House would agree that this is a major issue for the people of the south east.  We have campaigned for a long time to have this in the programme for Government and to have the Cabinet agree that it must happen but for it to unravel now for different reasons is entirely inappropriate.  I ask the Leader to comment and, if he is in a position to do so, to update the House on the actions being taken by the Department to proceed with this issue.</p></speech>

I hope that his party leader and his fellow party members who have information about anyone guilty of this type of crime who may have been run into the South - or run from the South into the North of Ireland - would pass that information on as a matter of urgency to the relevant authorities and that they would be first in the queue with the information.</p><p>I support the call made this morning by Senator Pat O'Neill for an urgent debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the beef sector.  There is no logical reason farmers in Northern Ireland should receive &euro;350 more per animal than their southern counterparts for beef.  The beef sector is in crisis.  I do not want to see any factories blockaded because it impacts on people's livelihoods and jobs, but farmers have no option given that their livelihoods are at risk and many of them will go under.  This debate must be scheduled as soon as we return the week after next.</p><p>I want to renew the call I made recently for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to come into the House for a substantial debate on the mental health budget for 2015, with particular reference to suicide awareness and prevention.  In doing that, I acknowledge the innovative campaign rolled out last week by the HSE's national office for suicide prevention in conjunction with 20 partner organisations, called &quot;The Little Things&quot;.  The &quot;little things&quot; are acts of self-care that are proven to help us feel better and get through tough times.  The campaign gives tips on matters like the need for people to keep active, the need to talk about their problems with others, helping others who are in difficulty, staying in touch, eating healthily, drinking less alcohol and looking out for others.  I hope we will circulate the posters, cards and information that we have all been given widely.  Particularly given the impact of social media, there are great opportunities to publicise this highly innovative campaign among the wider public.  However, we must have a substantial debate with Deputy Lynch in the near future on the topic of mental health, and particularly in relation to suicide prevention and awareness.</p></speech>

We spent Monday visiting the battlefields of Flanders in south-west Belgium, on the border with France.  From an Irish point of view, we were specifically interested in, and had the opportunity of paying tribute at the graves of, two Irish patriots who died in that war, Major Willie Redmond, who came from the Leader's home county and died in rather tragic circumstances, and the great poet, Francis Ledwidge, whose reputation has been considerably enhanced over the decades since he, too, was tragically killed in a non-combat environment, when a shell fell when he was digging holes and two of his fellow soldiers were also tragically killed.  These are just two of many hundreds of stories we had heard throughout the day we visited Flanders.  In that context, I ask the Leader to consider setting aside an hour for statements on or near Armistice Day, 11 November, as an official tribute from this House of Parliament to those brave Irish soldiers who died for what they believed to be the cause of freedom for Ireland and who have now, belatedly, been acknowledged for that contribution, despite the layers of ignoring history over the decades.</p><p>It would also afford an opportunity for this House to discuss and to have a response from the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on the Government's plans for the 1916 commemorations, which seem to be clouded in some obfuscation - I will not go so far as to say mystery.  It is an area of concern for the surviving relatives of the 1916 leaders that the Government has not yet enunciated a coherent policy as to how they will approach it.  This matter came up informally at the weekend among British members because of the media attention that has been focused on the possibility of a member of the British royal family attending the 1916 commemorations - an issue on which I must admit I have ambivalent views.  I believe that this is an exclusively Irish commemoration.  After all, it was about ending British domination in Ireland and it might be a little incongruous to have a representative of the British royal family attending the commemoration of a seminal event in our history.  </p><p>In the context of what I have said and because of the ongoing debate about 1916, it would be a useful opportunity for this House to at least get some clarification but also to provide a platform to acknowledge the courageous contribution made by those Irish men and women for what they believed to be the cause of Irish freedom in the 1914-18 war.</p><p>I would also like to formally second the Leader's amendment.</p></speech>

I will not repeat it.  Nobody else should be silenced by the pretext that anybody now who speaks about Ma&iacute;ria Cahill is playing politics.  That is insulting to politics, to democracy, and to everybody.  Ma&iacute;ria Cahill, in her hour of need, turned to politics to try to do something when everybody had failed her.  We will keep it on the agenda.  It is not playing politics, it is answering the call of a woman who is in trouble.  Every woman and every man who has spoken here has done that and we will continue to speak until justice is done.  I support Senator O'Brien in what he said today.  I will not say any more about it now but it will not go away if one does not talk about it and instead shoves it under the carpet.  That is no way to deal with it and we will not fail Ma&iacute;ria Cahill in that way.</p><p>I would also like to speak about what Senator Crown spoke about, the hepatitis C drug.  I have a plea from a constituent of mine, who asked me that the treatment for hepatitis C, Sovaldi, be made available.  He gave me the cost of it and said it was a small cost to pay for his wife's life and is needed for her treatment.  He asked me to speak to the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I only received that text yesterday.  I know the Minister is considering the matter and I urge that the outcome of his investigations be positive.  The cost is not prohibitive.  It has just recently been recognised - and perhaps Senator Crown could elaborate on this - in the UK and according to a paper by the California Technology Assessment Forum there is a saving of 75% over 20 years.  It is not just about today's cost, it is about tomorrow's savings.  One cannot speak about life in terms of money.  It has been proven in research to save lives.  When one looks at the money, one must say that over 20 years if 75% of the patients in Ireland were treated, it would have a payback over that time and that is a small price to pay.  Hopefully we can have a debate, as Senator Crown has called for, and I hope that the Minister would be able to address that as well.</p></speech>

This is despite the fact that when I raised this matter on Tuesday the Deputy Leader said that there would be discussion.  I move an amendment to the Order of Business that we take No. 1 first with discussion.  Although the personnel are by and large okay - the chief executive and the chairman, and so on - there is at least one Government toady there and we know that the current Government tried to have many civil servants appointed because it wanted to keep it in-house.  Not taking this matter undermines the role of the Seanad and we must send a signal that we will keep watching this area, where the Equal Rights Authority was dismembered by a previous Government.</p> <p> I would like to raise what happened here yesterday with the asylum Bill.

It is a very important matter because the message should go out that asylum seekers were left swinging by the vote.  An inaccurate account of the Bill was given by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  He said there was no provision for travelling.  I pointed out the section in which this was dealt with.  He said the Government would accept no amendments, within 20 minutes of the Government's having accepted three amendments tabled by Senator Barrett.  That was complete and absolute nonsense.  I sent a copy of the Bill to Ms Sue Conlon of the Irish Refugee Council, at her request.  I have yet to have it acknowledged.  There has been no comment or reference to it.  That is a bit absurd.  NGOs should be very careful of playing a territorial game.  It was a very useful discussion and I hope it advances matters in this area, but Sinn F&eacute;in let itself and the Irish people down rather badly.</p></speech>

A deposit of 10% was always the norm, as we know.  The Central Bank's recent requirement of a 20% deposit is more than excessive given current practice throughout the country, of which I am aware, in the estate agent and auction trade.  We have to try to make purchasing a house attainable for young people.  The ratio of salary or income to the value of a property has varied.  A deposit of 10% was sacrosanct and we will return to that with the aid of an insurance-based scheme, the details of which we have not received.  I welcome it for the sake of our younger people who are hoping to get on the property ladder and acquire new homes.  It is important that we welcome the measure.  When we get more details we can discuss it further.</p></speech>

It will become increasingly apparent to him that Sinn F&eacute;in is grooming Fine Gael for after the next election.<br/>I agree with Senator Leyden, who referred to censorship in the media.  We have all seen evidence in <i>The Irish Times</i>that people who have a conservative point of view are squeezed out because they do not comply with the editorial line.  Unfortunately, the same applies to the national broadcaster.  I ask that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources come before the House after the break to debate this issue.  There is a statutory obligation on RTE which is invariably ignored.  I refer to a recent item on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; in which a well known abortion advocate was given free rein.  This caused untold upset to people who had given birth to children despite having been advised that there were abnormalities which meant they might not survive after birth.  One women wrote, on behalf of many such people, to the director general of RTE.  She was in that position, but now enjoys her eight year old daughter who is still alive and well.  I met a woman last year who was in similar circumstances and had her 12 year old daughter with her.  I have no difficulty with anybody who wants to promote abortion.  We live in a democracy and people are entitled to do so, but the national broadcaster has a responsibility and a statutory obligation to ensure that the other point of view is put and that points of view are challenged.  It is unacceptable, as the letter sent to the director general said, that RTE did not challenge that position.<br/>It is time we considered rationalising the national broadcaster.  We do not need the significant numbers of employees and high salaries within it at the expense of taxpayers.  It has abrogated its responsibilities, and it is time for a full debate on that.<br/>On a more positive note, a television programme was shown yesterday about the life of Seamus Mallon.  It was presented by John Bowman.  It was an excellent programme and reminded me that Mr. Mallon has been the most outstanding politician, in my view and that of many others, over the past 40 years in Northern Ireland.  It is a matter of regret for politicians in Ireland, and particularly the SDLP, that he never had the opportunity to serve as leader.  The party would have been in a stronger position if he had.  I ask the Leader to give serious consideration to inviting Mr. Mallon, a former Member of the House, to reflect on the current situation in Northern Ireland-----</p></speech>

I have mentioned this once or twice before.  I read a newspaper article by historian Diarmaid Ferriter, who is on the commission, in which he declared his impatience with the Minister's tardiness in presenting it with a plan.  She has given a commitment to come before the House, but she should have done so before now.  In the absence of a formal Government blueprint, every kind of revisionism is gaining a foothold.  I do not want to dump on Sinn F&eacute;in again, but the most ridiculous occurrence was the announcement by Deputy Gerry Adams last week that John Redmond was a man of violence.  I had to laugh at that one.  We need the Government to announce a plan.  There is a certain tardiness on the Government side.  Maybe it is worried that in some way the celebrations would turn into some kind of <i>post hoc</i>vindication of the terrible atrocities that occurred in the North and had absolutely nothing to do with 1916.  I can understand that, but we need to have an agreed procedure for the nation to pay proper homage to the leaders of 1916.<br/>Members have received correspondence from a number of county councillors on the title of mayor not being applied in certain municipal areas.  There is a Lord Mayor of Dublin, a Mayor of Limerick and a Mayor of Galway, but there is no mayor, for example, of Listowel, where I come from, Killarney-----</p></speech>

I ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to come before the House and make some alterations to the Act introduced by the former Minister.  If a local authority chooses to refer to its chairman as "Mayor", that should be allowed.  It is very hard for visitors to understand why they are being introduced to somebody who has a title such as "Cathaoirleach of the region".  It smacks of North Korea rather than the democracy we have become used to.  The title of mayor may have had some English medieval connotations at one time, but it is now universally accepted.  Every region in France, no matter how big or small, has a mayor, and it makes a lot more sense for visitors to be introduced to the mayor of a town rather than to someone with a nebulous title that has about 40 syllables and is difficult to pronounce.</p></speech>

He made a very strong case and Senator Keane has supported him.  I did not hear her second the motion asking the Minister to come before the House today to discuss the new drug to which Senator Crown referred.  He spoke on television about it very efficiently today.  We should listen to him and be given the opportunity to consider the matter.</p><p>I also second Senator Norris's proposal in regard to the Irish human rights and equality commission.  I do not understand why we have something on the agenda about which we do not have a debate.  Senator Norris is looking for a debate on that basis.</p> <p>I look forward to our debate on Palestine on 26 November because it deserves a full debate.

Certainly some voices said "No".  It was not unanimous.  This issue deserves a debate.  Senator Mooney described it well when he said we must not ignore the fact that Palestine was dropping rockets into residential areas in Israel over and over again, and Israel retaliated in the end.  Let us just make sure there is balance in that debate.</p><p>It is 450 days since President Higgins signed the Construction Contracts Act 2013 to enable it to become law.  However, the Act has not yet been enforced.  Not a day goes by when sub-contractors do not ask what is delaying this Act.  I can understand why a Government moves slowly on occasion but if this House initiates legislation that is subsequently passed by both Houses, why has nothing happened?  This week, the Department in charge of making sure the Act was enabled and put into operation changed from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, under a new Minister who has no experience of the last 450 days of whatever has been happening.  It looks as though nothing has been done to make this happen.  Something should happen immediately.</p><p>From this Sunday we will lose one hour of daylight every day because we will have to change our clocks again.  I have been pursuing this issue for many years but the Government should grab hold of it because it makes sense for us to join central European time and keep that extra hour all year round rather than just the summer months.</p></speech>

After the Fr. Kevin Reynolds debacle, we thought that RTE had moved on because we were promised better standards of fairness and balance.  However, the groupthink continues in regard to discussions on a range of social issues.  Dealing with individuals in RTE is a perfectly charming experience.  They are reasonable and they are pleasant.  However, collectively there is a rot which involves contempt for ordinary people and, often, contempt for the issues and a tolerance for manipulating debate and the public mind by partial coverage of events.  This is something we should debate at an early opportunity.</p><p>In regard to 1916, these events are complex but it is possible to commemorate great events which changed things without canonising one particular side and demonising the other.  Through our debates about the roles of John Redmond and Padraig Pearse, and their visions of patriotism, we should be able to commemorate those events in a proper way.</p><p>I repeat my request for a debate on energy and the increase in the public service obligation, which will cause a big hike in electricity prices.  Ahead of the summit on reducing our carbon emissions, the Taoiseach, with his usual clarity, stated today that it is not feasible to set targets that are unfeasible.  He was referring to the reality that our cattle produce considerable amounts of methane and that we have to protect our agriculture sector.  However, at a time when many of these targets may be revisited and regarded as unfeasible, I am concerned that Irish people will be left to foot the bill for an unimaginative and ineffective wind energy policy which was designed to meet those targets.  At a time when subsidies for wind energy production have been withdrawn in other countries, we seem to have rushed towards rampant and unplanned production of wind energy in a way that is not cost effective, and which involves ordinary people subsidising the production of renewable wind energy to the tune of &euro;94 million per year through their ESB bills and this public service obligation.  I am in favour of renewable energy but we seem to have caught ordinary people out and they are bearing the brunt of the lack of planning and the failure of those in power in this country to adjust to a situation in which we need to produce more renewable energy.  It now appears that the solution we have chosen, namely, a glut of wind farms and wind based energy, is not the solution.  It may well be the case that our carbon reduction obligations will have to be revisited, and ordinary Irish people who cannot afford it are being left to foot the bill.  I formally request a debate on energy, wind and the public service obligation based hike to our electricity charges.</p></speech>

A number of Members have asked for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to come to the House.  He will be here on 4 November for a comprehensive debate on health matters.  At least three Members asked that the Minister come to the House to deal with various subjects.  They will have an opportunity to discuss the health service and the areas they mentioned on 4 November.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien made a valid point on Sinn F&eacute;in and how many people involved in sexual abuse might Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA have banished to counties around the country.  This is something which will have to be answered.  It is all very well saying that information should be given to the police forces.  That is correct but we must also have accountability from Sinn F&eacute;in regarding the people who came before these kangaroo courts and where they were banished.  The public needs to know that.</p></speech>

Senators Keane and Crown spoke about the availability of a drug for hepatitis C sufferers.  As I noted, the Minister will come to the House on 4 November and I am sure the Members concerned will make their points to him.  I am sure they will also raise these issues with him in the meantime.</p><p>Senator Bacik spoke about violence against women, the Safe Ireland project and the importance of a two-state solution in the Middle East.  She also called for an update on the reports on penal reform.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will come to the House on 5 November for a comprehensive debate on criminal justice and to update us on various penal reform reports.</p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about the attack on democratic institutions in Canada.  I am sure all of us would like to express our solidarity with our democratic colleagues in Canada after the dreadful attack yesterday.</p><p>Senators O'Neill and Mullins called for a debate on the beef industry and asked that factories treat farmers more fairly than is currently the case.  I hope that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will come to the House in the next number of weeks to discuss the beef industry.</p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the lack of coverage of the Seanad in yesterday's &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;.  It is not the first time that &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; failed to cover Seanad business and there is a need for a fair share of coverage.  We have written letters about that previously and we can certainly take it up again.</p> <p>We will certainly seek to pursue that matter again.</p><p>Senator Landy referred to anti-social behaviour and the mindless vandalism which occurred in his county.  As already stated, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be coming before the House on 5 November to discuss criminal justice matters and penal reform.  The Senator could possibly raise with her the issues to which he refers during that debate.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien referred to the children's hospital.  She can raise that matter with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, when he comes before the House, and Senator Crown can do likewise in respect of the matter he mentioned, namely, the availability of drugs for those who are suffering with hepatitis C.</p><p>Senator Naughten referred to the kidnapping of 200 children in Nigeria and outlined her hope that there will be a positive outcome to the negotiations currently taking place between the Government of that country and Boko Haram.</p><p>I have already addressed the matter Senator Cullinane raised in the context of Sinn F&eacute;in and people providing information to the police.  In the context of the Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology, I was not aware of the fact mentioned by the Senator yesterday that the negotiations process had stalled.  As Senator Cullinane correctly stated, it is the intention of the Government that there will be a technological university in the south east.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government in this regard.  I understand the Minister summoned the CEO and the chairman of Waterford Institute of Technology to attend a meeting on the matter in the Department this morning.  It is to be hoped that the negotiations will be progressed as a result of the discussions that will take place at that meeting.</p><p>Senator Mullins referred to the beef sector.  He also requested a debate on mental health with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I have arranged for the Minister of State to come before the House on 11 November in order that we might engage in such a debate.  Senator Gilroy and others have also been seeking a debate on this subject for a number of weeks.</p><p>Senators Mooney and O'Sullivan sought a debate on the 1916 commemorations and on the question of recognition for Irish people who fought in the Great War.  I have asked the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come before the House for a debate on these matters on 13 November.</p><p>Senator Keane raised the issue of justice for Ma&iacute;ria Cahill - which I have already dealt with - and the availability of drugs for hepatitis C sufferers.</p><p>Senator Norris referred to the motion relating to the appointment of the members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and inquired as to why it is to be taken without debate.  I understand that a 40-minute debate on the motion took place at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and that seven members of said committee contributed to that debate.  There is no point in duplicating the debate on the matter.  I understand the matter was very well dealt with by the committee in question and that a very comprehensive debate took place.</p></speech>

We hope to have proposals on that matter in the near future.  Obviously, a requirement of 20% is very prohibitive for young people who are trying to purchase their first homes.</p><p>Senators Walsh and Mullen referred to the statutory obligation on RTE to ensure balanced reporting and debate.  Again, I suggest that it would be more appropriate to raise this matter with the relevant joint committee before which representatives from the station regularly appear.  I am sure the committee could examine the matter in detail.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Walsh in respect of Mr. Seamus Mallon.  I am sure his party's representative on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges will raise that matter with it.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the fact that the title of mayor is not being used by certain municipal authorities.  Obviously, that matter was dealt with when the House debated the local government legislation.  However, perhaps we might revisit it.</p><p>Senator Quinn requested a debate on Palestine, Israel and the general situation in the Middle East.  As indicated yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will come before the House on 26 November and we will be able to engage in a comprehensive debate with him on the matter to which the Senator refers at that time.  The Senator also referred to the long delay in respect of the Construction Contracts Bill.  I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, is dealing that issue.  It is to be hoped that matters will be expedited and that the Bill will be enacted very soon.  I note the points the Senator made in respect of moving to central European time, a matter he has raised on numerous occasions.</p><p>Senator Mullen requested a debate on energy matters.  I will certainly try to make arrangements for such a debate.</p><p>I take this opportunity to point out that the debates Members have requested with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, his Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be facilitated in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

This amendment does not seek to tie the Minister to any timeframe in which to apply for retroactive capitalisation on banking debt, but it does oblige him to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas each month on progress in that regard.  Given the large sums of money involved, it is important that there be a requirement for regular reporting on this issue.  Without tying his hands, the provision places an onus on the Minister to progress the issue and ensure both D&aacute;il and Seanad are kept abreast of that progress.  Given the potential benefits arising from these measures, this is an apt provision.</p></speech>

As with the amendments put forward by her party colleagues in the D&aacute;il, this proposal seeks to dictate a certain course of action.  In addition, it seeks to place a restriction on the Minister's discretion in terms of any application for retroactive recapitalisation.  In the case of this amendment, the restriction relates to an obligation on the Minister to present a monthly report on progress made in regard to any application.  This would limit flexibility on my part and would place us at a disadvantage in terms of our negotiating position.</p><p>As I have outlined on several occasions during the passage of this Bill - most recently, earlier in the week in this House - seeking a retroactive capitalisation is only one of a number of possible options available for recovering the money the State invested when ensuring our banks did not collapse.  The best way to ensure the Irish taxpayer gains the maximum possible return on the money that went towards preventing the collapse of the State's banking system is by being in a position to consider all the options open to us for pursuing such a return.</p> <p>While not ruling out the possibility of Ireland making an application for retroactive direct recapitalisation of the pillar banks at some point, it is potentially not the only option available to us.  It must be stressed again that the determining factor will be which option will achieve the maximum return for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

In this context, it is preferable to seek the option of retroactive recapitalisation and keep it in on the table rather than risk refusal with an early application.  I will, therefore, continue to pursue a strategy which keeps the maximum number of options on the table.  Monthly reporting on the issue would suggest not applying is a failure on my part when it is not.  I want to keep it as an option and pursue it at the most advantageous time.  If any party wants to find out the status of an application, it can obtain that information with a parliamentary question in any month where there is a doubt whether I have applied.  The proposed measure, therefore, is not necessary.</p></speech>

This is not particularly a motion but simply a question for the Minister that is not for today or tomorrow but is long term in nature.</p><p>We all acknowledge and recognise the very significant funding is brought into the State's coffers by the universal social charge.  Reflecting back on its introduction, we are also aware that it replaced the health and income levies.  The USC was also an emergency tax and probably could have been appropriately called a national recovery levy or tax.  Such was the state of the nation's finances at the time of its introduction that most reasonable political groupings and parties, and everybody interested in the future of the country, while not welcoming the introduction of the tax or levy could appreciate the necessity for same.  </p><p>I hope, through the Minister's stewardship and internal and external factors, the state of the nation's finances are slowly but surely beginning to improve.  We hope, with projected growth patterns and economic patterns into the future, that the State's coffers will not just improve but will have a more stable and sustainable future.  With that in my mind, my question for him is three pronged.  Will he look at the universal social charge anew?  Will he recognise, at least, that some of the circumstances which required its introduction may no longer exist and, thus, show a bit of flexibility in that regard?  Does he hope to remove the levy in the medium to long term?</p><p>My next question is not part of my official Adjournment motion but one that I formulated as I was talking and thinking.  We have income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  When looking at the long-term future of pensions and social welfare in this country one realises that we will, in the very near future, reach a situation where every citizen of the State will have some degree of social insurance cover.  That means every citizen will be paying into a social insurance fund.  From the perspectives of  administrative simplicity, a case could be made to further streamline all the charges, levies and taxes paid by every tax paying citizen of the State and to roll them into one, rather than have between two and four charges at present.  My question is not for today or tomorrow but for the future.</p><p>I would like to hear the Minister's views on two things.  The first is the long-term possibility of reshaping or, hopefully, removing the universal social charge.  I apologise for not tabling my second question as part of my formal motion.  It relates to the various layers of taxes and levies in this country.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Minister for Finance have made the very obvious and important comment that we must be in a position to present ourselves internationally as an economy with a tax that is fair, as low as possible and well administered.  The fewer levies, charges and taxes which apply in that regard the better and the more streamlining we can put in place, the better as well.  I thank the Minister for listening to me and look forward to hearing his observations.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-23a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014102300014#O01400"><p>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this issue today.</p><p>The situation is that the universal social charge, known as USC, was introduced by the previous Government in budget 2011 to replace the income levy and the health levy.  It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget  deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It was never intended by my predecessor that the USC would be a temporary measure.  The legislation under which it was introduced did not include any sunset clauses or place time limits on the charge.  It was designed and incorporated into the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure.  The &euro;4 billion in revenues collected from the USC play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base which insures that while most people have to pay USC on their earnings the amount is lower as a proportion of their income as would be the case if the revenue from the charge was delivered through the income tax system.</p><p>The Senator should be aware that the universal social charge cannot be avoided by using tax reliefs which are mostly used by the higher earners to reduce their tax burden.  In fact, by increasing the USC rates applicable to higher incomes in the budget, it has allowed me to cap the benefits that individuals get from the tax changes introduced in budget 2015.  As I outlined on budget day, the progressivity of our income tax system will be copperfastened by giving greater importance to USC at higher incomes so that the capacity of higher earners to shelter their income through tax breaks is significantly curtailed.</p> <p> As resources have allowed, the Government has taken steps to remove the lowest paid members of society from the USC.  In budget 2012 I increased the entry point to the USC from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  In budget 2015 I have extended this exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 from 1 January next onward.  This will exempt a further 80,000 individuals from the charge.  In addition, I have reduced the two lower rates at which the USC is payable from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively.  Furthermore, I have also extended the threshold before which the 7% rate becomes payable to &euro;17,576 in order that those on the minimum wage will only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.</p><p>The changes announced in the budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and USC will see reductions in their tax bills in 2015.  These changes will also improve the progressivity of our income tax system, with the top 1% of income earners now paying 21% of all income tax and USC revenues collected.  In contrast, the bottom 76% of income earners will pay 20% of the total.  As a Government, we recognise that the income tax burden can act as a disincentive to work and to the creation of jobs and that changes to reduce the burden can have a positive impact.  We repeatedly stated that when the public finances had been repaired sufficiently, we would reduce the personal taxation burden.  The changes announced in budget 2015, targeting low and middle income earners, represent the first step in this process.  My Department estimates that a consistent series of reforms, along the lines announced in budget 2015, and delivered over a three-year period, could boost employment by as much as 15,000 jobs when the full impact of the changes has taken effect in the economy.  That is why we will continue the process in next year's budget, while ensuring that we have a tax system which is progressive and which rewards employment.</p></speech>

As stated earlier, a levy, charge or tax which is generating in excess of &euro;4 billion each year can certainly not be made to just disappear overnight.  The streamlining and effective administration of our taxation system is extremely important.  It is possible to have a progressive taxation system without, of necessity, having a multiplicity of taxes, charges and levies.  I appreciate what the Minister said with regard to the fact that the Government's decisions on income tax and the USC have led to a significant - and welcome - number of people no longer being obliged to pay them.  If we had a singular income tax system, this could also have been achieved by the use of a number of bands.  Will the Minister consider introducing such a system in the future, perhaps by way of recommendations from a new commission on taxation?  Such a commission could examine the position with regard to the multiplicity of PRSI charges and levies, the USC and income tax.  Would it be possible to introduce a singular taxation structure?  From an administrative point of view, such a structure would certainly give rise to significant savings.  Perhaps the Minister might reflect on this matter, particularly as there is an undue amount of complexity within the current system.</p></speech>

When drafting this year's budget, I discovered that the USC is far more flexible than income tax.  By using the USC rather than income tax, it was possible to put in place direct relief in respect of different tranches of income and various categories of people.  If we were relying on income tax alone, for example, it would not have been possible to give back anything to people earning under approximately &euro;16,000 because these individuals do not pay income tax.  However, it was possible to deliver for them because they pay the USC.  A reduction in income tax rates would have had a very disproportionate benefit for high income earners.  However, it was possible to cap the rate benefits at the gross income amount of &euro;70,000 and then increase the USC by one point.  Of course, this was compensated for by a reduction in the higher rate of income tax from 41% to 40%.  On a net basis, nobody's combined rate of USC and income tax increased.  The benefits were capped in order that a person who earns &euro;80,000 obtained the same benefit as someone who earns &euro;70,000.  The position was the same in respect of those who earn &euro;200,000 per annum.</p><p>One often hears about astronomical salaries of &euro;500,000.  If we had proceeded on the basis of cutting the income tax rate only by 1%, then this would have worked out at 1% on &euro;500,000 minus &euro;70,000, which is &euro;430,000.  As the Senator will realise, the amount involved would be &euro;4,300.  It would not be sustainable socially or in the interests of equality and fairness for people on huge salaries to receive relief in the amount of thousands of euro, while those on low incomes only received a small amount of such relief.  That is why I capped the rate benefits.  The point I am making is that in designing the budget to be fair, the USC is a fair more flexible instrument than income tax.  There are other models of income tax and many of the eastern European countries that are new to democracy have introduced flat rates of such tax.  There are advantages in this regard because rates can be pitched quite low and everything is taxed from the first &euro;1 onward.  It would probably be very difficult for us to move into that space because tax becomes bedded in, allowances are made available, etc.</p><p>I see the USC as a permanent feature of the personal taxation system.  In terms of providing relief - and I hope that is what we will be doing - people will pay less personal tax.  The Government has three strategies.  The first of these is to widen the tax base by eliminating tax breaks, including those which apply widely to the building industry and many of which I removed in 2011.  There are also corporate tax breaks, such as the double Irish and so on, which we are addressing.  We hope that our actions in this regard will have a net benefit to the Exchequer.  The second strategy involves widening the tax base by means of the property tax, which has already been successfully introduced, and by charging for services such as those relating to water.  In the past, such services were paid for exclusively by the taxpayer and, in the main, from personal income tax.  This was achieved by transferring money from central funds to the local authorities.  As the economy grows there will be buoyancy  of taxation.  In conjunction with our controlling expenditure, this buoyancy can assist us in reducing the amount people pay by means of personal tax.</p><p>The Senator also referred to pensions and PRSI.  He appears to be angling towards asking whether it would be possible to convert the USC into a form of PRSI in order to support pensions.  That is a matter which would be worth debating.  However, it is not something that will happen during the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzpatrick was a successful computer engineer and was aged 34 when he was found dead in his apartment in Mannheim two weeks before Christmas in 2010.  He had intended to come home to Portumna in order to spend the holidays with his family.  The autopsy conducted by the German authorities indicated that Matthew died by self-inflicted strangulation.</p> <p>His family had its suspicions and conducted its own inquiries and investigations.  </p><p>A second autopsy was conducted in Dublin on 18 December 2010 when Matthew's body was repatriated by the former deputy State pathologist, Dr. Khalid Jaber.  It raised several troubling questions which have convinced the Fitzpatrick family that Matthew did not die by suicide, but had been the victim of a violent assault given the range of injuries found on his body, 45 in total, some of which were defensive.  The police investigators in Mannheim initially closed the case on 22 December 2010, but after much pressure from the family the investigation was reopened.  In June 2014 it concluded that there was no reason to change its view on what happened to Matthew.  The public prosecutor in Mannheim disregarded most of the evidence submitted by the Fitzpatrick family and several other aspects, including the autopsy conducted by the former deputy State pathologist, Dr. Jaber.  </p><p>There are several very troubling aspects to this case.  Recently the family requested an independent forensic radiologist to review CT scans which were taken of Matthew's body prior to the first autopsy in Germany.  Unfortunately, the scans were of a low resolution and therefore it requested high resolution scans from Heidelberg where the first autopsy took place in order that the independent review could be completed.  The family's lawyer submitted the request and was told yesterday that all autopsy medical information related to Matthew no longer exists.  These CT scans provided specific information relating to injuries sustained by Matthew and it is deeply disturbing that the German authorities have destroyed this vital information.  It is my understanding and that of the family that these records should be kept for a minimum of ten years.  We believe this to be a European standard to which Germany has agreed.  </p><p>There were other troubling aspects.  Witnesses and the family provided information on abusive and threatening messages that Matthew received from an individual.  The German authorities did not question this individual because he needed a translator.  The family also provided evidence that Matthew's PC and laptop were accessed after his death.  This access happened three hours after his body was found, on the following day and on three further occasions until 7 January 2011.  The police stated that there was no technology in the apartment and no further analysis has been done to identify who had access to Matthew's IT equipment.  The family also provided evidence on text messages from Matthew's phone, but this information was not analysed or taken into account.</p><p>The witness who found Matthew's body has changed his account of the position of the body three times.  The person stated that he was hanging.  The family provided evidence to show that this was impossible.  The witness was allowed to change his account with no analysis or cross-examination.  There were thefts of equipment belonging to Matthew from the apartment, including his professional camera, personal laptop and baseball bat.  This was reported to the police, but it rejected it as an issue.  </p><p>There is clear evidence that the investigation conducted to date has been flawed.  The family is convinced that it has provided enough evidence and proof to show that Matthew did not take his own life.  The family is asking for a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and for a thorough analysis to be conducted by the Minister and the Department of the evidence it is in a position to provide.  The Minister could then put pressure on the German authorities to reopen the review of the circumstances leading to the death of Matthew Fitzpatrick, a young man who had a bright career and future ahead of him and who lost his life in very tragic circumstances.  </p><p>The family is convinced that he did not die by suicide, but that there were injuries on his body which will prove he was the victim of a severe and vicious attack.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this matter.  I look forward to his reply.  I hope my request for a meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the family can be acceded to.</p></speech>

I fully sympathise with the family as I understand how traumatic it is for any family when a loved one dies, and for this to occur in tragic circumstances is even more distressing.  I wish to inform the Senator that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the embassy in Berlin and the consular assistance section in Dublin, has provided consular assistance to the deceased's family since they were first informed of his death on 13 December 2010.</p><p>Officials in the consular section of the Department have met the deceased's family on a number of occasions, including as recently as Friday, 17 October 2014.  Officials have discussed the case with the family and explained the Department's position, including providing relevant information about the German system, that may be of assistance to it.  I wish to advise the Senator that the consular assistance provided by the Department included facilitating contacts with police, undertakers, lawyers and the public prosecutors offices in Germany and with the Dublin county coroner's office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ireland.</p><p>On 15 December 2010, a diplomatic officer from the embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim and met relatives of the deceased.  The embassy supplied details of English speaking funeral directors in the region to assist the family in making arrangements for repatriation.  It provided assistance in dealing with the mortuary, local authorities and the appointed funeral director on behalf of the family.  It also supplied a list of English speaking lawyers practicing locally in order that the family could get professional legal advice on the case and the procedures involved.</p><p>On 22 March 2011, the Garda liaison officer based in the Hague and the diplomatic officer from the embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim to meet the police officer who led the investigation into the death.  It is my understanding that a senior representative of the state prosecutor's office of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg was also present at this meeting.  The embassy assisted the family in communicating to the representatives of the German authorities present its concerns regarding the manner in which the police investigation had been conducted.  In addition, the embassy in Berlin provided unofficial courtesy translations of extensive police notes on the man's death.</p><p>Following repatriation of the deceased's remains, the embassy provided unofficial translation services for a considerable amount of documentation to facilitate the family's contacts with the German authorities.  In addition, the Department translated into German a number of representations made by the family, as the Mannheim police authorities had made it clear that they were unable to process communications in English.  </p><p>I understand that the police investigation made a determination as to the cause of death and that the Mannheim public prosecutor upheld this verdict in July 2011.  Following this, the family appealed that decision to the regional public prosecutor in Karlsruhe which also upheld the verdict in September 2011.  In February 2012, a second police investigation commenced and in June 2014 the office of the Mannheim public prosecutor stated that the case was closed, with no change to the finding.</p><p>I am very conscious of the plight of the family and sympathise with its great loss.  However, the Department is not in a position to directly intervene in the German legal process.  The Department cannot interfere or try to influence the judicial process of another state.  It has consistently advised the family to take professional legal advice on the legal avenues that may be available to it in the pursuit of the case.  Let me assure the Senator that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide all appropriate consular assistance to the family and will continue to facilitate its dealings with the relevant German authorities.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide all appropriate consular assistance to the family and facilitate its dealings with the German authorities.  I appreciate that the Department cannot interfere in the judicial process of another state.  However, given the volume of information and the facts available, I want a meeting with the Minister to take place.  I want to ensure that all the facts of the case are made available to him and the Department.</p> <p>I hope some progress can be made in the near future to further process this case with the German authorities.  The family maintains the volume of evidence available strongly suggests Matthew Fitzpatrick did not die as a result of suicide.  The family is determined to obtain justice for Matthew and they intend to continue until they get the case reviewed and until all the information that they have made available and which is in the public domain is reviewed by the German authorities.  They believe much of the information they have provided has been disregarded by the German authorities.  There are serious questions to be asked about the conduct of the autopsy, given the nature of the injuries found on the body during an autopsy conducted by the deputy State pathologist in Dublin after Matthew's body was repatriated.  Many aspects of this case are deeply troubling.  I look forward to the Minister meeting the family to discuss this urgent matter.</p></speech>

The Minister has agreed to meet the family.  It is simply a matter of deciding on a date at this stage.  If Senator Mullins communicates with the Minister's secretary I imagine a date can be finalised as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The European Union victims of crimes directive 2012 provides for certain rights for victims when reporting a crime.  These include provision for victims to receive a written acknowledgement of their complaint from the police.  The acknowledgement should state the basic elements of the crime, such as the type of crime, the time and place of occurrence and any damage or harm caused by the crime.  The acknowledgement should include a file number and the time and place for reporting of the crime to serve as evidence that the crime has been reported.<br/>Furthermore, victims should be provided with information about their rights in sufficient detail to ensure they are treated in a respectful manner and to enable them to make informed decisions about their participation in proceedings.  The directive requires that information enabling the victim to know the current status of any proceedings should be provided.  The directive states that such information is relevant to enabling a victim to decide whether to request a review of a decision not to prosecute.<br/>In the United Kingdom districts of Kent, Somerset, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire police constabularies are providing such an information service to victims of crime.  It can be accessed by the public by logging onto <i>TrackMyCrime.police.uk</i>.  In the participating police constabularies victims of crime are given a reference number which they can use to log in to a secure website to get information on the status of the criminal investigation relevant to them.<br/>I believe this Government should introduce a similar online system for victims of crime to follow the progress of Garda investigations.  Victims of crime often feel left out in the cold when it comes to the Garda investigation of their cases.  They have legitimate questions, such as whether someone been arrested for vandalising a car or whether the Garda has arrested the people breaking into houses in a given area.  Victims can become frustrated when they struggle to contact the particular investigating garda, who may be off duty or on patrol.  A dedicated website would act as a one-stop-shop information source and would be a great tool for victims.  Furthermore, it could be easily updated by the relevant investigating garda.<br/>There has been widespread public support in the UK for the <i>TrackMyCrime.police.uk</i>service.  Diminished resources are available to the Garda.  Notwithstanding recent positive announcements it remains the case that the numbers in the Garda have fallen from 14,500 in 2010 to 12,900 today.  We have 139 fewer Garda stations now compared with 2011.  In a sense we have an under-resourcing problem and there is also the question of how the reduced number of garda&iacute; use the time available to them.  Garda&iacute; often spend time trying to get hold of victims to provide them with an update.  It seems to me that an easy-to-use online service would fill the information deficit that victims encounter and save on valuable Garda resources as well.<br/>I believe this would be an innovative thing to do.  Ireland has a track record in innovative schemes in the criminal justice area - I have in mind the Criminal Assets Bureau.  If the Government could think outside the box then, in the context of transposing the victims of crime directive, we could make real progress in assisting victims of crime to get relevant information, for example, information relating to the filing of charges, whether a suspect has been detained or the setting of a court date.  Moreover, they could get this information in a more timely fashion than applies currently.</p></speech>

It gives me the opportunity to address the Seanad on victims' rights.  I wish to reaffirm my commitment, which I have articulated on several occasions recently in other fora, to have the EU directive on victims' rights implemented in Ireland next year.  This is a priority for me.  It is an important directive which will have many implications for the criminal justice system and how victims are dealt with within the system.<br/>The EU directive envisages a scenario whereby victims of crime are recognised and treated in a respectful, sensitive, tailored, professional and non-discriminatory manner in all contacts with victim support or restorative justice services or criminal justice agencies operating within the context of criminal proceedings.  I imagine everyone will agree that this should be our objective.  Work on the necessary legislation, the victims Bill, is proceeding in my Department and I have attended several meetings on the matter.  It will go to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the new year for initial scrutiny.  Obviously, we must have it enacted by the due date of 16 November next year.<br/>Side by side with the legislative process, criminal justice agencies are working on practices and procedures to ensure that the legislation is implemented in practice because that is the most important thing.  All the agencies are aware that the EU directive is coming in.  A new umbrella group of victims' rights organisations have come together and is working with the relevant criminal justice agencies.<br/>A key element of the EU victims of crime directive is the requirement for policing services, in this case, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to offer a wide range of information to victims, without unnecessary delay, from the first contact with the police.  Recently, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has undertaken an initiative involving two victim liaison officers.  This is being piloted in Waterford city and in Dublin.  On foot of the outcome of this trial, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has decided to establish similar offices in each Garda division to improve the flow of information to victims of crime.  This is a welcome development which can be seen throughout the country now.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be tasked with keeping victims informed on their rights and providing them with information generally.<br/>The EU victims of crime directive requires a broad range of information on the progress of the investigation and any subsequent court proceedings to be made available on request to victims of crime.  I understand one British police force has developed the <i>TrackMyCrime.police.uk</i>initiative which is now being extended.  Senator Mullen has set out the details.  This is based on the track-my-parcel system available in commercial courier and parcel delivery companies.  The TrackMyCrime system has an intuitive appeal especially since it is available online.  As time goes by people are becoming far more familiar with using new technologies, such as e-mail, text, tracking systems, smart phones and apps, in their interactions with commercial enterprises.  A suitable TrackMyCrime facility, with the requisite security features to protect privacy, seems like one of an array of tools which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might usefully consider.</p> <p>This seems like one of an array of tools which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might usefully consider.  That would be an implementation matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is linked to the question of the technology and ICT systems that are available to it.  There is significant work to be done in relation to that and I have a commitment to helping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to upgrade its technology.  I am certainly happy to ask the acting Garda Commissioner to examine the desirability and feasibility of a scheme of the kind mentioned.  It would be linked to the level of technology currently available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that does need continuous improvement and upgrading.  </p><p>I will ensure that the need for systems to support victims will be included in any upcoming allocations I may make in respect of Garda technology.  I would hope that if any such system is introduced it would complement rather than replace the personal contact which is implicit in the new model of the Garda victim liaison officers system, which garda&iacute; are developing.  There are also other areas where I feel useful developments could take place in support of victims.  For example, in recently launching the strategic review of penal policy, which I understand will be debated here in the Seanad, I indicated my intention to bring forward legislative proposals in Government to place the parole board on a statutory basis in the near future.  I am also looking at victim representation on that board.  The issue of strengthening victims' rights is a key consideration in the preparation of legislation to strengthen the laws on domestic and sexual violence which I consider critical, particularly in the context of my objective for Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention, which we are doing.</p><p>I thank Senator Mullen for tabling this important issue.  It brings to the fore the whole question of victims' rights and how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other criminal justice agencies will respond to the EU directive at the operational level.</p></speech>

I welcome in particular her undertaking to ask the acting Garda Commissioner to examine the possibility and feasibility of introducing a TrackMyCrime system.  I would be very much obliged to the Minister if she could provide some further feedback on the acting Commissioner's response to this.  I agree with and welcome her comments about the need to ensure that the necessary technology is in place and that there is Government support for such technology.  I also agree with her on the personal dimension of victim support, which should not be compromised in the context of improved technological responses.  The two go hand in hand.</p></speech>
