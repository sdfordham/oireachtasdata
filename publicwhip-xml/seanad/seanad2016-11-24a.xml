I raise the matter on behalf of Councillor Joe Bonner of Meath County Council.  This relates to an ongoing issue that affects not only large housing estates in County Meath but those right across the country.  It is an emerging risk according to senior officials within Irish Water, whom we met last week to discuss the matter.  It concerns shared drains coming from estates, a major issue in the commuter belt around Dublin in particular.  Prior to Irish Water coming into existence, local authorities had the discretion to maintain or clear blockages in these drains but following a meeting with senior management in Irish Water last week, we were advised that the legislative framework restricts the company from carrying out any maintenance work on blockages in these shared drains within the confines of a housing estate, whether it is a private estate or one in the charge of a local authority.</p> <p>This creates a major difficulty where blockages exist and there are many examples occurring in sewerage infrastructure pipework between public sewer mains and manhole covers.  Blockages may occur across a road in a housing estate, for example, and this could bring about major difficulties.  Neighbours may have to work with each other and householders in an estate may have to apply to a local authority for a road opening licence or health and safety certification to carry out the works.  They may have to provide a bond to a local authority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The current situation is absolutely inappropriate.  There are restrictions on Irish Water in regard to this.  Pending a transient outcome or an outcome that would be desirable to the operator, Irish Water, and, more particularly, to the householders in this situation, I request that the legislation be amended or Irish Water provided with the appropriate discretion or that a national survey or scoping analysis be carried out by Irish Water over the next 24 months.  In the intervening period, the responsibility or discretion should be provided to those local authorities that carried out the maintenance work heretofore.  For example, Donegal County Council, Meath County Council and most others carried out works under the 2007 legislation.</p><p>It is my understanding from a reply to a parliamentary question from the now Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, on 7 October 2015 that Irish Water was responsible for water services infrastructure, including water supply pipes or sewers extending from the waterworks or wastewater works to the curtilage of the private property.  If that were the case, the problem would be solved.  In fact, Irish Water tells me that is not the case.  As such, there is a need for clarification here.  In the event that no such clarification is forthcoming, the legislation should be amended as a matter of urgency to give local authorities the discretion to carry out these works.  It is a major issue that is coming down the tracks, particularly with older housing estates where there may be infrastructural difficulties with the wastewater pipe network.  I am not sure what the response from the Department is.  I hope there is an acknowledgement that this is a risk and that the Department may provide some direction on solving it.</p></speech>

They come from a fabulous country.  I climbed one of their mountains many years ago and I really liked the country.  It is similar to Ireland when it comes to rural tourism.</p> <p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for providing me with an opportunity to outline the position in regard to this important matter for those affected throughout the State.  I agree with him that it is an important issue.  Like Councillor Bonner who asked the Senator to raise the matter, I have had many contacts from residents of estates in Meath and other counties facing the same issue.  It is of concern and it needs to be addressed.  We are certainly aware of it.  It can cause great difficulty.  While it does not happen every week, one can suddenly experience conditions that cause the problem, at which point it becomes an urgent issue for the families involved.  I will take the opportunity in my reply to set out the legal position but there is a commitment to work with local authorities and Irish Water to find a solution.  We have to do that.</p> <p>As the House is aware, the Government, Irish Water and local authorities are continuing to deliver on an ambitious transformation programme of the water sector in Ireland.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water with this relationship being expressed through service level agreements.  Through these 12-year agreements, local authorities are utilising their experience and expertise in asset management and operations to provide services on behalf of Irish Water.  This expertise is being combined with the considerable network and utility management experience available to Irish Water.  The agreements are based on partnership, continuous improvement and the delivery of efficiencies.  Each service level agreement in place with a local authority is supported by an annual service plan which reflects the required programme of transformation for that authority.  It also outlines agreed objectives and standards of performance set against a budget covering headcount, goods, services and investment in the coming year.  Annual service plans encompass a set of operational objectives, key performance indicators and a related budget, including payroll.  The plans set out the context for the delivery of water services for each local authority for a given year.</p> <p>The Water Services Act 2007 sets down the obligations and responsibilities of water services authorities and property owners in respect of water infrastructure.  Sections 43 and 54 of the Act provide that the property owner is responsible for the maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems which are connected within the boundary of their property.  This was the case also prior to the transfer of responsibility for public water services from the local authorities to Irish Water.  However, I am aware, as the Senator says, that individual local authorities may, at their own discretion, have undertaken clearance works in respect of common wastewater infrastructure on private property in the past.  I am familiar with cases like a particular terrace in Navan and St. John's in Kells where this has happened.  At the time, the local authority did the right thing because garden boundaries had often extended out to take in some of the public infrastructure, which caused a difficulty.  These works were not a requirement of the law pertaining at the time and not every local authority provided such services.  Those that did acted in good faith in my opinion.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 transferred responsibility for the maintenance and repair of pipes and combined drains under publicly owned roadways and pathways to Irish Water while responsibility for storm water sewers remained with local authorities.  The position as set out in legislation provides clarity on the responsibility for the maintenance of common sewerage pipes.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the legal position, I recognise the importance of local authorities and Irish Water working together to agree operational guidelines on this and other boundary type matters so as to provide clarity to householders as to the services which they can expect to receive from Irish Water working in partnership with the local authorities under service level agreement arrangements.  While further legislation in this area is not envisaged, my Department is engaging with Irish Water to set out clearly the responsibilities of Irish Water and property owners in regard to water supply and wastewater infrastructure.  We will find a solution to this working together with local authorities.  We will not have to go down the legislation route albeit there may have been a missed opportunity at a previous stage.  We can resolve it without doing so, however, and already some local authorities are making great progress, including Westmeath County Council.  It is about bringing in a system whereby this can be dealt with nationally.</p></speech>

He is well aware of the issues.  I acknowledge his sentiments and ask him to look at the difference between the reply to the parliamentary question asked on 7 October 2015 and the reply today.  In October 2015, the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, referred to the curtilage of the private property.  The reply today refers to the boundary of the private property.  If it were the curtilage of the private property, it would solve the problem.  It would be like the situation where the water network is within the curtilage of the property and the responsibility of the property owner and thereafter Irish Water is responsible.  If we could define it as just the curtilage of the property instead of the boundary, it would resolve matters because the boundary includes the whole estate and all those parts which are in charge.</p> <p>A solution is urgently required.  Having spoken to Irish Water, I believe it is very anxious to resolve the issue which has major implications for its good name.  I am sure Irish Water does not want this to turn into a huge issue.  I urge the Minister of State to find a resolution and to ascertain from the Department why there is a different response today to the one provided in the D&aacute;il on 7 October 2015.  The legislation has not changed in the intervening period but clarity is required.  If it is possible, I ask the Minister of State to come back to me with that clarity when he has an opportunity.  There is no rush.</p></speech>

The reply today is similar to the reply I gave here a number of weeks ago when I addressed the matter first with some of the Senator's colleagues.  I committed then and commit again to the Department finding a solution to this as it is the right thing to do.  This situation leaves people very vulnerable.  They cannot afford to fix the problem and the solution is often outside their boundary whereas the problem is being caused on their properties.  It can cause difficulties for neighbours.  In some cases, it is something that was always fixed or addressed over a period of 30 or 40 years.  We will find a solution.  Regardless of differing versions over the last year or two, there is a commitment to resolving the issue.</p></speech>

I think it is my first time speaking in her presence in this Chamber.  She is heartily welcome.  I congratulate her on her well-deserved appointment.  As a Deputy and as a former councillor over the years, I am sure she has experienced the issue I am raising today.  Children who have difficulties with their teeth can become agitated, difficult and demoralised.  Their parents can become anxious.  They become worried and concerned.  Many ordinary children who have braces on their teeth, or other dental difficulties, are bullied and suffer difficult challenges in school.  We can imagine what it is like for children with special needs who have been diagnosed as needing urgent, detailed and intensive dental treatment.  It causes awful anxiety and desperate worry for such children.  Their parents experience unbelievable uncertainty, fear and anxiety.</p> <p>I am dealing with a client, a child with special needs, who has been identified as being in urgent need of intensive dental treatment.  My office has been in weekly contact with the HSE to try to get this child's dental treatment approved.  We have been told it could take up to a year, which is an unacceptable wait for the healthiest, brightest and most confident child, but is just appalling and disgraceful for a child with special needs.  I believe this case warrants a special intervention by the Minister for Health.  He should direct the HSE to provide the funding that is necessary for this child's dental treatment as a matter of urgency.  I have received the standard Civil Service replies from the Department telling me that this is a matter for the HSE, which is responsible for managing the health services.  That is fine in ordinary day-to-day situations, but in a specialised situation like this the Minister can and should direct the HSE to put this case at the top of the queue.  He should instruct the HSE to provide the necessary funding immediately.  I look forward to getting a favourable reply from the Minister of State on this specific case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-24a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112400002#C00400"><p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this important issue.  As he knows, the provision of dental and other services to patients with special needs is a priority.  The public dental service of the HSE provides dental services to children up to 16 years of age, and to people of all ages with special needs, through its dental clinics.  All HSE denial clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to the age of 16 and treatment for special needs patients.  As it is not always possible or appropriate to provide oral health services to special needs patients in dental clinics, some dental services, including general dental anaesthetic services, are provided in general acute hospitals, particularly for patients who require special care.  The HSE's policy is that general anaesthesia should, if possible, be avoided in the practice of dentistry.  I am informed by the HSE that since 2012, it has been upskilling dental teams in conscious sedation as an alternative.  The upskilling of senior dentists in other behavioural techniques and in sedation reduces the reliance on staff in the acute sector, thereby improving access and providing a range of modalities to dentists to treat patients with special needs.  These developments, together with regular validation of waiting lists, aim to provide more appropriate and timely access for patients who require these specialised services.  Nevertheless, general anaesthetic services continue to be provided on determination of clinical need.</p> <p>The HSE has advised me that it is aware of and is dealing with the delays that have been affecting patients in area 5 of the community health organisation, which includes south Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford, due to a lack of local access to general anaesthesia in acute facilities.  I can inform the Senator that three full-day general anaesthetic sessions are to be facilitated exclusively for patients with special needs at Aut Even Hospital in Kilkenny.  Two full days will be facilitated before Christmas, providing treatment for up to ten patients within area 5, and a further day will be provided in early January 2017 to provide treatment for a further five patients.  Up to 15 patients will receive treatment under this initiative.  The success of this initiative will be evaluated to assess whether it should be further developed.  I am informed by the HSE that it is considering other options to provide these services in area 5.  As Senator Conway has mentioned, under the Health Act 2004 the HSE is required to manage and deliver health and personal social services, or arrange for such services to be delivered on its behalf.  Section 6 of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 prevents the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.  However, it does not prevent the Minister from making representations in this regard.</p></speech>

I am delighted that she is here to speak on such a relevant topic.  The BreastCheck programme is currently available to women between the ages of 50 and 69.  According to the BreastCheck website, "the Department of Health and Children chose this age group for screening as there is a greater proportion of women at risk of dying from the disease in this age group".  However, recent statistics have shown that the greater age group is actually those between the ages of 35 and 50.  Under the screening programme for women between the ages of 50 and 69, women are checked for breast cancer, regardless of whether they have any symptoms.  Screening and surveillance are secondary preventive measures that aim to detect breast cancer at the earliest possible stage to reduce the rate of breast cancer death.  Screening refers to monitoring those at average risk of disease.  Surveillance refers to the monitoring of those known to have an increased risk of the disease.  Internationally recommended surveillance imaging options include digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging or a combination of the two.</p> <p>Every year, approximately 2,600 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and approximately 660 women die from the disease.  One in ten women in Ireland will have breast cancer at some stage of their lives.  I know from my own experience that women under the age of 50 are at a crucial stage of their lives in this respect.  I went to school with three sisters, two of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer at the ages of 38 and 41.  Their treatment has been very successful for them to date, but the fear is always there.  The devastating effects of being diagnosed with advanced cancer for women under the age of 50 and their families should not be underestimated from an economic and social perspective.  By the time women present with symptoms of breast cancer, it can often be quite advanced and may have spread.  Approximately one in five women already have metastatic or secondary breast cancer at first presentation.  Finding cancer as early as possible gives a large survival advantage in any age group.</p> <p>The American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology suggest that women should have annual mammograms from the age of 40.  Many countries that have a basic screening service from the age of 50 also give women the option of avail of screening from the age of 35.  BreastCheck plays a pivotal role in the prevention of breast cancer.  Of the 92,061 women over the age of 50 who were screened between 2008 and 2009, 4,119 were recalled for further assessment and 672 were diagnosed with breast cancer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This represents 7.3 cancers per 1,000 women screened.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recommended recently that for women with an identified risk of breast cancer an annual MRI between the ages of 30 and 49 is cost-effective compared with no surveillance.  In another small cohort of women who have a high probability of breast cancer annual surveillance between the ages of 20 and 49 is the optimal strategy recommended by HIQA.  It also advised the national cancer control programme on the implementation of an organised surveillance programme for women under the age of 50 in Ireland who are known to be at elevated risk of breast cancer due to these genetic or family history factors.  I call on the Minister of State to consider reducing the age from 50 to 40 in the hope that this very worthwhile screening will save the lives of many women.</p></speech>

We all have family members or friends who have been touched by this illness.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address the House on the national breast screening programme, BreastCheck.  Population based screening programmes are an important element of early detection of cancer.  BreastCheck provides free mammograms to eligible women every two years.  This service is provided free of charge by the Health Service Executive, HSE, through its national screening services which also operate the CervicalCheck and BowelScreen screening programmes.</p> <p>The EU guidelines on effective screening for breast cancer recommend that screening should be offered to women aged between 50 and 69 employing two-yearly mammography.  BreastCheck has been available nationwide to women aged 50 to 64 for several years.  The roll out of this service to women aged 65 to 69 began in late 2015.  This age extension brings the screening programme fully in line with international best practice.  The additional population who will be eligible for this programme is approximately 100,000 and, when fully implemented in 2021, a total of 540,000 women will be included in the BreastCheck programme.  BreastCheck continually reviews new and emerging evidence on the benefits of screening, including the optimum age range for screening.  International evidence does not currently support the introduction of population based breast screening below the age of 50.  The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age and there is a higher prevalence of breast cancer in women aged 50 and over.</p> <p>Screening aims to detect cancer before symptoms appear.  Regular screening can help to detect cancer at an early stage when it is easier to treat and there is a higher chance of a good recovery.  I welcome the current BreastCheck advertising campaign which aims to boost uptake rates and urges all women to take the time to do something very important for themselves by availing of the invitation to have a mammogram.</p> <p>Breast screening is one element of our comprehensive cancer control programme.  As part of its work across the full range of cancers, the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme provides symptomatic breast clinics in each of the eight cancer centres, with a satellite clinic of the Galway service in Letterkenny.  Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years due to a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.  Five-year survival for breast cancer is now estimated at 82% for people diagnosed between 2008 and 2012.  This is a most encouraging figure and it shows a significant improvement from 75.1% for people diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.</p> <p>In conclusion, BreastCheck is aimed at the age groups that will benefit most from a population based breast screening programme.  While the international evidence in this area is continually under review, it is not envisaged at this time that the age range will be reduced below the age of 50.  I take this opportunity to encourage all eligible women to avail of the free breast screening mammogram when it is offered to them.  I assure the House that comprehensive breast services are also available to women in the designated cancer centres.  Those of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their general practitioner, GP, who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services.</p></speech>

Three years ago the previous Government ensured that a commitment was made in the five year schools' capital programme to build a new school at Whitecross national school in Julianstown.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Louth and east Meath areas are one of the fastest growing areas in the country.  The demographics are such that the schools' capital programme initiated by the then Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, ensured that 10% of all of the new school projects in the State would be developed in that area.  Apart from the new school developments, objectively, "ancient schools" and I use that term advisedly, ancient schools such as Whitecross national school in Julianstown needed to be replaced entirely.</p> <p>The conditions at Whitecross national school are appalling, they are deplorable.  Teachers battle to teach in prefabricated classrooms that are too hot in the summer and far too cold in the winter.  Mould appears on the ceilings and on the walls.  There have been rodent infestations with all of the related health and safety risks.  There is no hot water in the bathroom for children to wash their hands after using the toilets.  The cold water is far too cold for people to safety put their hands under the tap.  To put it bluntly, the school should probably be condemned.</p> <p>It is long past time that the new building was commenced and that the Department indicated a timeline for the commencement and completion of the work.  The time for excuses has long past.  The school is not fit for purpose.  In my opinion - and I am not prone to exaggeration - this is a health and safety nightmare, an accident waiting to happen.  The patience and tolerance of pupils, teachers and staff has worn extremely thin, particularly in recent months.  All they want for Christmas, as one young person told me, is their new school.  Children have told me they would forego their toys if it was a case that a new school would be developed soon.  We secured the resources for the new school in 2013-14 under the then capital programme.  The then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced a new capital programme last year.  A significant number of new schools have been built in the area in recent times that, in a sense, leapfrogged Whitecross national school.  It is high time that the bureaucratic foot dragging that is delaying this project is brought to an end.</p> <p>When will the project commence?  What is the timeline for the commencement and completion of the project and when does the Minister envisage that children from Julianstown in east Meath will be taught in a building that they, the staff and the parents deserve?</p></speech>

It provides me with an opportunity to go through a few points with him.  I know Senator Nash and if he says the school is in that state, I believe him.</p> <p>The brief for the major building project for Whitecross national school is to provide a refurbishment and an extension on the existing site to cater for a 16 classroom school.  The staffing allocation for Whitecross national school is currently a principal with 16 mainstream teachers.  Enrolments in September 2011 stood at 410 pupils.  The enrolments in September 2015 stood at 432 which shows an incremental growth of 5%.</p> <p>The design team was appointed in March 2011 with a brief to provide the extension and refurbishment work on a phased basis with a partial decant of classrooms on the existing site.  The project was included in the five-year construction programme 2012-16 and was scheduled therein to commence construction in 2014.</p> <p>Planning permission was granted in January 2014.  Since then the board of management and its design team have presented a number of proposals to the Department to change the brief to one which involves a single decant and a single phase delivery during construction.  This has led to significant delays in the progression of the project.  The most recent decant option, which included the provision of significant levels of new temporary accommodation on site, involved an additional cost for the project in the region of &euro;2 million - an increase in the overall cost of the project of around 40%.</p> <p>The project has reached an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b, which involves securing all statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.  All statutory approvals have been secured.  However, the difficulty is that the additional &euro;2 million cost for the project arising from the board of management's single phase decant and construction proposal raised serious questions as to the viability of the project.</p> <p>The board of management and the design team were invited to a meeting with the Department in order to resolve all outstanding issues and enable stage 2b to be completed.  That meeting was held on 11 November 2016 and agreement was reached in regard to the scaling back of the temporary accommodation costs, which should now allow the project to progress to the completion of the design stages.  I understand that the design team is working to complete the stage 2b report for submission to the Department in the coming months.  When the submission has been reviewed, the Department will revert to the school regarding the further progression of the project at the time.</p> <p>If there are further difficulties, there would be no problem with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, meeting Senator Nash to discuss the project.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Progress has been made, if not to the complete satisfaction of the Senator.

I would be happy to lead a delegation of parents, teachers and members of the school's board of management to meet the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, or the Minister of State.  One of the problems I have discerned from the process is a lack of communication, poor communication or miscommunications along the way.  It is a complex process.  The Minister of State can imagine the frustration on the part of parents seeing a considerable number of schools in the area being built while the school they fought hard to secure a number of years ago under the schools capital programme has been repeatedly long fingered and delayed.</p> <p>We were aware that there were issues several years ago with proposals around decanting children from the school to an alternative location in Drogheda.  The Department expressed concern about logistical arrangements to allow it to happen.  It may have delayed proceedings regarding reaching this point in the project.  It is a complex and difficult site.  We all want the school to be built, in the interests of the staff, pupils and teachers.</p> <p>Julianstown school was once a very small, rural school.  However, given that the area is one of the fastest-growing in the State, there has been a considerable population increase in the area, with new housing developments.  Given the number of young couples in the area, the demographic profile is set to increase during the next few years.  We need the school to be built as soon as possible.  I appreciate the Minister of State's intervention and I will take up the opportunity to meet him, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton and relevant Department officials to expedite this necessary project.  It is very much appreciated.</p></speech>

The board of management and design team had a very forward-reaching meeting with the Minister and the Department on 11 November and there is an agreement to scale down.  I am confident some arrangement and agreement will be made.  The agreement was to scale back on the temporary accommodation, which will reduce the cost.  I am confident that some arrangement can be reached that will be satisfactory to the board of management, the Senator and the pupils and families.</p></speech>

This goes some way to addressing the situation where potential first time buyers were paying huge rents but were unable to get a mortgage.  I am happy with the changes.  Although it will increase house prices, the elephant in room is housing supply.  The changes have the similar goal to the first time buyer's grant in the Finance Act, whereby the Government is purposely increasing the prices of new builds in order to incentivise builders to build houses.  I hope it does not get out of control and hour prices go through the roof.</p> <p>The Government must address supply by getting rid of development levies, examining the cost of certification of houses or keeping accidental landlords in the market by introducing some form of tax credit for those who bought during the boom.  I welcome the Minister's roll-out of the strategic infrastructure and speeding up of planning permissions.  There is a crisis in the city.  The population, especially in Dublin, is growing at a faster rate than we are building houses.  We need to get cracking on building more houses in the city.</p></speech>

Last night, I thought about it before I came here.  It is very easy to blame the Government and the current Minister for everything.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is trying to push the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 through the House.  There are aspects to it we like and aspects we do not like, and I find the Minister more than facilitating.  Last night, when I was looking at the hashtag <i>#streetsofshame</i>tweets, it struck me that homelessness did not arise yesterday or the day before.  It was not a function of the previous Governments, although we could argue until the cows come home that it could have done some things better.  Homelessness is the responsibility of everybody in the country.</p><p>Recently, I learned of developers who have held back property in order to cash in on the rising prices in the improving economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

It looks like the cub of the Celtic tiger has grown and is about to be unleashed on us again.</p><p>As Senators know, I give the Government a lash every time I get a chance.  However, in this particular case it is grossly unfair on the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He is trying to do something and it behoves us all, regardless of our political affiliation or our beliefs in profiteering, etc., to get behind him.  If he is making a mistake, that will emerge in time to come.  However, I do not believe he is; I think he is trying his damnedest.  I, for one, am behind him and want to support him in any way I can.  I found him to be facilitating yesterday on the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill.  If all Ministers were like him, we might get an awful lot more done in this D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It may be time for us to lash back a bit at the populism.  Maybe it is time we told the populists, "This is nonsense.  How many of you would be willing to put an extra five cent in the euro on your tax in order to cover some of the homelessness?".</p></speech>

They should go back and get this right, consult with all the different groupings in the Seanad and get a delegation from the Seanad that is representative of the House.  That is the proposal.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the health services.  I am conscious that the Leader was the Chairman of the previous health committee and is very knowledgeable on the issues.  I wish to speak about the hospital closest to where I live, Letterkenny hospital, where the full-capacity protocol has been deployed repeatedly this year.  That means that elective surgeries are being delayed.  As they are delayed, patients' conditions are deteriorating and they are waiting even longer.  There are huge numbers of people on trolleys and more on waiting lists.  In Donegal, there is a whole-of-system crisis when it comes to home care packages, community hospitals and right up to the main hospitals.  This is because the system has been chronically underfunded for too many years.</p> <p>I appeal to the Leader to invite the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to come to the House at the earliest opportunity to outline how he believes what has been allocated in budget 2017 is anywhere near enough to start to address the scale of this crisis.  On behalf of my party, I ask the Minister to review urgently the budget allocation for 2017.  He needs to understand that unfortunately what has been allocated will not go anywhere near addressing the scale of this crisis.  It is not acceptable to anybody in these Houses to see elderly people on trolleys with their dignity taken away.  It is not acceptable to see the limited time home care packages we give elderly people.  It is not acceptable that we have run down so many of our community hospitals.  The system is failing too many people.  We need to review the 2017 health budget urgently.  The Minister should come to the House for a debate so that people from throughout the State can relay the stories from their communities directly to the Minister until we have the issue resolved.</p></speech>

I suggest one reduction in its operation cost is the &euro;4,300 a month it pays to the Phoenix for full-page advertisements.  While talking about a challenging financial environment, it is happy to waste that sort of money.  The Minister needs to challenge whether we are getting value for money.</p> <p>We also had an oblique reference to RTE's coverage of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We are giving it &euro;180 million and it has a remit for public service broadcasting.  I know it has very small viewing figures, but RTE gets &euro;180 million to cover politics and the arts.  At the committee meeting, the director general said one of her journalists was discussing moving coverage of this House, committees and the D&aacute;il to the digital platform.  Yesterday, I was critical of Deputy Dooley.  However, he was the only one awake at the committee and picked up on it.  That is clearly what was referred to at the committee.  We are giving RTE &euro;180 million to cover the arts and politics, and the new director general is talking about moving the coverage to the digital stream and using a journalist to quietly lobby for support around the House, and is meeting journalists on a regular basis.</p> <p>Ministers are putting off decisions on the funding of public service broadcasting.  We had a do-nothing D&aacute;il and we now have a do-nothing Minister in this area.  There are serious questions to be asked as to how RTE will nurture future broadcasting talent and over its oblique reference at the committee to how it will cover politics.</p></speech>

This acknowledges the reality in Dublin that a limit of &euro;200,000 was not feasible and that it is very difficulty to find a property now in that price bracket in the capital.  I note the comments of Senator Craughwell and I welcome them.  I absolutely agree with him.  As I listened to the Minister on radio this morning, I certainly felt that homelessness is a complex problem that has been with us and that is getting worse.  Its roots lie in the past and the problem cannot be resolved overnight, but I believe the Minister is sincere and honest.  He is putting forward a plan to deal with this matter.  It is not a quick fix that will unravel in a few months' time.  It is a plan that will prevent further homelessness and that will lead to those who sadly find themselves without homes at the moment being housed.  No one in this Chamber can countenance the prospect of our children or citizens being reared in hotel rooms or being moved around.  School is difficult enough for children and it is where they learn to socialise.  It is distressing when they are faced with the prospect of long journeys to school or they are not clear if they can keep going to the same school for a prolonged period.  This is quite apart from the fact that there are no cooking facilities in these hotels and that the normality of family life is seriously disrupted for those obliged to live in them.  I know that everyone in this House would agree that we need to address this issue aggressively.  I know the Minister is doing that but he is also not rushing.  He is doing it in a way that is well thought out and that, I believe, will deliver for the future of the State and our children, our most important asset.</p> <p>Reference was made to Irish Water.  I welcome the fact that the company is investing so much money in infrastructure.  I was very pleased that the new treatment plant at Rush - where we turned the sod last week - is going ahead.  We will again be able to enjoy clean water on our beaches, which are a fantastic amenity for young people and tourists.  That to which I refer is happening across the State.  One of the most basic things in life is clean, safe water.</p></speech>

The Central Bank and its Governor are behind the curve in respect of first-time buyers in the context of giving them an opportunity to get on the property ladder by purchasing their own homes.  For the 18 months since this regulation was introduced, it was well known by most people in the property industry that it was not going to be a help of any kind.  I implore the Minister to stop playing with the blinds and to open the window for all those who have been denied the dream of owning their own homes.  The cost of building a house is the number one problem.  It is the main impediment to kick-starting a functioning housing market.  I call on the Minister to immediately reduce the VAT rate on new builds for the interim.  This would certainly allow us to tackles some aspects of the homelessness crisis and the low level of supply in the housing sector.</p></speech>

The Leader and I had a lively exchange yesterday and I want to put it on the record that I have the height of respect for him.  Perhaps part of the misunderstanding arose because Pro Life Campaign is a specific organisation.

There are real questions to be asked about whether it is good that big foundations can pump massive amounts of money into a small country in order to engineer a change in the law that will lead to massive social change.  Regardless of one's views on abortion, one should be concerned with that situation.  Perhaps the Leader meant the pro-life movement generally, I cannot speak to that, but the examples given of Irish people being brought to the US at a given time do not make out that case.  My desire yesterday was for clarity.  I was not in any way trying to undermine the Leader but I believe he was unfair to the Pro Life Campaign in what he said.</p></speech>

The Leader is capable of that and I will try to be capable of it also.  I need to say that.  It has not been the case that there has been any kind of influx of money to roll out a campaign.  Would that there had been, particularly in terms of the very good educational work involved, but that is not the position.  The story here, namely, that George Soros's Open Society Foundations is putting six-figure sums into Amnesty International, should not be ignored.  That is a disgraceful situation.</p></speech>

We all know that farmers are the lifeblood of our rural communities and we must be proactive in encouraging young people to enter and remain in farming.  It has been really disappointing, and unacceptable, that there was no national reserve in 2016.  Any news that it may not open in 2017 would be extremely disappointing.  In 2015 there were 6,260 successful applicants in the national reserve scheme.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has spoken on this in the D&aacute;il when he said that EU regulations allow for surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and clawback of 50% following the sale of entitlements without land.  If these do not generate a sufficient fund for the national reserve, then we need to look at other options.  There has been a thorough updating of maps using computer remote sensing ground inspections.  This means that most land parcels have scrub, roads, buildings and other non-eligible features digitised out.  It is, therefore, very easy for us to conclude that land parcels claimed by farmers in 2015 and 2016 are unlikely to be different.  With that in mind, there will not be enough entitlements returning to the national reserve due to non-use.  My overall point is that we need this matter addressed urgently by the Minister.  If we are serious about encouraging young people to enter and remain in farming then we need to support them.  We need to support them properly by ensuring there is a national reserve open to them in 2017.</p></speech>

The briefing was organised by Senator Black.  I applaud her tenacity and work in pushing this measure in the interest of public health, and in being determined and steadfast in the face of intense pressure.  We have debated the implication of this Bill at length and we know that passing it will dramatically improve the health of our nation.  At the briefing, two harrowing personal accounts were provided by families that have been destroyed as result of alcohol.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Yesterday morning, we again received a glossy production from the Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland on the envisaged structural changes that will be required for this measure.  In its initial interpretation, it outlined that there would be a cost imposed on each retailer of about &euro;50,000.  In yesterday's production, there was not a mention of a single euro.  What is it all about?  It is about visibility and always has been.  It has used the financial burden as an argument and a tool of fear.  This lobby is being led by large corporate powers.  It has used small retailers deceivingly to further its greedy aims.</p><p>We are hugely cognisant of the pressures there are on small retailers.  This Bill will particularly impact on businesses in the Border area in which there are already price differentials and currency variations.  We should be consulting with our colleagues in the North on this matter and looking at an all-Ireland cohesive alcohol strategy.  I wish to finish by thanking the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, for remaining firm on this matter.</p></speech>

We are talking about an &euro;850 million investment for a data centre that will be fully-fuelled by renewable energy.  It was announced by Apple in February 2015 that a data centre would be provided in both Denmark and in Ireland.  The sod has been turned on the Danish project and construction is under way.  In this country, we are still in the quagmire of the planning process.  A balance always needs to be struck.  There is a balance in politics and a balance of justice in law.  Much emphasis is on individual rights.  However, this case is not the only one where we are bringing in the sort of jobs of the future which we aim for from an international company and for which we are repositioning ourselves.  For the most part, the people of the area want the project to happen.  In this situation, we see that individual rights are actually crippling the progress of a major project.  It has to be acknowledged that in our democracy we have to provide a system whereby people can object and individual rights are protected.  However, we have to get the balance right.</p> <p>Eighteen months after the project was first announced, An Bord Plean&aacute;la heard objections and gave them permission.  We now have to wait until March or April for the matter to dealt with before the courts.  It could be thrown back again to the planning process.  I believe we need more of a balance.  The manner in which these applications are dealt with, the lack of speed and the lack of progress in our planning system, as is highlighted when one compares our system with Denmark's, is not only a travesty for the people of Athenry, but a travesty for our country, because Bloomberg is saying today that this is what one gets when one deals with Ireland.  We are already facing the challenges of Brexit.  We do not yet know what the implications of the foreign investment policy of the new presidency of Mr. Donald Trump will mean for us.  We can be hopeful, but not everything is clear.  Something has to be done about our planning process or we will remain crippled and denied of vital development projects that the west, in particular, is crying out for and starved of.</p></speech>

The people of the south east, of which I am one, thought that this issue was enshrined in the programme for Government.  The second cath lab was to be delivered.  It was a make or break issue for the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, who was negotiating the matter.  It was deemed the best deal for Waterford.  A review that was to be carried out was seen as a formality.  The funding was to be ring-fenced once the review was carried out and completed.  In Waterford University Hospital, there is currently an 18-month waiting time for an angiogram.  For an inpatient, there is a wait of seven days to have a procedure done.  The case was very well made by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and a report was to be compiled to prove to the rest of the country that Waterford needed the cath lab.</p> <p>Difficulties then arose and the flaws were in the carrying out of the report.  First, the report was based on a part-time system for a population of 500,000 people and there was a comparison with full-time cath labs across the country.  Second, it was projected that the travel time from Waterford to Cork was 90 minutes, which is completely incorrect.  If one lives in east Kilkenny and has to go into hospital in Waterford and has to be transferred, it would take at least an hour and 20 minutes to get to Cork.  Third, the report was interfered with before it ever started because the HSE took it on itself to provide notes and a report to Mr. Herity, who was carrying out the full report.  Where is this service now for the people of the south east?  Many people have been involved in this, including  the practitioners in the hospital and others.  Those people will continue to be involved in it because people are affected by this matter on a daily basis in the constituency of Waterford and the adjoining constituencies, including my own Tipperary.  I wish to commend Mr. Willie Doyle, who is leading this campaign.  There will be people on the streets if this is not resolved in January.  Earlier on, Senator Mac Lochlainn asked that the Minister for Health come to the House.  I ask that when the Minister comes to the House, he deals with this matter as well.  I would appreciate if the Leader would take this matter up as it is very serious.  We have been kept in the dark since the big blow-up in September.  That is not good enough.  The people of the south east want to know what is going on in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

I would err on the side of caution on this issue.  The issue of housing, which has been well documented and commented on, is really a supply issue and a costing issue with regard to the State taking a large proportion of the costs associated with building a house.  Therefore, pressure has been brought to bear on the Central Bank.  It may not necessarily have been political pressure, but let us call it vested interest banking pressure that was brought to bear on the Central Bank.  Interested stakeholders, such as banks, lobbied intensively to change these rules.  Unfortunately, where there is a limited supply of housing, particularly in Dublin, and where there are increased resources being made available to allow people to bid against each other, it will drive up the cost of housing.  That is what is going to happen, particularly in the capital, where there is a great demand for housing.  I would certainly err on the side of caution with regard to those changes made yesterday.  I do not think it is the right way to go, particularly when there is a new grant scheme being brought in by the Government at the same time.  We will probably debate those issues later with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.</p> <p>I also want to touch on the issue of free speech in the two Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to sensitive issues of social policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In recent days, two Members of the other House were attacked verbally by Deputy Clare Daly for their views on the eighth amendment.

I ask them to talk to the Israeli ambassador.  There is a very fine museum in east Jerusalem called the Rockefeller Museum.  It has been there for many years and has a wonderful library, a collection of archaeological artefacts and so on.  The Israeli authorities decided to transfer the artefacts to west Jerusalem.  This is very much the kind of thing the Chinese Government did with the Potala Palace when it moved the Dalai Lama's library to Beijing and so on.  It is cultural asset stripping.  If the Israelis have their way, there will be nothing left whatever in east Jerusalem.  What is most shocking is that on 19 July this year, the Supreme Court in Jerusalem decided after a hearing that the Israel Antiquities Authority was responsible for the antiquities of the Rockefeller Museum and that it had the right to transfer the library and the archaeological artefacts to west Jerusalem.  The worst part of the judgment was the decision that Israeli law is supreme in this area and that international law has no standing whatever.  The Israeli Government repeatedly takes this position.  Its attention should be brought to the fact that international law does have relevance and that the Israeli Government is not immune to the operation of international law.</p></speech>

I hope that we as a House will support these calls when they come before us next week.  This is an issue of rights, equality and the enfranchisement of all our people.  I wanted to make Members aware of this.  It is, as I indicated to the Leader a few weeks ago, the inevitable kick-back one gets when one continues to deny people something that is so fundamentally important to them.  At a time when we should be embedding links across the country and when we have all expressed concern about any re-emergence of a hard Border, Irish citizens in the North and among the diaspora are genuinely concerned as to what rights and entitlements they will have and what the Irish Government, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and as compelled to act as a result, will do to stand up for their interests.  In a post-Brexit scenario, but also as a matter of course and a matter of right, they should have such rights.</p></speech>

I fully support Senator Mulherin on the issue of planning permission regarding Apple in Athenry.  The way it is going is a disgrace.  Many people in the centre of Galway would be mad keen to get a job there.  It is hugely important.  Our system creates an impairment for these companies to come to Ireland and create employment.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to convey the following comments to the Minister for Finance.  They concern the Central Bank and its announcements yesterday and this morning about supporting first-time house buyers and the proposal in the Finance Bill that came up recently.  There are two aspects to housing loans.  One concerns capital.  Can a person get the money to buy the house?  The Central Bank has to some degree addressed this, as has the Finance Bill.  However, absolutely as important, if not more, is whether a person can repay the loan.  Many of these people are first-time house buyers, young people starting on the ladder.  They do not have the cashflow for the capital.  Even if they get money from their parents or other family members to help finance the purchase, they still need the cashflow.  I suggest that the Leader bring my comments to the attention of the Minister and that the Minister push the banks on this.  For at least the first three years, interest-only repayments for first-time house buyers should be allowed.  In other words, they would not pay interest on capital, which would give them the chance to solidify their jobs, start increasing their incomes and aid stability.  There is also the revenue side of the matter.  If an effort were made with the banks, I believe it would make a huge difference, and that, combined with the Central Bank and the Finance Bill, would open up the whole thing.  The money would then stay with the house owner rather than being transferred in extra profits to the developer.</p></speech>

This is a retrograde step.  On Tuesday, 22 November, Dee Forbes, the new director general of RTE, appointed on 1 April 2016, was on a charm offensive at a meeting of the communications committee.  She never indicated to the committee her proposals to outsource children's programmes.  This is a major blow because children's programmes are very important and highly regarded.  Their quality has been renowned.  Some of us will remember "Wanderly Wagon", "Bosco", "The Den", "Zig and Zag"-----</p></speech>

Dee Forbes was appointed on April Fool's Day but she made a fool of the committee on Tuesday because she never raised this issue at it.  I raised an issue regarding "Oireachtas Report" and explained to the director-general that both Houses of the Oireachtas are equal.  That, however, has not been the case.  Most of the time, the Seanad has been ignored by "Oireachtas Report".  There was no question of transferring "Oireachtas Report" from RTE 1 to any other station.  In fact, she praised the work of "Oireachtas Report", indicating to me and others that she would be expanding and developing the programme and would be in discussion with Members about this.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, should intervene in the case of young people's programming regard and call the director-general to the Department.  I will be suggesting to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that she should return to the committee to explain her decision in this regard.  RTE is selling part of the Montrose site from which it will raise &euro;50 million.  Current affairs programming is very important.</p></speech>

My concern is that the advertising industry will start to lobby us to reduce the effect the Bill will have on its industry.  The objective of the advertising measures contained in the Bill is to protect young people from exposure to alcohol marketing.  Research conducted relatively recently by NUI Galway found that more than half of school children reported they were exposed to four or more alcohol advertisements per day.  The majority were exposed to traditional or offline advertising while 77% of children were exposed to online advertising.  For children, exposure to alcohol marketing, including advertising sponsorship, increases the likelihood of alcohol ending up in their hands and them drinking sooner.  The younger a child is when they start to drink alcohol, the greater the risk they will develop harmful drinking patterns later in life.</p> <p>The Bill will return to the Seanad soon.  If there is to be any reduction or removal of measures in the legislation, I hope it will not be a precedent for other industries to start lobbying us.  I believe this is only the start of it.</p></speech>

The theme of this year's campaign is to change the conversation around the issue of domestic violence.  In the recently launched Women's Aid annual report, some of the headline statistics underlined the need for action from us in the Oireachtas.  Up to 42% of reported abuse occurs within marriage, 55% of women murdered in the State since 1996 were killed by their partners or ex-partners and 81% of abuse disclosed in 2015 happened in an intimate relationship.</p> <p>Too often excuses are found for instances of domestic violence after the event.  Often, part of the blame is placed on the victim.  We see this time and again.  I appeal to the media when reporting cases of domestic violence or where women have lost their lives through violence to report responsibly on it.</p> <p>Domestic violence needs to be seen as the heinous crime that it is, perpetrated by offenders.  We need robust legislation to punish these offenders and protect potential victims, as happens in other cases of crime.  Why do perpetrators of domestic violence continue to do it?  They do so because they know they will get away with it and will not be punished.  They also know women are often confined to their homes because they cannot leave as there is no housing or rooms in refuges for them due to the severe cuts that have happened.  The perpetrators know they will get away with it.  It must be stopped.</p> <p>Without the consolidated domestic violence Bill and the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill coming into effect, the Istanbul Convention will not be implemented.  The protections victims of domestic violence require will not be available.  The Taoiseach has said he will bring in this legislation.  Promises are not enough.  We need this legislation to be brought in immediately.  We need to protect women and children, and sometimes men, in their own homes.  That is the unfortunate state in which this country is in 2016.</p></speech>

An audit was carried out recently by the Irish Heart Foundation, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive's national stroke programme.  Unfortunately, it revealed a bleak picture of the services available for thousands of people battling to recover as a result of a stroke.  Thankfully, I am glad to report more people are surviving strokes.  They are not, however, getting the best chance of survival because of the poor state of some of our therapy services.  The after-effects for stroke patients deteriorated last year for the first time since the creation of the national stroke programme.</p> <p>The audit found several interesting statistics.  Almost three quarters of rehabilitation hospitals cannot give stroke survivors the recommended level of therapy.  Only one in four rehab hospitals has a dedicated stroke unit.  The majority of hospitals lack a stroke specialist to oversee rehabilitation.  Fewer than one in three has any access to psychological services.  The majority of the 26 hospitals which participated in the study have no access to community rehabilitation teams to continue therapy essential to aid recovery for patients who were discharged.  We have only half the acute stroke unit beds needed to meet international standards and an even lower proportion of specialist rehab beds.</p> <p>What makes this information critical is that the incidence of stroke in Ireland is rising by 350 cases per year.  Clearly, the national stroke programme needs to be urgently updated, along with the proper provision of resources to meet the needs of survivors to give them the best chance of possible survival.  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health?</p></speech>

Of the nine appointments made, only three of them were women.  Concerns have been expressed to me about the artistic expertise of some of the nine appointments.  I understand a broad range of expertise, not only artistic, is required for State boards.  One will appreciate, however, the Government has form with appointments to IMMA.</p> <p>Gender diversity on State boards should be a key priority for any Minister making those appointments-----</p></speech>

Senators Catherine Ardagh, James Reilly, Aidan Davitt, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred to the decision yesterday by the Central Bank to ease mortgage restrictions for young and first-time buyers.  I thank all Members for their suggestions, which were welcome.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Philip Lane, to listen to these suggestions, some of which were worthwhile.  The important point on which we all agree is that we must try to allow first-time buyers to access the property market to buy homes.  We welcomed yesterday's decision and will work with the Minister to ensure there will be a supply.  We need a functioning construction industry and banks that lend.  The help-to-buy scheme announced in the budget will make purchasing easier for first-time buyers.  It is important that we allow these measures to take hold.  Everyone is concerned about the nearly 7% increase in house prices nationally this year.  Reference was made to the Celtic tiger.  I hope we will never return to the boom and berserk cycle, but I welcome the news from the Central Bank.</p><p>In a genuine contribution Senator Gerard P. Craughwell referred to <i>#streetsofshame</i>.  I have not seen that hashtag.  The Senator referred to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  As I stated during Private Members' business yesterday, the Minister is someone who is trying.  He is honourable and sincere, as demonstrated by his willingness to come to the House at times of political pressure.  He accepts that he does not get everything right, but he is willing to engage and listen.  The Senator is right that we should support him.  I hope the Senator's thought-provoking contribution will change the landscape of politics.  As Senator Kevin Humphreys is fond of saying, this is a time of new politics and Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's contribution was an extension of it, for which I commend him.</p><p>We all have a responsibility to the homeless and for how we interact with people.  Those of us who participated in the Focus Ireland sleep-out will understand it is not a choice for many; that it is forced on them.  One person homeless is one too many.  Whatever the ideology behind the end result, we should work together to end this scourge on society.</p><p>Senators Kevin Humphreys, Fintan Warfield and TerryLeyden mentioned RTE's announcement this morning by its director general, Ms Dee Forbes, on the outsourcing of children's programming.  Having met the director general, she is a fine person with a good CV stemming from her involvement in other media outlets across the world, but I agree-----</p></speech>

I ask Members to watch BBC's coverage of the British Houses of Parliament and the Stormont Assembly.  It is a magazine-type programme.  Mr. Andrew Neil's programme on BBC is much better and better reflects the views expressed in the Houses of Parliament and the Stormont Assembly.  This is something RTE should consider.</p> <p>Senators Kevin Humphreys and P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I would wish all Senators to be involved in the committee, but it is welcome that some of them will be appointed to it.  It is extraordinary that Sinn F&eacute;in Senators are protesting about not being included in the committee, when they did not support the inclusion of Senators from across the House in the all-party health committee.  They must reflect on their own position.  I regret the fact that not all parties represented in the House have been included, but the Minister's motivation is honourable.  He has spoken to Members on all sides of the House and wants every group - parties, Independents and aligned groups - to be represented on the committee.  He has appointed an eminent and fine Chairman, whom I wish well.  He will be impartial and fair.  It is an important committee and the fact that a Seanad&oacute;ir will be its Chairman will give it status.</p></speech>

Linked with the contributions of Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, as Leader and a former Chairman of the joint committee on the protection of life during pregnancy, I respect the right of every Senator to have a different viewpoint from mine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we cherish the right to speech and to one's opinion.  I will not, as Leader, in any way try to curb freedom of speech in the House or in debate.  Perhaps in my remarks yesterday I was not specific enough; I was referring to the pro-life movement in general rather than to a specific group.  There was, and is, outside money being given to the movement.  They brought Members of the Oireachtas abroad and they brought people into the committee system to discuss Bills.  They had advisors from America during the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill legislative process.  Who they were representing or who they were here on behalf of is a moot point.  The point is they were here and money was coming in.  Philanthropy is a very good thing.  It has been the hallmark of our society.  I hope we all welcome individuals, groups and organisations receiving money for the betterment of the lives of people.</p><p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of young farmers and the national reserve scheme.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House regarding that.  It is important that young farmers are able to stay on their lands.  I would be very happy for the Minister to come to the House regarding that issue.</p><p>Senators Devine and Noone raised the issue of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I commend Senator Black for her presentation in the AV room yesterday.  The Bill will be coming back to the House.  It is about public health and the misuse of alcohol.  All of us who are public legislators accept we have a duty to protect all of our citizens.  We must get legislation that is right, that will reduce the harm caused by alcohol and reduce the impact it has on the lives of people.  People gave personal testimony yesterday of their lives being tarnished and ruined by alcohol.  None of us will stop the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill doing its work.  Minimum unit pricing is coming in and there are restrictions in terms of advertising.  There is discussion about one part of the Bill.  The important point is the Minister is sincere.  I chaired the health committee that did pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  We need to have a huge conversation about alcohol misuse, availability, price, advertising and how we can change the culture and ethos around the misuse of alcohol.  We should all work together on that.</p><p>Senators Mulherin and &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the very important issue of planning, in particular for the Apple location in Galway.  I sincerely agree with them on the matter.  I commend Councillor Peter Feeney who held a rally in Galway last week.  It is important we allow for the development of facilities such as the Apple one in Galway because we need to take jobs out of Dublin and the big urban areas and into rural Ireland.  That is why we welcome the announcement that the majority of jobs created in this calendar year have gone outside the metropolis.  </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to free speech.  I referred to that already.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House on the issue of the Rockefeller Museum.  Senator Norris is right, no one is immune from international law.  We should all work to uphold it.  </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's Private Members' Bill on the diaspora will be in the House next week.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, who is just back from a trip to the US.  Senator Lawless will be back next week.  It is something we need to keep on the agenda.  The Government is committed to this.  The question is how we arrive at the end result.  I take the point. </p></speech>

We have had this on the Order of Business in recent weeks.  Senator Ardagh made a very fine contribution on it.  The Senator is right.  It is important that we have the legislation.  The domestic violence Bill, which the Minister is committed to publishing and enacting, will be critical and it will put women and families at the centre of the legislation.  We need that enabling legislation.  We also need resourcing.  The Senator is correct.  We must protect women and children and, in some cases, men who have been abused.  The Government "What would you do?" campaign is one we should get behind.  We should work together to eliminate the awfulness of what is happening.  If one meets women and children and talks to them about their life stories and what has happened to them, it is devastating.   We all have a duty to get behind the campaign.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue-----</p></speech>

We have a national stroke strategy.  The Senator's point is well made.  There needs to be joined-up thinking to improve outcomes, have people treated more quickly and recognise the symptoms.  Yesterday, Senator McFadden raised the issue of the community geriatrician.  It is about primary care and expanding the way we run our health system.  It is important.</p> <p>I neglected to mention Senator Mac Lochlainn's comments on hospital services.  It is important that we acknowledge that the Minister for Health has the highest health budget in the history of the State.  What we need to see is a change in how the HSE and hospital groups deliver that budget.  It is no good saying we have a budget of &euro;14.2 billion.  The issue is how it is administered and distributed.  The Senator referred to a hospital.  The former Minister, Senator James Reilly was there.  Senator Mac Lochlainn and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Joe McHugh, have been very strong on that issue.  It is important to recognise we have seen greater initiatives created by the Government.  One person too many on a trolley or waiting list is not good enough.  The winter initiative has seen extra money.  I would be happy to bring the matter of Letterkenny hospital to the Minister's attention.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-24a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112400002#Q01000"><p>We will stay for as long as we can.  I very much welcome the opportunity to debate this extremely important issue.  I take this time to offer my sympathies to families who have been affected by suicide, and particularly recently in Cork.  The most important thing is to work together with organisations, communities, schools and those particularly affected in order to work through it.</p> <p>I welcome this debate as an opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s and my commitment to our mental health policy and to the development of services within the mental health area.  Since 2012, an extra &euro;115 million and around 1,150 new posts has been allocated for mental health and suicide prevention initiatives.  The budget this year has provided for additional spending for enhanced services of &euro;35 million on a full-year basis to enable further improvements to access across a range of areas.  Key priorities for next year's service plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child and adolescent and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services, along with the delivery of services for people with eating disorders.</p> <p>Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further spend of &euro;9.7 million in mental health associated with increased pay costs.  It is my belief the increase in wages will go a long way towards realising the full implementation of A Vision for Change in the coming years.  This additional &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the mental health budget increase to &euro;851 million, representing an increase of 3% over 2016 and an overall 20% increase since 2012.  People are asking why we cannot spend the &euro;20 million this year on one-off projects but the Government has given the go-ahead for the construction of a new national forensic hospital at Portrane.  As I did in the D&aacute;il, I urge those who have not visited the Central Mental Hospital to do so or meet staff, family members and patients so they can understand why this major project is needed and how it will benefit the most vulnerable people in our society.  It is a significant capital investment for next year and with spending on this new hospital and other minor and mental health projects, it will exceed &euro;50 million.</p> <p>I am very much focused on modernising our mental health services in line with the national mental health policy, A Vision for Change, and that is why we are spending over &euro;900 million on mental health next year.  Again, I know that figure is not enough but we have given the commitment we will increase this year on year and we will stick to that commitment.  In addition to the substantial ongoing financial commitment to service development, we have also commenced the process of updating our current mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  My Department has recently commissioned an evidence-based expert review, which will focus on the progress made to date in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Some may argue we do not need to update it but rather get working on it.  It needs updating, however.  The review will take into account international best practice and it will inform the next steps in the development of our mental health policy.  It will also provide a solid evidence base to determine the policy direction and a basis to further improve service development in the area while shaping future policy.</p> <p>In line with the commitment given to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 October 2016, an oversight committee will be established within three months of the review being finalised to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of the expert review.  It is also envisaged that a successor policy to A Vision for Change will include a multi-annual implementation plan to inform this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Health Service Executive, HSE, will be directed to develop a multi-annual approach to that and to the development of mental health services.</p><p>The increased investment in mental health services over the past number of years, at a time when funding in every Department was being cut across the board, has helped to facilitate an increase in the staffing levels of both adult and child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Of the additional 1,550 new posts approved since 2012, some 1,150 have been or are in the process of being recruited.</p><p>Increased investment has also funded the development of specialist services recommended in A Vision for Change.  That includes forensic, eating disorders, psychiatry of later life and mental health intellectual disability services.  We are also seeing continued development of community mental health teams, improved seven day responses and liaison services, perinatal mental health, two new clinical programmes specifically for ADHD in adults and children, which is one of the newer programmes, and dual diagnosis of those with mental illness and substance misuse on which a clinical lead will be appointed in the coming weeks.</p><p>We are also advancing the development of counselling services at primary care level and providing considerable extra funding to extend services such as Jigsaw, which offers a more informal environment in which younger people engage with each other and encourage each other to seek help.</p><p>A Programme for A Partnership Government recognises the need to further promote awareness and prevention strategies.  That is why this year we launched our national task force on youth mental health, which I chair.  We have had three meetings to date.  We have met with services and engaged with younger people.  We held our first forum last week and I hope early in the new year we can identify and bring forward key issues and priorities on which we can begin working almost immediately.</p><p>I acknowledge that this area needs continued investment, monitoring and attention.  While services are not perfect, we have started from a very low base.  As with anything, if we want to get it right and ensure the effects are long-lasting, we must not take a big bang approach but rather take our time and make sure that any changes happen for the right reason.</p><p>I welcome today's debate.  I hope it will be open and informative.  I want to hear Members' suggestions and, if needs be, their criticisms, but I hope we will work together on this because we all have the same goal and want the same end result.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this debate which, as she rightly said, should be had above the political discourse.</p> <p>An important element of a functioning society is that we can deal with the issue of mental health in an adult and structured manner.  Having a healthy mind is as important as having a health body.  Understanding the link between mind and body is the first step in developing strategies to reduce the incidence of co-existing conditions.</p> <p>Mental health is defined by the World Health Organization as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises his or her potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.  Good mental health is a prerequisite for normal growth and development.  It enables people to lead a fulfilled life and to relate satisfactorily to those around them.</p> <p>The common characteristic of mental health disorders is that they all impact the affected person's personality through processes or social interactions.  These effects are as debilitating as a physical illness yet we all know they are not treated in the same manner or with the same urgency of care.  People with serious mental health conditions are at a high risk of experiencing chronic physical conditions.  People with chronic physical conditions are at risk of developing poor mental health, therefore, they interlink.</p> <p>The number of suicides reported in Ireland has risen enormously over decades from 76 deaths in 1950 to a peak of 554 in 2011.  In 2015, some 451 suicides were recorded.  In addition to that are those deaths by suicide that are unrecorded.  Anecdotal evidence suggests, and we heard reports this week, that there are 1,000 deaths by suicide annually on the island of Ireland.  Those stark figures hide an enormous societal shift during which suicide was decriminalised in 1993.  Thankfully, other taboos and stigmas around mental health have long gone and it can be dealt with as any other health condition.</p> <p>Before the enactment of the Mental Health Bill brought forward by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in 2001, the primary mental health legislation dated back to 1945.  It was interesting to note that the third debate on mental health in the current D&aacute;il took place last week.  There was also a substantial debate on mental health yesterday during Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il.  That has to be welcomed, and it brings a new focus to mental health.</p> <p>It is ten years since the publication of A Vision for Change, which was a ten-year framework for building positive mental heath and providing accessible community based specialist services for people with mental health issues.  Its terms were meant to be implemented by 2016 but, to date, just over 75% of those have been met.  However, in the area of child and adolescent mental health, the figure is barely 52%.  For older patients I understand the figure is 53% and for persons with disabilities, the figure is a shocking low of 19%.  It is clear that those who are more vulnerable in society are getting fewer supports, and that issue must be addressed.</p> <p>There was a commitment in the election manifesto to increase the funding for mental health by &euro;75 million, or &euro;35 million per year, in the lifetime of the Government, which the Minister of State referred to in her contribution.  That is a step in the right direction but the vision to spend &euro;35 million for additional services in 2017 will not be met, before we even enter that year.  In fact, approximately &euro;20 million of that will not be spent.  That is worrying and it falls way short of targets identified in the programme for Government.</p> <p>I want to raise a number of major issues.  The staffing for child and adolescent mental health is 48% below what is required.  That is a major issue.  There may be staffing constraints and recruitment difficulties but the purpose of the additional funding was to meet those challenges.  Two thousand children are waiting for their first appointment, with 10%, or 200, waiting for a year or longer.  That is far too long and it must be addressed.</p> <p>I am not sure what the difficulties are with spending the money next year and I would be interested to hear the reason from the Minister.  She addressed that to some extent but it is an issue because difficulties are being experienced.  If the funding has to be spent on recruitment next year because of difficulties being experienced, why not give the additional funding, for a one year period, to community groups that support mental health activities in the community at the point of contact closest to those who are suffering with mental health difficulties?  We need to adopt radical thinking, even for a one year period, to fulfil the Government commitment on the targeted spend.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that aspect.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well.  She has a very difficult brief.  I am aware she brings a lot of knowledge to the table and that she is passionately committed to delivering on this issue.  Ministers in her position in the previous Government found it difficult.  I am aware the Minister of State is meeting the challenge head-on, and I wish her well with that.  Any support we can provide from this side of the House will always be given.</p></speech>

I am sure she is very busy, so I appreciate her taking the time to come here not only to clarify issues and address serious concerns facing the most vulnerable in our society, but because I truly believe she wants to have an effective dialogue about what we can do to help.</p> <p>We are both new to the roles we find ourselves in, yet we are no strangers to the mental health problems that face many people in our country.  We are also aware that these problems begin with the children of our nation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joan Freeman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While we hear that much has been achieved in this area, the Minister of State and I know that in many areas nothing is happening.  I am sure that the Minister of State is determined to address as many issues as possible during her tenure, but how can she do this when the budget she has been given is not only paltry, but offensive?</p><p>It was announced that mental health would receive &euro;35 million, but it was a most dishonest statement.  Not only was it dishonest, it was also underhanded because the statement omitted two very important issues.  First, that &euro;35 million is to be spent over two years and only &euro;15 million would be spent in 2017.  That &euro;15 million will merely act as a contingency fund to fill in the gaps that inevitably occur in any given year, such as pension and other natural increases.  Second, what makes this even more distasteful is that we have not been told how the HSE intends to distribute that &euro;15 million, which backs up my fear that this money will go anywhere and everywhere that the Government and HSE wants it to go.  It certainly will not go towards reducing the waiting lists where more than 2,000 children are still waiting to be seen on a never-ending waiting list.</p><p>Recently the Minister of State and I attended the very first mental health summit where there was mention of the review of A Vision for Change and the new task force, both of which are merely kicking the can down the road, something this Department is good at.  We have had review after review.  Ten years ago we had the "Reach Out " document on suicide.  It was reviewed nine years later and another new document came about.</p><p>At that mental health summit, we heard a woman speak about an 18-year old young man who had been buried that morning because he died by suicide.  One of the pallbearers was 12 years of age.  This young little fellow was waiting to be seen by CAMHS for over four weeks.  This child had suicide ideation and self-harming issues.  The director of mental health who said that high-risk children are being seen within a week is also terribly dishonest.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to provide me a breakdown of what has been spent in 2016 - how it was delivered and how it was administered.  In addition how many people were truly hired this year and where were they placed?</p><p>I beg the Minister of State not to make the mistake other Ministers of State have made by accepting the crumbs from the table as offered by the Government.  She must not allow mental health to continue to be the Cinderella of social issues.  Many Senators are as passionate as I am about mental health and they also want to help the Minister of State achieve a fair, compassionate and workable mandate.  However, she must also be the champion for mental health.  That starts with treating her Department with the same respect all other Departments are treated with.  The Minister of State needs to obtain for us the status other Departments are given and obtain for us a voice that will stop being a whisper.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish her continued success in a role she has really grasped from the outset.</p> <p>As we all know, mental health issues can affect any home in the country.  The area is a challenge for any government and society to deal with and manage in order to improve awareness and treatments.  I commend the Minister of State on her extremely proactive approach to her brief so far.  It is welcome that the programme for Government states that the mental health budget will be increased annually during the lifetime of the Government and that the Government is committed to meeting the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  I appreciate the Minister of State's comments on a review of that document.</p> <p>The allocation for the mental health budget for 2017 was subject to many untruths and a lack of understanding online.  People often get confused when discussing the annual mental health budget.  Many of us were inundated with questions to our offices asking why the entire mental health budget was just &euro;15 million or if it had been cut.  We need to be clear and unequivocal that the mental health budget for 2017 will be &euro;851.3 million.  Noting that funding of &euro;150 million was secured in this year's budget for the new facility in Portrane, as the Minister of State discussed, I ask her to update us in her reply on the status of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is close to where I live.  When will that institution be able to move to Portrane?  Like the Minister of State, I have also visited that facility and I believe it is no longer fit for purpose.</p> <p>I fully appreciate that funding alone will not solve our problems.  Much of the money cannot be spent without the staff to carry out the work.  I also welcome that in this regard, training nursing places will increase by 45% in the next four years.  In addition we need to see what approaches in different sectors are best performing.</p> <p>The importance of team sports and club activities cannot be underestimated in providing a solution to cultivating a healthier approach to mental health.  I am heartened to see our leading national sports organisations recognise the ability they have to influence the mental health of their members.  They have taken action by launching several campaigns, aimed at not only increasing awareness, but also taking practical steps to improve their players' health and welfare.</p> <p>The GAA on a national level has partnered with the HSE to support the highly shared and viewed "#LittleThings" social media campaign.  Like other organisations, the GAA has seen fit to appoint a full-time community and health manager.  The Kilmacud Crokes club in Stillorgan is involved in phase 2 of the award-winning healthy clubs project.  It has launched its own "Crokes talks" videos.  These brilliant pieces highlight how health and well-being have been integrated into the club's philosophy.  It reminds everyone that they can contribute to a positive club experience for all members.</p> <p>Another club in south County Dublin, Cuala, framed its emotional well-being conversation around a topic that is very real and immediate to every athlete - achieving one's potential and how an injury, be it mental or physical, can hamper one's endeavours to do just that.  Its short film "#StoptheStigma" has had more than 10,000 views on YouTube.  Both these clubs have drilled this health-awareness-driven practical campaign to the heart of their members and there may be an on-field benefit as these two clubs reached the final of the Dublin county senior hurling championship.</p> <p>No one could argue that a healthy, happy, supportive and positive team spirit leads to success.  Nationally the IRFU has rolled out its campaign, called "Tackle your Feelings."  The purpose of that programme is to work towards creating a society where emotional vulnerability is viewed as strength and where being honest with oneself about how one is feeling is brave.  It seeks to provide players with the tools to develop their self-awareness, improve their positivity and confidence, and become resilient.  My club has signed up to Senator Freeman's "Mind your Buddies" campaign through Pieta House.  It has worked really well in this laddish macho environment to have people who are trained available to talk to those who need it. </p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for her contribution and look forward to her reply.  I wish her the best of luck with the rest of her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-24a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112400002#S00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  She spoke about a review and she knows how I feel about reviews.  The review was done adequately and very professionally by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and my union, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, and released in July.  Knowledge is no good unless it is followed by action.  I implore the Minister of State to forget reviews, but I think I am battling against the wind.</p> <p>Funding for mental health in this country has always been inadequate.  It is just over 6% here, whereas it is 14% in Britain and the North.  We have gone from 13% ten years ago to just over 6% now.  The impact of the &euro;35 million is not being felt.  I highlight my frustration and desperation in addressing the issue of funding.  We tried to get 24-7 crisis intervention to be taken seriously in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  Since the formation of the Government, Sinn F&eacute;in twice introduced a motion and on both occasions Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted down the 24-7 measures we sought.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was voted down in the face of two groups, one from the Liberties and one from Cork, which we had invited to the Gallery.  Both groups were families and community groups who had lost their children or loved ones through suicide and had gone through that trauma and were trying to recover from it.  It is heartbreaking for them.  It felt like a slap in the face when both the Government and Opposition voted it down.</p><p>In the 2017 budget, &euro;35 million was announced in new funding.  Like other community and advocacy groups, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the measure as a positive step in implementing A Vision for Change.  As a previous, and perhaps future, front-line worker, along with my psychiatry and nursing colleagues, I know this &euro;35 million is being rehashed and promised every year.  We never saw it on the ground.  Perhaps we will see &euro;15 million of it this year.  The extra fund is coming to &euro;15 million.  It is an added investment of only 1.8% in new developments for mental health compared to the 2016 budget.  This is unforgivable.  I would like the Minister of State to directly respond on this point and tell us why this &euro;35 million was masked as &euro;35 million in new funds.  The Government is doing nothing to address the sheer neglect of mental health going back decades.  The pitiful investments of new funds such as these will do nothing to address the crisis among our communities across the island.</p><p>I do not want to play politics with the issue.  The people who are dying and crying out for help day after day do not want politics played.  They want support, services and to get better.  What is it going to take?  How can we get 24-7 crisis intervention rolled out?  I admire the Minister of State's bravery in taking on the role and the responsibility, given her family's trauma.  I recognise her determination to do her best to ensure the services are introduced.  However, it is not happening.  How can we put billions of euro into banks and millions of euro into water, but cannot find resources to prevent our people dying because they cannot see hope?  What brick walls are preventing this?  Is there resistance within the power of Fine Gael?  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il can do it.  We will support whoever brings this forward, in the interest of nation, our people, families, loved ones and communities.</p><p>This morning, on national media, did Fianna F&aacute;il's leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, commit to 24-7 services?  I did not hear it.  If it is true, I welcome it and I urge the Fianna F&aacute;il Members to talk to their leader and ensure it happens without delay.  We need to see the strength of the measures Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing.  If they will improve what is on offer, Fianna F&aacute;il can count on our support and we can advance further.</p><p>Mental health is the most significant issue facing Ireland and the world, as referenced by the World Health Organization, WHO.  Mental health affects housing, education, employment, family life and substance abuse, among many other aspects of life.  Let us get this right.  The Minister of State must go back to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and plead for funding to implement 24-7 crisis intervention.  We can then further the other elements of A Vision for Change, over 70% of which have not been implemented.  We could do it together on an all-party basis or, even better, an all-Ireland basis.  My colleague, Ms Michelle O'Neill, has been in contact and we established an all-Ireland mental well-being initiative.  Let us improve the health of our nation and stop the pitiful funding we provide for mental health and the perception that we are saying it is terrible but are not going to do anything about it.</p></speech>

I will talk about some of the lived realities on the ground and how the task force and the Minister of State's work can reach the target groups.  Last week, I gave a talk at Alexandra College in Dublin 6.  The speaker before me gave an amazing speech and spoke about where in the world her friends were.  When my turn came to speak, all I could think of was where my friends were and why I was not able to give the same speech.  During the past six months since I was elected, I have lost four people to suicide.  The only difference between me and the other speaker was inequality.  How are we making the connection between inequality and access to services and help?</p> <p>Although services exist in communities, there is a lack of cohesiveness between some of the services and the community members.  When services were first set up a long time ago, the community people had demanded them, especially regarding addiction.  There was upward pressure.  Are we missing some sort of link between the services and the community, especially for young men in disadvantaged areas who will struggle to even know how to access services and where to go?  This is one of the reasons I am holding the Tallaght Talks next week.  It is to try to start the conversation with young men.  Some 250 people from west Tallaght are attending it and we have got local faces such as Al Porter and Paddy Holohan, the mixed martial arts, MMA, fighter, to try to act as ambassadors for the services that exist so we can shine a light on them.  Although we have plenty of services in Tallaght, such as Pieta and Jigsaw, young men and women in the area cannot name a single service.  While the may know Pieta exists as a national organisation, they might not know how to access it in their own locality.</p> <p>How can the task force begin to address this?  While it is a community-led task force in the voluntary sector, it seems to include people who are actively involved in working in mental health in those sectors.  Is there a space to develop some sort of task force that could feed the position on the ground into the main task force maybe two to four times per year so it can become more cohesive and the message can filter down to the ground to the people who need it most?  In more affluent areas, people have much more social and cultural capital and they know who to ask for help.  They might have people in their families who work in specific mental health areas.  People from the poorest backgrounds do not have that.  They do not have family members who are counsellors, psychiatrists or lecturers who can signpost the way.  Is there an element of the Minister of State's work that seeks to address the people at the very bottom?</p> <p>I include those with dual diagnosis, especially in the homeless sector.  As someone who has worked in the homeless sector for so long, it is very difficult to see people turned out of accident and emergency departments and sent back to the street with no co-operation between the health service and the addiction service on devising an dual approach to addiction and mental health in order to avoid people being knocked from one door to another.  Our streets have become our asylums.  We stopped institutional care of people who are mentally unwell.  They are on the streets and in the hostels, where they are not receiving the care they need.  Is there something we can do to put more resources into the homeless service and addressing mental health on the street?  I met a man in a homeless hostel who had slit his throat and I had to stem the blood.  I could not get him sectioned.  He had cut his throat wide open and I begged to have him sectioned for his own safety, but I could not do it.  Normal project workers with no background in mental health are trying to fire fight all these situations.  Is the Minister of State considering those who are hardest for mental health services to reach?</p></speech>

I thank her for her continued genuine hard work in her role as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  It is important that we are seeing an increased budget for mental health services.  The Minister of State rightly said there was a need for definite improvements within the services, and any change must equate to an improvement in the service.  I have a raised a number of points with the Minister of State on a number of occasions.  While I understand they are operational matters for the HSE, it is very important that we implement A Vision for Change and look at how we implement changes such that they ensure improvements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there are changes to day centres or hostels the public, mental health users and staff need to fully understand the reasons.  We need to understand the benefit of changes and those changes need to deliver improved services.  I emphasise this in the context of recent experience of how the HSE has communicated with the wider public in County Roscommon.</p><p>I worked as an occupational therapist within community mental health services and it is crucial that people have confidence in the service.  They need to feel they can connect as they need to and that is a challenge for us in County Roscommon.  There must be an environment and a structure that support people, give them certainty and help them regain control over their lives and enjoy a good quality of life.  The mental health budget spans many different Departments and many different areas of life.  Senator Neale Richmond rightly spoke of the importance of sporting and community organisations in helping people to achieve a sense of well-being to face the demands of modern life.  The work is cross-departmental and the youth task force is trying to engage as many groups as possible to improve people's lives.</p><p>I understand the external report into mental health services in County Roscommon is being finalised and it is really important to have it.  It was commissioned because things were not working as they should have been.  It will identify weaknesses and make recommendations for change.  It will create a space for people in our county to use mental services as they need them.</p></speech>

A total of 16 people from a wide variety of backgrounds are suspected to have died by suicide, and I welcome the fact that the Minister is coming to Cork on Friday.  It is heartbreaking for communities to lose people aged 18 years, 15, 17, 20 and 44, and I commend the Lord Mayor, Councillor Des Cahill, who is holding a multi-agency forum in Cork city hall on Monday, 5 December to help, alongside the Minister's intervention, to bring about structural support to enable us to eliminate this awful scourge from our society.  I commend those involved, particularly Senator Freeman and Pieta House, on the way they have increased therapists in Cork.  It is about all of us coming together to work, to educate, to empower, to assist and to end this awful tragedy.  For any mental health advocate, be it Bressie, Conor Cusack or an ordinary person, it is good to talk and to engage and there is support there for people who need it.  I commend the Minister on her work and I hope there is action in Cork because it has been traumatic and devastating for people.</p></speech>

The mental health reform agenda makes a clear case to me, as it has to other Senators, for the retention of the &euro;35 million funding and some areas have been identified as suitable for the money to be spent, such as an adequate investment in peer support services and a greater availability of other social inclusion supports, like talking therapies.  I am a bit late because I was speaking to Dublin Simon whose counselling service is drastically underfunded.  They are anxious to extend the service and, as the Minister will know, mental ill health and homelessness go hand in hand.  Other areas include the development of culturally appropriate mental health services for people from ethnic minorities and the development of mental health services for particular groups of individuals, such as people with a co-morbid mental health difficulty and addiction.  A person may have an addiction or mental health issues but cannot get joined-up services as they have to go through one door or another.</p> <p>A statutory national advocacy service for both adults and children with mental health difficulties could be set up and there is a need for a dedicated funding stream for tenancy sustainment supports for people with mental health.  In my Cork Simon days mental health was often a reason people lost their tenancies.  This creates an awful problem for the person but it also creates problems in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Increased staffing in community mental health services up to the levels in A Vision for Change are also needed, as are access to 24-7 crisis mental health supports.  When I was in Cork Simon the dramas happened on Saturdays and Sundays or over the Christmas period when everyone else was on holidays.  Mental health crises do not happen on a Monday-to-Friday basis.  We need increased investment in in-reach liaison services for people in the criminal justice system as many people in our prison system are mentally unwell and not getting the supports they need.</p></speech>

We have been accused of allocating money but not spending it, or allocating it for a year ahead but not planning for the following years.  There is a very firm commitment from this Government, however, that we will implement A Vision for Change.  The figure of &euro;35 million, or &euro;37.5 million each year, has been put out there and whether it is spent year after year or all spent in one year does not make any difference as long as we plan ahead properly.  Staffing has been a problem and I can get an exact breakdown of what has been spent this year for Senator Freeman.  Some of it has gone in capital and some has moved away from services because of an inability to spend it.  This year, &euro;400,000 of the funding has gone to allocate 60 new places for the training of psychiatric nurses.  This will increase by over 45%, to 70 over the next four years, to help us tackle the problem.  Next year and the year after that we will be able to spend this money.  The &euro;35 million will be spent over two years and next year I will look for and expect the same amount.  Whether it is spent in one year or over two years, the big issue is that it is spent.</p> <p>On the task force, three groups are working together at the moment.  We are working with younger people and held our first youth forum this week.  We had engagement from throughout the country and across the spectrum, from children in college to children in bad areas, to hear exactly what they wanted to say.  A body of work is ongoing involving the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills to identify the services that exist, where they overlap, where they are not working and where we can improve them.  Some 155 services have already been identified and many can be amalgamated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We will not be issuing a report by Christmas.  We will issue recommendations, some of which might require legislative change or funding.  That is a work in progress and it is hard to identify exactly what will come out of it.</p><p>As regards dual diagnosis, in the coming weeks we will be appointing a clinical lead.  There is a programme being identified and worked on.  Once that clinical lead is appointed he or she will pull together a team which will plan a framework on how to deal with this problem.  It is a bit of a chicken and egg situation as to which comes first and how one deals with the two, three or four at the same time.</p><p>There is an interdepartmental team working with the Department of justice.  They have made recommendations, specifically on care for people while they are in prison.  The next phase which will happen in the coming weeks is to look at the follow-on plan for what happens to people when they leave.  More often than not they have more help when they are in prison than when they leave.  That is the next body of work that needs to happen.</p><p>I have to leave but perhaps I can come back to Senators on some of the issues they have raised.  I can address the issues properly then.  I thank the House for this opportunity and I apologise that I have to leave.</p></speech>
