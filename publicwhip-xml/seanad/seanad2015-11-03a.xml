I am also grateful that the Minister for Health has taken the time out from his busy schedule to be with us.</p> <p>I want to put on the record straight away that, in the context of this motion, I am not calling for a suspension of the vaccination programme.  What I am looking at, however, are those mothers and their daughters - specifically a growing number of daughters in this country - who, in my opinion, are not being treated in a holistic manner for the traumatic physical and mental side-effects that have hit them, coincidentally or otherwise, within a couple of days of receiving this vaccination.</p> <p>We are also here today in the shadow of High Court proceedings that are being taken by the mother of a girl who received the HPV vaccine.  She is asking for an order restraining the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which monitors health products in Ireland, from proceeding with the use of gardasil in any vaccine programme.</p> <p>She is also saying that within 24 hours of receiving the vaccination in October 2011, her 11-year-old daughter presented with severe flu-like symptoms.  Her daughter became extremely fatigued and suffered severe nausea which led to weight loss and muscle wastage.  Her daughter also missed days at school, was hospitalised with bilateral pneumonia the following year, and was on antibiotics for six weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Her daughter is now disabled to the point that she needs to be cared for on a permanent basis.  This was reported in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I cite that example as one of the many that can read on the website of REGRET, a support group set up by a group of parents.  There is growing concern internationally about the use of gardasil, which I hope the Minister will acknowledge.  To date, Japan has suspended its vaccination programme.  Denmark has asked the European Medicines Agency to review the vaccine and it has been decided that the Danish child vaccination programme will switch from using gardasil to cervarix.  A presentation has been made to the Scottish petitions committee on the points that I have made and it has been asked to accede to a request for a round-table discussion to be held at Edinburgh between scientists and medical professionals from both sides of the HPV vaccine safety debate. <br/><br/>According to Merck's own statistics, some 183 million doses of gardasil have been distributed worldwide.  Using its clinical trial percentage, this means there could be more than 6 million girls around the world suffering autoimmune conditions that could influence their health for the rest of their lives.  According to the World Cancer Research Foundation, in 2012, 528,000 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed worldwide.  This presents the question of whether it is worth the risk.  <br/><br/>There should be some acknowledgement by the Irish health authorities that there is something medically wrong with over 100 girls who have now been identified by REGRET as having developed similar symptoms within days of receiving the vaccination.  The medical establishment and the Department of Health have decided against having any discussion or investigation of this.  They say it will happen anyway and that every medication and vaccination has side effects and this is within the tolerable level.  When one looks more deeply, there are parents spending huge sums of money on trying to get treatment for their daughters and there should be some recognition of the financial crisis that many of them face as a result of this.  They genuinely believe that it is as a direct result of the vaccination.  <br/><br/>Everything I have said so far on the record is factual.  This is not about scaremongering.  The Danish Government has given 7 million kroner for an independent investigation, the Japanese have suspended its use, and an evaluation of gardasil and cervarix by the EMA has been initiated by the French Government.  These are not isolated cases.  There is a growing body of international opinion that suggests that something is wrong somewhere.  HPRA is engaged in the current EMA evaluation.  I hope there will be some recognition by the Irish health authorities of the trauma being suffered by these children and that they get some financial benefit.  They could be granted medical cards, which has happened in the case of other conditions in previous years.  There should be some recognition that there is something wrong somewhere along the line.  The parents genuinely believe that it is a direct result of the HPV vaccination.  <br/><br/>I reiterate that this is not about a suspension of the programme but an acknowledgement that there is something going on.  The Irish health authorities should not turn their face away from a growing body of international opinion that is beginning to acknowledge that there is something there.  We should join that growing chorus.  I do not believe it will go away.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the concerns of families who believe their daughters have experienced adverse reactions and health issues after receiving the HPV vaccine.  The vaccine protects against two high-risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  It is estimated that the HPV vaccination will save 60 lives annually in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is gardasil, a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  Following this, the national immunisation advisory committee recommended that the vaccine should be offered to all girls aged 12 years on an annual basis.</p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally, and at EU level.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  This is as it should be as it ensures that decisions are made solely on scientific information and expert advice, rather than being implemented by political pressure or lobbying.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where health care professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment.  All reports received are evaluated and considered for the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information that may assist in the assessment of the case.  I have been informed by the HPRA that up to 9 October it had received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and soreness or a rash at the injection site.  These are short-lived.</p><p>As is the case for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the pharmacovigilance and risk assessment committee, an EU-level drug safety committee, where the authority is represented and actively contributes.  I am aware that the European Medicines Agency has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine "to further clarify aspects of their safety profile", although the agency points out that this review "does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks".  The HPRA is participating in the review, which aims to clarify aspects of their safety profile and is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  In the meantime, the European Medicines Agency has advised health care professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Health care professionals should therefore continue using them in accordance with the current product information.  Any changes to this advice will be made following the outcome of the review.</p></speech>

He said the symptoms he outlined in the same paragraph are short-lived.  He should tell that to the parents of the over 100 people who have been experiencing much more serious medical, emotional and mental conditions for two, three and four years after getting the vaccination at 11 and 12 years of age, citing the current court case.  All I have asked, and it has not been forthcoming, is for some acknowledgement, at least, that there is something going on regarding this.</p> <p>In providing the pack to parents under the vaccination programme, why does the HSE not provide the patient information leaflet that is provided by Merck itself?  It provides a different information package.  I have read the information leaflet that accompanies the HPV gardasil vaccine and it makes for frightening reading.  I also know anecdotally that there are GPs around the country who are not recommending this vaccination as a result of this growing concern about the efficacy of gardasil and its possible side-effects.  They are issues the Minister cannot ignore.  Is he happy that the information leaflet provided by Merck, which manufactures gardasil, is not given to parents before they sign the consent form?</p></speech>

This is the summary of product characteristics, SPC, and the patient information leaflet.  The information is presented in clear, simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults, as the average reading age in Ireland is lower than the adult age.  Prior to all school immunisations, parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  The information packs for all immunisations are standardised nationally and the information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For schools vaccines, parents are also given the contact details of their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.  Each information leaflet also refers patients to the national immunisation website, <i>immunisation.ie</i>, where additional information, including the licence documentation, the summary of product characteristic, SPC, and the patient information leaflet, PIL, for each vaccine are found.  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organization for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the national information office to ask any question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the immunisation office within one working day.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1200" speakername="Averil Power" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015110300002#E00200"><p>On 22 October last, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, called for Beaumont Hospital to go off-call as the accident and emergency department was dangerously overcrowded.  By the early evening, there were 41 admitted patients in the accident and emergency department awaiting a hospital bed and numbers were set to rise as the night went on.  As the Minister will be aware, the department is also short of nurses and doctors and staff are concerned that it is impossible to provide a safe level of care to patients in these conditions.  Almost half of those awaiting a bed on the night to which I refer night were over the age of 75 and many of them had been forced to spend days on trolleys and chairs in frantic, bright and noisy conditions waiting for beds to become available.  Waiting on a trolley in such degrading and inhumane conditions is unacceptable for people of any age but it is particularly cruel for frail older individuals in their 70s, 80s and 90s.</p> <p>Accident and emergency overcrowding also creates an unacceptably stressful working environment for staff and is exacerbating the problem with emigration of nurses and doctors from Ireland to other countries where they can work in better conditions.  I appreciate that the problems at Beaumont accident and emergency did not just appear on this Government's watch but they seem to be getting worse.  According to the INMO, overcrowding at Beaumont increased by 40% in the first nine months of this year compared with 2014.  There is a major concern that the position will deteriorate further and that Beaumont Hospital may well be facing its worst winter ever.</p> <p>As the Minister will recall, the CEO of the hospital, Mr. Liam Duffy, described Beaumont as unsafe during last year's similar overcrowding crisis.  The former clinical director of the hospital, Professor Shane O'Neill, resigned over patient safety concerns.  I recently met the CEO, Mr. Duffy, and accident and emergency staff to discuss the accident and emergency crisis, and particularly what can be done to address it.  A number of things need to happen.  First, we need to reduce the number of people presenting at the accident and emergency department by improving primary care and out-of-hours services.  D-Doc was a great service when it started but it is suffering from a lack of resources.  I obtained figures from the HSE last year which show that some people classified by D-Doc as urgent had been waiting over 13 hours to see a doctor.  The rational course of action in such a circumstance is to go to accident and emergency and yet the service is supposed to prevent those who use it from having to do so.  Second, there is an urgent need for more convalescent and nursing home beds in the area.  Often Beaumont has up to 100 patients awaiting discharge for whom it cannot secure nursing home or convalescent home beds.  Some even have been there for over a year.  As the CEO explained to me, the average time in Beaumont is three or four days and in those circumstances - where there are particularly difficult cases and a place cannot be found for someone - 100 others are denied places because 100 patients could go through that bed in the same amount of time.  Third, even with these measures, improving out-of-hours services and reducing those presenting to accident and emergency, there will still be a crisis at Beaumont because of the older demographic relating to the area.  Beaumont has one of the most elderly populations in the country.  Given that the people who live in the area are going to continue to age, there will always be a need for acute accident and emergency medical services at Beaumont far more advanced than those currently provided there.</p> <p>The accident and emergency department was built for only 35 patients and is often home to 100.  Work is ongoing in respect of designs for a new accident and emergency department on the Beaumont campus and the authorities there are in discussions with the HSE about the matter.  However, the Government has not yet committed to building that new facility.  I raised this matter in order to urge the Minister to ring-fence the necessary funding and give a solid commitment that funding will be available as soon as those plans are finalised to build a new accident and emergency facility at Beaumont Hospital.</p></speech>

I wish to assure the House that reducing emergency department, ED, overcrowding is an objective of the Government and the HSE.  I convened the emergency department task force in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the ED task force plan.  Delayed discharges nationally are reducing steadily from 830 in December 2014 to 570 last Tuesday, and this has freed up more than 200 beds every day for acutely ill patients.  In October 2014, Beaumont Hospital had between 80 and 90 patients awaiting discharge home with supports or to a nursing home, and this number decreased to between 55 and 65 in October 2015, freeing up a whole ward for acutely ill patients every day.  The waiting time for the fair deal nursing homes subvention scheme has decreased from 11 weeks at the beginning of 2015 to between two and four weeks now.  By the end of 2015, more than 1,200 additional home care packages will have been provided as well as 149 additional public nursing home beds, 24 nursing home beds contracted for Moorehall in County Louth and 65 beds in Mount Carmel Community Hospital.</p><p>Senator Power is correct in identifying services such as D-Doc and convalescent home places as vital parts of a comprehensive solution to the overcrowding which we see in Beaumont all too often.  This integrated approach has led the Director General of the HSE to co-chair the ED task force implementation group until March 2016.  This will ensure all parts of the health and social care services work together and optimise resources to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months.</p><p>The rate of increase in the population of older people living in Ireland is greater in north Dublin than in any other part of the country, including other parts of Dublin.  In 1997, only 5% of people in Dublin aged over 65 lived in the areas served by Beaumont Hospital.  By 2011, this had increased to 24%.  With this older population in mind, additional short-stay convalescent beds have opened this year in St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, Clontarf orthopaedic hospital and St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  Hospitals on the north side of the city were also prioritised for access to the 65 additional beds opened in Mount Carmel Community Hospital.  However, given that most people prefer to remain in their own locality, where it is easier for friends and family to visit, a tender inviting private providers to supply additional short-stay and long-term nursing home beds in the area is also in process.  It is hoped that it can be agreed in the coming days or weeks.  The HSE will continue to target additional short-stay beds as part of its winter planning process for dealing with pressures on acute hospitals.</p><p>The HSE is reviewing GP out-of-hours services throughout the country, including D-Doc, which provides an out-of-hours GP service to the population of north Dublin city and county.  This review is expected to conclude shortly and will contain recommendations for changes and improvements to the delivery of service in each area.  Funding has been provided to Beaumont to extend its day hospital from two days a week to five days a week as an alternative pathway for admission and assessment for elderly people referred to the hospital by their GPs, thus allowing them to avoid the emergency department.</p><p>On the question of a new emergency department at Beaumont Hospital, a design team has been appointed, incorporating architects and health care planners, to undertake a feasibility study on the location, size and cost of building a new emergency department at the hospital.  This work is at the stakeholder consultation phase and the report is expected to be available in mid-December 2015.  When the hospital board approves a design, the project will be submitted for consideration by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group, of which Beaumont Hospital is part, HSE Estates and the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I also welcome the review of D-Doc and hope it leads to improvements in the service, given that it has great potential to deflect patients from Beaumont accident and emergency.  However, as I pointed out, and the Minister acknowledged, the rapid increase in the number of older people in the area is causing particular pressures.  While the design is open to discussion, everybody agrees there is a need for a new, far larger accident and emergency department.  I am disappointed the Government has not committed to funding it and I will keep pushing for it.</p></speech>

The board must do a feasibility study, cost it and approve it before the Government can make such a commitment.  A new emergency department alone will not solve overcrowding.  Among the emergency departments throughout the country, new and old, some of the new ones are overcrowded.  However, a new emergency department might provide a better service and patient experience, and it may be worth doing on this basis, separate from the overcrowding issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a ward currently closed in Beaumont Hospital.  This is creating difficulties at the moment.  I think it is St. Damien's kidney ward.  It has partially reopened this week and will fully reopen by the end of the month.  I hope this will ease the situation.  Over many years, the authorities at Beaumont Hospital have consistently explained the hospital's problems by reference to the number of delayed discharges.  For example, 90 beds were not available to acute patients because people could not get home care packages or nursing home spaces.  There has been a considerable reduction, from 80 or 90 to 50 or 60, in the number of delayed discharges at Beaumont Hospital.  That should have made a difference but it has not.  In fairness to the hospital, it has acknowledged that and, as a result, is looking at its own practices.  It is examining specialty wards and considering changes in the way things and people work to improve patient flow in the hospital.  Such measures have been demonstrated to have real effects in other hospitals.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  As we know, deer are wild animals that cannot easily be fenced in and ideally should never be fenced in.  The protection of red deer, as a native species, is very important.  As Senators will be aware, the number of red and sika deer in Killarney National Park is roughly equal.  I know it is impossible to find an exact number, but I would be interested to get an approximate number.  I do not think there would be any objection to a cull of sika deer, which is an imported species.  I think any cull should be confined to sika deer.</p> <p>The fencing of Killarney National Park would be impossible.  As we know, deer exist outside the park as well.  There is no question of the road between Killarney and Kenmare, which passes through the national park, ever being fenced.  However, in view of the number of accidents that have happened on the N72 road between Killarney and Killorglin, there is a case for some limited fencing where deer have tended to cross that road.  I support that case and suggest that the fence might extend from the end of the Castlerosse Hotel wall to the car park on the perimeter of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.  That is a limited area.  As the Minister of State probably knows, many of the trees along that roadside have been damaged by cars crashing into them as they veer to avoid deer.  The coroner has commented on that matter on a number of occasions.  I support fully the installation of fencing to exclude deer along that stretch only.  If there are too many red deer in lowland areas and they are wandering beyond the park - for example, into the reed beds on the edge of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club - perhaps they could be suitably darted at a particular time and transported to much higher ground on the edge of Mangerton or Torc.  It think it could be a question of husbandry rather than of a cull.</p> <p>Red deer have existed in Killarney for over 6,000 years and are widely regarded to be of international importance as a unique species of deer.  Damien Hannigan of the Wild Deer Association has said he believes illegal poaching has reduced the number of red deer in Killarney to "a dangerously low level" in recent years.  He fears that an indiscriminate cull could endanger the genetic diversity of the species.  While I might not go quite that far, I would be supportive of what he is saying or hinting at.  As a member of the Kerry Deer Society, I do not believe, on the basis of my sightings and my knowledge of the area, that red deer have been culled to a dangerously low level.  I should mention that the society in question would not support a cull of the red deer.  The Minister of State probably knows that illegal poaching is taking place.  I do not think the people who are shooting deer are examining them to see whether they are red or sika.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Being a fellow Kerryman with an interest in these matters, I am sure the Minister shares my concerns and I look forward to hearing what he has to say on the issue. </p></speech>

I appreciate the Senator has a very good knowledge of the national park in Killarney.  As a trustee of Muckross House and having devoted a long number of years to the welfare and development of the park, including its wildlife, it is appropriate that he raise this matter.</p> <p>Nationally, wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.</p> <p>On deer policy in general, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, recently published Deer Management in Ireland - A Framework for Action, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish deer management forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the report.  The forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas, such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, and representatives from both Departments.</p> <p>In Killarney National Park, park rangers during their normal daily duties often take spot counts of deer on the lowlands.  Sika deer numbers are not out of control in the park and are at much lower densities than can be found in Wicklow, for example.  However, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would like to further reduce the numbers of this non-native species.</p> <p>Red deer numbers have not significantly increased in the uplands of Killarney National Park.  However, lowland numbers have increased, and these deer are highly visible.  It is intended to commence culling this population in November once the rut has finished.  It should be noted that pressure was exerted on red deer in areas adjacent to the park when they were on the open season order.  This may have resulted in red deer entering the park for sanctuary.</p> <p>With respect to the ongoing management of the deer population, the intention of any cull would be to focus on the red deer populations in Muckross and Knockreer in the first instance.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service believes fencing the national park would not be viable and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  First, as the presence of deer is not confined to the national parks, fencing of these properties would not serve any practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.  Second, the park is more than 10,000 ha. in size and includes some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task, which would be unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Third, sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.  Fourth, the erection of a fence of this size would also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.  Fifth, there are many deer outside the park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists.</p> <p>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists and improved signage are likely to be the most effective measures to assist motorists when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  These populations roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.</p> <p>I am aware that there have been calls in some quarters for the Department to carry out a national deer census.  The Department does not have the resources to carry out or co-ordinate a national deer count.  A large part of the deer population lives in forestry or woodland and it is particularly difficult to achieve reliable counts in such dense cover.  There is no evidence to suggest there is any threat to Ireland's deer population.</p></speech>

While it might not be possible, I would rely on the rangers.  Their approximations would be good enough for us.  I do not accept that the red deer population in Muckross and Knockreer should be culled in the first instance.  The fencing that I am calling for would affect only red deer and stretch 100 yd, 200 yd or, at most, 300 yd from the end of the wall of the Castlerosse car park on the western side.  This would address the coroner's concerns by reducing the number of accidents on that busy stretch of road.  There is no question of fencing on the Kenmare Road.  As the Minister of State suggested, though, perhaps there could be improved signage to warn of the presence of deer.</p></speech>

The Minister recognises that the red deer of Killarney National Park and the surrounding area are of national conservational significance and that the subject of culling is emotive.  There is a considerable challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that the deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.  The Department conducts localised annual deer counts on State lands, such as the Wicklow and Killarney national parks.  Deer species are increasing in range and number.  Where appropriate and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p> <p>Regarding road accidents, I remain of the view that improved sight lines and signage for motorists are likely to be the most effective measures to assist them when driving through areas where deer populations can be expected.</p></speech>

Following the equally foul murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe, this vile act has stunned the communities of Omeath, Blackrock and the wider Border area.  There is a major problem with criminals masquerading as republicans and indulging in criminal acts such as large-scale smuggling, including of tobacco, diesel laundering, racketeering and extortion.  They are out of control.</p> <p>The Garda is undoubtedly doing a great job.  In recent weeks, there has been evidence of an increased Garda presence in Cooley and my area of Haggardstown.  I am told that a great deal of valuable information has been gathered, not just on cross-Border criminality but also on motorway criminals.  The Garda is building a large bank of information.</p> <p>What measures have been taken to increase security in the area following the heinous murder of Garda Golden?  I wish to raise the suggestion of a cross-Border task force involving the Garda, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, HMRC, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, the UK National Crime Agency, the relevant justice Ministers and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This task force concept has been advocated previously by a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly chaired by Senator Paul Coghlan in its comprehensive report on cross-Border crime.

In the context of the talks going on around the Stormont House agreement and the danger to the institutions in the North, he has said that he sees that such a task force would be a vital component of the successful conclusion of those talks.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, is right on the money in his suggestion to establish a task force.  I hope he gets the full support of all involved for his proposal.  It is time to put a stop to the gallop of these criminals who think they are beyond the law.</p></speech>

I apologise to him on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, who cannot be here to answer his question.</p> <p>The murder of Garda Tony Golden in the line of duty was a loss for the nation.  Our thoughts are with his family and friends in their grief.  He displayed a courage and commitment to duty which is in the best traditions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  His killing is a stark reminder of the considerable risk that the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face on our behalf in their daily work.  My sister served in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for almost 30 years.</p> <p>The allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has been informed by the Commissioner that the allocation of personnel is monitored continually to ensure optimum deployment.  This process is reviewed periodically in the light of particular incidents of concern.  In this context, the Garda Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 27 garda&iacute;, including two sergeants, to the Louth division as an interim measure.  These garda&iacute; are being transferred on a temporary basis to support the work of the 283 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Louth division.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has secured an increased allocation in budget 2016 that will allow for the recruitment of an additional 600 new garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 that will be recruited before the end of this year.  The work of local garda&iacute; in the legislation is augmented by a number of Garda national units, such as the drugs and organised crime unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, in accordance with operational demands.  Tackling organised crime is a priority for the Government, the Garda and other law enforcement authorities.  Of course it is a shared priority with the authorities in Northern Ireland, and extensive cross-Border co-operation is in place to tackle smuggling and other Border-focused criminal activities.  This work involves police, customs and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions.  The inter-agency cross-Border enforcement groups on fuel and tobacco fraud are examples of this joint work in action.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, met recently with the Minister of Justice in the North, David Ford, to discuss what more can be done to tackle cross-Border crime.  The Ministers jointly hosted the annual cross-Border organised crime seminar in Sligo on 30 September and 1 October, which was attended by more than 100 delegates from North and South.  It was one demonstration of the close and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is examining, in co-operation with her counterparts in the North, ways to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jimmy Deenihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=306"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=306&amp;amp;pid=JimmyDeenihan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want an enhanced overarching structure put in place to support it.

As I said previously, their work in the area is bearing much fruit.  It is to be hoped that can make a big difference.</p> <p>I refer to the cross-Border task force.  I note the comments of the Minister that she would welcome increased co-operation with her counterparts in the North to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area, which should be noted.  We want to see that enhanced and there is a need to put in place an overarching structure to support it.  The comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, reflected that.  It is my earnest wish that progress be made in this matter and that the task force be established in short order.</p> <p>Before I conclude, I wish to congratulate Chief Superintendent Pat McGee of the Louth-Meath division on an excellent and amazing career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He is retiring this weekend.  He has been to the forefront in the Louth-Meath division for many years.  In my village, Blackrock, County Louth, we formed a hurling team together when he first came to the area, believe it or not.  He had played in an all-Ireland minor final for Wexford.  I wish him very well.  He is a very popular and hard-working chief superintendent.</p></speech>

Since 2012, the Government has invested almost &euro;29 million in renewing the Garda fleet to support front-line Garda responses.  In this regard, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, recently announced the allocation of a further &euro;5.3 million for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motorcycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  The Government's capital plan 2016-2021 provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles.  It also provides major additional investment of &euro;205 million over the lifetime of the plan for Garda ICT systems and technology.  This will bring the overall Garda ICT funding to &euro;330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan.  The increased budget allocation that the Minister secured for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted intelligence-led policing.</p> <p>The Government and relevant law enforcement agencies will maintain and intensify their focus on combating organised crime, whatever its aims and origins.  In respect of Border-focused crime, we will continue to work in close co-operation with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and develop measures to enhance and support this joint approach to crack down on those who exploit Border communities for their criminal ends.</p></speech>

It would do justice to &quot;Fair City&quot; and all the other TV soap operas.  We have been following this with great interest through the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which has been referred to as the downtown office of the Government parties for disseminating the latest blow-by-blow accounts of what is going on between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  On a very serious note, homelessness is escalating to the point where it has gone beyond being a national crisis; everybody is now very much aware of it, yet there seems to be no great resolution.</p><p>According to the newspaper today, the latest episode in this soap opera is that the capping of rents is now being considered, along with the introduction of legislation that will make it more difficult for landlords to evict tenants.  There is sufficient legal protection for tenants.  What is really needed is a belated acknowledgement that there is an urgent need to increase the housing allowance, the supplementary allowance.  In various exchanges I have had here on this issue over the past year or two with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, she has said that increasing the rent supplement would act as a pull factor in that it would increase rents and that landlords would automatically push up rents.  They are pushing them up anyway.  If this latest episode of the soap opera comes to fruition, it will be obvious that, between now and the time any proposed legislation comes before these Houses, landlords will immediately start putting up rents again.  It is a catch-22 situation.  It seems that in order to help the poor unfortunate people who cannot get rental accommodation because it is beyond their financial means, the most obvious solution, at least in the short to medium term, is to increase the rent supplement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Leader convey my concerns to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and ask him to come to the House to discuss his brief in this regard?</p><p>While I welcome unreservedly the reported investment designed to improve the efficiency of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its fight against crime, question marks are already being raised about the more than 270 vehicles that are to be provided not only as to when they will come on stream, but where they will be apportioned and who will drive them.  The recruitment of trainee garda&iacute;, welcome as it is, is only addressing an issue that has been with this Government since its inception, when it stopped recruitment.  That resulted in a reduction in garda numbers from 14,500 to 12,000.  In many parts of the country, particularly in rural areas where Garda stations have closed, there is a real need to provide more resources.  The new investment is welcome, particularly in the information technology area and for the allocation of new high-powered vehicles to tackle the activities of thugs who use the motorway system around the country to scare the living daylights out of people living in rural areas.  However, we must have answers to the questions that have arisen.</p><p>Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, to the House before Christmas to outline the Government's strategy on sport?  I was present recently at a well-attended and comprehensive briefing by the Federation of Irish Sport, the umbrella body for all sporting organisations.  One of the key priorities emphasised at that briefing was the need for a national strategy on sport.</p></speech>

In that regard, I welcome the Government's investment in the provision of Garda cars and the return to Garda recruitment, which was stopped under the previous Government.  It is very important to note the turnaround that is being made.  In addition, new legislation is coming forward on this issue.  I remind colleagues that the justice committee will have a hearing on rural crime at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow in the course of which we will tease out some of the issues Members have raised.</p><p>I welcome the news today that the unemployment rate has fallen to 9.3%, down from 10.6% this time last year.  This means the number of people out of work has fallen by nearly 25,000 in the past 12 months.  It is very significant progress to have moved from the crisis peak of unemployment at 15.1% to this new low.  That progress is very welcome, although the rate remains too high.</p><p>I welcome the signing into law last week by the Presidential Commission of the Marriage Bill 2015.  This means we will see the first weddings of gay couples in Ireland in the coming months, which is very welcome.  I am disappointed, however, as are many others, that the DUP has used its powers to block the development that took place in the Northern Ireland Assembly whereby, for the first time, a majority of MLAs - 53 to 52 - voted in favour of a change in the law.  I hope we will see progress on marriage equality in the North.</p><p>I expect Senator Susan O'Keeffe and others will join me in raising concerns regarding the year-long investigation by <i>The Guardian</i>into the Irish fishing sector which points to the use of migrant workers as cheap labour.  A catalogue of abuses is documented in that newspaper today, including workers being confined to vessels, being paid less than half the Irish minimum wage, being subjected to extreme sleep deprivation and so on.  Clearly, although we have strong criminal law prohibiting human trafficking either for sexual or labour exploitation, enforcement is a difficulty.  In that context, I welcome the Blue Blindfold initiative, which asks people to watch out for indicators of human trafficking.  I welcome, too, the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, that spot checks will be put in place to identify undocumented workers.  I call for a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

However, I prefer to see the glass as half full rather than half empty.  For the first time, the Northern Assembly has, by democratic vote, stood in favour of equal marriage.  That is a great thing.  It seems there has been some softening of views on this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I saw an interview with Mr. Ian Paisley Jr. in which he spoke positively about decriminalisation and so on and so forth, but it is a little ironic that this was stopped by a combination of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the DUP - strange bedfellows indeed.<br/><br/>I have been asked by Maynooth Students Union to draw attention of the House to a sad event relating to a young campaigner called Dean McCarron who was a strong fighter during the Yes Equality campaign.  He was the head of Pride, the gay organisation, in Maynooth.  He was energetic and fun.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality,  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, put out a message on social media expressing his sadness at this young man's passing.  He was in San Francisco for a family wedding and he died rather suddenly and unexpectedly.  Maynooth Students Union issued a statement saying:</p><blockquote>MSU cannot find the words to express our regret at the loss of one of our stellar former students ... Dean was also a key student campaigner in the recent marriage equality referendum, and on so many student and community issues before that.  He wanted to make the world around him a better place.</blockquote><p>This is the kind of young person, regardless of sexual orientation, that this county needs, and I greatly regret his passing.</p></speech>

I would like to congratulate Clarke railway station in Dundalk on winning the overall award for best train station in Ireland.  Voting was conducted through an online poll and in railway stations.  Customers were asked to rate their station under the criteria of customer co-operation and information, station appearance, staff helpfulness, hanging baskets, absence of litter, flowers, etc.  The Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann awards reward excellence in customer facilities, cleanliness, innovation and customer service in the country's 144 railway stations.  It was a major achievement for the manager of Dundalk station, Mr. Anthony Monaghan, and, as he says himself, "his brilliant staff".  I would like to acknowledge the contribution his predecessor made over many years.  Mr. Brendan McQuaid's contribution was enormous and the staff under him were active in promoting the station for at least 20 years.  The award is just rewards.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Jim D'Arcy, mentioned Chief Superintendent Pat Magee from the Louth-Meath division, who is retiring this week.  I would like to acknowledge his contribution to law and order.  He started off as sergeant in my home town of Carlingford and he made a major contribution during the Troubles.  I wish him, his wife Concepta, and his family many happy years of retirement.</p></speech>

Nothing happened until this week.  I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality on her announcement that she will do something about this.  It takes a long time to get things done and, apparently, there were challenges.</p> <p>Something similar happened last year.  I tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill 2014 in respect of personal retirement savings accounts and the question of whether they should be taxed.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris, read from his script and said that unfortunately it could not be done.  I am delighted that almost a year later this amendment has been made in the new Finance Bill.  Things do happen and perhaps we are obliged to have patience.</p> <p>I have mentioned previously the huge volumes of food generated everywhere, not just in our own homes but in supermarkets and hotels as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Part of the problem in this regard is due to the fact that we still allow people to put "best before" rather than "use by" on them.  The fact that a product has passed its best before date does not mean there is anything wrong with it.  I recall an individual who supplied us with potatoes on which the best before date was three days later.  He said, "They are new potatoes and it is best if they are eaten on the day of purchase.  However, the fact that the best before date has been passed does not mean they have gone off."  A huge amount of food continues to be wasted.  Morrisons, a large supermarket chain in Britain, just announced that it will give all its surplus food to charity and will not throw out any more food whatsoever.  That is an initiative we should support.  In France, legislation which makes it illegal to throw away edible food has been introduced.  Let us ensure that we learn from what is happening abroad and proceed to improve our country on that basis.</p></speech>

However, I disagree with the Senator's assertion that there is adequate protection for tenants.  We are heading towards the eventuality of 1,000 families in the Dublin region being homeless by the end of this year.  They are being made homeless because they cannot afford to pay rent increases, some of which have been in the region of 35% in recent years.  There are no protections against economic evictions.  The main reason for this is that there is no protection against unreasonable rent increases.  The call for rent certainty is based on the fact the latter would allow people to have a reasonable expectation as to what would be a fair limit in the context of rent increases.  I ask Senator Mooney to consider his position on that.</p></speech>

I welcome this afternoon's announcement to the effect that the Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment, Deputy Nash, published the report on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts.  The findings of the study, conducted by the University of Limerick, are very interesting.  While they establish that there is not an extensive number of zero-hour contracts in Ireland, there is a large number of "if-and-when" contracts in existence here.  The idea behind the latter is that, unlike the position with zero-hour contracts, the person is not obliged to make himself or herself available for work.  As we all know, however, people on the type of contracts to which I refer do make themselves available for work.  The impact on young people, in particular, is well known and has been highlighted by trade unions and NGOs.  They have argued that the unpredictability of work, the difficulties in managing work and home life, unstable incomes, difficulties in accessing financial credit, contracts that do not reflect the reality of the number of hours worked, insufficient notice when called to work and so on have a distinct impact on the younger cohort of workers.  Given that the report contains a number of interesting and exciting recommendations, I ask that time be made available for a debate on it and - as I have requested previously - on the wider issue of young people.  The issue of predictability of work is of major concern to that cohort.</p></speech>

It is more than that - people have been calling for the Government to get its act together, to put in place policies to deal with issues in respect of homelessness and the private rented sector, the supply of housing by the State and the over-reliance on the private rented sector in the context of the vast majority of social housing applicants.  As we are all aware, many cannot get landlords to sign up to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or rent supplement and, therefore, they have no options open to them because of the lack of availability of social housing.  That is the nature of the crisis.  There is also the issue of landlords increasing rents.  They are doing so because private sector tenants and social housing tenants are competing with each other to rent their properties.  Those social housing tenants are obliged to seek private rented accommodation because that is the only option open to them.  That is the problem and we need to deal with it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Last Thursday, I dealt with a family in Waterford.  A woman with three children was turned down even for emergency accommodation - no bed and breakfast or hotel.  There was no support whatsoever and she was told to go back and live with her family.  That was on the front page of the <i>Waterford News and Star</i>this week, which did a feature on it.  Three homeless families were in my office last week.  That is the reality in Waterford, but it is also happening in Limerick, Cork, Dublin and elsewhere.  It will not get any better until we deal with it.<br/><br/>All we see from the Government parties is dithering, disagreement and rows.  However, what is being portrayed in the media may or may not be happening.  I do not know the reality of it, but we want Ministers in the House to have a proper discussion with us about solutions on which we can agree.  If the Government brings forward solutions to deal with the problem, it will have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am sure the Independents and Fianna F&aacute;il will also support the Government in doing the right thing because this is a national emergency.  I appeal to the Leader to arrange such a debate.  The Government should get its act together and do something immediately because we cannot allow this crisis to continue.</p></speech>

As we know, such crime is controlled in many areas by the Provisional IRA, as was recently documented in a report.  This is something which we in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly unanimously recommended last February at a plenary meeting in Dublin.  The Taoiseach greatly welcomed it at the time.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is pursuing this further in the ongoing talks at Stormont.  Cross-Border crime has its roots in paramilitary groups which existed and were active in other areas using other methods, thankfully no longer.  It appears to me these people have continued their organisation for their own benefit and their own criminality.  They are crime lords in these areas and try to control things as tightly as they can.  I accept that a blind eye is not being turned to these people.  However, policing is so light and merely a token, if I may say so, particularly on the other side of the Border in south Armagh, that they do not need a blind eye to be turned.  They are able to carry on with impunity.  For all these reasons I am delighted that the establishment of this task force is being pursued more actively.</p> <p>I also greatly welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality that we will have 27 garda&iacute;, including two sergeants, allocated immediately to the Louth division.  This is in addition to the 600 new garda&iacute; who will be recruited next year and the 550 we will have by the end of this year.  As we know, part of the criminality in that area involves the pollution of the Fane River system and Lough Ross from which drinking water is extracted for the Crossmaglen, south Armagh and Dundalk areas.  While I know that water is treated, it is disgraceful that such activity is able to go on in this modern-day, democratic society.</p></speech>

I have often been criticised for being unduly critical of the Government but I compliment the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who went to the summit today.  If Senators have not attended, I recommend that they do so.  Without doubt it is one of the greatest technological and innovative centres one will find in Europe.  There are companies attending from Argentina, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and from elsewhere around the world.  I spoke to one very large company and asked them its representatives if they were doing good business.  The reply was that they did not come here to do business but because this is the place to be this week if one is involved in information technology.</p> <p>In complimenting the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on going to the summit today, I am dismayed that the Taoiseach was not there.

I ask the Leader to do what he can to ensure that we bring the Web Summit back from Lisbon next year and to provide whatever resources are needed, such as shuttle buses.  I spoke to people today who took two hours to get through Dublin Airport last night because there were so many people coming into the country.  The taxi drivers who drove me to and from the summit told me that they are run off their feet bringing people over and back to the RDS.  This is a great summit to have in this country and we have to get it back.  It is an Irish summit.</p></speech>

I had a Commencement debate with him on a community fund that is supposed to be in place.  It appears that if locals object to a wind farm development, they will get the benefit of a community fund, yet if they sit back and do not object they get nothing.  In my area of Rooskey, Ballaghaderreen, a company that put up two massive wind turbines had a local person apply for the planning permission and because he was a local person, the locals did not object to his application.  Once he got the planning permission, the company bought the turbines from him.  Now it appears that there is mobile phone interference when the turbines are rotating, and when the wind comes from the west or south locals cannot watch their televisions because they freeze.  The notion that these industrial wind turbines do not affect health is false.  I call on the Leader to have a debate as soon as possible in the House on wind farms and wind energy.</p></speech>

The issue of housing and the capacity to sort it out will take a number of weeks.  There is no magic wand to wave.

We should be able to have a debate on that issue so Members of this House will be able to advise and offer suggestions to the Minister for agriculture on the working group.  </p><p>One of the observations that has been made is that it is very difficult to get Irish people to do the arduous work that is required on fishing vessels.  That was never an excuse for any organisation or company to exploit workers from other countries, to treat them like slaves and ignore their rights.  Those rights have been hard-won over many decades.  They have not been trained to do what can only be described as hazardous work and have not been paid properly.  It took courage for them to speak out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Susan O'Keeffe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2366"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2366&amp;amp;pid=SusanOKeeffe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Goodness knows the risk to which they have put themselves in order to do so.

I am glad there is a huge national debate taking place in respect of burglaries in rural and urban areas and I welcome the announcement yesterday of Operation Thor, which will tackle organised crime gangs and prolific offenders.  We all want to see more checkpoints put in place to disrupt criminals who use motorways to travel between areas and commit crime and we will hopefully see many extra high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hotspots.  However, there is another major issue that needs to be considered, namely, the market in stolen goods.  Where are these criminals offloading the goods they have stolen?  If there were no market for them, there would be far fewer burglaries and less crime.  We need a forthright debate on this matter in the House.  The Minister would learn a great deal from Senators on issues that are relevant in various parts of the country and on how the goods to which I refer are offloaded.</p> <p>There is a need for a national crime prevention awareness campaign and I hope such a campaign will be rolled out in the coming weeks.  We need to encourage communities to work together and with local garda&iacute; in order to get more community alert schemes into place.  As individuals, we all need to look at our own houses and premises to see how we can make them more secure and how we can be more careful when we are going out at night or if we are away during the day.</p> <p>There is too much talk about the closure of small Garda stations.  I do not want to see garda&iacute; sitting around in small rural stations where there is very little happening.  I want them out in patrol cars.  I also want them out in communities, meeting people and getting to know them and picking up useful information.  We need to wage war on crime and criminals, particularly who carry out burglaries.  What we have seen this week and in recent weeks is the start of it.  We all have a role to play.  We all have a contribution to make to the debate on this matter.  I would like such a debate to be facilitated in the House in the near future.</p></speech>

It is important that we make every effort to bring back the Web Summit, which will not be hosted in Ireland next year.  However, we have to put the matter in context.  On the radio this morning, severe and unjustified criticism was levelled at IDA Ireland.  All the State agencies have worked very hard to bring new industries to this country and to create new jobs.  There is proof of that: the unemployment rate is down again this month, to 9.3%.  I wish it were lower but steady progress has been made and it is clear evidence that all the State agencies are working very hard to assist people in finding employment.  The criticism this morning was unjustified.</p> <p>Some 35,000 people will attend the Web Summit.  The event relates to a very technical area and many people are travelling from all over the world to attend.  We must consider the number of people who attend other events held in this country.  We are able to organise such events very efficiently and without difficulty.  For example, a person to whom I spoke this morning referred to the National Ploughing Championships.  Some 281,000 people attended those championships - which were organised in a very efficient and effective manner - this year.  There is no reason we cannot organise the Web Summit in the same way here in Dublin.  Whatever difficulties arose need to be examined but people should not be blaming the Ministers, the Government or the State agencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They have done everything in their power to assist the organisers.

Although there is a major problem with burglaries, I have a feeling it is being somewhat overplayed and the very negative incidents that occur throughout the country are less frequent than perceived.  When I canvass at the doors, I get the impression that there is a perception that residents are unsafe in their homes because of stories they hear.  That is a real feeling for them.  Senator Mullins mentioned Garda visibility and that is something I feel strongly about.  We need to have a lot more of these new garda&iacute; visible on the streets, both in the cities and in suburban areas.  If garda&iacute; are seen around the place, it is a deterrent.  Given that there have been closures of Garda stations, whatever one might have to say about that which could involve a big debate, if they are not going to be sitting in Garda stations I believe strongly that there should be a greater police presence.  Even if garda&iacute; were to go into estates once a day and that there would be some sort of a rota system whereby they would be seen to be around the place, it would be a positive move.</p> <p>There is a related matter that has been brought to my attention by a few people recently and I have done a little work on it.  I have researched the law in the United Kingdom when it comes to the possession of a knife on one's person.  As far as I am concerned, there is practically no justifiable reason for carrying a knife outside of one's home.  Perhaps a butter knife for sandwiches or a Stanley knife would be acceptable.</p></speech>

I join my colleague, Senator Mullins, in looking for the Minister to come to the House for a wide-ranging debate in this area.

The Minister, who is a key member of the talks team, has stated that the talks must produce an outcome that further deepens North-South co-operation in tackling problems such as large-scale smuggling operations, fuel laundering, drug dealing and extortion.  It is time to put a stop to the gallop of these criminals who think they are beyond the law.  In this regard, the recent extra resources drafted into Louth as a result of the heinous murder of Garda Tony Golden are bearing dividends.  The checkpoints adjacent to motorway exits and in the Cooley area have gathered a great deal of information and tracked the movement of many suspicious people, and that is to be greatly welcomed.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has also said that there is a need to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this regard between North and South and we want to see an enhanced overarching structure in place to support it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Hopefully, in conjunction with the successful conclusion of the Northern talks, this task force will be established.

Although we have had two debates on housing during the past 12 months, I agree there is an urgent need for a further debate soon.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will have further proposals on homelessness and a housing plan in the next two weeks.  Hopefully, we will have a debate on it then.  The Government has put aside &euro;3.8 billion to build more than 100,000 housing units in the coming years.  We are to install modular housing as an emergency measure in Dublin and more of those modular units will be installed in the coming months in order to tackle homelessness.  I am sure the Minister will come to the House within the coming weeks, after all the new proposals have been put in place.  The Government is treating the matter very seriously and I will ask the Minister to come to the House as soon as the new and further proposals have been announced in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Mooney raised the question of the Garda.  He suffered from a little amnesia.  The previous Government closed down the Garda college in Templemore, and as a result we had no recruitment of garda&iacute;.  This Government has put 500 new garda&iacute; on the streets and the budget provides for an additional 600 garda&iacute;.  Law and order is of paramount importance to the Government, and will continue to be during the coming months.</p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the fact that unemployment has decreased to 9.3% from 15% when the Government took office.  As she said, while it is a great improvement, the figure is still too high.  The Government recognises this and job creation is the Government's top priority, and will continue to be.  The more people we can get back to work, the more taxes will come in and the more services we can provide for the people, which is what we want.</p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the signing into law of the Marriage Bill and expressed regret at the DUP's move.  Senator Norris also commented on it and welcomed the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly voted in favour of a change in the marriage law, which is a first in Northern Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senators Bacik and O'Keeffe spoke about the use of migrant workers in the fisheries sector and welcomed the Minister's action on this issue.  I agree with both Senators that the exploitation of workers is totally unacceptable, regardless of the countries the workers in question come from, and will have to be stamped out in the fisheries industry and in all other industries.</p><p>Senator Norris expressed his regret at the passing of a student leader, Dean McCarron.  I have read about this excellent young man, who took part in student politics and in the recent marriage referendum.  I would like to express our sympathy to his family on his very early passing.</p><p>Senators Brennan and Jim D'Arcy wished Chief Superintendent Pat Magee well on his forthcoming retirement.  Senator Brennan also made some good comments about the railway station in Dundalk.</p><p>Senator Quinn spoke about the tagging of criminals, which is an issue that has been raised recently.  I am informed that legislation to allow tagging was introduced in 2007.  Based on comments in recent times, there is obviously a need to revamp the mechanism that is in place.  As Bills relating to burglaries, bail and victims of crime will be considered in this House before Christmas, Senators will have ample opportunity to discuss the matters raised by Senator Mullins in particular.  I am sure Operation Thor can be debated when the Bills in question come before the House in the coming weeks.</p><p>Senator Quinn raised the issue of best-before and use-by dates, as he has done on several previous occasions.  I would agree with him.  I understand there are supermarkets in Ireland that are giving waste food to charities.  Perhaps this could be organised on a national basis.  I think this is being done in Cork, in particular, at present.  I suggest that it could be expanded nationwide.</p><p>Senator Hayden suggested that inadequate protection is being afforded to tenants.  She also commented on the study on zero-hour contracts.  I will certainly invite the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to come to this House to discuss that study.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the possible establishment of a task force with responsibility for tackling organised crime.  This matter was raised by Senator Jim D'Arcy during the Commencement Debate before the Order of Business.  Senator Coghlan mentioned the involvement of the Provisional IRA in the crime that is ongoing in Border areas and expressed support for the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who has called for the creation of a task force.  This issue was raised at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly over 12 months ago.  I am hopeful that this task force will be up and running soon because it is of paramount importance to tackle such crime, as can be seen by anyone living in Border areas.  As Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned earlier this afternoon, the deployment of extra garda&iacute; is already bearing fruit.  There is a need to build on the good relations that exist between the Garda and the PSNI to stamp out the criminality that has been clearly evident in Border areas over the last ten years or more.</p><p>Senators Craughwell and Colm Burke spoke about the great success of the Web Summit and wished it continued success in the future.  I understand that Lisbon has signed up to host the summit for the next three years.  I hope there may be a possibility of bringing it back to Ireland after that.  I listened with interest this morning to the comments of a number of people from South Africa and many other countries who are attending the Web Summit.  They said that Ireland, as an English-speaking country, is the key place to have such a summit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They spoke little of the problems enunciated by Mr. Cosgrave whom I wish well in his efforts.</p></speech>

The National Concert Hall has a special place in the cultural life of this country.  The range of musical experiences it offers has attracted many thousands of visitors since its establishment in 1981.  In 2014 alone it presented almost 900 events to almost 330,000 people.  This was the highest attendance figure at the hall since 2009 and is a reflection of its successful programming strategy.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to convert the National Concert Hall from a company limited by guarantee to a statutory body.  Companies operating under the Companies Acts must comply with the corporate governance, reporting and accountability provisions of those Acts.  Reporting to a Minister, or onwards to the Oireachtas, would not be normal for companies established under the Companies Acts.  I consider it more appropriate that there be a statute-based framework for the National Concert Hall.  This will provide for appropriate reporting and accounting to me and onwards to the Oireachtas while not impinging on its curatorial independence.</p><p>The development of this legislation forms part of a number of important developments in the cultural arena.  Senators will be aware that my Department and I are in the process of preparing our first ever national cultural policy, Culture 2025<i>. </i>We have been engaged in public consultation and this has provided an important opportunity for everyone to have his or her say on what we want to achieve in terms of our arts and culture in the next decade.  In the past month or so my Department has held a series of regional meetings, culminating with a one-day meeting in Dublin where cultural stakeholders from across the country came together to share ambitions and ideas.  It was a great success, and I was greatly enthused by the level of creativity and optimism in the room.  I hope that Culture 2025<i></i>will embed culture in the minds of Government and citizen alike, and that it will make culture a part of our daily language and form a greater part of our daily lives.</p><p>Culture is intrinsic to society and of inherent value, and it should be recognised as such.  My aim is to create a vibrant cultural sector that is fully inclusive, with clearly defined strategic goals and a clear understanding of its interaction with Government.  The cultural policy must also aim for increased participation in and access to cultural activities for all sectors of society.  As a high-level document, Culture 2025<i></i>will set a framework for future strategies and will be underpinned by the principle of upholding and supporting artistic freedom.</p><p>As Members will be aware, the economic crisis had a severe impact on the sectors under my remit.  I commend all of our cultural institutions on their work not just in maintaining services but also in increasing visitor numbers during the difficult years.  I am pleased, therefore, that I have been in a position to stabilise and increase funding for our cultural institutions in the 2015 and 2016 budgets.  A once-off &euro;2 million funding injection for our cultural institutions, which I secured late last year, has been retained for 2016.  The cultural institutions will also benefit from specific funding under the Ireland 2016 programme.</p><p>Before I discuss the main provisions of this Bill, I acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht which contributed towards the development of this Bill.  Members of this House sat on that committee and their work is much appreciated.  I also thank the chair, the board, the chief executive and the management of the National Concert Hall for their helpful contributions during the development of the Bill.</p><p>I will turn now to the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1, covering sections 1 to 3, includes standard provisions such as the definitions section.  Part 2 of the Bill deals with the establishment of the National Concert Hall as a statutory body.  Section 5 deals with the establishment of the National Concert Hall as a body situated for the time being at Earlsfort Terrace to perform the functions conferred on it by this Bill.</p><p>Section 7 deals with the functions of the National Concert Hall and is an important section.  The approach has been to adopt broad strategic functions with the aim of enabling the National Concert Hall to act in both the public and the commercial arenas in which it operates.  The principal functions include the provision and operation of the national venue for the performance, appreciation and enjoyment of musical, creative, artistic and cultural activities.  In addition, section 7(b) contains a specific reference to the public interest and promoting the performance, knowledge, appreciation, creation and enjoyment of music as an integral part of Irish life.  I am confident that this section contains due recognition of the importance of the role of the National Concert Hall in Irish cultural life.</p><p>Section 8 is another key section in the Bill.  This section is an explicit recognition of the nature of the relationship between the Minister and the National Concert Hall.  The section provides that the National Concert Hall shall be independent in the exercise of its functions subject to such general policy guidelines as may be issued by the Minister to all national cultural institutions from time to time.  I am aware that this issue was the source of some discussion at the joint committee hearing and I am happy that the provision addresses the concerns raised at the hearing.  Section 9 deals with the powers of the National Concert Hall generally.  In particular, the section provides that the board shall have the power to do anything that appears advantageous, for example, to the performance of the functions of the National Concert Hall.</p><p>Part 3, covering sections 10 to 17, inclusive, deals with the board of the National Concert Hall.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 10 deals with appointments to the board of the National Concert Hall.  In making appointments, the Minister of the day shall consult the chairperson of the board in relation to the expertise that is required on the board.  In addition, the Minister shall have regard to any guidelines prepared by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of appointments to the boards of State bodies.  Section 11 sets out the standard conditions of office for board members.  Sections 12 and 13 are also standard provisions dealing with board vacancies, meetings and procedures.  The Bill allows for the establishment of committees by the board to assist it in its work.  Again, this is standard.  Board members will operate on a <i>pro bono</i>basis unless a Minister decides otherwise.  Sections 16 and 17 deal with statements of strategy and annual reports by the board.<br/><br/>Part 4 of the Bill covers a number of staffing issues.  Section 18 sets out the role of the chief executive officer.  Sections 19 and 20 deal with staffing and superannuation.<br/><br/>Part 5 deals with the accounts and finances of the National Concert Hall.  Section 25 enables the National Concert Hall to borrow subject to certain conditions.  Section 26 is a standard provision concerning the preparation of accounts by the National Concert Hall and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Section 28 deals with the powers of the National Concert Hall to establish subsidiaries, partnerships or other corporate vehicles.  The section can be seen in the context of my approach to this Bill generally.  I have tried to be enabling in order to ensure that the National Concert Hall can operate across both the commercial and public sector.<br/><br/>Section 28 concerns the balance between enabling the National Concert Hall and putting in place the appropriate safeguards.  Section 29 sets out the requirements surrounding gifts to the National Concert Hall.  Part 6 of the Bill sets out the transitional provisions that are necessary for the conversion of the National Concert Hall company into the statutory body National Concert Hall.  Part 7 of the Bill gives effect to the change of name of the Irish Film Board.  The changing of the name to Screen Ireland or F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann will reflect the broader remit of the agency as the promoter of the Irish film, television and animation sector.  I am very positive about the future of the National Concert Hall, and I view this legislation as an important step forward in achieving this aim.<br/><br/>I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the Seanad and I look forward to hearing the contributions throughout Second Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-03a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015110300002#GG00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  The Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, of which I am fortunate to be a member, and the pre-legislative debate gave us an opportunity to understand precisely how the Bill would help the National Concert Hall.  We had a number of public hearings which allowed us to meet and discuss with a number of stakeholders the reason the Bill was necessary.  The chair of the National Concert Hall appeared before the committee and spoke about balancing the public interest of the National Concert Hall with the commercial challenges.  He provided figures to the committee for 2013 which showed that more than &euro;4 million was generated by the National Concert Hall and about &euro;2 million came from State funds.  That is about two to one, which seems to be a good balance.  It has had a very good track record since its establishment in Earlsfort Terrace in 1981, having been in operation for more than three decades.  That it can run up to a thousand events each year is a considerable achievement, and it has more than 300,000 visitors coming through its doors.  It is clear that its programme caters for a broad range of tastes, which is precisely as it should be.  It gives up-and-coming artists and groups the opportunity to perform in such a prestigious venue.  There is no doubt that having that on a CV and as an experience is certainly a boost as one develops one's own cultural work.</p> <p>The Minister has outlined well the importance of culture in the life of society and the life of the nation.  The actual amount generated by the National Concert Hall for the economy is almost &euro;38 million annually, if I have calculated correctly.  That is a huge contribution to the community and the immediate environment.  It is important to try to help those artists who have yet to make their way in the world of art or the world of entertainment by keeping the rates low, because it is an ideal opportunity for them, particularly since the National Concert Hall will be a statutory body and in law will have the same recognition as all the other cultural institutions.  It is State-funded to the extent of a third of what it costs to run, based on 2013 figures.  It made the point that it sees itself as a leader on behalf of other less well resourced cultural bodies.  Often, it sets the tone and the standard and creates the profile and the publicity.  Its role is even greater than what it actually puts on stage, and it can be seen as an advocate for culture and the arts in general.  That it will be a statutory body will add to its standing.</p> <p>The Bill is important in terms of negotiating with other people in the area of fund raising, and it brings with it a mandate.  All of that is exceptionally important, and I am sure the fingerprint of the National Concert Hall is on the Bill.  I do not think there should be that great division when a certain amount of evolution is taking place in the arts or culture.  In this particular case, we all work together.  On the other hand, the independence issue is important also.  The Bill does not in any way harm that independence; in fact, it is the opposite.  Given that it will be a company, it would be wrong for all kinds of reasons if it did not have to report back to the Minister and, through the Minister, back to the Oireachtas.  First, it is working in our name, and second, it has a standing in law and, above all, because of the funding provided by the State.  Far more important, however, is the fact that we should always show an interest in the operation of the cultural institutions.  We should not just say they are out there.  That is why I am pleased that we are having a debate on culture and the arts.  We have had good debates in the past.  In that context, we should feel free not to be seen in any way as being hypocritical against anybody or against the National Concert Hall, but we should have a sense of partnership and motivation which should form part of the relationship between us.</p> <p>On the broader issue, which is not for the main debate, of the many cuts the Minister has inherited - and we would wish it were otherwise - there is no doubt that budget cuts of 30% or 40% over a four- or five-year period cause damage.  It is not just a matter of cutting salaries or not engaging people when a vacancy arises.  It is none of that.  The whole morale suffers and becomes threatened.  I ask the Minister to ensure that as momentum gathers and there is new growth in the economy the arts is not way down the priority list.  I suggest that arts and the economy should run parallel.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is because at the end of the day the public relations, tourism and morale aspects of culture and arts in the life of the nation are so great that we cannot put a financial value on it.  I trust the Minister will make the case for culture and the arts, not only in respect of the Arts Council but for all the bodies at local, regional and national level.  Many bodies have an international remit as well.  We never want to see them having to do something to the point whereby they come across as impoverished.  When people travel abroad, whether to China or Japan or wherever, they can see the venues and funding at the disposal of those countries.  I am not saying we can compete with all that, but it is important when we have something that is good, intrinsic, rich unique and exclusive to ourselves.  It is like with a gift in that we need to be able to parcel it properly.  Funding is always needed.</p><p>I attended the Wexford opera festival last Sunday night and the number of volunteer helpers at the front of house was most impressive.  In the case of The Helix in Dublin, those responsible insisted there would be volunteers at the front from day one.  The importance is not only in the savings but also in that a volunteer can have a very passionate feeling for something and are able to transmit that feeling when talking to a patron.  They go out of their way to meet patrons.  Volunteerism must be acknowledged and recognised.</p><p>Above all else, it is important we ensure we embrace the arts through education at all stages.  As we know, there is a charter for arts in education.  I hope that too will be as it should be in future.</p><p>I compliment the Minister and the Department on bringing the Bill before the House.  It is the right step at the right time.  We need more of this type of development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-03a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1165" speakername="Eamonn Coghlan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015110300002#HH00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  Like Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I am delighted to speak on this legislation.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it to the House.  As the Minister said, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the conversion of the National Concert Hall from a company limited by guarantee into a statutory body.  Various sections outline the functions of the National Concert Hall, its accountability and the corporate governance structure, which is in line with public sector reform generally relating to the corporate governance arrangements of our national cultural institutions.</p> <p>Much hard work has gone into the composition of the Bill, including a review of the corporate governance of the National Concert Hall commissioned by the Department in February 2014.  In addition, pre-legislative scrutiny was carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  This involved public hearings with the relevant stakeholders.  The Bill provides for appropriate reporting to the Minister and the Oireachtas.  It will streamline the accounting process and give it a statutory basis.  Section 7 sets out the functions of the National Concert Hall, which will be the national venue for musical, creative, artistic and cultural activities.</p> <p>The National Concert Hall is a fantastic venue to showcase our rich musical heritage.  Other functions include the promotion of music in the public interest as an integral part of Irish life.  This is an important role since music and the arts enrich our society at home and by attracting visitors from overseas.</p> <p>Section 8 provides that the National Concert Hall shall be independent in the exercise of its functions subject only to general policy guidelines issued by the Minister to all national cultural institutions.  I believe it is important to have independence in decision-making.</p> <p>Music and the arts play an important role in our lives and in society.  Music reaches out, transcends all walks of life and demonstrates strong social inclusion.  Participation in music and the arts by children is one of the most important fundamental skills we can instil in their young lives.  The National Concert Hall plays an important role in education.  I know many young children who have performed there over the years as part of school choirs and I know what a big thrill this has been in their lives.  Participation in such a prestigious venue improves their self-confidence, self-esteem and interpersonal skills.  It builds positive attitudes in their lives.</p> <p>I acknowledge the contribution of the National Concert Hall in the area of health care by enriching the care of people with long-term illnesses or other conditions.  There are opportunities for learning through music for people with special needs and there are ongoing programmes in all the children's hospitals as well as the LauraLynn children's hospice.  I am pleased that the role of the National Concert Hall is not restricted to hosting concerts alone.</p> <p>As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; indicated, the National Concert Hall has been located in Earlsfort Terrace since its opening in 1981.  It has a 1,200 seat auditorium.  Last year, almost 330,000 visitors attended some 900 events held there.  It derives most of its income from its commercial activities.  The turnover according to the latest accounts was &euro;6.8 million, enabling the company to break even, with State funding only amounting to one third of the total income.</p> <p>The Bill will enshrine the National Concert Hall as a cultural asset of national importance nationally and internationally.  Events held in the National Concert Hall cater for all genres, including classical, opera, jazz, musicals and even popular music.  It hosts many international competitions of great importance such as the Veronica Dunne International Singing Competition, which attracts visitors from all over the world.</p> <p>The National Concert Hall is growing and developing the range of concerts and events on offer, from the international concert series to chamber music and traditional music, one example of which is Tradition Now in conjunction with the St. Patrick's Festival.  In addition, Perspectives offers leading artists from across the spectrum the opportunity to perform to packed audiences.  These artists include The Gloaming, Phil Glass, Bryan Ferry and the great flautist, James Galway.  These were some of my favourites from last year.</p> <p>I am pleased with the ongoing refurbishment of the Kevin Barry rooms into a 130 seat multi-purpose performance space by 2016.  In addition, refurbishment is ongoing in the main auditorium while the old medical library will be a new 500-seat recital hall.  There will be a jazz club, rehearsal spaces, recording studios and creative incubation spaces.</p> <p>I welcome the role the National Concert Hall will play in the Government's 2016 programme.  There will be a series of seven signature concerts over seven days during Easter Week 2016 around the theme of the Proclamation.  The National Concert Hall is a critical part of Dublin's tourism network, attracting visitors and boosting the local economy.</p> <p>I draw the attention of the Minister to some issues regarding the National Concert Hall.  The Minister noted the turnover from the last accounts and said the company broke even to the tune of &euro;6.8 million with a one third contribution from the Government.  My understanding is that the numbers on the doors are down this year and there is a projected loss of more than &euro;200,000.  Is this being addressed at the moment?</p> <p>There are also indications that 80% of the concerts at the National Concert Hall are promoted by commercial promoters.  This means only 20% are being promoted by the National Concert Hall itself.  Is anything being done to ensure the National Concert Hall will be proactive with its promotions?  The geographical area most catered for by the National Concert Hall is the greater Dublin area.  Are there any plans to extend its availability nationwide from Donegal down to Kerry and everywhere in between?  I note that the current chief executive is due to step down in September 2016.  When will the search for the new chief executive begin?  What human resources process will be in place to interview potential candidates?</p></speech>

It provides for the conversion of the National Concert Hall company from a company limited by guarantee into a statutory body to be called the National Concert Hall.  The measures outline the functions of the body, the role of the board, general governance issues and the necessary commercial freedoms required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill provides us with an opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the National Concert Hall as a national asset of the people of this State.  It will operate as the national venue for the performance, appreciation and enjoyment of musical, creative, artistic and cultural activities, including the promotion of concerts and recitals of artistic, educational and cultural value.  We acknowledge the considerable potential the entity holds as a venue to further develop an interest in and appreciation of the arts and generate increased revenue.<br/><br/>Until recently, National Concert Hall funding was sourced primarily from ticket sales, with some 70% of total income coming from the purchase of tickets by members of the public attending performances and events.  That is an encouraging signal of the value the public places on the concert hall and of people's appetite for the arts.  More than 300,000 visitors experience over 1,000 events annually, as outlined by previous speakers.  The Government proposes to secure the future of the concert hall by placing it on a statutory footing similar to that of other national cultural institutions.  While it may reasonably be expected that the State will continue to provide key funding to support the National Concert Hall in its delivery of its public service remit, we understand the likelihood is that the institution will continue to be funded mainly from income generated from its own activities, such as ticket sales and its hiring out as a venue.<br/><br/>We need a national cultural and arts strategy that matches the level of interest that exists among the public.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in urge that the national cultural institutions be better used as a resource by the State.  We need a strategy that recognises that a competitive creative industry sector is vital to the prosperity of the State and acknowledges that a creative nation is a productive nation.  In times of recession, we should not allow the arts to be viewed as a luxury activity.  Unfortunately, when pitted against funding of other sectors in an either-or manner, the arts often take the brunt.  We have a long and rich history of support for arts and culture in this country, which has enabled our artistic and cultural communities to prosper.  Arts and culture enrich our society and reflect our national identity.  They are at the core of our burgeoning creative industry sector, which encompasses music, the performing arts, film, television and radio, advertising and marketing, software development and interactive content, writing, publishing and print media, and architecture, design and visual arts.  We must develop a strategy that supports our creative businesses and talent wherever they are located, to enable them to develop and compete globally.  The arts should be accessible and available to all sectors of society and should embrace every type of citizen.  Schools, old age pensioners, disadvantaged communities and children with disabilities should all have an equal opportunity in accessing the arts.  A long-term vision for the development of the arts is necessary in order to make that happen.<br/><br/>Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; chomh maith gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh polasa&iacute; Gaeilge ag an St&aacute;t ionas go dtabharfar t&uacute;s &aacute;ite don Ghaeilge sna hionaid cult&uacute;rtha ar fad sa t&iacute;r seo.

Unfortunately, the value of the arts can often be sidelined, especially in the current economic climate in which so many sectors face cutbacks.  The struggle is evident in the fact that it is so hard to earn a living as an artist, and incomes are often supplemented by other means.  Many leading artists aged over 50 are not in a position to feel secure about their future.  Brilliant minds fall by the wayside all too easily for lack of support.  There is little facility to support older people as they progress their skills.  Our younger artists, meanwhile, are going elsewhere, while the question arises as to where our mid-career artists might be.  What are we doing to capture the young talent that exists in Ireland and to retain and support it?  We need to halt the talent brain drain from this State to other shores.  Young people in the arts have considerable potential to contribute revenue for the State.  We must take steps to halt the mass export of our young talent and find a way to sustain them through long-term models.  There are examples of this in other European countries.  Artists are our thinkers and activists, but this often is not appreciated or understood.  Finding a way to position artists in such a way that we ensure they are valued is critical.<br/><br/>The focus of the current board of the National Concert Hall remains on the proposed transition from company to statutory body while maintaining the highest standards of musical performance for the enjoyment of the public.  This process allows the concert hall an opportunity to work in partnership with the Government to maximise the transformation of the hall and site into a world-class centre of musical excellence.  Once the process is completed, a new strategy and business plan will be developed, as we have heard.  Concerns have been expressed as to why the possibility of making the National Concert Hall a semi-state body with a commercial remit was not considered.  There are concerns, too, about the control the Minister will have over the body under the proposed model and the role of departmental officials in deciding the policy that is implemented.<br/><br/>I have concerns regarding section 18(9), which proposes to gag the chief executive officer from making any critical statement.  The section states: &quot;In the performance of the duties of chief executive officer under <i>subsection (8)</i>, the chief executive officer shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&quot;  I am concerned about the imposition of such a gagging provision on the CEO of any cultural institution in the State.<br/><br/>I conclude by welcoming the provision in section 23(1), which may be of particular interest to Senators.  This subsection puts an end to double-jobbing by persons who are elected to the Seanad or other democratically elected positions whereby they could previously act in two roles at the same time and be paid by the State for both of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-03a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015110300002#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She has been here several times recently, which is good.  Any legislation that strengthens the role of one of our cultural institutions and makes it more accountable is to be welcomed.  Members of the public often complain that State organisations are not accountable.  These proposals represent a good step forward in addressing that issue.  While the independence of the National Concert Hall will continue to be recognised and upheld - it could not function if it were not, in a curatorial fashion, independent - it will now be accountable in respect of its funding and having members of its board brought before Oireachtas committees.  In addition, the body will be subject to freedom of information provisions and its accounts will be brought under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These are important provisions in the current climate.</p> <p>I do not expect there will be or could be any opposition to the legislation before us today.  We in this House always like to take the opportunity to confirm the importance of our country's cultural life and heritage.  There is a tendency to assume that the economy - as in the mantra "It's the economy, stupid" - is of most concern to people, but the reality is that our cultural life is incredibly important to people in this country.  It is in our DNA in a way I am not sure it is in every country, in so far as it relates to our capacity to articulate ourselves and our vision of the world.  It is a very Irish thing.  In that context, I would like to see as much assistance as can be given being afforded to all our cultural institutions.  I congratulate the Minister on having secured additional funding.  I hope our cultural institutions and our cultural life in general will continue to be supported by the Government at all times.</p> <p>The American ambassador, Mr. Kevin O'Malley, spoke at the opening of the Web Summit about the importance of the cultural relationship between our two countries.  Indeed, he has been to the fore in trying to encourage creative dialogue between our two countries.  He was in Sligo two weekends ago to attend a debate with the musician Rufus Wainwright, who was performing there, which was organised in collaboration with the American Embassy.  The ambassador is keen to open up a dialogue between artists in the United States and their counterparts here across the cultural spectrum.  That is a good way for our two countries to discover things we have in common.</p> <p>It is interesting to consider the history of the National Concert Hall, which is as old as William Butler Yeats.  The building was originally constructed to celebrate the International Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures in Dublin in 1865.  Most of the building was taken down in the late 19th century because it was too expensive to run it.  It was dismantled and taken to London, where it was rebuilt as the Albert Palace.  When the original concert hall opened in May 1865, its purpose was to celebrate the visual arts in particular, but also industrial products.  It has always had a heritage built around culture and, latterly, as part of UCD, it has also had an educational remit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Susan O'Keeffe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2366"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2366&amp;amp;pid=SusanOKeeffe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the real needs of the concert hall is its outreach programme.  It plays a strong role in schools and in the area of health, which I was not aware of.  Outreach programmes are notoriously expensive and are difficult to keep going.  The National Concert Hall has a programme of music in children's hospitals such as Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Beaumont.  These are the sort of programmes that we want to see being continued.  They are particularly important in the area of dementia and Alzheimer's and allow music into the lives of a broad range of people.  People often believe that the National Concert Hall is a place exclusively for concerts.  The outreach programme will need funding in the future if it is to work with schools, teachers, students and musicians.  This is where we can foster and grow the musicians of the future.  It is important that the National Concert Hall continues its role of working with communities, particularly with its community choir and working with older people and their orchestra.  These are the matters that people forget about.  They think of the facade of the National Concert Hall and the great performances that take place there.  In this year of Yeats, 2015, two wonderful events took place in September - Beautiful Lofty Things, led by the historian, writer and lover of Yeats, Roy Foster and the following evening, Blood and the Moon, a whole series of new musical pieces inspired by Yeats.  I thank the staff and the team at the National Concert Hall for affording us the opportunity to celebrate Yeats there.  That shows its capacity to have a broad range of musical interests celebrated at the concert hall.  It is not just exclusive music; it tries to provide for the tastes of all kinds of people.  </p><p>Senator Coghlan talked about the idea of the National Concert Hall being taken around the State.  I support that but I wonder how it might happen.  We have enjoyed reaching out to the National Gallery and the National Library through the Yeats activities in Sligo in the last number of years.  That has been very successful.  The Abbey Theatre has also been a partner with us on Yeats day over the last few years.  We have not thought of how we might do it with the National Concert Hall.  I suspect it might be possible through some of the outreach programmes.

Perhaps Leitrim also.</p><p>Part of the reason why we wanted to encourage the national institutions to hold hands, as it were, with Sligo through the Yeats piece was to make sure that people who do not get the chance to travel to our national institutions, because they do not have the time or money, have the chance to understand that these are our national institutions and that we have a share in all of those.  That is something that we could bring back to the National Concert Hall.</p><p>I acknowledge the work done by the committee before this legislation was drawn up.  The Minister has acknowledged that one of the changes that has occurred during the lifetime of this Government is that committees engage more at the pre-legislative stage.  The Minister has acknowledged the work that was done and the help that it gave her and her officials and it should be noted that this is something that should and will continue and can be strengthened.  It is important that members of the public see that the democratic process and the way we do our business in this House, while not always perfect, we have found some ways to improve it and this is one of those ways.  This is a smaller Bill, but as Senator &Oacute; Mhurch&uacute; has said, it allowed for matters to be teased out and for expert witnesses to come in and give advice to the committee, which the committee could then transfer to the Minister and her officials.  I thank the Minister for bringing this legislation and thank her for her time.  </p></speech>

It gives a sense of recognition to the National Concert Hall.  The National Concert Hall is a source of pride for everybody.  I am old enough to remember the debates that took place before it was decided to develop Earlsfort Terrace.  They were going to build a completely new concert hall on Northumberland Road.  Eventually it settled on Earlsfort Terrace and I am glad that it did.  I have been there many times and the variety, to which tribute has been paid already, is quite astonishing.  I was there for the New Orleans jazz from the Preservation Hall Jazz Band where at the end they did a funeral march and led the entire audience out onto Earlsfort Terrace and back into the hall in a conga line.  It was wonderful.  I have been there for Rachmaninoff's piano concertos and for the magisterial series of Beethoven's piano concertos given by that great artist, John O'Conor.  I have also performed there myself.  I was on stage with Anne Bushnell.  I took part in her wonderful Judy Garland show.  I wonder if I am gay at all because I had never heard of Judy Garland until I did that show.  I have also comp&egrave;red concerts there.  It is a wonderful facility of which everyone should be proud.  I was interested in the positive numbers presented by the Minister.  It is very like the James Joyce Centre and I look forward to seeing the Minister there once again.  Our figures are equally good.  We have made remarkable progress in developing that and we also generate twice as much income as we receive from the State.  We are grateful for what we get from the State.</p><p>I have a number of queries on the Bill which I read with great interest.  The first is on section 5 which says &quot;the National Concert Hall (in this Act referred to as the 'NCH'), situated, for the time being&quot;.  That is a curious phrase; it is as if perhaps they were going to take up Senator O'Keeffe's suggestion that it be transferred to Sligo brick by brick.</p></speech>

Is there any uncertainty about it?</p><p>Then there is the question of the seal, which is an interesting one.  Does a seal exist at the moment?  As a question of design, it would be very interesting for a young Irish artist to design a seal.  I would like to know a little bit about the seal.  </p><p>I really like section 7, which outlines the principal functions of the National Concert Hall, which are &quot;to provide and operate, having regard to international standards and good practice, the national venue for the performance, appreciation and enjoyment of musical, creative, artistic and cultural activities including the promotion of concerts and recitals of artistic, educational and cultural value&quot;.  I will not read the whole thing.  It is essential, clear and positive.  </p><p>I have some worries about Part 3 on the board of the National Concert Hall.  The Minister has spoken about the independence of the National Concert Hall but there are very strong powers given to the Minister.  I think they are too strong.  Section 10 says &quot;The NCH shall have a Board consisting of a chairperson and 8 ordinary members appointed by the Minister&quot; and &quot;The Minister shall designate one member of the Board to be the chairperson.&quot;  The Minister is, in a sense, the dictator of the concert hall and that worries me.  Section 10(7) says &quot;Ordinary members who are to hold office for the periods specified in <i>subsection (6) </i>shall be selected by lot to be drawn in such manner as may be determined by the Minister.&quot;  The Minister even determines the way they will draw lots.  That is a hell of a lot of power.  </p><p>Moving on to section 11, &quot;The Minister may at any time remove from office a member of the Board if (a) in the opinion of the Minister, the member has become incapable through ill health of performing his or her functions&quot;.  Hello.  What qualification does the Minister have?  Surely that decision should be made by his or her doctor.  What medical qualifications does the Minister have?  There may well be a situation where there is a coincidence and the Minister at the time is a medical doctor but I do not see why the Minister should have that power.  The Minister already has the right to remove members of the board for any reason at all.  If she thinks they are unsuitable she can get rid of them.  Why this business about their health?  I do not think the Minister has any role in determining the health of a member of the board.  I will return to this a little bit later.</p><p>Section 10 says &quot;The Minister shall have regard to any guidelines prepared by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to appointments to boards of State bodies.&quot;  Why?  What on earth has Deputy Howlin got to do with the National Concert Hall?  It is about money but why should he have the same power in regard to appointments?  The Abbey Theatre was vitiated for a number of years by the intervention of the Government.  Subsection (<i>6</i>) says, &quot;The persons first appointed as ordinary members shall hold office as follows: (a) 3 members for a term of 3 years; (b) 3 members for a term of 4 years; (c) 2 members for a term of 5 years.&quot;<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not see why it is necessary.  I do not understand the mathematics of it.  Is it to provide some kind of continuing governorship?  I do not know.<br/><br/>Certain people are excluded from governorship of the board.  They are excluded if they make a composition or arrangement with creditors.  Many very artistic people get into trouble and go bust.  They have major commitments to putting on shows.  Making a composition or arrangement with creditors is very different from any kind of criminal activity, for which they should rightly be excluded.  I do not see why going bust, making a composition or agreement with creditors should exclude a person.  I do not understand it.  Although it is standard practice in boards, this does not mean we should not challenge these issues in the Seanad.<br/><br/>Regarding expenses of board members, the Bill states: &quot;No remuneration, other than the expenses referred to in subsection (2), shall be payable to the chairperson or an ordinary member of the Board or to a member of a committee of the Board except where the Minister, with the consent of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, determines otherwise.&quot;  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is popping up again.  I worry about it.<br/><br/>The Minister and others spoke about making a statement of strategy, and it is very much to be welcomed.  The Bill writes off Members of the Seanad.  It is a tradition that has always exercised me and I will table an amendment to delete it.  Why should Seanad Members not serve on the board of the National Concert Hall?  We are appointed on a vocational basis.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; speaks on traditional Irish music and cultural matters.  He would be an adornment to the board of the National Concert Hall.  It is not about payment, given that they are unpaid.  It is an outrage and is ridiculous.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell would be another excellent person whom I would like to see on the board of the National Concert Hall and I see no reason that she, or people like her, should be prevented from serving in such a way.<br/><br/>The provision whereby the chief executive officer is responsible to the Oireachtas committees is good.  I must address a <i>non sequitur</i>in the second last paragraph of the Minister's speech in which she said:</p><blockquote>Part 7 of the Bill gives effect to the change of name of the Irish Film Board.  The changing of the name to Screen Ireland or F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann will reflect the broader remit of the agency as the promoter of the Irish film, television and animation sector.  I am very positive about the future of the National Concert Hall.</blockquote><p>We went a bit off track there.  It is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>.  While I understand that miscellaneous provisions are put in as a means of tidying up, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the National Concert Hall, as far as I can see.  Maybe I am missing something.  I do not like untidy legislation.  I like it to be compact and all of a piece.<br/><br/>By and large, I welcome the Bill.  It gives recognition to one of our valuable cultural institutions.  I commend the Minister on bringing it forward.  However, I am concerned about the degree of ministerial power involved.  The current Minister is not a tyrant, but is the most delightful and intelligent women.  However, it lays up the possibility of people behaving in a tyrannical way.  I do not like the intervention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform at all.  The Bill states that remuneration can be paid with the permission of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would like to see people squeezing money out of that particular Martin Chuzzlewit.  I am very actively concerned about the exclusion of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, including people who are nominated on the cultural and educational panel.  We must allow Seanad Members to be on the board of the National Concert Hall.</p></speech>

Given what happened a few boards later, they should bring us back.  I was on the board in the early 1990s and into the 2000s.  I was the only dissenting voice on a board of 15 members against the National Concert Hall moving.  At that time, there was the beginning of the sloshing around of money.  We were going to move from Fenian Street to a green field site.

There was a tremendous urgency about it, like when Dublin City University became a university in the late 1980s.  We had a great outreach programme, which other cultural institutes might look to.  We were the first board to get the National Symphony Orchestra to get into buses, trains and cars and go to places such as Sligo, Mayo and Galway.  It is not easy to move a symphony orchestra, but we did it, and the orchestra brought its great music all over Ireland.</p><p>Thomas Moore said:</p><blockquote>Music, oh, how faint, how weak, <br /><br />Language fades before thy spell! </blockquote> <p>The only time when my savage breast, or beast in me, is soothed is through music.  We could talk artistically until the cows come home, which is one of the reasons the Bill was an easy jaunt.  It does not discuss creativity, imagination, the arts or performance.  It discusses governance and structure, and rightly so.  Well done to the Minister because without imposing governance, structure and a strategic plan on a statutory body, the artistry will not happen.  It is not an artistic Bill.  We can talk all the artistry we like.  It is a platform for great artistry, entertainment and development from the young musician to the greats and for music for all ages, sizes and ears.  It is not exclusive, and this is the great thing about it.  It was an easy jaunt through this, and I am delighted about it and welcome it.</p><p>I read Brigid McManus's well written and excellent report on the governance structures of the National Concert Hall, which the Bill is about, without taking away the artistic independence or the independence of the CEO or board.  I agree with Senator Norris that the board members should be artistically and creatively skilled, imaginative and talented and with a proven record and mix, and should not be political appointees or appointed on the basis of &quot;I knew Dan, who knew Joe&quot;.  I like the idea very much.  It is very important.  It is also very important to have board members with backgrounds in accountancy, human resources and commerce, who can see ways forward when things get tough and money is tight.  Well done on that.</p><p>I agree with Senator Norris about Seanad Members, although people think one is double jobbing and getting all the goodies, and that it is somebody else's time.  I am not sure about it.  While we have the privilege of being in the Seanad, we can be the conduit for the National Concert Hall and do not necessarily have to sit on the board.  I commend the Minister.  It is very good, and is an easy jaunt, creating governance and some kind of structure, which obviously fell apart during the past four years not under the watch of this or the previous Minister, but under its own lack of watch in the National Concert Hall.</p></speech>

Some interesting issues were raised.  Regarding Senator O'Donnell's comments, this is a question of putting a proper governance structure in place.  That is important, as taxpayers' money is being invested in the National Concert Hall and it must be accountable to the taxpayer through the Minister and the Oireachtas, but it must also be allowed curatorial independence, which is at the core of the legislation.</p> <p>The National Concert Hall forms an important part of Irish cultural life, with thousands of visitors going through its doors every year.  It has worked hard to grow and develop the range of concerts and events that it offers to the public, providing audiences with concerts of artistic excellence and diversity while making a significant contribution to the country's cultural calendar.  To the end of September this year, the hall has held a broad and engaging programme of concerts and educational and outreach activities, with 738 events attracting some 222,000 visitors.  The hall's flagship international concert series brings the world's leading orchestras and classical artists to Irish audiences.  Chamber music continues to form a central part of the hall's programming while concerts by Irish and international musicians and a residency for the Vanburgh String Quartet are at the heart of the offering.</p> <p>The hall has prioritised investment in composers and musicians, which helps to support Irish artists and deliver new creative talent.  Projects have included Shaun Davey and Nuala N&iacute; Dhomhnaill's new song cycle, Nora Barnacle, which premiered on Bloom's Day, and Blood and the Moon, new songs based on Yeats's poetry to mark Yeats 2015, which premiered in September and involved Irish and international contemporary artists.</p> <p>A point was made about rising young stars.  Learn and Explore is Ms Bernadette Greevy's bursary for singers and was presented again in 2014, awarding a prize of &euro;4,000 towards furthering musical development.  Ms Gemma N&iacute; Bhriain was its winner.  The hall supported the Veronica Dunne international singing competition in January 2014.  It also presents a rising star award.  The hall hosts a wide range of concerts presented by an array of promoters from the commercial, cultural, educational and community sectors.  All of this adds to the hall's vibrant and significant contribution to Ireland's cultural life, cultural tourism and economy.</p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the 2016 centenary programme launched earlier this year is the centrepiece of the decade of centenaries and is a key priority for my Department.  I was delighted to secure more than &euro;48 million for this initiative and I look forward to working with communities at home and abroad to make next year memorable.  A great deal of money will be spent on major capital projects, including the National Concert Hall.  This will ensure a lasting legacy for the commemorations.  The Kevin Barry Room at the hall is being redeveloped.  It was the setting for a seminal moment in Irish history in December 1921 and January 1922, namely, the lengthy and momentous debates of the Second D&aacute;il following the signing in London by Michael Collins and his delegation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  The restoration project will see this space brought fully into public use as a flexible 130-seat performance area, complete with the necessary acoustic treatment and sound proofing.</p> <p>A point was made about the inclusion of the Irish Film Board in this legislation.  The board and the hall operate in the cultural arena under my auspices.  That is why I included it in the Bill.</p></speech>

It was the express wish of the board's former chair, the late Bill O'Herlihy, that its name should be changed.  I promised Bill two weeks before his untimely death that I would do this because it was the right thing to do.  I was pleased to have the opportunity to do so as part of this Bill.  The board's full current name - Irish Film Board-Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann - is considered outdated when used in the international arena.  The use of the word "film" in the title is considered limiting and the proposal to change the name to "Screen Ireland" or "F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann" will reflect the agency's broader remit for the promotion of Irish film, television and animation.  The board is supportive of this change and I am glad to have been able to include it in the Bill.</p> <p>I agree that the arts play an important role in our society.  I was pleased to secure a 12% increase in my Department's budget for 2016.  Further investment in the arts is necessary.  As the economy continues to improve, I will fight the case for increased funding.  The National Concert Hall will receive the same Exchequer allocation in 2016 as it did this year, which included an additional &euro;100,000 increase.  All cultural institutions will benefit from the additional funding that I secured for the 2016 commemoration programme.</p> <p>I wish to reassure the Senator that there is no gagging of the CEO.  It is a standard provision when the CEO appears before the Committee of Public Accounts that he or she cannot comment on Government policy.</p> <p>Culture 2025 is the first cultural policy that we have formulated.  I want it to imbed culture in the minds of the Government and the citizen alike.  It will make culture a part of our daily language and form a greater part of our daily lives.  Culture is intrinsically valuable to society and should be recognised as such.  Culture 2025 will address the issue of volunteers.</p> <p>The concert hall has a comprehensive outreach programme.  I agree with Senator O'Keeffe that we need to broaden the role of the national institutions generally so as to extend their offering into the regions.  Everything cannot be Dublin centric.  The offering needs to get out to the regions and more rural areas.</p> <p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan raised a number of issues.  The hall has adopted a broad programming strategy to address some of them.  Section 18(2) provides that the CEO will be appointed by the board with the approval of the Minister.  I want to be clear about appointments to the board under section 10, in that the Minister is not a dictator.  I am conscious of that.  Appointments to the board are done through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  People are invited to apply to sit on the board.  An independent panel will assess the applications and present a short list to the Minister, who will make the final decision.</p></speech>

This is a standard provision.  If Senators were on the board of the National Concert Hall and also serving in the Seanad there is a potential conflict of interest with regard to funding and policy.  Therefore, I believe it is prudent to retain this provision in the Bill.</p></speech>
