I wish to ask him about the levels of educational attainment among Travellers and specifically what is in place to address the stark figures that have been published.  I start by restating that the position for Travellers is dire when it comes to education and that action is urgently needed.  The same applies across the piece to health, housing and employment.  I wish to focus on education and employment.  </p>  <p>Less than two weeks ago, on 12 October, the CSO released the 2016 census data for Travellers.  Shockingly, they show that 60% of Travellers have received a primary education only.  Just 13% of Traveller women and girls have been educated to upper second level or above compared with 69% of the general population.  The figure that really stands out for me and which I feel is staggering is that 167 out of a total of 30,000 Travellers have a third level qualification.  These statistics are intrinsically linked with the rate of employment among Travellers, of whom 80% are listed as unemployed.  If one has not received or only received a primary education, if very few complete second level and only 167 have a third level qualification, it comes as little surprise that the rate of Traveller participation in the labour market is so low.</p> <p>Findings by the ESRI show that Traveller participation in the labour market increases sharply as levels of education attainment increases, rising from 9% among those with only a primary education to 57% among those with a further or higher education.  In the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes Traveller community national survey recently published, 85% of Travellers stated that unemployment among Travellers has got a lot worse or no better over the past five years.  This is so disappointing, particularly as in the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton's previous role, the creation of jobs in Ireland was one of the great success stories.  It is a real pity that many in this particular group of people, because of poor education, are also unemployed.</p> <p>Education is key to improving the employment and life outcomes for the Traveller population and I want to know what measures the Minister was working on or what new measures he will introduce to increase Traveller participation.  The State's track record on this issue is very poor.  As the Minister will be aware, in 2011 all addition educational supports aimed at Travellers specifically were eliminated.  The Travelling with Austerity report shows us that State spending on Traveller education fell by 86% between 2008 and 2013.  This should be compared to the overall reduction in Government spending of 4.3% over the same period.  I struggle to think of any other section of society that has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of resources.  It is a stain on the record of the previous Administration.  The cuts included abolishing the visiting teachers for Travellers posts, additional resource teachers and resource hours for Traveller children and closing specialised training centres for teenage and adult Travellers.</p> <p>The 1995 Report of the Task Force on The Travelling Community acknowledged that few initiatives in the area of Traveller education have been as successful as the appointment of visiting teachers, a scheme that was introduced in the bleak 1980s.  These visiting teachers worked across the generations, from adults to toddlers.  They had a range of roles, from providing support to encouraging attendance, acting as an advocate and ensuring progress from primary to secondary and beyond.  We need new initiatives similar to this to support the Traveller community through education.  Some 60% of Travellers are aged under 25.  The time for action to help these young Travellers is now.</p> <p>What are the current measures in place and can the Minister give an update on the education points included in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, which was published in July?  The strategy includes very specific education orientated actions.  In light of the CSO findings that the educational attainment among Travellers continues to lag very significantly behind that of the general population, I want to know what the Minister is doing now and any new measures he might propose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102500003#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Kelleher for raising this issue.  No doubt this is a challenging and complex area.  As the Senator will be aware, in June-July of this year the first National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy was published and the education committee within that has met in the intervening period.  The strategy involves, as the Senator stated, a number of important education elements.  At a general level, it proposes the need to support in areas including education, employment and economic development.</p>  <p>The Senator raised the issue of the extent the Traveller population has participated in the fall in unemployment from 15.1% to 6.1%, which is a dramatic improvement.  I do not have data on that.  The Intreo offices of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been very successful.  It was one of the successes under the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, that the work of the then Department of Social Protection was reoriented to help develop the unemployed to get into employment positions.  Long-term unemployment is now down to 3%.  We have been very successful in that area.  I do not know to what extent Travellers have benefitted from that change, but certainly the focus of that policy is to assist the unemployed in finding pathways back into work.</p>  <p>Another element was to ensure that the curriculum resources gave consideration to the culture and history of the Traveller and Roma population for use within the education settings and work is under way on that by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.</p>  <p>In the area of SOLAS and the ETBS planning for the needs of disadvantaged groups, including Travellers, that is very much a part of what is being done.  As the Senator can understand, with unemployment very high, there was a huge emphasis on delivering a scale of opportunities.  Now there is greater focus on identifying needs and pathways and ensuring that those programmes are of benefit.  The latest figures I have show that there are 500 persons who declare as Travellers who are in programmes such as VTOS and Youthreach, and those programmes have in the past reported very good impact.  We will be conducting a review of each of them shortly.  We will look specifically at their success in bringing along groups, such as the Traveller and Roma groups, and successfully finding pathways for them.</p>  <p>The other area was to focus, in particular, on attendance.  A two-year pilot programme is being initiated, mainly driven by Tusla, which is responsible for the home school liaison and the school completion policies.  That two-year pilot programme will target attendance and participation by Traveller and Roma children.  It will involve the appointment of additional home school liaison teachers and other supports to try to achieve high levels of attendance and completion.  As the Senator correctly stated, there is a real problem with the fall-away as Traveller children progress through the education system.  I attended the recent meeting that the former Taoiseach held in the context of the recognition of the ethnicity of the Traveller community and there was uniform support for education as being a key gateway.  This pilot programme has built on the work there and it will be very much embedded with the Traveller community to try and achieve a big step up in the participation.</p>  <p>Another element obviously is trying to address what the Senator correctly pointed out was a very poor level of third level participation, with only roughly 1% of the adult Traveller population having third level education.  Our performance framework for the higher education system has for the first time included an explicit target for enrolment of Traveller students.  Obviously, we will be looking to see if can we use the programmes that we have rolled out, which include particular college bursaries worth &euro;5,000 for 600 students from non-traditional backgrounds, as a gateway for Traveller students to come through.  We have, as the Senator will probably be aware, a call out to the higher education institutions at present to develop their access policies and we will be keen to see that there are explicit attempts by the third level sector to ensure that its access policies include Traveller student.</p>  <p>There is work in progress and there is new policy being developed, but I share the Senator's view that this is an area of very substantial challenge.  The figures for education progression are, as the Senator correctly states, dismal and they are ones that we have to address.  There is a determination in the committee that has been recently established in the education area to progress that.</p></speech>

Education is key.  The Minister correctly stated it is dismal.  I referred to the levels of participation right across the system, but particularly in third level.  The baseline is so low that we surely can raise our game.  It is good that there is a committee looking at it.</p>  <p>However, I was also looking at the measures in the strategy.  A network of peer support and mentoring is one of them.  That is a great idea, but what is happening?  The strategy includes good practice initiatives but again they are pilots.  These are all aspirational.  There are few concrete proposals here.</p>  <p>On school enrolment, are schools discriminating against Travellers?</p> <p>We have had some high profile cases.  I noted that No. 11 in the strategy states that a review will be published in early 2017.  I do not know if the review has been published.  If not, it would be helpful if the Minister came back to the Seanad in this guise, as a Commencement matter, or as part of our debates to consider this matter further.  This is a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102500004#C00300"><p>I agree.  The two-year pilot will be rolled out shortly.  I think it is in a position to go live very soon and it will involve Tusla.  It will enhance Tusla education welfare supports and additional home, school, community liaison co-ordinators, which we will fund.  In addition, it will also fund the Traveller community workers in pilot areas to work with Tusla staff where Traveller children are enrolled.  It focuses on the biggest thing, namely, retention within the school system.  If we cannot develop policies that work in that area, then we will not achieve anything.</p>  <p>The policy position is that Travellers not be educated separately.  It is an established policy that Travellers should be in mainstream education and not separated out.  The old system of visiting teachers and so on, which the Senator referred to, was a separate strain.  To be fair to the Department of Education and Skills, over those years the investment in resource teaching, which is designed to meet the needs of children who come to school with particular difficulties, has been increased by 50%.  We now have close to 14,000 teachers in resource teaching.  They are available to pupils, be they from a Traveller background or any other background, who exhibit particular difficulties in dealing with the education programmes.  That is a very substantial resource that has gone in.  Funding was increased by 50% even in those very difficult years.</p>  <p>It is hoped that this integrated model, if we can improve attendance, will mean that the resources are available within schools to address some of these needs.  That is why the focus has been on attendance, in particular.  Also, it is the first time that targets have been set for progression to third level.  We are trying to ensure that a coherent pathway is developed over time.</p>  <p>I note the Senator's concern.  I will ensure that reasonable progress reports are provided to the Oireachtas so that we can see how we are progressing in this area, which is rightly a matter of considerable concern.</p></speech>

I have come to the conclusion that while the all-party committee which is chaired by the Deputy Leader is sitting to deal with the issue and doing its business, following which a report will be presented to both Houses before the end of the year, I will not encourage and will disallow any debate on the matter.  It is also inappropriate for members of the committee to direct comments at each other in the Chamber and for others to defend such comments.  The committee should be allowed to do its work.  I have made that decision and hope it will be respected.</p>  <p>Some people made complaints against a certain Senator.  There is a mechanism for the making of complaints against Members of this or the other House.  It can be triggered if anybody feels he or she needs to so do.  It is not the job of the Cathaoirleach to referee on this issue and I do not intend to do so.  I expect the House to come on board and accept my decision.</p></speech>

Speaking at its annual conference in Limerick, Dr. Tom Ryan, president of the IHCA, said the evidence that we needed more acute hospital capacity was compelling.  Despite a growing and ageing population, more than 1,400 inpatient acute hospital beds were closed in the past decade.  The number of elective surgeries has declined by 50% in the past four years.  There has also been a persistent policy from the Government of rationing health care by the State as it has systematically decreased the number of inpatient beds in public hospitals.  Successive Governments have failed to address this issue in successive budgets and health capital plans.  This is the root cause of waiting lists and the treatment of patients on trolleys.  I have previously referred to the delays about which we hear about anecdotally, as well as to patients not receiving chemotherapy on time and the rationing of imaging scans in cancer treatment.  The Government promised 1,500 more nurses, but the reality is that only 13 of those positions will be filled.  There is a serious issue across the public sector in the recruitment and retention of State workers, specifically nurses and members of the Defence Forces.  We need to examine it seriously.  The State needs to consider how it will recruit and retain staff.</p>  <p>My second issue is leniency in sentencing.  It is stated on page 101 of the programme for Government that more serious legislation will be introduced to deal with those who abuse and groom children.  This issue is urgent and should be at the top of the agenda.  I respect the Judiciary and the discretion judges have.  They are given certain guidelines, but it is incumbent on the Government to act on the commitment given in the programme for Government and introduce more stringent legislation.</p>  <p>Another small item I would like to mention is flu jabs.  It is the time of year when we should all receive the flu vaccine which is made available to us in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is incumbent on us to lead by example and have the flu jab because the benefits outweigh the negatives.  Herd immunity to protect ourselves and others is vitally important.  I, therefore, urge everyone in the House to have the flu jab.</p></speech>

Teagasc's statement of strategy for the period 2017 to 2020 formed part of a briefing for Oireachtas Members today.  The briefing was very informative.  It is worth acknowledging the enormous support available, based on science, innovation and research in agriculture, forestry, horticulture and the food sector.  What was particularly important about the briefing was how Teagasc shared what was happening in its food innovation hub.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge, as Teagasc did this morning, the enormous support given by the Government to fund the food hub.  That is positive news and news that we should share.</p> <p>The next issue I wish to raise is not particularly good news for anyone who listened to "Morning Ireland" this morning.  Yesterday, the official bed count showed that 524 people were either on trolleys and, where no trolleys were available, the people were in wheelchairs.  The issue was discussed in great detail this morning on "Morning Ireland".  I ask the Deputy Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Health.  Senator Ardagh mentioned the 'flu jab.  The reality is we have no 'flu currently.  We have no' flu epidemic or major illness.  Our climate is pretty good for this time of the year so we have not seen a major demand placed on hospitals.  Last night, however, 524 people across this country were on trolleys or, as confirmed on the news, in chairs awaiting beds.  The situation is clearly unacceptable and is expected to worsen.  I am afraid that we will have to talk about this issue time and again.  </p> <p>Finally, I want to raise the issue of fast-track planning.  Last year, the Government referred to fast-track planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  We were assured, as part of this legislation, that people would have the capacity to lodge objections or observations on strategic planning applications with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I spoke to officials in An Bord Plean&aacute;la this morning and it was confirmed that the board was not in a position to receive applications online for critical infrastructure applications or even for appeals anywhere in the country because, as I was told, no legislation has been put in place to give effect to the promise in the legislation.  I ask the Deputy Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The option is a very important element.  The Minister gave a commitment to this House that critical technology would be put in place that would allow members of the public, and public representatives alike, to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Yet today the board has confirmed that it is not in a position, and cannot and will not accept submissions online.  That is not good enough.  The matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

First, I wish to refer to yesterday's sentence in the Tom Humphries case.  It has been pointed out today that this is not a unique issue just because of the high-profile nature.  There is a real issue with the sentencing that is being handed down, particularly to people who have been found guilty of sex offences.</p>  <p>Two years ago I introduced to this House the Sentencing Council Bill which sought to bring into practice in Ireland what has been the practice in England and Wales.  I refer to a system where a clear range of sentences is  provided to the Judiciary.  In those jurisdictions the majority of the councils are comprised of the judiciary but they are also representative of a range of stakeholders in English and Welsh society.  However, there is accountability when it comes to sentencing.  The judge in question must publish and explain the sentence that he or she has handed down.  Most importantly, there is consultation with the public on what is an acceptable sentence for a particular category of crime.  Clearly, a wide range of people believe that yesterday's sentence was not in keeping with the wishes of Irish society.  I want to again put my Bill forward.  It has been reintroduced by my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  I would like to see the Bill and the council advanced.</p></speech>

I am concerned about reference being made to a particular case because there is still a possibility that an appeal will be lodged by either the DPP or by the person in question.  I clearly understand where the Senator is coming from in terms of a discussion and introducing legislation.  That is permissible.  I would prefer if Members did not specifically refer to the case yesterday or whatever because the matter is out of our jurisdiction.  There may be an appeal, which could throw up a different result, lodged either by the DPP or the defendant.  The Senator can continue now but I urge him to be careful.</p></speech>

The Cockhill Celtic Football Club, which is a very senior football and community organisation in my part of the world, was devastated by the floods.  Two of its pitches were destroyed along with all kinds of amenities and the damage to the tune of hundreds of thousands of euro was done.  Even though the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Chief Whip were on the pitch within a few days, two months later the club has no idea if it will get any money or financial assistance from the Government.  It is completely unacceptable that a senior sporting organisation, that fields eight different teams and facilitates 300 young people in my community, has been devastated by the floods and left with no financial support from the Government and has received no clarification after two months.  </p>  <p>Swan Park in Buncrana is a vital amenity that was at the heart of my community.  It has been destroyed.  Again, there has been no clarification issued by the Government about whether funding will be provided.  The same applies to Glenevin Waterfall.  Potato and crop growers have had their lives destroyed and suffered financial losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of euro.  Again, the Government has not clarified what will happen.  We had a debate here last week but I heard no specific clarification regarding County Donegal even though I thought we were going to get one.  There was supposed to be an announcement made yesterday but, again, there has been no clarification about these issues.  </p>  <p>I wish to make it clear that I will continue to raise this issue until the communities that have been devastated in my area get the support that they need, be it the community or sporting amenities.  Such a situation would not be allowed to happen anywhere else in this State.  Now that the cameras have gone the people have been left behind.  There is no way a major sporting or community amenity in one town that has been destroyed should be left without a clarification, two months on, about where funding will come from.  </p>  <p>The Leader made promises the last time I raised this issue two weeks ago.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for a specific Minister to respond to me and tell me what will happen in terms of Cockhill Celtic Football Club, Swan Park and Glenevin Waterfall.  Please can I have a specific response to these issues.</p></speech>

It is essential that the message goes to the Government, and the Deputy Leader conveys it, that the SAVI II report, that has been awaited for over a decade, be delivered.  Research is long needed into the extent of sexual abuse and violence in Ireland and a report must be delivered.  Recently the Taoiseach has commented that the &euro;1 million for research, which is a paltry sum, has been redirected to legal aid for victims.  That measure adds insult to injury.  It should not be necessary to choose between legal aid and research to challenge the issue across the country.  It is not too much to ask that &euro;2 million is provided.  By that I mean the Government should give over &euro;1 million for legal aid and &euro;1 million for essential research on sexual violence, particularly as such research is long overdue and  promised for over a decade.</p>  <p>I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to expedite the return of the Domestic Violence Bill to this House.  The legislation is very much near completion.  It contains, as very clearly requested by this House, the specific crime of coercive control.  We have seen the horror of grooming in respect of young people.  Coercive control is a serious issue that affects many people in society and needs to be tackled.  I want us to have an opportunity to tackle it in this House before Christmas.</p>  <p>The main issue I want to highlight is the trial of 11 human rights defenders that began in Turkey today.  Ten of them were arrested following a human rights workshop organised by a group called IHOP.  The group brought together exactly what we need in society, the human rights advocates from an Islamic and feminist backgrounds and people who worked for LGBT rights equality.  The group facilitated dialogue between all of those interested in rights issues across Turkish society.  It reflected the diversity of that interest in Turkish society.  The 11 people have been arrested and detained on trumped-up charges.  I request that the Irish Government ensures that the Irish embassy observes and pays due attention to the trial.  I know that the embassy has a capacity to do so.</p> <p>I understand other European embassies have sent witnesses to observe the proceedings, and we should do the same.</p> <p>I accompanied a delegation of human rights advocates from Turkey to Leinster House last week.  While they were here, they learned that another of their colleagues had been arrested.  I sit on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe where I have seen colleagues discussing the arrest of fellow party members and parliamentarians.  Judges, too, are being arrested.  In fact, the Council of Europe awarded its highest honour, the V&aacute;clav Havel award, to a judge who was arrested.  The case of Idil Eser, director of Amnesty International in Turkey, has been much highlighted.  He is one of the 11 on trial today, along with others from the Turkish Women's Coalition, the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly and the Turkish Human Rights Association.  I note that the EU has withheld &euro;80 million in funding from Turkey in view of concerns regarding human rights issues.  How, then, can it justify the immigration control agreements signed with Turkey, let alone the similar agreements with Libya, Sudan and others?  Civil society is under threat on a global scale, as we saw with the attack in Malta, the arrest of civil society leaders in Catalonia and the clampdown on protest in Poland and Hungary.  I urge my fellow parliamentarians to take this issue very seriously.</p></speech>

Last July, I highlighted the delay in the construction of social housing and the absence of affordable schemes.  I understand Dublin City Council is trying to get around the problem and ensure social housing construction proceeds on some of its sites.  At the Poolbeg West strategic development zone, commonly known in the locality as the Irish Glass Bottle, IGB, site, the construction of 3,500 units was announced.  The planning scheme for the development has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but we still have no affordable housing or affordable rental accommodation at the site.  There is an enormous interest in affordable housing among people in my community in Ringsend and Sandymount.  Some of these people are living in local authority accommodation, which they would be willing to surrender if there was some certainty regarding affordable housing provision in the area.  There have been media reports since July that an affordable housing scheme would be announced within the next two weeks.  In September, <i>The Irish Times</i>again reported that a scheme would be rolled out in the next fortnight.  Potential users of any such scheme cannot make plans if they do not know whether they will qualify for affordable housing or the rental accommodation scheme, what costs will be involved and how they might qualify.</p><p>Will the Leader call the Minister to the House at the earliest convenience in order that he can clarify his thinking on this matter and outline the costs of affordable housing provision under a new Government scheme?  We need to know if it will be like the old Part V scheme where there was a 20 year clawback and a 30% to 35% discount on the purchase price.  There is growing frustration at the lack of clarity.  In the absence of information, people who hope to have the opportunity to purchase an affordable housing unit are stuck and cannot move on with their lives.  I look forward to having that debate with the Minister as soon as the Leader can arrange it.</p></speech>

This development is being described as the boomerang effect, with members of the Irish diaspora in Australia helping these companies with their plans to come to Ireland.  I understand up to 45 firms have expressed an interest in locating their business in the mid-west.  It is a most welcome development.</p></speech>

Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has played an important role in that organisation, from the pioneering work of the late Deputy Frank Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs, on nuclear non-proliferation to the efforts of Defence Forces personnel in the service of blue helmet peacekeeping since 1958, including in such challenging locations as the Middle East, the Congo and west and north Africa.</p>  <p>Sometimes, however, the UN gets it wrong.  Early last Saturday morning I read a headline proclaiming that Robert Mugabe had been named as goodwill ambassador by the UN's World Health Organization, WHO.  My first impression was that I must be reading an article on the Waterford Whispers News website or that it was some sort of sick joke.  In fact, it was true that the WHO's Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebyreyesus, had made the announcement, remarking as he did: "Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs [non-communicable diseases] for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritise NCDs."</p>  <p>Fortunately, the WHO has, in the light of international opposition, rowed back from the appointment.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was right to describe the news as "offensive and bizarre".  Mr. Mugabe is in the same league of extraordinary dictators as Castro and Pinochet, people who did not believe in the UN Charter and who rounded up opponents, shot them or had them disappeared because those opponents disagreed with the ideology of the day.  What possessed the WHO to do this given the atrocities Mugabe has inflicted on his own people, brutalising human rights activists and democratic dissidents?  This incident with Mugabe is a stain on the proud history of the UN and the World Health Organization and one that should never be revisited.</p></speech>

Few in this House can know what it is like to wake up in the morning and realise one is about to lose one's home.  I have actually been there, but it happened back in the days when I could walk in and negotiate with my bank manager.  I was fortunate that the bank I was dealing with, while taking my house, allowed me to walk away debt free and thus I was in a position to restart my life.  I had a call yesterday from a person who worked for one of the pillar banks.  I will not name the name the institution in question in deference to the Cathaoirleach.  The caller told me of a manager at the bank who delighted in seeing a tracker mortgage taken from a client, seeing it as a win for the bank.  What sort of attitude is that?  Most of the people I know working in banks are genuine, decent and hard-working people, but a thug like that needs to be brought to heel.  Likewise, the thugs who sit in the boardrooms of the banks of this country, who have stripped those banks of the managers who customers could talk to and cry with, need to be brought to heel.</p><p>My request to the Leader may seem somewhat crazy but the reality is that there is only one way to bring these fellows to heel and that is through the courts.  Of course, no family in unfortunate circumstances could afford to do that.  Why does the State not select a few of these cases and take them to court?  We are not just talking about malpractice in respect of tracker mortgages but also in regard to variable interest rates.  These people are not happy unless they take a person's blood.  God being good, I managed to rebuild my life after losing my home and, just a few weeks ago, made the last payment on my mortgage.  I decided to go into the bank and make the transaction in cash because it was the final payment due.  I thought surely there would be a red carpet out for me, a bottle of champagne and somebody to shake my hand.  There was none of that but I was presented with a charge of &euro;35 to get my deeds back.  What sort of God-damned people are these?</p><p>Will the Leader look into the situation of the crew of the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>who are currently serving in the Mediterranean and have not been given their overseas payments?  Their families are struggling, particularly those affected by Storm Ophelia.</p> <p>Perhaps the Leader will look into the issue for me today.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, come to the House to discuss pay and conditions for councillors who are struggling to maintain a livelihood.  We have lost many councillors recently owing to the heavy workload they face and the absence of proper pay.  The matter is with the Minister for Finance and I ask that he come to the House to discuss it.</p><p>I also ask that the Minister come to the House to discuss technician pay for Army cooks.  Army cooks were awarded technician pay but have not yet received it.  Apparently the issue is with the Minister.  I have been lobbying for some time on behalf of an individual in my local area who, unfortunately, passed away last week and was buried on Monday.  It grieves me that this man, who represented his country and struggled for so long, died without receiving proper pay.</p></speech>

We know from freedom of information records that have been released that there is a pattern whereby aeroplanes are flying from Shannon Airport to the capital cities of the so-called Saudi coalition, which has brought death and destruction to tens of thousands of people.  The Government has made us a part of this by turning a blind eye to what is happening at Shannon Airport.  I have asked the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue on numerous occasions.  It reminds me a little of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in that it is apparently coming but a slot for it has not yet been arranged.  I would welcome a debate on the US military's use of Shannon Airport. </p>  <p>I raise a specific episode which occurred on Sunday of last week.  I regularly attend protests at Shannon Airport and on the day in question I saw a peaceful protester knocked to the ground by garda&iacute;.  I then saw garda&iacute; drive up to the protest, inspect the protesters' vehicles, set up a roadblock on the main road out of Shannon Airport and single out the protesters by stopping their vehicles and inspecting their tax and insurance details.  They did not stop members of the public.  When one of our fellow protesters pulled in to see what the problem was, he was immediately issued with a fine for parking illegally on the motorway.  This incident amounted to nothing less than Garda harassment.  It was disgraceful and I hope no one in the Government will stand over it.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to explain the appalling behaviour of garda&iacute; in Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

We must examine all opportunities arising from Brexit.  The Taoiseach stated he is seeking associated membership for Ireland of La Francophonie, a group of French-speaking countries similar to the Commonwealth.  La Francophonie is a global organisation that deals with culture, science, economy, justice and peace.  Ireland is taking its place among the nations of the world, and by increasing our footprint in foreign affairs and doubling the number of Irish embassy staff, we are moving in a different world.  I say this because Brexit brings major opportunities and threats and we must work more closely with the United Kingdom.  We must also establish more links with Commonwealth countries also and we should not be afraid to do so through justice, science and peace building.  We have a shared history and it is incumbent on us to examine all these opportunities.</p>  <p>Not enough is being done by Senators and Deputies to forge relationships with members of the diaspora in Westminster who form an Irish caucus, as it were, and show great goodwill towards the island of Ireland.  Between 12 and 15 Senators and Deputies will travel to Westminster on Monday, 6 November, to meet the leaders of all the political groups in the UK, including the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson.  The group will be hosted by Tourism Ireland and other Irish organisations.  We must do much more of this type of work because we have neglected the relationship with the United Kingdom.  The Good Friday Agreement will be 20 years old next year and we should be brave and mature enough to start working on this relationship.  We need to do more to bring together Members of the Oireachtas and members of the diaspora in the House of Commons. </p>  <p>I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to ask for associate membership of La Francophonie.  It is a good idea.  We should not be afraid to examine the possibility of forging new associations with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, which is also a member of La Francophonie.</p></speech>

However, not one community group or organisation has had an application accepted under the scheme.  The current Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, indicated the funding is secure for the three-year period in question.  This year, all five applications made under the scheme have been returned to the groups concerned seeking further information.  This is unfair and disappointing.  There must be an issue with the scheme if only five applications for funding have been submitted.  A sum of &euro;3 million is available for the three-year period, yet only five applications for funding have been submitted.</p>  <p>One of the reasons the scheme is not working is that the Government will only fund 60% of the cost of a CCTV scheme, with the remainder to be provided by the applicant organisation.  This issue needs to be addressed and the scheme must be changed.  I call on the Minister to change the scheme because it is not working.  It could be used to monitor littering and anti-social behaviour, particularly in rural areas, if the criteria were changed.  Many rural groups, organisations and communities are not aware of the scheme.  A proper awareness raising campaign must be introduced and the scheme must be changed.</p></speech>

Several months ago, I and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, along with a number of other Senators, raised in the House what can only be described as the swindle taking place in the JobPath scheme.  I want the Minister to come to the House to answer some straightforward questions on the scheme.  For example, why will up to &euro;340 million be given to private companies over six years to exploit - that is the only word I can use - the most vulnerable people in our communities?  The scheme gives ownership of these people to the two private companies operating JobPath.  In 2017 alone, &euro;65 million was spent on the scheme, which is not working for individuals.</p>  <p>People are being required to bypass their local employment service and travel miles upon miles to centres where JobPath offices are located.</p> <p>JobPath offices then take complete ownership of the individuals and do not allow them to sign up for any other scheme or anything available to them in their area.  I want the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come to the House immediately to answer my questions.  What will be done tomorrow morning if the contract with the private companies is cut off?  What are the penalties?  Let us have some transparency regarding the original flawed contract which is subject to the height of secrecy.  What has been done with JobPath is a swindle; it is one of the greatest debacles of the decade and I thank my colleagues for exposing it today.</p></speech>

It concerns St. Mologa's school in Balbriggan and is affecting 463 children.  The school now has 16 prefabs.  The children have been in prefabs for years.  It is terrible to think that in 2017 children are cold at school during the winter and too hot in the summer.  They are on the list for a new school, but there is no firm date and no hard evidence that progress is being made.  I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills on the changes he introduced in the budget to the pupil-teacher ratio and in respect of students with special needs, but these very changes mean that the three extra teachers for the school this year - there will be four next year - will have no classrooms in which to teach the children who represent the future of the country.  In a republic of equal opportunities they deserve proper facilities in which to learn and enhance themselves and the country in the future.  I, therefore, ask that the Minister be invited to come to the House.  I am sure a request is being made to have a Commencement debate on the issue.  I will be very happy to share time with other Senators who have a similar interest in it, but it is up to the Cathaoirleach to decide.</p></speech>

As the Senator has raised the matter today, he may not do so again in a Commencement debate.  If he believes it would be appropriate to table a Commencement matter, he should await my decision.  I will allow him to conclude on the matter now.</p></speech>

I examined the matters presented to me this morning.  The Senator has raised this matter, as he is entitled to do, but he may not raise it today and again in the Commencement debate tomorrow.  If it was possible to do it, there would be duplication all over the place, but I will allow the Senator to continue.</p></speech>

Second, this is an issue that cannot be addressed properly during the course of the Order of Business but which can and deserves to be raised.  I hope the Cathaoirleach will reflect on this and extend to the people of Balbriggan, particularly its children, the courtesy of allowing the Minister to come to the House to answer on this very serious and pressing issue in a Commencement debate.</p></speech>

I refer, in particular, to comments made by two members of the Garda Representative Association, one from the Donegal division and the other from the Cavan-Monaghan division, in which they highlighted their concerns about Brexit and what might happen in the event that there was a hard border.  They were putting the Government on notice that the Garda did not have the numbers to provide an adequate policing service for the community as things stood, never mind in the even that there was a hard Brexit.  To highlight this point, they gave a couple of examples.  They referred to Clones, County Monaghan, which has a population of over 3,000 people.  All it has is one sergeant and two garda&iacute;.  Monaghan Garda station recently lost three members, or 10% of its entire workforce, and they have not been replaced.  The area from the Cavan border to the Armagh border which covers three counties is patrolled by one patrol car with two personnel on board, if we are lucky.  It includes Monaghan town, Clones and the entire countryside.  This clearly shows that there is a serious issue with Garda numbers in the Border counties.  I would like the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address it.  In addition, he might outline his plans in the event that there is a hard border.  What are his plans to strengthen the Garda force in the Cavan-Monaghan division, County Donegal and along the entire Border frontier?</p></speech>

It is not specifically about Garda numbers but about rural crime.  To be honest, I had no intention of raising the issue this morning until, about half an hour ago, I received a telephone call from a gentleman who lives within four miles of me at home.  He and his wife are both in their 70s.  They had a family SME all of their lives and employed at least four to five people, for whom they paid taxes, with their own.  Last Friday evening, when they came home having been shopping, they discovered that their business and house had been totally ransacked.  This morning the man in question was in tears on the telephone.  The couple are now prisoners in their own house.  He cannot leave the house unless his wife goes with him and she will not stay on her own.  As he said, he is a prisoner in his own house having contributed to society for a lifetime.  He also said the lack of policing in rural Ireland was the cause of the majority of the problems.  Nobody is aware of how rampant crime is in rural areas and how vulnerable and targeted those in the age group in question feel when in their homes.  They worked all their lives for them in order to have a little comfort in their retirement.</p>  <p>I do not know whether we would get all of the answers if the Minister was here.  We are recruiting extra garda&iacute; and investing extra resources, but it is a question of how the extra garda&iacute; and resources are being deployed.  There is no strategic policing code for rural areas, but there is a need for one, as opposed to a code for policing across the entire country.  Policing in urban areas is completely different from policing in rural areas, but this is not recognised.  Politicians on every side will say such a barracks was kept open.  Barracks in our area were kept open and everybody was taking credit for it.  There is a maximum of two garda&iacute; on duty at any one time and they are covering an area that was once covered by three or four barracks, each of which used to have four to six garda&iacute;.  That is the root of the problem.  The man who telephoned me was in tears and I practically was.  I had no intention of raising this issue in the House, but the man's conversation moved me to do so.  He is a genuine individual who is now, as he states, a prisoner in his own house.  Society should be ashamed.  We have to take some action to change it.</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Defence to come to the House to have a discussion on the future of the Defence Forces.  Yesterday Senator Gerard P. Craughwell outlined some very alarming statistics on the Order of Business.  I would specifically like to ask the Minister of State, in the light of and given the unknowns associated with Brexit, what plans he has for the Defence Forces and the security of the Border.  A number of years ago the most modern army barracks in Europe, D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Cavan town, were closed.  I have raised this issue continuously in the House.  We were told the barracks had been closed strategically to improve the quality of the Defence Forces.</p> <p>Almost the entire Border is being left without any Army personnel other than skeleton crews based in County Louth and in County Donegal because the personnel who are allegedly based in both of those barracks are not based in those barracks.  They are operating, some of them in this city and some of them in the Government Chief Whip's town of Athlone.  It is time we got real here.  Our Border is not being secured-----</p></speech>

I do not know whether we are going to stick to the rule that one issue is raised per person.  Certainly, there are plenty of issues today.</p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of waiting lists and lack of capacity.  Some &euro;75 million has been spent in this year's budget on this issue.  While I take the point the Senator is raising, and it is a serious issue, under the 2017 waiting list action plan the NTPF has advised that so far this year 11,797 patients have been authorised for treatment with more than 4,700 patients having accepted an offer of treatment, and over 2,000 of these patients having received their procedure.  On 1 October, funding of &euro;700,000 was allocated by the NTPF to roll out an endoscopy initiative for 2017.  Approval was given to the HSE on 25 September to drive a national waiting list validation project.  This funding will provide for dedicated capacity within the HSE to support systematic and regular waiting list validation and continued focus on scheduled care.</p><p>Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of sentencing.  I share Members' views on this.  There is a certain level of frustration.  The House will understand that I cannot comment about an individual case such as the case that has been mentioned.  It is important to be aware that sentencing is a matter within the remit of the Judiciary and it is not open to the Minister to intervene directly.  The Government published the Judicial Council Bill in 2017.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council, as Senators will be aware.  A sentencing information committee will also be established to collate information on sentencing imposed by the courts.  The report of the working group, Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  Nevertheless, it is an issue that could do with debate in this House.</p><p>The 'flu jab was mentioned by Senator Ardagh.  There has been discussion in the media recently about the 'flu jab.  The 'flu, by its nature, is an evolving virus and it changes based on geographic location.  There is much talk about our 'flu jab not covering certain strains of 'flu but I would not want that to dissuade people from having the jab because it covers most types of 'flu that one can get.  I would hate for the message to go out that if one gets the 'flu jab, it will not be sufficient.  I can see Senator Swanick smiling at me.  Maybe I am not describing the medical reality of it.  It is important, notwithstanding any strains of 'flu that exist in Australia or wherever, that we get the jab that is available in this country.</p><p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the Teagasc strategy, and how many patients are on trolleys this morning.  I understand the HSE held a weather-ready meeting on Monday, 23 October, which was attended by hospital groups, hospital community health care organisations, CHOs, primary care providers as well as HSE management as part of work to finalise integrated winter plans for all sites for the coming winter.  This is part of a pro-active and integrated approach to winter planning in order that the health services are ready for the increased demand for health services, in particular, emergency department, ED, services in the months ahead.  The point is well made that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>With regard to fast-track planning, I would be interested to hear from the Minister on that issue.  It links in with a point made by another Senator which I will come to.  A debate in the area of fast-track planning and planning generally with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, would be a good idea.</p><p>The last time I took questions Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the issue of community funding.  All I can say to the Senator is I will follow up.  After the Senator mentioned it on the last occasion, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Ring, who stated he would come back to me on it.  In fairness, the Minister seemed to be interested in the issue.  Following on from what the Cathaoirleach stated, and as I stated on the previous occasion, I would say it is an issue for a Commencement debate on which Senator Mac Lochlainn will get a direct answer from a Minister.  Perhaps the Senator raised it already but it would be no harm to raise a follow-up one.  It would be important that, even if an issue is mentioned on the Order of Business, it would not necessarily preclude Senators from raising it.  If it is raised here one day and then the next day the Senator has a Commencement matter, that would be serious duplication, which we should avoid.</p><p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of sexual abuse, the SAVI report and the research on sexual violence which is badly needed.  The Domestic Violence Bill is being considered by the Department of Justice and Equality at present and it will be back in the House next month.  That is fresh off the press.  The Senator will be pleased to hear that.</p><p>The trial of the human rights activists is a foreign affairs issue.  It is something that we will bring to the attention of, and no doubt is already being considered by, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister.</p><p>Senator Kevin Humphreys raised the issue of affordable housing.  I have already stated that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should come into the House to discuss the planning area.  It really is a planning issue that Senator Humphreys is referring to because if there was fast-track planning for cases such as this, it would get around the issue which he raises.</p><p>Senator Byrne complimented the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its work when it comes to trade missions.  The Senator's comments highlight the value of trade missions, which are perceived to be jollies in a way but which are really hard work.  Ministers and representatives from Ireland work hard on those trade missions and I thank the Senator for raising it here.</p><p>Senator Swanick raised the United Nations day issue, and the Robert Mugabe comments which I wholeheartedly agree with.  In fairness, they have changed their minds.  It was unbelievable, and I would share the Senators thoughts on that.</p><p>Senator Craughwell was passionate today about the banks and I can understand why.  I share the Senator's frustration.  When one telephones a bank now, one cannot get to speak to somebody or one must go around the houses to get to speak to somebody.  The day is gone where there is any real customer service in banks.  It is, quite frank, unacceptable.  When it comes to those who are in difficult situations, the empathy seems to be gone out of that area entirely.  I congratulate the Senator on the last payment of his mortgage.  I wish I was at that stage where I was making my last payment on my mortgage.  When it comes to the crew of the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>, that is an issue for a Commencement debate.  I would suggest that the Senator do that.</p><p>Senator McFadden raised the pay and conditions of councillors, which I think we would all agree with.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, was in here for a Commencement debate, but it would be a good idea to get him in for an entire debate on this area because it is an issue that interests us all.  With regard to Army cooks, that feeds in to - pardon the pun - the wider issue of the Defence Forces.  It is a good idea.  The Senator is doing good, as it is her area.  Given the contributions today, there is a serious need to have the Minister in.  Indeed, it will be arranged, probably the second week after we come back, that he will come into the House.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised an issue regarding the Shannon.  I cannot really speak about it.  I do know about the issue to which the Senator refers.</p> <p>It is certainly an issue that perhaps should be raised.  If that is Senator Gavan's information it should certainly be communicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I would expect that as a Member of the Oireachtas Senator Gavan would be entitled to a response on what the Garda's approach is to a situation as described by the Senator.  Senator Gavan could follow it up with the Minister if the response is unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Senator Feighan does great work and should be acknowledged for his work on Irish-British relations.  He has highlighted the recent visit by the Taoiseach to France, and that Ireland would be considered part of <i>La Francophonie</i>group.  Brexit is a negative for Ireland but this aspect is a positive part of Brexit; that we must diversify and look to other countries for arrangements, trade and potential.  It is good to hear positive talk around Brexit.  I commend Senator Feighan for arranging the upcoming trip.  Unfortunately, due to other commitments I cannot make.  I hope it is a constructive meeting and that the Members have an enjoyable time with colleagues in the UK.<br/><br/>Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke on community groups and the CCTV scheme.  This is an issue for a Commencement debate.  It is very specific and I believe the Senator would get great satisfaction from a one-on-one with the Minister on the topic.  I do not know the full extent of the scheme and how it operates but perhaps there is a communications issue.  If there is, the Senator will need to raise it with the Minister directly in a Commencement debate.  That is not to say that I will not communicate it to the Minister, but I believe that would be the best way forward.</p></speech>

I cannot know about every Commencement debate that occurs in the House, and that was quite a while ago also.  There is no reason why a debate could not be facilitated in that area.  Perhaps it could be expanded slightly so that this issue could definitely be covered.  I suggest to expand it in case there are other issues that Members may wish raise with the Minister in and around the skills, jobs and training area.  I will certainly seek to ask the Leader's office to arrange that.</p>  <p>Senator Reilly raised a local issue around no classrooms.  This issue needs urgent priority.  The Senator has a Commencement debate down I hope that he would not be precluded from continuing with that.  Clearly it is a matter of priority.</p>  <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of Garda numbers on the Border.  There are many challenges with Brexit and this is another one we really need to keep an eye on.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, would welcome the opportunity to outline plans in this regard, and as it pertains to Brexit.</p>  <p>Senator Paul Daly raised the issue of rural crime.  The fear that he described is a reality for many people, especially those who are older or more vulnerable, around the country.  The Senator illustrated a very sad and personal situation.  I do not want to be party political about the subject but to a degree I have to be.  Fianna F&aacute;il closed many of the Garda stations.  Since we have had the opportunity we have put significant investment into Garda numbers.  I know that is not what the Senator wants to hear but-----</p></speech>

Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; leithdh&aacute;ileadh breise de &euro;687,000 le cur ar f&aacute;il do sc&eacute;imeanna taca&iacute;ochta teanga na Roinne lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</p>  <p>T&aacute; &euro;2.65 milli&uacute;n &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il faoi bhuis&eacute;ad 2018 do chur i bhfeidhm an phr&oacute;isis plean&aacute;la teanga an bhliain seo chugainn.  Is ionann sin agus ard&uacute; &euro;1.8 milli&uacute;n thar an all&uacute;ntas at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don phr&oacute;iseas sa bhliain reatha.  Ina theannta sin, ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; ard&uacute; ar an gcist&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do na gn&aacute;thchl&aacute;ir reatha ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil dl&uacute;thbhaint acu chomh maith le cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise 20 bliain.  Leis an all&uacute;ntas m&eacute;adaithe at&aacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile, t&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; le mo Roinn tac&uacute; tuilleadh le cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise agus an phr&oacute;isis plean&aacute;la teanga mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an nGaeltacht, leis na bailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta agus leis na l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge.  Mar is iond&uacute;il ag an tr&aacute;th seo den bhliain, t&aacute; an phlean&aacute;il chu&iacute; idir l&aacute;mha ag mo Roinn i gcomhar leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s, leis an bhforas agus go deimhin le p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara eile chun c&uacute;ram cu&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh den chist&iacute;ocht shuntasach seo sa chaoi is go mbainfear an leas is fearr as ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</p> <p>N&iacute; call dom a r&aacute; go n-aithn&iacute;onn mo Roinn an r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach at&aacute; ag an teaghlach mar a bhaineann s&eacute; le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge go bisi&uacute;il chuig an ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin, ba mhaith liom an deis a thap&uacute; chun c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoin gcl&aacute;r taca&iacute;ochta teaghlaigh.  Is &iacute; aidhm an chl&aacute;ir seo, a ceapadh mar bheart faoi leith le c&uacute;ram a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ims&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus an teaghlaigh de chuid na strait&eacute;ise, tac&uacute; ar bhealach ilghn&eacute;itheach le treisi&uacute; na Gaeilge i dteaghlaigh Gaeltachta.  Faoin gcl&aacute;r seo, cuirtear c&uacute;namh ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; sc&eacute;imeanna agus tionscnaimh faoi leith de chuid mo Roinn ar leasa theaghlaigh na Gaeltachta at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il clainne le Gaeilge n&oacute; a dteasta&iacute;onn uathu &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; mo Roinn i mbun forbartha faoi l&aacute;thair ar fheachtas nua feasachta i dtaca leis an bpac&aacute;iste teanga i gcomhar le haltra&iacute; poibl&iacute; Fheidhmeannacht na Seirbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte agus f&oacute;gr&oacute;far tuilleadh eolais faoi sin sna seachtain&iacute; at&aacute; romhainn.</p> <p>Mar is eol don Teach, tugann Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 feidhm reacht&uacute;il don phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga faoina mbeidh pleananna teanga &aacute; n-ullmh&uacute; ag leibh&eacute;al an phobail i gceantair a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; aitheantas a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh faoin Acht mar limist&eacute;ir plean&aacute;la teanga Ghaeltachta, mar bhailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta n&oacute; mar l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge.  Ag an bpointe seo, t&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas chun pleananna teanga a ullmh&uacute; ag leibh&eacute;al an phobail tosaithe sna limist&eacute;ir plean&aacute;la teanga Ghaeltachta ar fad at&aacute; leagtha amach faoin bpr&oacute;iseas.  I m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;in na bliana seo, d'fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; all&uacute;ntas suas le &euro;100,000 thar thr&eacute;imhse 12 mh&iacute; i leith gach limist&eacute;ar plean&aacute;la teanga faoi leith ina mbeidh feidhmi&uacute; plean teanga aontaithe ag tos&uacute; sa bhliain reatha.  An mh&iacute; seo a chuaigh thart, d'fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; go bhfuil an ch&eacute;ad tr&iacute; phlean teanga Gaeltachta ceadaithe.  T&aacute;thar ag dr&eacute;im go mbeidh pleananna i leith suas le ocht limist&eacute;ar eile r&eacute;itithe ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta le cur faoi bhr&aacute;id mo Roinne roimh dheireadh na bliana seo.  Beidh an maoini&uacute; breise at&aacute; ceadaithe chun tac&uacute; leis an phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga in 2018 r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach de r&eacute;ir mar a bheidh breis pleananna teanga &aacute; gcead&uacute;.  Anuas air sin, t&aacute; forbairt d&eacute;anta ag mo Roinn ar an ch&oacute;ras faisn&eacute;ise geografa&iacute;, GIS, chun tac&uacute; leis an phobal agus pleananna teanga &aacute; n-ullmh&uacute; acu.  Is forbairt shuntasach, cheannr&oacute;da&iacute;och at&aacute; i gceist leis seo.  Den ch&eacute;ad uair riamh, beidh staitistic&iacute; agus sonra&iacute; faoi leith ar f&aacute;il i dtaca le gach limist&eacute;ar plean&aacute;la teanga mar aonaid astu f&eacute;in.  N&iacute; amh&aacute;in go mbeidh s&eacute; n&iacute;os fusa ag lucht plean&aacute;la teanga an c&oacute;ras a &uacute;s&aacute;id, ach cuirfear an t-eolas i l&aacute;thair ar bhealach at&aacute; tarraingteach don phobal tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile.</p> <p>Ag an bpointe seo, ba mhaith liom an deis a thap&uacute; chun tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ar fud na Gaeltachta at&aacute; i mbun ullmh&uacute; agus feidhmi&uacute; pleananna teanga.  T&aacute; obair mh&oacute;r d&eacute;anta agus idir l&aacute;mha ag na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; sin ar son na Gaeilge, ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son an phobail ina bhfuil siad ag maireacht&aacute;il.  Is &eacute; an spiorad sin, spiorad na meithle, at&aacute; ag cro&iacute;l&aacute;r an phr&oacute;isis agus is c&oacute;ir agus is ceart &eacute; sin a aithint.</p> <p>Ina theannta sin, ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; obair idir l&aacute;mha chun an pr&oacute;iseas a bhr&uacute; ar aghaidh mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis na bailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta.  Chuige sin, t&aacute; an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s agus Foras na Gaeilge i mbun oibre le p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara i Leitir Ceanainn, cathair na Gaillimhe agus Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is chun an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga sna bailte sin a bhr&uacute; chun cinn.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; t&uacute;s curtha leis an phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga i gCluain Dolc&aacute;in, in Inis agus i mBaile Locha Riach i dtreo a bheith in ann aitheantas mar l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge a bhronnadh ar na ceantair sin.  N&iacute; call dom a r&aacute; ar nd&oacute;igh go leanfaidh m&eacute; orm, mar Aire St&aacute;it ar a bhfuil freagracht as gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, le gach iarracht gur f&eacute;idir agus gur g&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun an oiread agus is f&eacute;idir cist&iacute;ochta a fh&aacute;il chun tac&uacute; leis an phr&oacute;iseas t&aacute;bhachtach seo at&aacute;, agus a bheidh, ag cro&iacute;l&aacute;r chl&aacute;r oibre mo Roinne mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an Ghaeltacht sna blianta at&aacute; romhainn.</p> <p>Ba mhaith liom anois c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil obair th&aacute;bhachtach d&eacute;anta ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s anuas tr&iacute;d na blianta ar mhaithe le saol eacnama&iacute;ochta, cult&uacute;rtha agus s&oacute;isialta phobal na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  De thoradh na hoibre at&aacute; ar bun ag foireann dh&iacute;ograiseach an &uacute;dar&aacute;is ar son na Gaeltachta ar bhonn lean&uacute;nach, t&aacute; deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta agus fiontra&iacute;ochta cothaithe agus cruthaithe i gceantair nach bhfaigheadh na deiseanna sin murach gur ann don eagra&iacute;ocht.  N&iacute; g&aacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agus idir l&aacute;mha ag an eagra&iacute;ocht thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach chun pobal bisi&uacute;il na Gaeltachta a chaomhn&uacute; agus a choth&uacute;.</p> <p>Is &aacute;bhar s&aacute;saimh &eacute; mar gur &eacute;irigh leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s 559 post a chruth&uacute; anuraidh agus gur cuireadh &euro;300,000 breise ar f&aacute;il don eagra&iacute;ocht do 2018.  F&aacute;gann s&eacute; sin gurb &eacute; &euro;7 milli&uacute;n an bunl&iacute;ne nua caipitil i mbuis&eacute;ad 2018 don &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  N&iacute; miste dom a lua freisin go bhfuil all&uacute;ntas breise de &euro;1.5 milli&uacute;n in airgead caipitil curtha ar f&aacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s i mbliana, chomh maith le &euro;2.4 milli&uacute;n anuraidh.  F&aacute;gann s&eacute; sin go bhfuil &euro;3.9 milli&uacute;n sa bhreis ar an bhunl&iacute;ne curtha ar f&aacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s le dh&aacute; bhliain anuas, idir 2016 agus 2017.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go dtabharfaidh an t-all&uacute;ntas breise seo deis don &uacute;dar&aacute;s roinnt togra&iacute; caipitil t&aacute;bhachtacha a bhr&uacute; chun cinn in 2018 agus tuilleadh fosta&iacute;ochta a chruth&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht d&aacute; bharr.</p> <p>Tuigfidh an Teach gur ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna a thiteann an fhreagracht an polasa&iacute; don oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022 a chur i bhfeidhm.  D'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; gur aisfhreagra suntasach is ea an polasa&iacute; seo ar a bhfuil r&aacute;ite agus molta sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain mar a bhaineann s&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar l&eacute;iri&uacute; breise ar dh&aacute;ir&iacute;reacht lean&uacute;nach an Rialtais seo chun c&uacute;ram a dh&eacute;anamh do chur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise, is d&iacute;ol suntais &eacute; go bhfuil aonad pholasa&iacute; oideachais Gaeltachta faoi leith bunaithe cheana f&eacute;in ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire, an Teachta Bruton, chun cur i bhfeidhm an pholasa&iacute; a bhr&uacute; chun cinn.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo uile go bhfuil c&eacute;im th&aacute;bhachtach eile chun cinn glactha ag an Rialtas ar son na Gaeilge agus cur i bhfeidhm c&oacute;rasach na strait&eacute;ise.</p> <p>Foils&iacute;odh tortha&iacute; an athbhreithnithe ar Bhille na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la (leas&uacute;) 2014 i m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;n 2014.  De bharr mh&iacute;sh&aacute;stacht le cuid de na leasuithe a bh&iacute; molta, n&iacute;or foils&iacute;odh an Bille agus t&oacute;gadh cinneadh athbhreithni&uacute; eile a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille ag an am sin. Tar &eacute;is tr&eacute;imhse fada comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in, foils&iacute;odh ceannteidil an Bhille &uacute;r i m&iacute; Meitheamh na bliana seo.  T&aacute; iarracht d&eacute;anta sna ceannteidil seo dul i ngleic le dh&aacute; mh&oacute;rcheist - na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga agus an earca&iacute;ocht sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute;.  Mar sin, mar chuid den Bhille nua, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist c&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;n a thabhairt isteach in &aacute;it na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Faoin gc&oacute;ras seo, bheadh rang&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;ide as rialach&aacute;in chun caighde&aacute;in a leagan s&iacute;os do na comhlachta&iacute; sin.  Ar an mbealach seo, beidh muid in ann a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na caighde&aacute;in is airde &oacute; thaobh &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge de bainteach leis na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a mb&iacute;onn ag sol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; don phobal, pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta san &aacute;ireamh.</p> <p>M&aacute; t&aacute; an ch&oacute;rais nua seo chun a bheith &eacute;ifeachtach, beidh orainn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta.  Is &eacute; ceann de na pr&iacute;omhfhadhbanna a chuireann bac ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge n&aacute; nach bhfuil na daoine leis na scileanna cu&iacute; fostaithe sna hoifig&iacute; cu&iacute;.  M&aacute; t&aacute; muid chun feabhas a chur air seo, caithfidh an St&aacute;it l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe St&aacute;it at&aacute; in ann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; agus a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag oifigigh St&aacute;it at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Chuige sin, beidh s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir sa Bhille go mbeidh 20% de na daoine nua a earca&iacute;tear don tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; ina gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoibl&iacute; at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachta&iacute; in ann freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh &oacute;n bpobal ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; seo thar o&iacute;che.  Creidim gurb &iacute; an earca&iacute;ocht cro&iacute;l&aacute;r na ceiste, agus t&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach gur f&eacute;idir t&oacute;g&aacute;&iacute;l, ar bhonn ch&eacute;imi&uacute;il, ar l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge agus, ag eascairt as sin, go mbeimid in ann feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge mar is c&oacute;ir.</p> <p>Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; mo Roinn ag obair i gcomhr&eacute;ir le hOifig an Ard-Aighne chun an Bille a dhr&eacute;acht&uacute;.

It shows once again how this Government is completely out of touch with the basic needs of the citizens.  The surge in waiting times has been linked to staff shortages.  The public sector recruitment ban as well as increased demand as the economy picks up were factors that could have been foreseen and there is no reason for inaction.  One only needs to look around on the way to work to know there are more cars on the road.  In 2016 the number of private cars on the road crossed the 2 million mark, and there were 240,000 learners licences were issued.  When this issue was raised almost nine months ago, in February 2017, the Seanad was told that additional resources and staff would be put in place to reduce waiting times.  It is baffling that the Government has still not hired the additional staff needed to reach this demand.  Instead the Department is proud that it has put in place certain overtime arrangements and notification systems for learner drivers to increase the numbers of tests being administered.  This is very basic and should have been put in place months ago.  There is no joined up thinking in the Department nor is there evidence of any future planning.  When will this Government realise that things do not need to reach crisis point before it acts?  The situation needs to be prevented from deteriorating further.  I call on it to expedite the appointment of additional driving testers to increase the numbers.</p></speech>

I will try to use my time constructively.  There are a number of statistics that the Minister's statement to the House did not deal with.  I spoke with the Road Safety Authority earlier today.  Today there are 70,000 waiting for driving tests whether for private cars, commercial vehicles or for buses.  There are 52 test centres in the country spread across 31 local authorities.  The Minister has accepted that what has happened is not satisfactory and says there is a plan to recruit testers.  When I spoke to the RSA last week, I was informed that it had not made any appointments; there was one panel <i>in situ</i>but others were needed.  The RSA informed me that a substantial number of people had retired this year and that a significant number will retire in 2018.  It told me that it takes eight weeks to train someone and today no one is in training, so there will not be one single additional instructor this year.  If we did have one it would be in late December.  These are the facts.</p><p>The current system is not working.  The Minister cannot stand over a situation where there are 70,000 people who have paid a fee and are legitimate applicants waiting on a list for tests.  These are people who want to go to college or take up employment and they cannot do their tests.  It is most unsatisfactory.  It is the Minister's responsibility, in his portfolio of transport, to address this.  I want him to say how, in co-operation with other agencies under his responsibility, he will increase the number of new testers.  Will he assure this House that there will be new testers in place before the end of this year?  How will these lists be cut?</p><p>I deal in facts.  When I spoke to the testing centre in Tipperary today at 9.30 a.m. I was told that applicants had to wait 27 weeks.  In Waterford, 26 people have been waiting for 26 weeks.  In Wexford they wait 25 weeks and 21 weeks in Cork.  Kerry is divided in two with waits of 24 weeks in Tralee and 23 weeks in Killarney.  In fairness to the Minister he does accept that this is totally unacceptable that 70,000 people are waiting to do driving tests.  It is not an average of 10 weeks.  It is a critical issue which must be addressed with resources.  It needs to be taken head on.  I will bring this back to the House in December for further report.  I am committed to sticking with this problem and achieving a resolution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-25a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1426" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102500015#AA00300"><p>From listening to the Minister and the Senators, there is clearly a problem.  The waiting times are not acceptable.  As the Minister noted, ten weeks is the objective.  It must be addressed urgently.  I understand that a theory test can be had within ten days.  I do not know the reason for this.  There is obviously more people applying for tests but it does not explain the whole bottleneck.</p>  <p>From speaking to the RSA, the Department and so on, I understand there can be a cohort of up to 29% of people who do not show up for their tests, which is a major issue.  The Minister mentioned that the test centres now telephone people to check that they are coming.  It is hugely important.  On a positive note, I am aware of someone who needed an emergency test because they had got a job and they needed a car.  That person got the test within a few weeks but people should not have to depend on that kind of queue jumping or no-show tests.  I was told that sometimes when people show up for their test, it cannot take place because the person does not have his or her driving licence, or insurance, the car is not taxed or it does not have a valid NCT certificate.  On one occasion someone turned up for a driving test without a car.  It is necessary to sort all those issues.  I welcome Senator Boyhan's promise to stay on the case and I support him on it.  It is in the Minister's interest that this be sorted.  A waiting time of ten weeks, which is two and a half months, is better than the situation as it is now but it should be better than that again.</p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Senator Victor Boyhan, who has raised this issue relentlessly in the Chamber.  I fully support his efforts.  If one looks at the numbers for the three test centres in my own county, Buncranna, Letterkenny and Donegal, they are at the top of the list for waiting times.</p>  <p>I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the matter that I raise. It is the poor public transport infrastructure in rural Ireland which means if people want to stay in their job, avail of education, visit loved ones in hospital and so on they require a car.  I am concerned about the considerable time involved which can be as high as six months for a test, and then there are repeat tests, because not everyone passes the first time.  That is unacceptable.  The Road Safety Authority has known about the shortage of testers for a long time.  I am thinking of the number of driving instructors across the State.  I cannot imagine there is significant further training to take people to the level necessary to become testers.  I ask the Minister to grapple with this matter in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, with a particular focus on the impact it has on the rural economies.  </p>  <p>We talk about the economy moving in the right direction again.  When we look outside from the windows of Leinster House, the cranes can be seen across the skyline, but that recovery is not happening in rural areas at anything like the same level.  Situations like this, where people have to wait so long to get either their test or their repeat test will not help to develop the economy, it will hold us back.  It is an issue with wider implications than mere inconvenience for those who want to pass their test. </p> <p>The frustration has been brought to my attention time and again by people across Donegal, be they from the Inishowen peninsula, the north Donegal area, the north-east area towards Letterkenny, or south Donegal.  It appears that the Government and the Road Safety Authority are unable to sort this issue out.  I commend Senator Boyhan and I commend the Minister for attending to deal with this issue today.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene to find a solution with the Road Safety Authority.</p></speech>

When I worked with young unemployed people in Wexford, Wicklow and across the south east, I noted that being able to drive really made the difference between getting work and not getting work.  In many cases, it was almost impossible to gain employment if one could not demonstrate that one could drive.  I am very much aware of the benefit of being able to drive.</p>  <p>I wish to highlight two slightly related issues, one of which concerns the driver theory test, which is currently delivered by a private company based in America and working internationally.  In the discussions we have had in this House on rural post offices, it was asked why we do not seek to ensure rural post offices could be hubs for things such as the driver theory test.  In designing requests for tenders, we should recognise the benefits of locating multiple services that are needed in rural communities in central hubs such as post offices.</p>  <p>As of 17 June this year, those seeking to take the driver theory test are required to have a public services card.  Given that the Data Commissioner has indicated her dissatisfaction with the arrangements in place regarding the public services card, and having received replies from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, she has now indicated her intention to launch an investigation into how the card has been rolled out, the protections that are in place, or not in place, and how it is being managed.  Will the Minister consider removing, or suspending, the requirement for a public services card for those seeking to do the driver theory test?  It represents an extra level of bureaucracy for those involved.  It is an instrument over which there is a major question mark at present.  It is not appropriate to continue pushing people to take up the card while it is under investigation.  From May 2018, new European directives on data protection will be in place.  They will provide a much more appropriate and safe environment for the rolling out of any of these measures.  Will the Minister consider removing or suspending the requirement related to the driver theory test?</p></speech>

It is quite obvious that this matter exercises people greatly in their own areas but it is universal.  It features outside Donegal, on which this debate has largely concentrated.  It affects every county and every testing location.  The best performance is in Kilrush, where the is an eight-week delay.  The delays elsewhere can extend to over 20 weeks.  As I have already said, this is not satisfactory.  I agree with everybody who said so.  It has obviously taken the testers by surprise.  One cannot solve this overnight.  One cannot appoint testers overnight; it has to be done gradually.</p>  <p>The Road Safety Authority is more than aware of this issue, thanks to the contributions of various Senators.  I have spoken to the authority about this on several occasions.  I am satisfied the matter is being addressed as a matter of urgency and that the numbers and waiting times could be reduced, not only in Donegal.  I believe the measures I have outlined today will have an effect.  They were also outlined in the House last week.  It is a matter of tracking the number of driver testers and the delivery of 120 extra overtime tests per driver tester.  Senator O'Mahony referred to the number of no-shows.  It is an extraordinary number.  It results from people applying who do not really intend to go for a test at all.  Many telephone calls are being made and a considerable number of people are saying they are not actually going to turn up.  The slots are then filled extremely efficiently by telephoning people who are regarded as a priority and who want a test urgently.  New driving testers are being appointed.  A large amount of overtime is being grabbed up by testers.  There is a new driver-booking system being introduced.  Therefore, the matter is being addressed fairly aggressively and effectively.</p>  <p>I take the points made by Senators on their own areas and the difficulties in those areas.  I understand them and the figures that are being given to us here today.  They are correct.  I must issue a warning about quoting figures, however.  The figures quoted here last week were not accurate.  According to the Official Report, Senator Boyhan said the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said the current national average waiting time for a driving test is 14 weeks.  The Senator then said, "I can tell him that this is not the case."  It is the case.  The Senator should be careful about what he says.  I acknowledge he is making a case but he should be careful with his figures.  The Senator stated: "Nowhere in the more than 50 centres does the waiting time meet the target of 20 weeks."  I do not know where the Senator got the target of 20 weeks.  There is no 20-week target.  He should be careful.</p>  <p>You went on to say: "I reiterate that the waiting time in Buncrana is 19 weeks, in Donegal it is 24 weeks and in Letterkenny it is 21 weeks."  That is not correct.  All those three figures are completely inaccurate.  Those figures that you are quoting are ones that-----</p></speech>

The Senator  has been in this business for a very long time and he knows perfectly well that the measure is of the average number of weeks waiting.  To come into this House and quote the longest possible waiting time of any individual is not an honest way of producing these figures.  What the Senator should have cited, but did not cite, were the average waiting times in weeks.  These figures are much lower.  They are not acceptable but to cite the waiting time of the one person in each area waiting the longest is misleading.  The figures are inaccurate and exaggerated.

What is important here is the average waiting time in weeks.  There are two categories the Senator got in the letter.  The letter,  which I read,  made those two categories absolutely clear.  In every case that the Senator quoted, the average waiting time was considerably lower.  There is an obligation on the Senator, as someone who has rightly championed those who are experiencing the problem, not to quote anything but average figures.  The figures are measured based on the average.</p>  <p>The problem arose between you and the Minister of State last week because alternative figures were being cited.  You and the House know it is right to quote average figures.  Average figures will bring one to the same conclusion that all the other Senators rightly came to today, that is, that this has to be addressed.</p> <p>Do not come in here-----</p></speech>

I would certainly be happy to address individual figures with any Senator, because everybody has them in his or her own area.  We should give this a little bit of time now, because measures are being taken.  I would be happy to come back here in six months' time and inquire of the RSA what progress has been made, and to report on the issues in Roscommon, Galway and Dun Laoghaire.  I will not do it every week.  This is the second week in a row that we have had the same conversation.  Remember when quoting figures, that the figures go up on the website every week.  The figures change every single week, and it is important to be up to date.</p>  <p>I do not know the answers to Senator Higgins's questions, in particular the question on the public services card, but I will think about them and come back to her.</p></speech>

What happens in Catalonia and Spain matters to all of us.  We know Spain very well.  I know that very many of us, and the people we represent, have spent time living, working, studying or just holidaying in Spain, particularly in Barcelona, one of the great European cities.  After Britain, it is the country that Irish people travel to most.  Cities and towns across Spain are home for many Irish people.  In addition, 1.8 million visits were made to Spain from Ireland during 2016. A growing and welcome element of this traffic is connected with the increasing numbers of Spaniards living in Ireland, and of course the many Spanish students who join us during the summer.  We all want the best for Spain and its people, and it is because we know it so well that we were so shocked by the violence that occurred on 1 October and why we sincerely hope that nothing like it happens again.  I know that some Members of the Oireachtas also visited Catalonia, including on that October weekend, and their perspectives and experience can help contribute to our consideration of the situation there.</p>  <p>Tensions are running high, but the fact is that Spain is an established democracy where citizens have full rights protected by the rule of law.  In any democracy, political developments must take place within a legal framework.  This is not a procedural point.  This is a fundamental requirement if the rights of all citizens are to be protected.  Respecting the rule of law, its possibilities and protections but also its limits, is not a choice but an obligation.  The resolution of the current crisis needs to be within Spain's constitutional framework, through Spain's democratic institutions.  That view was repeated by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The freedom to express contesting views is an essential check and balance in any democracy, but differences of opinion must be contested with full respect for the law and the rights of all citizens.  This is the foundation that underpins and protects modern democratic societies.  We can disagree with the law.  We can work to change the law, but we cannot ignore the law or act beyond the law.</p>  <p>In Catalonia, and elsewhere in Spain, as in all our democracies, public representatives and all citizens must work to advance their goals within democratic institutions, such as parliaments, with full respect for the law.  Clearly any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy.  It requires legitimacy both in terms of the broadest possible political consensus and in terms of a sound legal framework.  On that basis, the referendum vote of 1 October cannot be accepted as legitimate.  I do not believe that it provides the basis for a declaration of independence.  The holding of this referendum was also ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court.  It is clear, including from the massive gatherings that we have seen in Catalonia, that many there support independence, but we know too that there are many others who do not support independence, and it would be wrong if their views were not fully taken account of.</p>  <p>In early September, a small majority of the regional Catalan parliament voted through referendum and transition legislation in controversial circumstances.  Those in parliament opposed to the measures, who made up nearly half the region's parliamentarians, argued that the legislative process breached the parliament's own procedures as well as being illegal.  Spain's constitutional court later ruled the legislation illegal.  This is a complex political issue and it is for politicians to resolve complex political issues through dialogue and empathy.  It is this political dialogue rather than escalating tensions that we all want to see, but dialogue needs to respect the constitution of Spain, the rights of all citizens of Spain and the regional and national parliamentary institutions that represent them.  Any political action outside of that framework lacks legitimacy and cannot claim to respect the plurality of opinion in Spain, or in Catalonia for that matter.</p>  <p>I am conscious that there have been many calls for external involvement in the resolution of this matter, particularly after the violence that occurred on 1 October.  However, the Government's position is that in Spain, as in any other country in the EU, internal political and constitutional arrangements are the prerogative of a country and its people and should be determined by them, through the institutions of the country and in accordance with the rule of law.  Internal divisions, contesting aspirations and robust debates are to be expected in any democracy, but they have to be resolved in keeping with the rule of law.  Constitutions can be changed, as we know, but that has to happen in a constitutional way.  I, therefore, welcome the cross-party support in the Spanish Parliament for the establishment of a committee to consider the issue of constitutional reform, which may address some of the current concerns.</p>  <p>I am very concerned at the impact on people's lives that the political uncertainty has given rise to, including the decisions of over 1,000 companies to transfer their corporate headquarters out of Catalonia.  I am also dismayed at reports of fractures within families and communities to which this divisive issue is giving rise.  The validity and legitimacy of political effort requires, as I have said, securing the broadest possible consensus within the law.  Citizens also deserve the certainty that the rule of law extends to them.  That is why I remain of the view that it is for all Catalans and all Spaniards to arrive at a shared view on what steps within their laws and their own democratic institutions might best support a process of resolution.  Clearly this is proving difficult.  The decision taken by the Spanish government to apply article 155 of the constitution marks a significant point.  Nonetheless there still remains an opportunity for engagement.  We hope that leaders take the necessary steps to return to the space where differing views are contested through national and regional democratic institutions, with full respect always for the law and the rights of citizens.  Upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all democracies.  Ireland respects the constitutional and territorial unity of Spain.  The Government's position remains that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain are matters to be determined by its own citizens, though its own institutions, and in keeping with its own laws.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-10-25a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017102500018#DD00100"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss events in Catalonia.  There is significant cause for concern in the violence that was perpetrated in the region during the attempt to hold a referendum on independence.  I have no doubt that some 100 years ago, there were people in Parliaments around Europe pointing to the need for the rule of law to be upheld in Ireland as it attempted to leave the United Kingdom.  I am sure the first Irish Parliament, of which this House is a successor, was described at the time as undemocratic because it did not comply with the constitution of the UK.  However, that is all a matter of historical record.</p>  <p>In terms of what is happening in Catalonia and what the Spanish Government is doing in response, we would all agree that people should, of course, be allowed to have their say.  If the Catalonian population chooses to have a referendum, it should be permitted to take place.  That desire by the people to exercise their democratic rights was facilitated in Scotland and Quebec, but it has not been accommodated in Catalonia.  We do not know whether the majority of Catalonians are in favour of independence, because the numbers differ depending on which opinion poll one is consulting.  Spain, like the European Union, has evolved and changed over time.  Having come out of the era of Franco and gone through the establishment of the various autonomous regions, which were given some level of local powers, there is nothing to say it cannot evolve and change once again.  The challenge for the Spanish Government is that in saying to the people of Catalonia that democracy will not be allowed to have its say, the Catalonians are being left with very few alternative courses of action.  The long and unfortunate campaign by Basque separatist groups and others was the absolute opposite of democracy.  People must be shown that democracy works and will be allowed to work.</p>  <p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the proposals by the Spanish Parliament for the establishment of a parliamentary committee.  This is essentially an issue for the people of Spain and Catalonia to resolve, but that does not mean we cannot raise our concerns regarding incidences of violence.  There was no reason for the violence that took place.  The referendum could have been allowed to proceed without any need for stopping people from going into polling booths and sanctioning local police to use force.  The Spanish Government could have allowed the ballots to be counted and simply ignored the result if it so chose.  It is often the case when such conflicts arise, as we saw in this country 101 years ago, that reactions by governments can lead to exactly the opposite outcome to what is intended.  The path the Spanish Government is going down runs counter to its own arguments.  The Spanish cannot talk about democracy while allowing their police force to beat up pensioners.  Nobody in this Chamber or in this country would support the Spanish Government's approach to the crisis it faces.  The situation has been going on for decades or centuries, depending on which view one takes, but the response by the Spanish authorities has been appalling and should be condemned by everybody.</p>  <p>We all hope the matter can be resolved and that a fair committee will be established which allows for a referendum on independence, as happened in Quebec, if that is what the people of Catalonia decide.  As I said, it is not clear whether a majority of Catalonians would vote to leave Spain.  The point is that democracy must be supreme.  If we do not allow people to have a democratic say, then we leave them with very little alternative.  They can either sit tight and accept that democracy will not have its say or they can seek out alternative routes to what they wish to achieve.  That was the approach taken by the British Government to events in this country 100 years ago.  We do not want the same situation to evolve in Spain but it will require the authorities there to learn lessons from the mistakes of the past in regard to the establishment of this Parliament and the treatment by the British authorities of the will of the Irish people.  Of course, the will of the Irish people was not in compliance with the constitution of the UK at the time, which is not to defend the rule of law under the British regime.  The United States constitution stated at one time that a slave was not entitled to be a free man.  In other words, constitutions are not always right.</p>  <p>We all hope for an end to violence in Catalonia and a peaceful outcome to the current conflict.  The European Union has a role to play in achieving that but the first requirement is that everybody who saw the violence must condemn it.  As we know, governments acted within the law to prevent marches in Northern Ireland.  People just wanted their civil rights but were beaten off the streets.  The law said that could be done because the marchers were not complying with the laws passed by Parliament.  That approach ultimately leads down the wrong road and we must ensure Spain and Catalonia do not take that road.  The Catalonian people must be allowed to vote in a referendum on independence, if that is what they choose to do.  How the issues are resolved in the long term is a matter for the populations of Spain and Catalonia.  We hope the Catalonian people can be allowed to make their own decision as to the best outcome for their region.  It is not acceptable that a country which purports to be a democracy would allow pensioners, students and others to be beaten when they are simply trying to exercise their democratic rights.  Nobody in this Chamber would condone such activity.  As democrats, we must condemn a situation where people who were engaged in what was essentially an opinion poll, because of the manner in which it was not allowed to function properly, were denied their right to do so.  There is a difficult balance to be achieved in this instance but we must condemn the actions of any government that resorts to beating what it claims to be its own citizens.  As I said, the same thing happened in Northern Ireland when the police force there attacked the citizens it was supposed to protect.  The world saw what happened in the North and condemned it.  Unfortunately, it led Northern Ireland down a road we all regret.</p></speech>

I recently spent a week in the region during which time the referendum was to take place.  There was not a single day that I did not go down to the Palace of the Generalitat to observe the protests.  We must be very clear that what happened is unacceptable.  With all due respect, it is disappointing to note the failure of the Minister of State, in line with the same failure on the part of the Government, to condemn this violence unequivocally.  We in Europe need to learn from our history.  The proposal on which the Catalonian people were to vote asked whether they wished to be ruled or administered by a new republic.  As we know, a true republic is about equality, access, dignity and allowing people to exercise their rights in a democratic way.  I am a strong advocate of the republic.  We must never lose sight of what a true republic is about and what it represents.</p>  <p>The European response to the crisis has been disappointing.  Whether one is from the Basque region, Catalonia, Madrid or any other part of Spain, one is a European.  All of those people are citizens of the European Union and should, as such, be protected.  The EU should be defending the rights of its peoples.  I do not wish to say too much about the internal workings of Spain because I recognise there are particular constitutional arrangements to do with the administration of the country and so on.  We in Ireland would resent - and do resent, in some cases - any interference in how our country is run.  It is disappointing that member states of the EU and the institution itself have not come out strongly on this issue.  We are seeing the beginning of a fragmented Europe both in the realm of economics and in respect of a shared culture and sense of belonging.  People are becoming more and more alienated and the space that has opened up is being filled by extremism.  We must be conscious of that and of the lessons of history.  My understanding of the EU was always that it would defend the rights of its citizens.</p> <p>The European Union and its predecessors assisted this country greatly in getting, and vindicating, rights on many issues and we owe a great deal to it.  That is my real concern.  We must acknowledge that all people in Spain are citizens of the European Union and the European Union should stand firm in solidarity with its people.  </p> <p>The Government needs to come out unequivocally and condemn the violence.  I saw the violence there; I speak as someone who witnessed people being intimidated, being clobbered over the head and being dragged, viciously beaten and kicked by the authorities there.  Irrespective of what authority they had, it was not right and proper.  As politicians, or for that matter as citizens, we do not suspend our critical faculties.  We do not have to remain silent or be gagged because we are members of the club called the European Union.  We do not have to stand shoulder to shoulder and let it go on.  If we fail to condemn it, we are part of it.  That is my concern.</p> <p>There were young people, old people, families, workers and the unemployed.  There was a vast range of people there but they had the right to gather in a public place.  They had the right to have a view, and to express their view.  They had the right to disagree and whatever about the constitutionality of the referendum - that is a matter for Spain and other authorities - nobody had a right to beat them, humiliate them and walk all over them.  What is more disturbing is that the Union, our country and other member states of the European Union did little in response.</p> <p>I make a prediction.  There will be European Parliament elections in 2019.  Young people do not want to support or be part of a Europe that stands idly by and does nothing but, more importantly, whose leaders turns a blind eye to violence and humiliation and do not allow people peacefully assemble and talk about a new vision and a new way for their country or region.  I certainly do not and I am in my 50s.  That is what is at stake.  For most people in Europe, it is not actually about the entire workings of Spain.  It is about the great organisation called the European Union that was going to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in solidarity, that remembered the Europe of the past and that advocated for a new Europe of the future, but it has failed abysmally.  What will happen is people will move off and vote for different extremes and that vacuum will be filled.</p> <p>I hope these matters will be resolved internally by agreement.  It makes economic sense.  It makes sense for many reasons.  It is a matter for the Spanish people to stick together, to consolidate, to grow their economy, their country and their opportunities for what a great country it is.</p> <p>We have a road to travel too, and that is my criticism today.  I understand the Spanish Senate is meeting on Friday and it will discuss this matter.  I understand, even from today's news, that there is ongoing negotiation and dialogue for a resolution.  As democrats, we have to welcome that.  Hopefully, we will have a resolution to this dispute.  Let us be clear that we, if we sit idly by, will lose people.  The European ideal, the expectation that it would stand in solidarity with its people, is steadily being lost and it is something we need to wake up to.</p></speech>

We know Spain well.  Many of us and the people we represent have spent time living, working, studying or just on holiday in Spain, particularly in Barcelona, one of the great European city.</p>  <p>How true that is.  I live in the west of Ireland and Knock is my local airport.  There are five direct routes from Knock airport to Spain.  I will fly from Knock Airport with my partner and child next Saturday to Malaga.  Although Malaga is not in Catalonia, this shows how close the relationship is between Ireland and Spain.  There is also a direct to Faro from Knock airport.</p>  <p>The Minister of State said that Irish people travel to cities across Spain and it is the destination of some 1.8 million visits.  We are very close to Spain.  It is effectively our escape, for warming our bones, etc.  Since the 1930s, Spain has been so close to us.  We must not lose sight of the fact that Spain is an established democracy where citizens have full rights and are protected by the rule of law.</p>  <p>It is evident that Catalonia remains tense.  Spain's Prime Minister announced over the weekend that he would invoke a never-used provision of the Spanish constitution to remove elected leaders of Catalonia from office because of their support for independence.  In response, the far left CUP party described Madrid's action as an act of aggression against all Catalans.  There are reports that Catalonia's political leaders intend to bring a legal challenge to prevent the Spanish Government from removing them from office and taking over running the region to stop its push for independence.</p>  <p>We agree that the real worry in what we saw is that the rise in political tensions will spill over into something more sinister on the streets of Barcelona and elsewhere.  I readily condemn the actions of the police.  I saw it on television.  It was very upsetting.  Certainly, it was unwarranted.  It is imperative that this dangerous conflict is resolved as soon as possible through talks and dialogue rather than any manifestation of violence.</p>  <p>It is also clear that this political crisis is having an economic impact.  Some say it is huge.  It certainly has had an impact in Catalonia.  Caixabank, Spain's third largest bank, has reported it suffered a moderate but temporary run on deposits due to the crisis over the independence bid.  The bank, until recently, was based in Catalonia but now has transferred its headquarters to the Valencia region.</p>  <p>I am aware that the situation in Catalonia is being monitored by our Government.  It is very serious.  Earlier this month, the concern about the situation was conveyed to the Spanish authorities by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, at a meeting with the Spanish ambassador.</p>  <p>I reiterate that upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all modern democracies.  The Government's position remains that the constitution and political arrangements in Spain, as in any other member state of the EU, are a matter to be determined by its own citizens through its own institutions in keeping with the rule of law.  The Government has made it clear that any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy, both in terms of the broadest possible political consensus and in terms of the legal framework.  On that basis, the referendum vote in Catalonia cannot be accepted as legitimate - it is an aspiration - and does not provide the basis for a declaration of independence.  The Irish Government cannot recognise or accept a unilateral declaration.</p>  <p>As I said, I hope the Government is conscious that tensions remain high.  It is important that steps are taken to reduce tensions.  I hope that the parties concerned can find a way to do this as soon as possible and work out a way to discuss their differing views in dialogue.</p>  <p>Since the crisis began, the solution remains the same.  It is for the parties there to arrive at a shared view, and I agree with setting up a group on what measures might best support a process to resolve this crisis.  As we all will be aware from our experience on this island, violence has no place in politics.  While the situation is still precarious, we all hope the voices of moderation on both sides will prevail in order to defuse this growing political crisis.</p>  <p>The EU certainly did not emerge well out of this.  It seemed to take a step backwards.  However, I hope that we will work together and ensure that calm heads can pave a way through this difficult decision.</p> <p>We talk about a Europe that is united but fragmented.  Issues such as these are boiling over in many areas of the EU, in the Basque country and in the Veneto in Italy, for example.  How can the EU and European Governments deal with such areas?</p></speech>

We have to recognise at the outset that Catalonia has long had a distinctive culture, history, and social, economic and geographical conditions.  It is a distinct region and its autonomy has been recognised in the past, in 1979 for example, though subsequent rulings of the constitutional court have diluted that somewhat resulting in later difficulties.</p>  <p>The Spanish Government's reaction to the referendum is within the law as laid down by the Spanish constitutional court.  The point needs to be made, however, that it has been overly heavy-handed in its approach.  The police overreacted considerably to the referendum, ultimately injuring 900 people.</p>  <p>The second point that needs to be made is that the representatives of the Catalan local administration must act within the law.  The proper Government reaction would be to take a more reasonable approach and enter into dialogue with the Catalan representatives.  The onus is on the Catalan politicians, meanwhile, to abstain from illegal activity.  I hope that, within the auspices of the European Union and through the Members of the Spanish Parliament, a process of mediation can arise and produce a settlement that preserves a level of autonomy and self-government in Catalonia while still maintaining the overall integrity of Spain.</p></speech>

I hear much talk of law in this debate and in the conjecture surrounding it but there seems to have been no talk of international law and international human rights.  The debate here seems to be very selective about which law and who has to obey the law.</p><p>The right to self-determination is enshrined in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both approved by the United Nations in 1966 and ratified by Spain in 1977.  Article 1.2 of the Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice recognises the right to self-determination.  The Spanish constitution of 1978 establishes in Article 96 that international treaties ratified by Spain form part of its domestic legislation and Article 10.2 establishes that the rules on fundamental rights and public freedoms shall be interpreted in accordance with international treaties on the matter.</p><p>The Parliament of Catalonia has continuously and unambiguously expressed Catalonia&rsquo;s right to self-determination.  A resolution on self-determination was adopted on 1 December 1989 along with subsequent resolutions in 1998, 2010 and more recently the approval of the declaration of sovereignty and the right of the people of Catalonia on 6 October 2016.  This also confirmed a parliamentary majority in favour of independence.  UN Resolution 1999/57 proclaimed the indissoluble links between the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the foundation of any democratic society.  The International Court of Justice has stated that the only limitation on the right to decide that the court regards as enforceable is the unlawful resorting to force or other serious violations of the rules of international laws.  I was in Catalonia on 1 October and nobody could accuse the Catalan people of unlawfully resorting to force or other serious violations.  One could certainly accuse the Guardia Civil of this, however.  </p><p>A recent report by a commission of international experts has concluded that there is no international legal prohibition barring a sub-state entity from deciding its political destiny by assessing the will of its people.  EU member states have recognised many former sub-state entities that assessed their people's political will and decided to pursue independence.  The EU, therefore, recognises the right to decide.  Are we now saying that we, as members of the EU, do not recognise that right?  International human rights also respect the rights to free speech.  International human rights do not close down hundreds of websites illegally, as the Spanish state did before the referendum.  International human rights recognise the right to freedom of assembly.  International human rights do not attack civilians at polling stations.  </p><p>It is obviously quite clear that the relationship between the Spanish and Catalan Governments has deteriorated incrementally since 1977, with less and less autonomy and the blocking by the Spanish state of progressive legislation passed by the Catalan Government on a number of issues, including homelessness, marriage equality, bullfighting and education.  The recent referendum was overseen by a team of international independent election observers led by an Irishman, Michael Grange.  I will read an extract from his report:  </p><blockquote>Yesterday we witnessed events that no election monitors ought to ever witness.  We hope to never witness scenes of this nature ever again.  We saw numerous and repeated violations of civil and human rights.  We are shocked that this happened at all, even more so as it is clear to us that it was a centrally orchestrated, military-style operation carefully planned.  We are stunned that armed masked officers entered polling stations with the purposes of preventing a peaceful democratic process.  Despite these issues, and other difficulties, people experienced trying to vote.  I want to emphasise that we did see a day of voting yesterday.  We wish to acknowledge the peaceful nature of how the Catalan people acted yesterday.  We witnessed many acts demonstrating the strong will of the people which showed that they were determined to have their say and let others have their say through the ballot box, including the elderly and disabled.</blockquote><p>As can be expected, there is a lot of disinformation out there.  The 43% vote cited reflects the final recorded number of ballots actually counted.  This does not include votes in ballot boxes removed by the Spanish police.  This, then, is actually a remarkable percentage and surprised even the Spanish Government.  On the eve of the vote the Foreign Minister declared that there would be no real voting.  Spain did everything possible, both legal and otherwise, to prevent voting: hacking into computer systems; closing down websites; as well as the violence that we all saw on television.  The brave people who voted, including a number of wheelchair users, ought to have their voice respected.  Do they not deserve to have their rights respected under international human rights law?  I think that they do and I think that our country has a role in ensuring this happens.</p><p>It is quite ironic that we are hearing so much talk here about obeying the law when we consider some of the players involved in the Catalan situation.  It is interesting that the Partido Popular<i>, </i>Prime Minister Rajoy's party, is currently implicated in more than 60 cases of corruption, 31 of which involve 835 party representatives being charged.  The response from Rajoy's executive has, from the start of the current legislature, taken the form of a strategic change that consists of disabling the key institutions that uncover and investigate corruption in Spain, namely, the state Attorney General's office and the anti-corruption public prosecutor.  This de-activation was designed, I am told by the Minister for Justice, Mr. Rafael Catal&aacute;, through the appointment of the state Attorney General, Mr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Maza, and the Chief Prosecutor for anti-corruption, Mr. Manuel Moix.  The three have been reproached and condemned by the Spanish Parliament for obstructing the investigation of corruption cases, among them <i>caso Lezo</i>.  Rajoy's party, then, does not exactly shine as a bright beacon of legality.</p><p>It is also interesting that the decision taken in the Spanish Parliament to impose Article 155 has really been taken by three parties: the Partido Popular; the Partido Socialista Obrera Espanol, PSOE; and Ciudadanos.</p> <p>It is interesting that none of these parties has elected MPs from the Catalan region.  As such, they do not have popular support in Catalonia, yet they are imposing their will on the 7 million citizens of Catalonia and failing to recognise the will of the region's people in democratically electing Carles Puigdemont as their President and a parliament that wanted the right to self-determination vindicated.  I am disappointed the Committee on Procedure has not yet allowed an invitation to be sent to President Puigdemont to address the Seanad.  We should not be bossed around by anybody about who can or cannot speak in this Parliament. </p> <p>I support calls for international mediation, including the calls made by Kofi Annan and the Elders and Amnesty International.  We must recognise that this is an international issue of fundamental human and civil rights.  We cannot be bystanders in this case which is a challenge to the basic principles of democracy.  If it were to happen here, we would seek support internationally.  We had to call for international support to mediate in this country in the past and this is what all 7 million Catalans are calling for.  Ireland has been, and is viewed as, an honest broker and we have a good reputation internationally with regard to peacekeeping.  We could and should play a role in helping to facilitate a process of dialogue.  We must wake up to what is taking place without being afraid to call it out. </p></speech>

Many of the points I wished to make have been made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh so that should be possible.</p>  <p>We have heard many references to the rule of law being invoked as if it is a magic card that can be played.  The rule of law has a context.  We are duty bound to protect and support a rule of law that is linked with a democracy and respects human rights in a free civil society.  Many countries have a rule of law and those of us who have travelled internationally will have visited some where the rule of law is imposed and does not have regard to considerations of self-determination, democracy, human rights or civil society.  Let us not use the term "rule of law" in a blanket manner and instead be clear about what type of rule of law we mean. </p>  <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh eloquently highlighted an area of immense concern for people in Ireland and the rest of Europe.  We need international law, international human rights law and respect for freedom of expression, assembly and self-determination.  There is no doubt the actions taken by the police, at the direction of the Spanish Government, against those who were voting or seeking to vote in the recent referendum in Catalonia violated human rights.  The evidence was provided by those from Ireland who were in Catalonia and it was visible internationally.  The response of the European Union, including Ireland, has not been adequate.  Prime Minister Rajoy has spoken of the "firmness" and "serenity" shown by the police in their actions.  We have heard discussion in the Oireachtas about the violence but we have not had a strong message from Europe properly condemning the violence, demanding action in response to it and asking whether our concerns about human rights breaches are being addressed.  The message we sent to the Spanish Government was one of impunity for its actions.</p>  <p>The Government has spoken at length about its concerns about the rise of populism and there is constant discussion about the importance of the centre holding.  However, a blind eye is being turned in the face of authoritarianism, which is, in many cases, a much greater danger than populism.  Authoritarianism, which is bound into the rise of populism, is on the rise in Poland, Hungary and Austria where far right parties may be part of the next government.  We know what authoritarianism looks like as we saw it in Catalonia, not only in the actions taken on the day of the referendum but also in the shutting down of websites and the arrests of civil society leaders on charges of sedition.  We have seen this play book enacted in many parts of the world.  Why do we not speak up against it when it takes place in Europe?</p>  <p>The task of peace building in Europe has been deeply neglected in recent years.  Securing borders, the predominant narrative, fits in with the narrative of policing and might is right.  The diplomatic skills required to meet the challenge of having people who disagree with each other find ways to engage in dialogue and build peace together seem to have been forgotten and neglected.  The challenge of peace building was the reason for European integration in the first place.</p>  <p>Of all countries, Ireland, with its legacy of building peace and experience of war, cannot wash its hands of the task of peace building and promoting diplomacy.  There is no doubt that dialogue, space and time are needed.  When President Puigdemont chose not to immediately implement the decision on independence and stood back from the brink at the request of Europe, he created a space for diplomacy and dialogue.  This window of weeks has been used by Spain to make arrests of civil society leaders, hold further trials and engage in more sabre rattling.</p>  <p>The threat to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution is extremely dangerous.  Regardless of whether one attributes credibility to the results of the referendum, the people of Catalonia voted for the Catalan Parliament and Mr. Puigdemont as their President.  Invoking Article 155 sends a direct message to those in Catalonia that their vote is being disregarded.  This message will drive a further wedge between Catalonia and Spain. </p>  <p>I am sad to see fragmentation in Europe.  I would like to have a Europe of strong, autonomous regions which can work together.  What we should see in Spain is a credible coming together of regions of different cultural traditions and with different backgrounds and working together with respect and in autonomy.  What we have saw in 2012, however, was a push by Prime Minister Rajoy to diminish autonomy when he used the issue as a political football for electoral purposes.  Europe stood back and did nothing because during the period of austerity, important issues such as Europe of the regions, ensuring an equitable spread of development and prioritising measures to support social cohesion were pushed to the side for the sake of short-term national fiscal targets.  This has exacerbated tensions in regions across Europe.</p>  <p>I am concerned by the outcome of votes in Lombardy and other parts of Europe.  When Europe's wealthy countries failed to send a signal solidarity to the poorer countries of Europe and we have, at the highest level, President Macron and, to some extent, Chancellor Merkel, speaking about a two-speed Europe, we send a message that might is right and the wealthiest must look out for themselves.  This is the signal we also send to wealthy regions in countries which may wish to pull away and emulate the type of division we have seen.  The fragmentation of Europe is a real and dangerous threat and we need to step up to the challenge.  We cannot wash our hands of this issue.  Ireland should step forward and insist on a strong chastisement of the actions taken by Spain.  We must also put ourselves forward as an honest broker and offer ourselves as a mediator or demand a non-EU external mediator.</p></speech>

Like other Members, I know Spain well from many visits there.  The eruption of this constitutional crisis is shocking.  It was particularly shocking to see the violence that erupted on 1 October and the heavy-handed response by Prime Minister Rajoy and the Spanish Government.  It clearly inflamed the crisis and strengthened the independence movement.  We should hear stronger words of condemnation from the Government of the actions of the Spanish Government.  That is crucial.  The scenes were shocking, as was the fact that 900 people were injured.  The subsequent political arrests of pro-independence people were also shocking.  It was an inflammatory move by Prime Minister Rajoy.  He and his Government have mishandled the separatist question as a result.</p>  <p>That said, I certainly would not support a unilateral declaration of independence by Catalonia.  Like my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I disagree with those in this House and elsewhere who call for unthinking support for Catalonian independence.  We must also be clear that the so-called independence referendum took place outside a constitutional framework and that independent observers declared that it did not meet the standards required and so forth.  However, Prime Minister Rajoy's response was appalling.  There has not been sufficiently strong condemnation of the violence by the central government from our Government.</p>  <p>Furthermore, this issue is continuing to unfold.  There are ongoing developments.  Tomorrow, the Parliament of Catalonia will meet to decide on its response to the threat of direct rule from Spain, another heavy-handed tactic on the part of the Spanish Government, after which the Spanish Senate will return to the matter.  The strongest words of wisdom are the words of The Elders who spoke through their chairman, Kofi Annan: "The constitutional crisis that is unfolding in Spain calls for consultation and not confrontation."  The Elders have urged the Spanish Government and the regional government of Catalonia to renew their commitment to a resolution through dialogue and to find a peaceful path.  One thing we in Ireland know is the importance of peaceful dialogue.</p>  <p>As Europeans, we have lessons to learn from what occurred in the former Yugoslavia and, indeed, from what has been happening more recently in Crimea and Ukraine in terms of declarations of independence and the assertion of rights of self-determination that have consequences, may be complex and have to be navigated and negotiated through peaceful means.  That is very important.</p>  <p>I also refer to the recent statement by the president of the Party of European Socialists who criticised both sides in this dispute, pointing out that by calling an illegal referendum Catalonian nationalists tried to bend the rule of law to their advantage but by hiding behind police and the judiciary the Spanish Government stretched Spain's institutions, gave up on politics and fed extremist positions in both camps.  Ireland should condemn the Spanish Government's inflammatory moves and seek to encourage all involved to work towards a peaceful resolution.</p>  <p>Finally, it is not good enough for the European Commission to describe the crisis as an internal matter for the Spanish.  In the past we saw the EU fail in its response to the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia.  The EU must recognise that this is an important matter which cannot simply be brushed aside.  It is more than an internal matter, particularly when we see the police tactics used on the streets of Barcelona.  There is a middle ground.  Many people in Catalonia would not have supported the vote for independence and did not turn out on 1 October for that reason.  Equally, they were disgusted by the Spanish Government's tactics.</p>  <p>There must be stronger words from Ireland and a strong indication of our support for any peaceful attempts to resolve this crisis, recognising, of course, that there are ongoing issues and that the crisis is unfolding as we speak.</p></speech>

I feel very strongly about this subject.  The reason is that I, like many others, witnessed Catalan women being dragged, kicked and assaulted on the referendum polling day.  It would not be right for me as an Irish woman parliamentarian not to speak out on the subject.</p>  <p>What efforts have been made by the Government to call for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalonian administrations?  The response of the Government is indistinguishable from the Partido Popular's Government line.  As a people recently familiar with the importance of open dialogue for resolving political disputes we should be seen to forward a solution-based negotiation.  The Taoiseach's recent comments on the possible Border poll under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement have not helped the situation.  Referendums are a democratic expression of political will and should be treated with due respect.</p>  <p>There is an urgent need now for dialogue.  It is clear that the Spanish Government will not initiate or facilitate this.  It is up to the EU leaders, therefore, to ensure that the collective pressure of the EU is used.  The Taoiseach should demand this at the next EU Council meeting.  Whatever anybody's views on the demand for Catalonian independence are, there is an irrefutable electoral mandate there and it should be respected.  This mandate should form the basis of negotiations without preconditions.  The Spanish Government's position of pretending that the referendum never happened is not tenable.  The first step it must take is to acknowledge the support for independence.  I remind the Spanish Government and the EU that this was a key moment for Catalan independence.  I would almost go so far as to say that it assures independence in the same way as young people and others across this island were politicised in 1920 after the first Bloody Sunday, in 1972, 1981 and 1916.  In all cases people were politicised and motivated.  I foresee the same thing happening again.</p>  <p>However, the imposition of direct rule by Madrid is folly, as is direct rule being imposed in the North.  We cannot sit on our hands.  We must play an honest and active role in protecting human and civil rights.</p></speech>

Ireland has always worked constructively with the Spanish Government to build bilateral and trade relations and to pursue our common goals at both EU and international levels.  Of course, we are monitoring developments in Spain closely so we can better understand our EU partner.  We are paying particular attention to any potential impact that events might have on Irish citizens.  The Department is following developments closely and is responding to the concerns of Irish citizens both in the Houses and outside.</p>  <p>The Government continues to give this matter its full attention.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, spoke on the matter in the Topical Issue debate on 21 September.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, have spoken with the Spanish ambassador on the issue.  There were statements in the D&aacute;il yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I am happy to have the opportunity to update the House this afternoon.  The Taoiseach discussed Catalonia with Prime Minister Rajoy on the margins of the recent European Council.  I and the Government condemn the violence that occurred on 1 October.  The Government is very clear that there is no room for violence in politics and it is important that there should be no repeat of that violence.  Such actions are counterproductive.  Political progress must be pursued through dialogue.</p>  <p>The Government supports a resolution to the current situation that is based on democracy and the rule of law.  I reiterate the Government's position that this must be determined by Spain and its people based on the rule of law and through their institutions.  It is through such democratic processes that all voices can be heard and a way forward found.  Of all nations in the EU, we should understand that.  We are now entering a phase where there is potential for confrontation.  None of us wishes to see further clashes or injuries such as those that occurred earlier this month.  Dialogue is the way forward so there can be a peaceful outcome.</p></speech>
