Yesterday, an answer was provided to a parliamentary question in the other House.  A report undertaken by the company of the chairman of the west north-west hospitals group led to his resignation and proposed, among other things, the closure of maternity units in Sligo, Castlebar, Letterkenny and Ballinasloe.  After we highlighted this in the question it emerged that incorrect procedures had been followed in putting the report together.  Then, it emerged that the report was going to be shelved and, in the words of the Minister of the day, subsumed into the national review.  This emerged from the answer yesterday by the Minister as well as the extraordinary admission that the review of maternity services nationally has yet to begin.  One wonders how it is possible to subsume a report which sought to close units in parts of the country into a national review that has yet to begin.</p><p>The current mothers and prospective mothers of Ireland are entitled to know just what the Government is planning.  Clearly, we exposed a plan, sanctioned or otherwise, to dismantle the existing obstetrician-led maternity services in the west north-west hospitals group.  Is this the plan nationally?  What is informing this plan?  When, in fact, do the Government and the Minister plan to establish the review, in respect of which he has misled the House in the past to the effect that it was already under way?  I believe the people are entitled to know.</p><p>There is an issue with the property tax and the collection of same staying with the local authorities of origin.  We seek a debate on the issue because throughout the country there are local authorities, some of which have an extraordinarily high rate base, including, for example, Fingal County Council, which is alleged to have more than &euro;100 million on deposit.  However, there other authorities throughout the country which have followed the policy of this and previous Governments, in particular, in trying to live up to their obligations under the national spatial strategy and which went into extraordinary debt to accumulate land to try to meet the ambitions as set down by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  On the one hand there are local authorities that might have, for example, Dublin Airport within the rate base.  Let us compare this with where I am from in Sligo.  One corner of the former authority probably has more of a rate base than the entirety of County Sligo.  It has all this money on deposit.  Then there are other counties in need of funds.</p><p>Central government says it will take those funds now and use them or put them into the black hole of the Exchequer to fill deficits in health and so on.  This is wrong and it requires a debate.  The people are entitled to participate in this debate before the Government simply decides to take the money.  We should have those debates.  In particular, I seek clarity before the recess on the debacle which is the review of maternity services.  It is nine months since we had the report following the high-profile case of Savita Halappanavar.  Furthermore, the report in respect of west north-west hospitals group has been discredited.  We need to know exactly what the Government is planning in this regard.  Why have we not had a review before now?  Why is the Government at this stage admitting that it has not done it?  I am keen for a debate on these two issues before the recess, if possible.</p></speech>

I also welcome the substantial and packed programme of the Taoiseach today relating to economic promotion in Germany.  It is so important for the country.  For example, he will be addressing 2,000 leading German business people and he is taking part in a separate trade and investment event.  I believe all this activity, together with the other items on his agenda today, including a meeting with Angela Merkel, will further enhance our existing strong trade links.</p><p>I am proud of the fact that in my part of Ireland we have the great German firm - we have had it since 1958 -  Liebherr Ireland Limited, where 700 people are employed.  Separately, there are three hotels with over 200 people further employed, namely, the Europe, Dunloe and Ard na Sidhe hotels.</p></speech>

I have witnessed this myself having met people who come from Germany to visit Liebherr Ireland Limited and who are doing business with the company from all over the world.  What the Taoiseach has done today is of tremendous value and importance and I greatly welcome it.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we used to have local services and water.  They were paid for by general taxation.  We have been told that it makes sense to have a water tax to link consumption of water to what we pay for water, and I totally understand that.  However, surely the money that people paid in tax that used to be for water should no longer have to be paid since they are now paying for it through their water tax.  People's tax bill should go down by the corresponding amount.  Otherwise, it simply becomes an extra bonanza for the Government.</p><p>We read this morning that we have basically built in a disincentive to efficiency and cost control in our local authorities by the approach taken to high-spending local authorities which may not be giving sufficient attention to how they shepherd their principal resource, namely, the money given to them by their citizens.  We are told that if they do a bad job and spend prolifically then they can always get topped up by the neighbouring council, which may be doing a somewhat better job in shepherding these resources.  To me, the logic is, put simply, that if a local authority charges a certain amount of tax and finds that it is surplus to requirements, it should refund the tax.</p> <p>I could understand if some of the money was used in the context of the current national health emergency to pay for health services which are being run down.  That would save lives.  However, I cannot understand handing it over to the next local authority which is not doing a particularly good job in managing its resources.  I join Senator Marc MacSharry in asking for a full-blooded debate on the issue, many of the implications of which have not been worked out.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 11, Defamation (Amendment) Bill 2014, be taken before No. 1 today.</p></speech>

Anyone who knows his writing will know that references to "the physicality of his language" are most appropriate.  He was very much inspired by living in Sligo, having been born in County Westmeath and lived in County Cavan and, for a long time, London.  He came to love the rugged coast of County Sligo and always spoke about the solitude of the place inspiring his later works.  He was a friend and someone who cared very much about his work, albeit he is said to have said, "I know that I write, but I still don't see myself as a writer."  He was a member of Aosd&aacute;na and the best way to describe him would be as a "literary genius".  His loss is our loss.  I pay tribute to his work and express my condolences to his family, wide circle of friends and the literary community.</p></speech>

There are probably 50,000 undocumented Irish scattered across the United States of America.  We all lobby hard to regularise their position and obtain green cards and, if they want to stay there, citizenship for them.  It is an ongoing lobby, in which many Members have been involved, particularly Senator Mark Daly whose efforts over many years I laud.  We would all welcome progress.  However, there must be a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  If a US citizen tries to get a work visa or go a step further and obtain a residence permit or citizenship in Ireland, he or she has as good a chance as a resident of Mars.  Let us be real.  I have come across a case involving a very well qualified young man who has been going out with an Irish girl for eight years and plans to marry.  However, they do not want to marry for the reason of obtaining a citizenship right.  It is not the first case I have come across, although they are few and far between.  We must be honest.  We go to Washington on a regular basis to lobby American politicians to give the Irish a break, yet, whether one is an American citizen or from outer Mongolia, the heart of Africa, Mars or the moon, one has the same chance here.  That is the reality.  Why do we not get a grip on it, given that the numbers involved are very small?  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should take a serious look at the issue.  There is no <i>quid pro quo</i>and we are not appraising the matter according to the reality.  It is an absolute disgrace that we fight hard to have our young people who are scattered across the USA regularised with green cards which allow them to work, live and travel back and forth, whereas we give the two fingers to any American male or female who comes here, notwithstanding that he or she can survive on his or her own income here.  It is about time we faced up to the issue and were not disingenuous in going to Washington to say, &quot;Help our young Irish,&quot; while failing to give one iota of a chance to the few young Americans who come here.  It is a bad signal to send when we are looking for results on the other side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300004#C00400"><p>I would welcome a debate on the property tax, particularly the equalisation fund local authorities always had.  We should include the devolution of functions to local authorities and performance indicators, which were referred to by Senator John Crown.  There are 42 performance indicators by which every local authority is judged.  I would like them to be included in the analysis when we have the debate and to ensure they are used in spreading the money across the country.  The debate is that, of course, one has high density urban build-up and strong intensification of industry in particular areas.  However, that has always been the case, which is why there has been an equalisation fund.  We must ensure that when it is changed and power is given to councillors, the devolution of functions we have always sought is used properly.  I would welcome such a debate.</p><p>I wish to ensure water safety is brought to the fore in the House.  Of late we have seen many deaths by drowning, particularly in Dublin.  There are now more drownings inland than in the sea.  There were over 200 cases.  There are now more drownings than people killed on the roads.  It is a very serious issue.  I compliment Irish Water Safety's summer safety programme which is launched every year, but note that it does not receive enough publicity.  We are always told of the need to be aware and safe on the roads, in which regard I commend the Road Safety Authority.  I saw that Jedward had to be rescued on Wednesday by a helicopter and ten people.  Having gone for a walk along the coast at Malahide, they became stranded.  Naturally, they contacted Mammy who is always the first port of call and then the sea rescue services.  A helicopter and ten people had to come to rescue them.  Water safety services cost a lot and I want to ensure Irish Water Safety is properly funded.  We should have a debate on water safety, the relevant authorities and the need for education and publicity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300004#C00500"><p>In the post-troika era as the Government plans a reshuffle and the programme for the remainder of its term of office, I ask that we debate in the House the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is not just that he should investigate financial mishaps after they happen, he also has a role as a national auditor.  I hope the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, will come to the House to debate how best we might cost projects and obtain measures and benefits.  We have dropped the regulatory impact assessments that used to accompany the explanatory memorandums of Bills and must keep an eye on expenditure matters.</p><p>I welcome the successful talks which took place in London yesterday between the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and Sinn F&eacute;in.  It raises the question for the House of how we can contribute to the peace process.  We on this side have asked that the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland be invited to attend, but that has not happened.  We had a very successful visit by the Orange Order.  I hope next week will see a peaceful marching season.  Should we reopen the invitation to the Orange Order?</p><p>I pay tribute to Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn who yesterday announced his retirement as Minister for Education and Skills.  He has had a remarkable career in the Oireachtas for over 40 years.  Committed, hard-working and a deep thinker, he was a very good friend of this House.  In fact, his was one of the leading constituencies in supporting the retention of the House in the referendum held last October.  Are these events connected?  I think they are.  More recently, we remarked on the success of SUSI in what transpires was his farewell address to the House last Tuesday.  The scheme of grants for students in higher education had a very rocky launch last year, but this year only ten complaints are being investigated by the Ombudsman.  Given that 160,000 persons are eligible, it is a huge improvement.  The Minister was also associated with the improvements in mathematics papers, particularly in the leaving certificate examination.  There were no disputes in that context this year after a rather frantic session which had left hundreds of thousands of young people better off.</p> <p>The Minister steps down to great accolades for his performance in many years of public service to this country.</p></speech>

Like Senator Barrett, I was also present and was delighted to lead for the Labour Party in the motion on education the other day, which turned out to be the Minister's last debate here.  The motion before the House was successful, which signifies the way in which the Minister carried out his business in this House.  As everybody has said, he was certainly a reforming Minister and someone who changed the face of education in this country.  As a former teacher, I appreciate the work he has done, as will many of my colleagues in the long run when everybody looks in the cold light of day at the positive things he has done, particularly in the area of pluralism, patronage and SUSI.  We saw how he took on the problems in SUSI last year and how they were rectified.  This year, 168,000 people have been successful with relatively few problems.</p><p>In light of that, I wish to raise the closure of All Hallows College, which was announced a few weeks ago.  I have received representations from students attending the college who are very concerned about the future of their education.  I understand that a meeting was held last week with the students and guidance counsellors of the college to provide a further update on the future of their courses.  The students were given some indication that they would be able to continue their education at the college for another year but were not given anything concrete.  Students were also advised that it might be best if they applied to another university or college, but the only university still accepting applications is NUI Maynooth.  If accepted to other third-level institutions, students may be required to repeat their first year, which in turn would make them ineligible for a SUSI grant.  This is certainly an unexpected consequence and I urge the Leader to contact the incoming Minister for Education and Skills and the Department to ask them to look into the matter on behalf of the students at All Hallows College.  We have seen some assistance provided to students at the recently closed English language schools in Dublin and I would ask that the same consideration be given to the students at All Hallows College.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300005#D00500"><p>I would like the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss SI No. 226/2014.  The issue has been highlighted by Senator Daly over a long period because most legislation is by way of statutory instruments and does not come here for scrutiny.  By coincidence, this statutory instrument came into force on 1 June 2014, days after the local elections.  It was signed before then.  It specifically allows local authorities to collect rates on vacant buildings under section 5 of the particular Act.  This is causing deep concern to people who are trying to rent their properties.  There are many streets with vacant premises due to the economic downturn and the lack of initiative by the Government, yet the Minister has decided to allow local authorities to collect rates on those buildings as if they were trading.  It has been the tradition that where a building was vacant, it was not rated for the period during which it was empty.  I have experienced it myself.  The minute a building starts trading, one is in a position to provide funds to the rating authority and to pay the rates.  This is an illogical move that is causing great distress to many property owners the length and breadth of Ireland.  Many of them have properties that have been empty for the past seven years, yet the local authorities will now be empowered under this statutory instrument to collect rates from those buildings even though their owners have no particular income.  This is why it is important that we have a debate with the current Minister, who will be nominated as a European Commissioner next week, at which point there will be a new Minister.  The point is that each council must assess the situation, and where councils do not collect this money the Department can reduce their block grant, so it is a very serious issue.  I would like the Minister to give guidance to local authorities and explain the situation here before he departs for greener lands next week or in October 2014.</p></speech>

The cancellation of that day, which is essentially an anniversary marking the birth of an alcoholic beverage, has been welcomed by many organisations, including Alcohol Action Ireland, which recently revealed that ambulance calls were up by 30% on that day.  That organisation also recently highlighted our dangerous relationship with alcohol, and this was just another reason for people to drink.  I am in two minds about Diageo's new initiative, Amplify, which is an effort to support Irish artists.  I would always welcome this, but I am in two minds about it because it is alcohol sponsorship.</p><p>I support Senator Keane's comments regarding water safety.  We need to raise awareness of this issue.  An interesting but worrying report by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland showed that 60% of people over 60 drank during the course of their prescriptions.  As we know, alcohol can interact harmfully with some prescription medications and cause negative side effects.  This ties in with Senator MacSharry's Bill yesterday relating to suicide.  We had a very good discussion about suicide and the significant role of alcohol was part of the debate.  The figures were also high for people taking anti-epileptic or anti-psychotic drugs.  Even though people are forbidden from drinking while using these drugs, a huge percentage of people drink when they are on that type of medication.  No more than Senator Keane's call for advertising and awareness about water safety, we should consider an information campaign on this issue to highlight the dangers so that people are aware of what they are doing.</p></speech>

I do not agree that we should allow the motion on Eurodac through without a debate.  There are a number of issues around it that should be debated fully in the House, so I ask the Acting Leader to reconsider that and give us time to debate that motion.</p><p>By tomorrow evening the Labour Party will have a new leader, who may be Deputy Joan Burton.  We do not know who it will be.  It is quite ironic that she may be moving away from the portfolio of social protection the day after 5,000 lone parents lose their one parent family payment.  I hope that anybody in the Labour Party who has voted for Deputy Burton to be the leader of the party has not taken her promises too seriously.  If one looks back, one will see that the changes to the eligibility criteria were announced in 2012 and are coming into effect now.  Under the new rules introduced as part of the budget in 2012, welfare payments were only to be paid to parents whose youngest child was aged seven or less.  The age limit has been reduced year on year from 14 in 2011, and the move will affect an estimated 9,000 families this year and 60,000 by July 2015, when children under the age of seven will lose their eligibility.  </p><p>At the time, I listened to the Minister with a number of lone parents on the day she announced this change.  She made a promise that the measure would not proceed until a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries to whose social protection systems we aspire, was in place.  The cut is coming into effect today, so where is the Scandinavian-style child care system that was promised by the Minister at the time?  The organisation Single Parents Raising Kids claims that the 800 after-school child care places provided for low-income families under the subsidised after-school child care scheme are nowhere near what is needed to assist the 60,000 families affected.  No additional training or employment supports have been provided for lone parents and they do not have sufficient child care, so how can they avail of opportunities?</p> <p>I am calling as a matter of urgency for a debate with whoever will be Minister for Social Protection after the reshuffle to have these cuts reversed until we have in place the Scandinavian child care system promised by the Government.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice and Equality is refusing this man a visa to come to the country for four days to view the product the Galway company has to offer.  It is time the Department started to think about jobs.  We have an unemployment crisis, yet it is refusing this company the opportunity to create a large number of jobs in the country, for what reason I have no idea.  The Deputy Leader might bring this issue to the fore in order that we can have a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality to find out what is going on.  If the man in question wanted a visa to travel to any other European country, he would have it in four days.  In this country, however, for reasons that are a mystery to most Iraqis and Saudis, it takes 12 or 14 weeks.  Then for some unknown reason the person concerned is refused and has to go through an appeals process, by which stage the business could be lost.  The only option open to the company in question is to either go through the appeals process which could take months and again end in refusal, or else move to the United Kingdom to do business with the man mentioned.  I call on the Deputy Leader to bring the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House in order that we can get answers to all of these questions.  I find it particularly difficult to deal with the Department of Justice and Equality when it comes to visa applications.  When people are refused and a politician is brought into the mix to try to deal with these guys, it becomes even more frustrating.  I call on the Deputy Leader to solve this problem in some shape or form.</p></speech>

At the same time, she might call for a moratorium on such appointments.  Of the 1,300 appointments made by the Government, only 28% of the positions were filled after being publicly advertised, despite the Government's continued promises in the run-up to the general election that there would be openness and transparency.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, called for a moratorium in 2010, but there is a deafening silence from him now as he watches his fellow Cabinet members breaking their own promise of transparency in appointments to State boards.</p><p>Another promise broken by the Government concerns the deaf community.  The Government stated it would allocate resources to members of the disabled and deaf community and examine mechanisms to provide for the recognition of Irish Sign Language, yet the funding allocated, in particular for the advocacy service, was cut.  I know an apology has since issued in which the people concerned were asked to call the Department, but that is the equivalent of telling a person who is illiterate to write a letter.  This shows why the funding needs to be reinstated because it is the advocacy service of the people concerned and it deals with Departments on behalf of the most vulnerable and those who find it most difficult to communicate with them.</p><p>I also seek a debate on the matter raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien yesterday concerning the 1916 Rising.  When Henry Grattan talked about an Irish Parliament up to 1800, he lambasted those who were satisfied with the granting of economic opportunity.  He talked about an independent and free parliament.  We have a former Taoiseach who seemed to be quite happy with Home Rule and was a great admirer of John Redmond.  Let me remind colleagues what Home Rule would have brought.  It would not have brought control of our own foreign policy which would have remained with Westminster, rather it would have bought limited powers of taxation, with 42 MPs still sitting at Westminster.</p></speech>

The Irish Road Haulage Association wants the regime to be changed to a pay-as-you-go system similar to those in place in other European countries.  Our motor tax rates for HGVs are completely out of kilter with those of our near neighbour and European counterparts.  It costs &euro;4,000 per annum to tax a HGV in Ireland, whereas across the Border in Northern Ireland it costs &pound;850, or less than &euro;1,200, per annum.  As a result, almost 25% of hauliers have already moved their businesses to Northern Ireland, with an estimated 4,000 registered vehicles in Northern Ireland, Britain, Bulgaria and Belgium.  In addition, our international fleet is paying on the double when carrying out international haulage work by having to pay road tax in Ireland and a road user charge elsewhere in Europe, as well as a &pound;10 levy in Britain and Northern Ireland.  I am sad to say it is now more financially rewarding for hauliers to base themselves elsewhere.  Last January the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, set up an interdepartmental group to assess the implications of introducing a pay-as-you-go road tax system for HGVs.  I understand a report from the group is to be published at the end of next month and will outline a number of options to ensure transport costs do not have a negative impact on Irish businesses.</p></speech>

One concerns the property tax and the confusion surrounding it.  After all, this is a tax that affects every home in the country.  Aligned with it, we need more detail on water charges which will definitely affect every citizen in the country.  Furthermore, the debate called for by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on lone parent families is critical.  The cut to the allowance is to take effect from tomorrow.  I tabled this matter for discussion on the Adjournment last week as a serious anomaly has been missed by the relevant Minister, as a result of which if a lone parent works 20 hours a week, he or she will lose &euro;70 of the allowance.  This is a clear disincentive to work and we all said we were against such disincentives.  Let us face up to this problem.</p><p>My main reason for speaking is to pay tribute to the Minister for Education and Skills.  I believe he was right to make a dignified exit on his own terms after a very long and remarkable 40 year career in politics.</p> <p>His role as Minister for Finance in the mid 1990s, in which he did a very fine job in a coalition Government, stands out.  As Minister for Education and Skills I have both agreed and disagreed with him.  I served with him on the Oireachtas committee in the previous Government and completely disagreed with him on rural schools.  However, I thought his reform of the junior certificate was well intentioned and I welcomed his examination of the need for creativity and critical thinking.  I decried his lack of-----</p></speech>

Why is ComReg allowing the PSO levy to be increased over a four-year period by 250% while international electricity prices are decreasing?  The money goes to two main recipients, namely, the country's peat plants and renewable energy.  The vast majority of the money goes to fund developers and investors when wind turbines do not go around.  When the wind does not blow, the PSO levy collected from all the houses in the country will cover the losses of developers and speculators.</p><p>It is outrageous and disgraceful that ComReg is proposing the increase.  This is the commission that has been given responsibility for pricing our water.  How could anyone have any faith in the organisation?  I have made a submission and I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the new Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, whoever it is, to the House next week to discuss the issue.  It is totally unacceptable.  These faceless people in ComReg came before an Oireachtas committee this week and were able to provide no answers whatsoever on water pricing.  Serious questions remain to be asked.  There is a conflict of interest in which the Minister is involved.  We must have a wider debate on where the PSO levy money goes.</p></speech>

These people have injected an element of Dublin versus rural Ireland into the property tax issue, no doubt as a last-ditch effort to save their seats in the face of angry and betrayed constituents, and I find it disgusting.  I call on the Deputy Leader to urgently seek a debate in the House on property tax with the Minister responsible for local government.  It is Government policy to allow 80% of the tax to remain within the local authority area in which it is collected.  While this will be good for Dublin councils, the property tax base in rural Ireland, in places such as in Roscommon, is narrower and there will be a requirement to equalise and support the funds going to these areas to ensure regional equality.  I hope there is no rural phobia - I do not what the word is - among these middle-class Labour Party Deputies.  We need a debate to ensure there is proper solidarity among the regions of the country.</p></speech>

He has replaced dilapidated prefabricated buildings throughout the country with bricks and mortar, which was sidestepped by many previous Ministers for education.  As a former primary teacher who had the fantastic privilege of teaching junior infants, I came to know a certain number of nursery rhymes.<blockquote><br />Little Jack Horner<br />Sat in a corner,<br />Eating his Christmas pie;<br />He put in his thumb,<br />And pulled out a plum,<br />And said, &quot;What a good boy am I.&quot;</blockquote></p></speech>

Maybe the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is putting himself in line for the position.</p><p>No. 22 on the Order Paper should be taken today as a matter of great urgency.  It is a Bill which would give proper scrutiny to a position which, as reported in yesterday's Irish Independent in an article about M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn's pay-off and pension, is worth &euro;250,000 per annum to the recipient and has tremendous implications for the Irish people.  The appointment to the position should be scrutinised properly by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I propose that No. 22 be taken today as a matter of great urgency.</p></speech>

I spoke on the matter last week.  The purpose of our proposing No. 22 was to try to do politics slightly differently and ensure that a job as important as the Irish position on the European Commission would not simply be part of a game of political snakes and ladders but would be debated in detail and scrutinised in full.  Thus we in this House, our colleagues in the other House and, more importantly, the Irish people who foot the bill through their taxes could be satisfied that we will send a candidate to Brussels in whom we have confidence and pride, and that we would not use the European Commission as a political dumping ground for someone we want to get off the domestic political pitch.</p><p>Various names have been mentioned and they have their pluses and minuses.  We are entitled to sit down with the proposed candidate in this House and the D&aacute;il and fully debate the suitability of the appointment.  I need not remind my colleagues of appointments made during the 1980s and 1990s which we, wearing different political hats, saw as political stunts.  I want to ensure that whoever is sent to Brussels on behalf of the Irish Government and people goes with the full support and goodwill of both Houses.  It is not too much to ask for a debate on the matter.  We will have a Cabinet reshuffle in the next week and perhaps this appointment will be part of the game of chess.  It is a significant appointment.  As Senator Heffernan pointed out, the person will receive an annual salary of approximately &euro;250,000, significant pension entitlements, and Mercs and perks on an unprecedented scale.</p> <p>We must ensure the right person is appointed.  We should surely have a debate on the issue in the House.  I, therefore, formally support the request and amendment proposed by Senator James Heffernan.</p></speech>

The words "disgraceful behaviour" have been used by my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il in this respect.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on renewable energy and public subsidisation in general.  I wonder if my colleagues also criticise so heavily the 1992 reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, otherwise known as the "MacSharry reforms", which introduced a measure providing that 15% of all arable land be set aside and for payments to be received for not producing on this land.  There is a social good in this regard in the same manner as there is a social good in subsidising capital investment in renewable energy production in the longer term.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on the matter as called for by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.</p></speech>

I saw the headline, but I am not sure what is the status of that report.  I will be happy to ask the Leader to arrange a debate on maternity services and whatever review is taking place.  I can check its status.  I was concerned to see the headline on the delay in establishing the expert group, as I understand it.  Following the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, we had all hoped a proper review of maternity services nationally would be carried out.  </p><p>The Senator also called for a debate on the local property tax.  Such a debate was sought by Senator Darragh O'Brien yesterday.  I have already asked the Leader's office to secure a debate on it, in particular the role of local authorities.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the fall in the unemployment figures.  It is extremely welcome to see a fall of 1.7% in the standardised unemployment rate compared to the figure for last year and a fall of 4.4% in the number of long-term unemployed.  That means that we have witnessed a decline in unemployment in two successive years.  This is very welcome, although clearly much more needs to be done.  </p><p>The Senator also welcomed the Taoiseach's visit to Germany today and the work he will be doing there in encouraging greater trade links with Germany.  We all welcome this work. </p><p>Senator John Crown asked for a debate on the local property tax.  As I said, I have already sought such a debate.  </p><p>The Senator also requested that No. 11 on the Order Paper, Defamation (Amendment) Bill, be taken before No. 1.  I am happy to agree to that amendment.</p></speech>

Many Members paid tribute to him on the Order of Business on Tuesday when I referred to his poem <i>Serenity</i>which was published in<i>The Irish Times</i>on that day which presented his work at its best.  We all join the Senator in sending condolences to his family and friends.<br />Senator Denis O'Donovan asked for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to be invited to come to the House to discuss the relationship between the United States and Ireland.  That matter was raised earlier this week and I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste yesterday on foot of a request from Senator Paschal Mooney on the renewal of the graduate J1 visa scheme, in particular.  The Senator should have received a copy of that letter today.  He also referred to the need to ensure recognition for the undocumented Irish in the United States and the parallel issue of recognition for US citizens in Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste made a commitment that this would be one of the issues he would pursue most vigorously in his last weeks in office.  I know that he has been doing this and that he recently visited the United States to that end.  A citizenship ceremony for persons who have gained Irish citizenship will take place in the Convention Centre tomorrow.  It is one of the initiatives the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, introduced and which the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is continuing.  It has been a positive development.  Many people I know who have obtained citizenship at one of these ceremonies have spoken in positive terms about the experience.  It is a very important development compared to the technical, informal procedure whereby people claimed Irish citizenship at sittings of the District Court which was most unsatisfactory.<br />Senator C&aacute;it Keane also called for a debate on the property tax which, as I said, I have already sought.  She also called for a debate on water safety.  Her colleague, Senator Pat O'Neill, raised this matter on Tuesday.  We all wish to send our condolences to the families of the children who drowned so tragically earlier in the week, as well as to the families of the adults who drowned.  There have been some very tragic water safety-related incidents, including drownings.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred to the many rescues that had also taken place, including the high profile rescue of Jedward from a sandbank in Malahide.</p></speech>

We will seek a debate on the matter.  Senator Pat O'Neill asked for a debate on improving the education of school children in water safety, a matter on which we all agree with him.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett asked for a debate on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor.  I will seek such a debate.  He also referred to the successful talks in London this week between the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and Sinn F&eacute;in and the need to ensure a furthering of the peace process.  We all join him in wishing for a peaceful marching season as we enter that period of the year.  He also requested that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister be invited to come to the House.  We agreed to this at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and an invitation was sent.  I understand the committee will meet again next week when I will raise the issue.  I believe there was a difficulty in aligning the dates, but the matter is in hand.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett also paid tribute to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I am glad that so many colleagues have done so.  The Minister has had an immensely significant career of public service of nearly 40 years.  Colleagues have paid tribute to him for the role he played as Minister for Finance in the 1990s.  It was extremely successful and he left behind a budget surplus in building the core of proper and sustainable prosperity.  Also, there is his major reforming work as Minister for Education and Skills.  Senator Mary Moran referred to his introduction of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in the House on Tuesday evening.  One of his key attributes that we all appreciated as Senators and on which many colleagues have commented was introducing Bills in the Seanad on a regular basis on which we had very good debates.  The debate on the Bill mentioned was a very good one.  With his reforms on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector, SUSI and the student grants scheme, the initiatives on literacy and numeracy and mathematics, the teaching of junior cycle students and the restructuring of the VEC system, introduction of SOLAS and the education and training boards, he has had a transformative impact on the education sector in a short three year period, for which I pay him my own tribute.  As a former teacher,  Senator Mary Moran also paid tribute to him and said how much she appreciated his reforms.  She called for a resolution of the issue of the closure of All Hallows College to ensure, in particular, the students were not left high and dry.  I ask the Senator to table that matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  Talks are ongoing on it.  Like her, I commend the resolution of the issue of the closure of English language colleges for foreign language students who were accommodated by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Education and Skills in agreeing to a resolution method.  I hope we will see something similar happen in this case.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden asked for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss SI No. 226 of 2014, which allows local authorities to collect rates on vacant buildings.  It would be a good idea if the Senator tabled the matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  I had some success in the last session of the House with a former Minister for the Environment who amended a statutory instrument on dredging at Passage East, County Waterford, where a huge amount of damage was being done to the harbour.  Perhaps we are not using the Adjournment matters facility enough in dealing with statutory instruments.  They offer a real possibility in terms of change and I ask the Senator to consider using it.  I appreciate his predictive powers and crystal ball gazing in predicting the future of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, but I will pass over it.</p><p>Senator Catherine Noone welcomed the announcement that Diageo would not be running an Arthur's Day event again.  We all welcome this, given the concerns about binge drinking during that one day event in previous years.  As the Senator said, there is a doubt about the new initiative.  It would be much better to see an event supporting Irish music and artists being spread over one month.  The Senator also supported Senator C&aacute;it Keane in calling for a debate on water safety.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for a debate on the moiton dealing with Eurodac.  We had a full debate on the issue at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence yesterday.  I participated in the debate which continued for nearly an hour.  However, I have spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality about it and she has agreed to debate the issue again in the House today.  As colleagues will be aware, she will be in the House immediately after the Order of Business to take Committee Stage of the Irish Human Rights Equality Commission Bill and has very kindly has agreed to debate the motion dealing with Eurodac at the conclusion of Committee Stage.  We should be able to deal with the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill 2013 at 1.30 p.m.  I do not think there are many amendments to the Irish Human Rights Equality Commission Bill and colleagues should check the monitors to see when the debate on the motion dealing with Eurodac will commence. </p> <p>It will be taken immediately on conclusion of Committee Stage of the Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014.  I propose that amendment to the Order of Business on foot of a request from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  There is no doubt the Eurodac directive is important.  We did raise concerns with the Minister, which we can debate today.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh called also for a debate on lone parent allowance changes, lone parent families and child care.  I will certainly ask for that debate.  We had a full debate with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, during which she put the case very strongly that we need to move away from the current model, which has had very poor outcomes in terms of poverty for lone parents, who still remain in poverty despites decades of lone parent allowance.  The Minister's moves to ensure-----</p></speech>

The Senator spoke eloquently about how frustrating this is.  I ask him to table it as a matter on the Adjournment to the Minister for Justice and Equality, as that mechanism would provide a quicker response on the issue.</p><p>Senator Mark Daly raised the issue of appointments to State boards.  I gave a full answer to the Senator on this issue on Tuesday and have sought a debate on it.  He referred also to the ending of the Pobal grant for the Irish Deaf Society advocacy service.  I have raised that issue with Labour Party Ministers and, since Tuesday, I have got information on it.  I suggest the Senator write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, as I intend to do, to ask that he reconsider that grant.</p><p>Senator Daly referred to a debate on centenaries which Senator Darragh O'Brien had sought earlier in the week.  In fact, what Senator Darragh O'Brien sought, rather unusually, was to have the former Taoiseach Mr. John Bruton come to the House.  I suggested that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might consider that request.</p><p>Senator Terry Brennan called for a debate on a report due to be published next month on possible changes to motor tax for hauliers.  This issue was raised on Tuesday by Senator Michael Comiskey, at which time I suggested that he seek to raise it as a matter on the Adjournment.  After the report is published, it would be appropriate to raise it in September.</p><p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames raised the issue of the local property tax.  I have already sought that debate.  She called also for a debate on lone parent families.  I have already agreed to seek that debate.  The Senator also paid tribute to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, with which we would all like to join.</p><p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill called for a debate on energy prices in light of the consultation currently being carried out by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I will certainly ask if we may have that debate in due course.  I would suggest, however, that it might be appropriate to have the issue debated at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the first instance, as it may be possible to invite the Commission for Energy Regulation to appear before the committee.  It may have been done already but, if so, I am not aware of it.</p><p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen raised the issue of the local property tax and the motion tabled by four Labour Party Deputies.  I gave a full answer in the House on Wednesday on that issue.  The motivation behind the motion from the Deputies was to ensure that the tax is levied in a fair and progressive manner.  I think we would all agree with that view.   I overlooked the Senator's personal attacks on my Labour Party colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  I am not sure whether the reference to &quot;middle class&quot; was an insult, but it certainly sounded like one.</p></speech>

That is another important achievement that he has had.</p><p>Senator Heffernan called for an amendment to the Order of Business to debate No. 22 on the Order Paper, the Parliamentary Scrutiny of Appointments (European Commission) Bill 2014, today.  I cannot accede to that request.  I have already acceded to the request by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh to change the Order of Business.

The Government will bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context. The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will--<blockquote>(a) maintain and promote a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within the North of Ireland, and<br />(b) continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Is m&oacute;r agam &eacute; go bhfuil deis againn an Bhille seo a phl&eacute; ar&iacute;s eile.  We raised our concerns previously with the Minister about the amalgamation's impact on the Good Friday Agreement and all it has striven to achieve.  As such, we have tabled this amendment.  Paragraph (b) is particularly pertinent, given the delicate negotiations on legacy issues that are ongoing in the North, for example, flags, etc.  We can never take for granted that the peace process will stay firm.  While it is everyone's intention that the process be maintained and every effort be taken to ensure that all agreements are held to fully and both Governments play their role, we fear that this Bill dilutes the understandings on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement and the way the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, does its work.  We have tabled our amendment to reiterate the importance of these matters and we want the Minister to take it on board, as the Bill is a retrograde step in this context.  No chances can be taken with the maintenance of peace and good relations between all traditions on the island of Ireland.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on our amendment.</p></speech>

He will recall that this amendment was discussed on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The position remains that the amendment's text is technically inappropriate for legislation.  Were the Government to undertake actions along the lines suggested, they would either be matters of policy and resource allocation or would need to be addressed in detail in legislation.  However, one does not insert in legislation that the Government should make proposals that may require legislation.  Instead, we get on with implementing the Government's policy programme.  Where this requires legislation, such legislation is introduced.  There are technical issues with the amendment's drafting.</p><p>We are merging the Equality Authority and the IHRC.  My predecessor consulted the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State around the time this proposal was announced.  I assure the House that there are no adverse implications for our commitment under the Good Friday Agreement or for our relationship with Northern Ireland.  Equivalence of protection relates to substantive human rights law, not to questions of institutional structures.  This Bill addresses the future institutional arrangements for equality mechanisms.  They will always operate differently in different jurisdictions.  Under the Constitution, our body of human rights law is at least equivalent to that which exists in Northern Ireland.  Contrary to the impression that the amendment's proposed paragraph (a) might convey, the remit of the new commission as regards human rights compares favourably with that of any national human rights institution in Europe.</p><p>The merger is intended to create a body that is greater than the sum of its parts.  There is a significant commitment to ensuring an effective body.  Extra resources and staff for the body have been agreed and it will be well equipped by the Bill.  Thanks to the extra staff and resources and this legislation, protection of human rights and equality will be provided for cohesively.  As such, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In our reading, though, the IHRC does not have the full range of powers available to the commission in the North.  Therefore, the equivalence obligation under the Good Friday Agreement appears to have been ignored.  That the Government is proposing to amalgamate the IHRC and Equality Authority will result in a mismatch of powers and obligations and the equivalence obligation will again be ignored.  We call on the Minister to maintain the IHRC as a sole body and to invest in it the broad range of powers available to the commission in the North.  The Bill is unpicking parts of an agreement to which both Governments are equal co-guarantors and that was supported by the vast majority of the people of Ireland.  This sends the wrong message to parties that may want to diminish powers granted under the Good Friday Agreement and unpick other elements of it.  We struggled and fought for the Agreement.  Therefore, will the Minister reconsider our points?</p></speech>

There are no adverse implications for the Agreement.  Nor do I accept the Senator's points about the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, NIHRC, versus those of the IHRC.  I invite him to cite an example of where the NIHRC is stronger.</p><p>I put it to the Senator that the Bill's proposals on the protection of human rights are strong.  The Government would not introduce a Bill that had adverse implications for the Agreement.  My predecessor consulted the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State when this proposal was announced and shared its details.  There was discussion of the matter.</p><p>For these reasons, I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We must always be vigilant in our duties and obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement.  Had this House been abolished last year, my constituents in Northern Ireland would never again have had a vote in the Oireachtas.  Some were annoyed by this, but it did not happen.  This is an example of how voting rights that were protected under those agreements and the 1937 Constitution could have been removed by a referendum in which those who had the voting rights were not entitled to vote, as they were in Northern Ireland and the referendum was only held in the Republic.  They value their rights, which form part of a better tradition of the two parts of the island sharing a common heritage.</p><p>The debate between Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and the Minister was important, in that we can sometimes inadvertently intrude on people's rights.</p> <p>The Government speakers at that time appeared to be unaware that there were implications for Northern Ireland of the abolition of this House.  While that is over and done with and the abolition did not happen, it shows that sometimes things can have inadvertent consequences.  We want to preserve the best possible relations between the two parts of the island.  The Government is to be commended on doing so.  It is, as we all know, a 24-7 job.  I will not be opposing the section.</p></speech>

It is an important point, in respect of which we will be very vigilant.  I would like to point out that under section 10 one of the functions of the commission is to participate in the joint committee with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in accordance with the multi-party agreement annexed to the</p><p>British-Irish Agreement within the meaning of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.

They transpose into Irish law the EU directive referred to.  The directive was one of a package of competitiveness measures published by the Commission at the time of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Essentially, the idea is to ensure that we remove any barriers to free movement of workers within the EU by putting in place positive measures to ensure that relevant information is available to them in languages other than the language of the receiving State and that they have access to redress mechanisms on the same basis as nationals of the receiving member state.<br />The substantive EU directive that eliminates discrimination against migrant EU workers is contained in an earlier EU regulation 492/2011, which we have already fully transposed into our employment equality legislation.  The directive to which I am now referring now is 2014/54/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014, on measures facilitating the exercise of rights conferred on workers in the context of freedom of movement for workers, which was published in the <i>Official Journal</i>in April 2014 and comes into operation by virtue of Article 10 on the 20th day following its publication.  We have until 21 May 2016 to transpose this directive, but as there is nothing new in the directive in so far as it compares with our existing equality legislation, I am taking the opportunity today of including it in this legislation.  The sole exception is contained in Article 4.2B, which creates the new role for our designated national body of &quot;acting as a contact point <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>equivalent contact points in other Member States in order to cooperate and share relevant information.&quot;  Through this amendment, we are providing in our legislation that our new body will be the contact point.  The Equality Authority is the designated body for the purpose of other EU equality-related directives and is already part of the European network of equality bodies.  As such, this is not a new role in practice.<br />During my time as a member of the board of then Employment Equality Authority, an important part of its work was defending employment rights.  It is interesting to note that this has not been referred to in legislation previously.  Article 8 of the directive requires that the directive be referenced in national transposing legislation.  All the other provisions of the directive have equivalents in our equality legislation.  As this directive provides for no new rights, the opportunity is being taken today to make this amendment to the Bill, which is all we need to do by way of legislation for transposition to be complete.  If we do this today, the transposition of the directive will have been completed ahead of time.  To some degree, it is a technical amendment.  However, it is important in that it means that the new body is the contact point for equality measures.</p></speech>

My understanding is that this is effectively adding an additional function to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and that it is identified in the directive that in order for a body to be appointed as the point of contact it must have certain competencies in providing or ensuring the provision of independent or legal assistance to union workers and their families; conducting or commissioning independent surveys, particularly in relation to obstacles to the right to free movement; and ensuring the publication of independent reports, also in relation to freedom of movement and so on.</p><p>I note that in the preamble to the directive it is stated that should a member state decide to expand the mandate of an existing body it should ensure the allocation of sufficient resources to the existing body for the effective and adequate performance of its existing and additional tasks.  The Minister indicated in an earlier response that she has provided additional resources and staff for the new merged body, which I acknowledge.  However, as this amendment comes so late in the day, was account taken of these additional competencies and the work required in relation to this additional function in the calculation of those resources, or was it at least acknowledged that the organisation may require additional resources in order to incorporate this function in light of the transposition of the directive?</p></speech>

There is no concern in that regard.  In regard to the resource issue, this is about the body being the contact point and attending the relevant networking meetings.  I would be confident that the resources allocated would encompass the body's work in this area.  We were aware that this was a competency that this body was likely to have.</p></speech>

My question is, given that the body is now the point of contact and for that reason additional work will potentially arise, in particular in terms of employing its competencies and extending them to issues related to freedom of movement, there may be a requirement for additional resources.  I am concerned not that the body will not have the competencies but that this additional function may result in additional work for the commission, such that it will require additional resources.  Does the Minister accept that?</p></speech>

I believe the extra costs will be marginal and can be met by the additional resources provided.  Obviously, once the body is up and running I have no doubt the resource issue will be ongoing, as it is for all bodies.</p></speech>

Internationally, in February 2012 the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights organised an international gathering to develop principles to guide the interaction between national human rights institutions and parliaments.  Its rationale for the gathering was rooted in its desire to assist implementation of the Paris Principles, which are foundational principles for the establishment of effective national human rights institutions.  The Paris Principles state national human rights institutions shall establish effective co-operation with parliament.  The document published subsequent to that 2012 gathering is entitled the Belgrade Principles.  That is the short title and sufficient for now.  Principle 21 states: "Parliaments should identify or establish an appropriate parliamentary committee which will be the NHRI&rsquo;s main point of contact within Parliament".</p><p>At European level, on Second Stage I mentioned that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe had produced a report in May on a similar topic of improving co-operation between national human rights institutions and parliaments.  I am pleased that the Bill includes many of the elements included in the report's resolution, which was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary assembly.  Section 6 of the resolution states the assembly calls on national parliaments of Council of Europe member states to &quot;set up, where it does not yet exist, a parliamentary committee responsible for human rights [and] equality&quot;.  It is this committee with which the national human rights institutions has a formal relationship.</p><p>The Irish background to the proposals on foot of the Belgrade Principles and other international initiatives is that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality met members of the IHREC designate in March to consider ways to ensure deeper engagement between the committee and the IHREC.  One of the items we agreed to was to see whether there was a legislative basis for the engagement of the IHREC with committees, including a committee with specific responsibility for human rights oversight.  Both amendments seek to ensure closer co-operation between our committee system and national human rights institutions to support parliamentary involvement in the oversight of human rights and proper integration of human rights obligations in law-making.</p></speech>

We must encourage greater co-operation between Oireachtas joint committees and the new institution, but I am not sure if the best way to do it is through legislation.  We have had that debate and I look forward to the Minister's response.  In spirit, we agree with the principle that there be co-operation.  Senator Katherine Zappone has spoken eloquently about our record in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in meeting the members designate of the commission.</p></speech>

My advice is that it is not appropriate to impose obligations such as these on the Oireachtas in primary legislation.  Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas regulate their internal affairs and this is done under Standing Orders.  I recognise and appreciate some of the points made by Senator Katherine Zappone on this legislation.  It is included in the legislation that a strategy statement and an annual report will be submitted directly to the Houses.  It is being set up under the Paris Principles which call for strong engagement between the body and national parliaments.  I would like to see the Oireachtas responding actively when these reports are received.  It can be arbitrary as to which annual report is discussed by the committee and as such, it is not built into legislation.  Generally, it is left to the discretion of the committee to call in the body after an annual report is presented.  It varies depending on the committee's priorities and how important it thinks it is.  Clearly, one wants reports and strategy statements coming from the commission to be discussed by the committee.  The committee with responsibility for human rights and equality is the place where we expect the reports to be discussed.</p><p>I am happy to support the Senator in putting this request to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On that basis, perhaps we might try to progress the issue under Standing Orders.  I cannot guarantee that it will be accepted, but it is the appropriate way to move forward, rather than by an amendment to the Bill.  Given the differentiation between the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas and what we can include in legislation, I am advised it would not be the best way to deal with the amendment.  I am happy to pursue the issue raised by Senator Katherine Zappone with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and take the recommendation forward.  Perhaps it is an innovative way in the Houses ensuring particular Bills, about which Members feel strongly, have substance in respect of Standing Orders.</p></speech>

This is a progression from the last Irish Human Rights Commission and a positive development.  We were attempting to make it more interactive and dynamic.  I hear the response of the Minister that it is not possible to do what we ask in the Bill.  Perhaps it might be done under Standing Orders and I appreciate the willingness of the Minister to support us.  Senator Ivana Bacik knows, being part of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, that we are looking at the possibility of doing this as a committee.  If we make a move to specify our human rights obligations which may have something to do with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, we would appreciate the support of the Minister.  I accept what she says and thank her for her support in a different way.</p></speech>

Then I will outline our rationale for placing the amendment within section 42, which deals with public bodies, rather than the more obvious section 32, which deals with equality reviews and equality action plans.<br />Equality reviews are a potentially significant tool for embedding good practice in organisations.  They go beyond strict compliance with the law to securing or even coaxing equality of opportunity.  We believe that combined with a human rights review, the mechanism could provide a means of building good practice, particularly in respect of proposed public sector duty, as covered in section 42.  More generally, it would enable the commission to develop an integrated approach to the human rights and equality strands of its mandate.  I referred to the importance of this on Second Stage.  Equinet, the European Network for Equality Bodies, has published research on mergers between equality and human rights bodies.  The network noted in its research that in some instances mergers of equality and human rights bodies have resulted in a near invisibility of work in one area.  The network concludes that equality and human rights mandates must be clear and linked and that a merged body should have the capacity and powers to undertake a multidimensional approach to issues and initiatives.<br />The Bill affords us an opportunity to secure an integrated approach to the human rights and equality strands of the commission's work.  The Minister is aware, as are all of us, that the Equality Authority has built up a considerable body of good practice and guidance on the equality reviews and action plans.  Again, as we are aware, reviews are a feasible alternative to the more protracted option of undertaking an inquiry.  This good practice can be drawn on and integrated with a human rights review.  That is the general rationale in respect of incorporating a human rights review with an equality review.<br />I will outline the reasoning for the placement of the amendment.  Since human rights, as defined in section 29, does not for the most part impose direct obligation on private entities, it would not be possible, although it might be desirable, in the context of how human rights are defined under section 29, which applies to section 32, to suggest that a human rights review is conducted along with an equality review, as outlined in section 32, because that section applies to the private sphere.  Instead, we are proposing that section 42, relating to the public duty function of the Irish Human Rights Commission, is amended to include the practice of carrying out an equality and human rights review in respect of a public body.  It is fantastic and a progressive move that this element is in the Bill.  We suggest the trigger for such an integrated review should be set at the level, to use the language of the amendment, of evidence of a systemic failure of the public body to comply with human rights or equality of treatment obligations.  In this case, evidence would refer to the commission having a reasonable basis for believing that there is a systems failure with regard to human rights and equality obligations.  If the commission has reason to believe this is the case, it may invite the public body to carry out an equality and human rights review and prepare and implement an equality and human rights action plan.  It would be terrific to see the new body developing this new practice and we believe it is an excellent opportunity to integrate the two strands.<br />The amendment proposes that the commission may, if it deems it appropriate, carry out the review and prepare an action plan.  The amendment describes what such a review and action plan relates to and adopts the same language as section 32 with regard to equality reviews for private entities.</p></speech>

It is worth considering this as one reference point in respect of the serious powers the commission will have.  The commission, either of its own volition or, if requested by the Minister, may conduct an inquiry if it is considered by the commission that there is a body, public or otherwise, suspected of a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations, or where there is a violation of or systemic failure to comply with human rights or equality of treatment obligations.  That is an important power already in the legislation and it should form part of the context when we reflect on the substance of Senator Zappone's amendment.</p><p>Section 42 introduces a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality and reflects this commitment in Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 which states, &quot;We will require all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions&quot;.  I understand the point Senator Zappone is making with the amendment.  I am keen to work through my thinking on the matter and any suggestion that I make in respect of how to take this forward.</p><p>The commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty by producing guidelines and codes of practice as outlined in section 31.  This is an important interaction the commission can have with public bodies.  I offer one example from the day before yesterday which was high-profile in nature.  It relates to the absolute need for public bodies to develop the cultural competence to engage with the new communities who have come to Ireland in the past ten or 15 years, particularly those who have most difficulty in engaging with authority figures, perhaps, or who are otherwise vulnerable.  I am referring to the report I published by Ms Emily Logan, under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, into the events surrounding the taking of two young Roma children from the care of their parents.</p><p>At the launch of the report on Tuesday I made the point that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out important and difficult duties.  Often, they have to make hard decisions in real-time, frequently without access to perfect information.  The report has found that well-intentioned garda&iacute; acting in what they believed to be the best interests of the children concerned made the wrong decision on the day.  Unfortunately, these wrong decisions had a very distressing outcome for the families concerned.  I apologised on behalf of the State and the Acting Garda Commissioner made her apology, as did the Taoiseach, for these events.  The report found the fact that the families concerned were members of the Roma community played a part in the decision-making process.  Specifically, the report found that while there may have been other factors which informed the Garda actions, the fact that the families were Roma was a significant factor in these events.</p><p>It is important to note that the report found no evidence, through the examination of these two cases, of ethnic profiling at a systemic level in the Garda.  However, Ms Logan found that the actions of the garda&iacute; involved in these cases on the day conformed to the definition of ethnic profiling.  The report has not found that the garda&iacute; involved were motivated by conscious racism.  Indeed Ms Logan was at pains to point out that in respect of the Tallaght case the report highlights the Garda officer's extensive commitment and contact with the local community, his community policing work and his voluntary engagement with minority communities.</p><p>The report has found - this is where I am linking it to Senator Zappone's amendment - that wherever there is a possibility that decision-making in respect of a marginalised community, such as the Roma, may be affected by negative stereotyping, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies would have a positive duty to be especially vigilant to ensure that these stereotypes are challenged, identified and corrected.  Of course, this applies to all public bodies that must develop such cultural competence to interact effectively with minority communities.  One of the points made following the publication of the report was the importance of training and that if we do not put the proactive training in place there is a risk of this happening, even unconsciously.  Training is very important as is consultation with, for example, the Roma community and Traveller interests.</p> <p>I am establishing an implementation group to take the work and the recommendations forward.  It is a cross-departmental group, involving consultation with other organisations.</p><p>This brings me to the positive duty provision in the Bill and to the Senator's suggestion for its improvement.  That is a very good example of the type of work that must be done.  The idea in section 42, simply put, is to put the positive duty on public bodies to conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights to reflect the commitment contained in the current programme for Government.  I believe the commission will have a very important role in the development of this concept, so it is meaningful in terms of developing and promoting equality in human rights across the public sector.  There is huge potential for this type of work to be integrated more systematically than it has been in the past.</p><p>As I said, training will be an important element.  We should recognise the work the Irish Human Rights Commission already does in respect of training.  The civil and public service has had tailored training.  The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have had some training, as have the Irish Prison Service, local authority officials and civil servants.  This should be ongoing.  Given that there are new recruits and changes of personnel, there is a need for ongoing training and the report that was published yesterday found that even though particular garda&iacute; were doing a great deal of specific work with the communities, they may not have had that specific training.</p><p>There is potential in the legislation to use the positive duty function to persuade and promote best practice by highlighting good examples to which other bodies could aspire.  The report yesterday made it clear that we must do this work.  One of the points on which I wish to elaborate is how much work has been done.  The potential here is to see the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission working in partnership with Departments and other relevant statutory bodies to ensure that the potential contained in this provision is developed to the full.</p><p>I have given that long background context because I understand the Senator's thinking.  I am concerned about part of the proposed amendment relating to the imposition of a review or action plan in subsection (7).  What must happen more than anything for genuine reform to take place is that the senior management of the organisation must take ownership of the process.  It is very much about persuasion and support.  The commission is well placed, once it has developed a good working relationship with Oireachtas committees, to address any instances where a public body refuses a request or presents a review or action plan that is inadequate.  I do not believe the CEO of any of the public bodies we are discussing would wish to have to appear before an Oireachtas committee to explain why he or she had not done this type of training or were not fulfilling the obligations that are envisaged under the legislation.  They would not wish to be in that position.</p><p>Part of the amendment is also suggesting that the commission might work with a public body to identify deficiencies and to look at areas that might require more attention and support it in undertaking a review or putting an action plan in place.  That is something I would like to consider.  I do not believe it is a power that should be used routinely, but strategically to ensure there is learning and that work can be done in a collaborative way.  For example, if there was an organisation or public body where problems were emerging in this area and it was not doing this work, the commission could work with it.</p><p>There is already the power of inquiries, and there is the routine work that must be done.  The Senator appears to be suggesting something that is somewhere in between.  Clearly, it cannot have the same power as the inquiries, which is dealt with in a different section.  My suggestion is that we do further work on this amendment - there are some drafting issues with getting this right - so we do not move into the territory of inquiries.  We can return to it on Report Stage and suggest a revised text, if that is possible and I hope it will be.  I will see if I can return with a formulation that captures what the Senator is suggesting but is not moving into the territory surrounding inquiries, which is already dealt with.</p></speech>

It was very helpful and necessary.  The report the Minister published provides a brilliant example of the type of practice we are suggesting.  A similar type of practice could be developed.  The Minister referred to the report and I commend her on its publication, the way she responded to it, the public apology and the swiftness with which she dealt with it.  It is very heartening and many other people felt that way too.</p><p>The Minister's response to the amendment is very much in tune with what we were trying to do, which is to pitch it somewhere in between.  If there are some technical difficulties in that regard, it would be wonderful if the Minister took the opportunity to look at those and return with a suggestion of something better from a technical perspective that would still incorporate the substance of what we are suggesting.  I appreciate her recommendation.</p></speech>

There is the other aspect to imposing these requirements regarding the positive duty.  Let us make it a dialogue going both ways.  There is a positive duty on public bodies to have regard to human rights.  I would accentuate the positive.  We received a briefing recently from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the garda giving the briefing to Deputies and Senators had been in Serbia.  He had fantastic expertise on how people of different cultures and races would get on together.  We also have the expertise of our peacekeepers who have kept the peace in Cyprus and other countries.</p><p>With regard to public bodies that are funded by the Exchequer, sports bodies have done a huge amount to give racism the boot and so forth.  This is a two-way thing, rather than holding inquiries or imposing duties on people.  Many people are doing really good work in the Army, the Garda and in sports bodies in the public sector.  Let us have some of that come to the surface because perhaps we are better at this than the newspapers sometimes lead us to believe.  Many people in Ireland have experience of dealing with interracial and intercultural matters and they are pretty good at it.  It makes society so much richer for us all.</p><p>Section 42 is a two-way process, with many good things happening.  That is to be commended and it is in the spirit of what Senator Zappone and the Minister have just said.</p></speech>

Obviously, when there is a report such as that on the investigation carried out by the Ombudsman for Children one is highlighting the deficiencies, the areas that need improvement and why what happened took place.  However, it is very relevant to point out as well, and I was very conscious of this as the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the huge amount of work the Garda has done regarding child protection.  Many new initiatives have been taken, much training has been done and new sections have been developed to deal with cases, such as sexual abuse cases, that come to the attention of the Garda.  Equally, the sports bodies have done a huge amount of work in respect of better practices, codes of conduct, investigations and taking action, and responding to guidelines such as Children First.</p> <p> The Senator provided an example in respect of sporting bodies and the work they are doing to tackle racism.  He is absolutely correct to state that a great deal of that work sometimes occurs below the radar.  We tend to hear more about the gaps and the deficiencies.  His point regarding the fact that there has been a sea change in Ireland in respect of equality and human rights in recent decades is well made.  It must be stated that we had a great deal of catching up to do and there is no room for us to be complacent.  However, huge strides have been made and, as stated on a previous occasion, we must pay tribute to those who have taken the lead in respect of this matter, including the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission and individuals such as Senator Zappone and others.</p></speech>

There are many who feel that the human rights of those in direct provision have been transgressed.  A former holder of the position of Ombudsman raised the issue of the oversight of the direct provision system and stated that she wanted the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act to be extended to include those in direct provision as a result of the fact that such individuals are of the view that there is no independent mechanism available to them in the context of making complaints, etc.</p><p>Will the Minister clarify whether the new commission will be responsible for overseeing the direct provision system?  It must be remembered that the system in question has no statutory basis.  The system does have a legal basis in that the Government decided to establish it but there is no regulatory framework in respect of it.  The Irish Refugee Council and other groups have raised serious concerns with regard to what is happening in some direct provision centres.  In light of the fact that she previously served as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister will be aware that people were raising concerns in respect of children being raised within a system which was only designed to obtain for a six-month period while people were accommodated in the country.  There are children aged between seven and nine years of age who have been living within the system for their entire lives.  I would like to discuss this matter at length with the Minister on another occasion.  Perhaps now, however, she might clarify the role the new commission will play in respect of the direct provision system.</p></speech>

The way to address some of the issues relating to direct provision is by examining the option of the single procedure.  Ireland does not have such a procedure and it is out of line with every other European country as a result.  One of the greatest concerns in respect of direct provision is the length of time families spend within the system.  The best way to deal with that is to ensure that we have the kind of process which works in a timely and effective manner and which does not put families in the position to which the Senator refers.</p></speech>

This regulation was the subject of a very full debate by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality at its meeting yesterday and it received all-party support.  The joint committee also discussed some of the issues to which it gives rise.</p><p>Under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution of Ireland the exercise of the possibility to opt-in to a Title V measure is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  On 6 May 2014, the Government authorised the exercise of the opt-in to the recast Eurodac regulation subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the business with which the joint committee dealt yesterday and with which we are dealing now.  Eurodac is an EU information technology system for the comparison of the fingerprints of asylum seekers across EU member states.</p> <p>The Eurodac regulation was originally adopted in 2000 and recast in 2013.  Eurodac facilitates the operation of the Dublin Convention and Regulation (EU) No. 604/2013, which establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining which member state is responsible for examining an application for international protection.  Senators will be very familiar with this system.  The Dublin system is based on the general principle that responsibility should lie primarily with the member state which played the greatest part in an applicant's entry into residence in the EU.  This is necessary due to the movements we see among people who are in this situation.  Ireland is participating in the recast Dublin regulation of 2013.  In fact, it was agreed during the Irish Presidency.  It is proposed now to opt into the recast Eurodac regulation of 2013 before its implementation date of July 2015 to ensure that the preparations in Ireland and the EU for the coming into operation of the recast regulation go smoothly.</p><p>The Eurodac system consists of a central system and a communications infrastructure with member states.  The principal additional elements of the recasting of the Eurodac regulation in 2013 consist of improvements and increased efficiency in the use of Eurodac in relation to prompt transmission - timelines are spelt out - by member states of fingerprints to the central system and marking of data on persons granted international protection; full compatibility with the latest EU asylum legislation and better addressing of data protection requirements; and the facility for member states' law enforcement authorities and Europol to access the Eurodac central database for law enforcement purposes.</p><p>Having made the initial proposal to recast the Eurodac regulation in December 2008, the European Commission amended it three times.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the original opt-in to the December 2008 proposal does not cover the Eurodac regulation as actually adopted in June 2013.  Consequently, it is necessary to begin afresh the national procedures for opting into the recast Eurodac regulation.  The recast regulation will apply from 20 July 2015, up to which date the original Eurodac regulation of 2000 continues to apply.  Accordingly, Ireland continues to participate in the Eurodac system.  I recommend that the House support the regulation and that it be passed by the Oireachtas.  It allows preparations to go ahead at national and EU level to ensure that we continue to be part of an essential central system of information exchange that allows requests for asylum to be addressed in the best possible way by the appropriate country.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin leis an Aire as ucht bheith anseo chun an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  I welcome the fact that we have been given the opportunity to debate the Eurodac proposal.  It is important that we get the chance in the Seanad to debate these things.  I note that it is seen to be very important to opt into this particular directive, but also that the Government seems to take an <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>approach to the European directives dealing with asylum.  The directive on the right to work is another one we should opt into, yet we have not done so.  Perhaps we can talk on another date about the fact that some directives are opted into while others are not.<br />The taking of the fingerprints of asylum seekers was a significant step when it was first introduced.  It was already a sensitive issue for many.  Many did not want to see asylum seekers undergo this additional invasion of privacy.  It was deemed justifiable and necessary at the time to facilitate the establishment of the Dublin chain of responsibility in the common asylum system.  The current proposal as outlined represents a major additional step and allows fingerprints to be used outside the Dublin regime.  However, the arguments of the Commission as to why this is necessary and proportionate are insufficient.  The practical necessity and importance of the measure have not been stated clearly.  In fact, it appears to many that uses will be made of the measure which are outside the aim of the original directive.  The effect of the measure could be very stigmatising, implying that asylum seekers are more criminal than others.  It is a problem we have in the asylum context in general.<br />I note that the European Data Protection Supervisor issued a critical opinion on 5 September 2012 saying the procedure followed does not do justice to the fundamental nature of the proposal and that a new impact assessment should have been performed.  It was further indicated that the necessity and proportionality of access to Eurodac data for law enforcement purposes are insufficiently demonstrated, that the proposal does not consider sufficiently the implications of the use of Eurodac data for law enforcement purposes with regard to applicable data protection law, and that the proposal does not consider the new legal basis for data protection since the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty and ongoing data protection reform.  The previous system was imagined to administer asylum applications, which it was supposed to make easier.  It is obvious that the data is sought to be used now by law enforcement agencies and Europol.  We are being given anecdotal evidence of success in combating crime, which is lauded as the reason we need to do this.  We are told certain high-profile criminals and criminal gangs will be stopped.  However, the wholesale sharing of information is a matter of concern for me.  We all want to combat organised crime, trafficking, etc., but the wholesale sharing of information gives one the sense that all asylum seekers are being put into the same basket.<br />The European Data Protection Supervisor has argued that the need for this has not been sufficiently demonstrated and has called for an impact assessment which looks at the whole policy.  Privacy International called for a delay of the proposal until proper, evidence-based impact assessments had been carried out.  Privacy International has also raised concerns about the right to privacy and the breaches of human rights which might be occasioned by the new system.  The UNHCR has recommended the taking of board of certain safeguards before the introduction of a facility to search Eurodac with latent fingerprints so that the possibility of error in matching fingerprints and wrongful implication of asylum seekers in criminal investigations is fully examined and eliminated to the greatest extent possible.  The UNHCR has also recommended that the provision on the prohibition of the transfer of information on asylum seekers or refugees to third countries be reinforced and clarified to eliminate any gaps in the protection of data; that the potential for stigmatisation of asylum seekers as a particularly vulnerable group be evaluated; and that the scope of the proposed instruments be limited to cases in which there is substantial suspicion that the perpetrator or suspect has applied for asylum and the applicant is informed that his or her data may be used for the purposes of a criminal investigation.  The general sense is that although the system in which fingerprints are used to identify asylum seekers to help speedily administer claims was acceptable initially, we are going much further now.  There are concerns around the step being taken and whether we are going in the right direction.<br />There is an issue with regard to the way we deal with asylum seekers across the EU.  I was at an event in Greece recently where the issue was raised.  An MP from Greece said it was felt that Greece was being used as a dustbin for souls in the asylum seeking process due to a lack of coherence across the 27 EU member states in dealing with the pressures of an influx of asylum seekers.  The Irish system involves adopting a guilty-until-proven-innocent approach to the consideration of asylum claims.  Asylum seekers are stigmatised and our system makes them feel like criminals.  Having spoken to people in direct provision asylum centres here, I note that they are very critical of the approach taken by the State, as are the NGOs that work with them.  This is another extension of that system.  Many of the asylum seekers I have met are highly competent, professional, educated people while others are normal people escaping from terrible situations.  They feel they are treated like criminals in the Irish asylum system.  Being put into the direct provision system is akin to their being put into an open prison.  The difference is that in an open prison, one knows when the end of one's sentence will be.  They do not feel that is the case with direct provision.  They also say that being in the Irish system exacerbates the issues they have with regard to mental health, human rights and the ability to progress personally with work and education.</p> <p> These are some of the issues I wanted to raise in this debate.  The Minister can address a number of these concerns.  The European system seems to think that this type of measure is a deterrent to anybody might want to come to the EU to seek asylum.  I do not think that is the best practice from an international perspective.  If we found ourselves in a position where we had to flee our country and were looking for asylum, we would expect to be treated in a much more humane manner.  Therefore, the concerns we are raising here are valid and backed up by international commentators with expertise in the area.  Certainly we should think twice before taking the move.  </p></speech>

As Deputy Leader, I was happy to accede to the request from Senator  &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the basis that I think it is a good idea that we would have a debate on motions that come to us from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or from other committees, particularly where they concern issues of significance.  However, I would say that the committee had a very full debate yesterday and sat for nearly an hour.  I certainly participated in it, Deputy Mac Lochlainn from the Senator's own party participated in it and it was agreed unanimously that we would opt in.  Indeed all of us, including the Chairman, Deputy Stanton, put questions to the Minister on detailed aspects of the application of this Eurodac regulation and this decision to opt in.  I think Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has raised various other issues around the treatment of asylum seekers, stigmatisation and direct provision, which he has raised many times.  I would share many of his concerns and I know the Minister does as well and has responded.</p><p>It is important to look at the detail of Eurodac.  I do not want to reiterate and rehash the entire debate from yesterday but I raised very particular issues concerning the treatment of minors because the Eurodac system permits the fingerprinting of those aged 14 and upwards.  I know the Minister said that she had raised those issues and had similar concerns.  We teased out these matters and the balance of rights of asylum seekers against the interests of ensuring both the efficient processing of asylum claims and international protection claims across the EU and preventing terrorism and serious criminality on a cross-Border basis.  We also considered the issue of the timing - why we are opting into it now.  We considered the implications of the Pr&uuml;m decision and the fact that Ireland has not yet implemented it fully in the context of the recent passing of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014.</p><p>We considered a wide range of issues, including the issue of latent fingerprints, which was raised by the Senator, and the Dublin regulation.  In the course of the debate, the transcript of which I urge colleagues to look at, the Minister assured us that asylum seekers are not being sent back to Greece and that an agreement had been made on that, something of which I had been unaware.  I know the Minister will respond more fully but Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's party colleague was satisfied as to the decision the committee was taking.  It was a unanimous decision and we did have a very full debate.  I am happy to have the debate again on the floor of this House and I think it is useful to do so.  I would say to colleagues that Ireland already takes part in the application of the original Eurodac regulation.  The recast Eurodac regulation is still primarily about asylum and claims for international protection.  The law enforcement aspect, which we also teased out in the committee, is not the primary function of this.  I urge colleagues to support the motion.  </p></speech>

I would agree with many of the points made about direct provision.  It must be dealt with and we will do our best to fast track the forthcoming legislation about which the Minister spoke.  What is occurring is a scandal.  We are dealing with significant legacy scandals at the moment but this scandal is happening at the moment and must be dealt with.  This measure was discussed for over an hour yesterday in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I know Deputy Mac Lochlainn engaged very fulsomely in that discussion.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300018#R00500"><p>The first point I would make is that this was discussed and agreed by the European Parliament and Council.  We are already part of Eurodac.  The recast regulation, which is what we are discussing here today, allows consultation of Eurodac by law enforcement authorities.  I want to put on the record that it is for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences.  It is aimed at enabling law enforcement authorities to request the comparison of fingerprint data with that stored in the Eurodac central database when they seek to establish the identity or to get further information on a person suspected of a serous crime or a victim of crime.  It is worth making the point that it is also about the victim of crime.</p><p>Fingerprint data constitutes an important element of establishing the exact identity of a person.  It is generally acknowledged and I think the Senator would agree that it is an important source of information for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences.  I understand that when the debate was held, many member states were adamant that they felt that law enforcement agencies should have access to Eurodac in the interests of the safety of populations.  However, I want to make the point that access is not arbitrary because I recognise that when any database exists, the question of the balance between access to information and the preservation of human rights is one that must be considered.  This was considered in the discussion of the various articles.  There are a number of articles dealing with the protection of fundamental human rights in the provisions.  Equally, a review is built in as to how the mechanism is working, which is an important safeguard as well.  There is also a detailed approach about the steps that must be undertaken by authorities accessing Eurodac so they cannot just say they want access to Eurodac.  In the first place, they must get permission and to have worked through any other database that is available.  </p><p>I will give the Senators some details.  Access to Eurodac can only occur if comparisons with other databases that are already available did not lead to the establishment of the identity of the data subject.  That would include, for example, our own national database.  The other databases are: national databases; databases of other member states under the Pr&uuml;m decision, in respect of which we are not fully linked in; and the European Union visa information system.</p><p>It is permissible to access data from Eurodac following negative results from these other databases in comparison with Eurodac but it is only permissible where a number of cumulative conditions are met.  I will go through them.  The comparison is necessary for the purpose of the prevention, detection or investigation of a terrorist offence or other serious criminal offence.  The comparison has to be necessary in a specific case.  There are reasonable grounds to consider that the comparison will substantially contribute to the prevention, detection or investigation of any of the criminal offences in question.  In each member state, a verifying authority acting independently shall ensure that the conditions for requesting comparison of fingerprints with Eurodac are fulfilled.  </p><p>I think that shows how the balance in the regulation is quite careful, has been considered at European Parliament and Council level and is built in to the access that law enforcement agencies have.  There are quite a number of safeguards that are adequate and important.  Equally, I believe in access to the Eurodac database by law enforcement agencies.  Many member states made this point during the course of the debate.  It is one that is essential and I would certainly recommend that this be agreed by the House.  </p></speech>

The Bill provides for the disestablishment of the Vote of the Health Service Executive and the funding of the executive through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health.  It also provides for a new statutory financial and service plan governance framework which will align with the new Vote arrangements.</p><p>The Government is reforming the health services and this Bill is part of that reform programme.  The reforms are of unprecedented breadth and depth.  They are radical and will ultimately see the introduction of universal health insurance, UHI.  In November 2012, I set out the building blocks for these reforms in Future Health.  Many of the initiatives, like the eventual replacement of the HSE, will require further and other legislative changes.  This Bill is, therefore, a transitional measure, building on earlier changes provided for in the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act, which was passed last year and which provides the basis for the implementation of the rest of the reform programme.</p><p>The Health Act 2004 provided that the HSE had its own Vote and that the Minister for Health had no legal role in setting its budget.  The House will understand that the intention then was to give the HSE greater operational autonomy from what, at the time, was characterised as a politicised decision-making system.  However, in my view, it crucially weakened the accountability of the HSE to the Minister for Health and the Department of Health.  This Bill establishes that, in future, funding of the HSE will be through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health, thus re-establishing appropriate and proper accountability of the HSE to the Department.</p><p>It is also, as I have said, another step on the reform journey, including the dissolution of the HSE, the establishment of a health commissioning agency, new community care structures and the establishment of hospital trusts.  This is a step on the way to establishing universal health insurance and Senators will be aware of the progress that we are making in achieving that objective, which is one of the key targets set out in the reform programme since the publication of Future Health.  The aim of the reform programme for the health system is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, where there is fair access to services based on need, not on ability to pay.  Under universal health insurance, everyone will have a choice of health insurer and access to a standard package of health services.  In addition, a system of financial protection will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising universal health insurance premiums for those who qualify.</p><p>The White Paper on Universal Health Insurance was published in April.  It provides substantial detail on the universal health insurance model for Ireland, the process for determining the future health basket, including the standard package of services covered under universal health insurance, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to universal health insurance.  Since publication of the White Paper, work has been carried out on a number of the following to advance universal health insurance.  A wide-ranging public consultation on the overall policy set out in the White Paper was carried out.  Over 130 submissions were received and these will be subject to an independent thematic analysis, the report of which will be completed by the end of September.</p><p>Ongoing preparatory work to establish an expert commission which will consult widely and make recommendations in regard to the scope and composition of the future health basket is being carried out.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children has been invited to develop a values framework which will help inform the work of the expert commission in making recommendations on the services for inclusion in the future health basket.  Officials from my Department have held discussions with the committee and it is hoped that it will be in a position to commence hearings with stakeholders in the coming months.</p><p>On the issue of the cost of universal health insurance, I have initiated a major costing exercise to estimate the likely cost of universal health insurance both for the State and individuals and households.  This a complex exercise which requires expert analytical support and input from a number of State agencies.  I expect to have initial results from this exercise early in 2015.  My Department has commenced a baseline examination of the current financial support systems in the health sector.  This will be followed by policy proposals on the financial subsidy system for universal health insurance.  My aim is to have all necessary preparatory work for universal health insurance in place by early 2016 with a view to full implementation of universal health insurance by 2019.</p> <p>The Bill provides for the disestablishment of the Vote of the Health Service Executive from 2015, and from that date the funding of the HSE will be mainly through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health by way of grants paid to the HSE.  The HSE will continue to collect the income it generates through statutory charges, superannuation contributions and other miscellaneous income.  The director general of the HSE will become an accountable person rather than an Accounting Officer and the Bill sets out an alternative statutory framework to govern the funding of the HSE and ensure that proper controls on its expenditure are exercised by the director general.  The Bill also makes consequential changes to the service plan process to align it with the new budgetary arrangements.<br />The Bill is divided into three parts.  Part 1 has three sections, which are standard technical provisions covering matters such as the Title of the Bill, commencement, definitions and repeals.  Part 2 contains the body of the Bill, which is designed to amend the 2004 Act, as amended by the governance legislation, to put in place the new statutory framework.  It amends a number of sections and inserts a number of additional sections.  Section 4 amends section 5A of the 2004 Act.  Section 5A provides that expenses incurred by the HSE are payable out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and the sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The amendment limits the application of this provision up to 1 January 2015.  This is because the provision is being replaced by a new provision, section 33A, which is being inserted by section 11, which I will outline shortly.<br />Section 5 amends section 16G, which was inserted by the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013.  Section 16G sets out the general functions of the director general.  The section specifically provides that the director general is responsible to the directorate, as the governing body, for the performance of his or her functions, except where he or she is acting as chairperson of the directorate.  The amendment provides an additional exception whereby the director general is required to report to the Minister for Health if he or she is of the view that the actions of the HSE are likely to lead to a breach of its budget limits, which is provided for in section 34A as inserted by section 12 of this Bill.<br />Section 6 amends section 28 of the 2004 Act, which provides specific definitions for Part 7 of the Act.  Part 7 sets out the accountability framework for the HSE.  This section adds further definitions which are required arising from the other provisions of the Bill.<br />Section 7 inserts a new section, section 30A, enabling the Minister to determine a net budget for the HSE, and sets out the process for doing so.  The Minister is required to notify the HSE of its budget no later than 21 days after the publication of the Estimates for the public services, more commonly known as the abridged Estimates volume, AEV.  In practice, it is likely that the net determinations will be issued on the day the AEV is published or the following day.  The section also allows the Minister to adjust a net determination for the HSE in the course of the year.  Sections 8 and 9 make consequential amendments to the service plan provisions of the 2004 Act, arising from the new Vote and budget setting arrangements.<br />Section 10 inserts a replacement section for the existing section 33, which requires the HSE to manage services in a manner that is in accordance with the approved service plan.  The section is being expanded to require the HSE to manage the services within the net determination notified to it by the Minister.  Subsection (2) reintroduces the concept of the first charge principle.  Under this principle, if the HSE exceeds its budget in one year, the deficit is a first charge against the following year's approved budget.  If the HSE has a surplus, it would be allowed to carry over the surplus into the following year, subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  These constraints in the carry-over of a surplus are necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, which puts the principle of ministerial expenditure ceilings on a statutory basis.<br />Section 11 inserts two new sections.  Section 33A is a technical provision allowing the Minister to issue grants to the HSE with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This effectively replaces section 5A, as I already mentioned.  This section also inserts section 33B, which provides for a separate process for approving a capital plan and provides for the governance arrangements regarding the approval of such a plan.<br />Section 12 inserts two new sections regarding the functions of the director general of the HSE.  The new section 34A gives the director general the statutory responsibility of ensuring that the HSE operates within its budget in respect of capital and non-capital expenditure.  It also obliges the director general to notify the Minister if actions being undertaken by the HSE are likely to lead to its breaching its financial limits.  A new section 34B provides that the director general shall be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the HSE's annual financial statements and any other reports made by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This provision is required because section 40G of the governance legislation, which makes the director general the Accounting Officer of the HSE, is being amended so that he or she ceases to be the Accounting Officer with effect from 1 January 2015.<br />Section 13 amends section 40G and makes the director general the Accounting Officer for the HSE for the years 2005 to 2014.  This means the director general is still accountable for the appropriation accounts for those years and the HSE has to produce appropriation accounts for 2014.<br />Section 14 amends section 40L, as inserted by the 2013 Act, which sets out the functions of the audit committee of the HSE.  These functions relate to advising the director general and the directorate of the HSE on financial matters.  The existing subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) reflects the current statutory position of the director general as being the Accounting Officer.  It is being amended to delete this reference and replace it with an obligation on the audit committee to advise on matters relating to the HSE's and the director general's obligations in respect of the implementation of the service plan in accordance with the new funding arrangements.<br />Part 3 provides for the transitional arrangements to enable the changeover from the current system to the new funding arrangements.  Section 15 provides that the HSE's Vote shall be abolished on 1 January 2015 and that funding will be arranged through the Vote of the Minister for Health in 2015.  It also provides funds in the Vote of the Minister for Health for 2015 so as to enable the Department to provide grants to the HSE, pending D&aacute;il approval of the Minister's Vote.  The provision will cease to have effect when the D&aacute;il approves the Estimate for the Minister for Health for 2015.  Section 16 is a technical amendment to the Valuation Act designed to ensure that the buildings of the Health Service Executive remain exempt from rates.<br />As I have outlined, the Bill is another step on the reform journey, the ultimate destination being universal health insurance.  The central aim of the health reform programme is to improve equity and access to services.  This Bill is an essential, if technical, part of that goal.  Transparency and accountability around service delivery are fundamental tenets of the health reform programme.  This Bill, together with other changes I am making, will help ensure more accountability during the time the HSE continues in existence.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We are opposing the Bill.  Ordinarily, on a personal level, I would not be comfortable with &euro;12 billion or &euro;13 billion of the people's money being under third-party control.  I regularly spoke in that vein when I was on the other side of the House and former Deputy Mary Harney was Minister.  However, I am not confident that the Department of Health under the Minister's stewardship is the right place for the budget.  Over recent years the budgeting and financing of the HSE and the health services has been an unmitigated disaster.  Never before have we had post-budgetary verification processes whereby the Minister's handiwork is overseen by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach.  It does not give one confidence.</p><p>The main reason I oppose the Bill is that when the text of the service plan was presented, it was changed at the last minute after Ministers warned that the original version was political dynamite and would lead to uproar due to the widespread cuts.</p> <p>Despite my criticism of Tony O'Brien in his role, he seems to have more of a handle on the facts than the Government does.  He wrote: "It will not be possible in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands placed on the health services."  However, when the service plan was published the next day it had been altered and the letter stated: "It will be very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands..."  There were other changes also.  A blunt statement in the introduction signed by Tony O'Brien declared: "The level of investment required to meet many of the critical service priorities ... cannot be met".  It could not have been clearer.  That was changed, and the published version stated: "some service priorities ... may not be met".  The version presented to the Minister stated that the actual budgetary challenge facing the health service for the year was in excess of &euro;1 billion, but that sentence was omitted from the version presented to the public.</p><p>I am concerned about the budget going into the Department if the practice is one that alters the true financial position and paints a complexion other than the truth for public consumption.  That would not give one any confidence.  For all the difficulty I have with the current position, I believe it is better when one considers how the Cabinet tampered with the facts before they were prepared to present them to the public.  Mr. O'Brien's predictions have been correct when one considers the continuing cuts that have been necessary and the shortfall in the budget announced on 25 June of &euro;158 million in terms of the deficit in the Vote to date.  </p><p>That, in essence, is the reason we will not be supporting the Bill.  While it is an unmitigated disaster, taking the budget in at this time under a Cabinet which is prepared to doctor the truth for public consumption in the way it did this year does not give one confidence.  We would prefer, however blunt and undesirable, the Tony O'Brien approach of telling people the truth.  There is no doubt the past few years have been challenging for the Minister in terms of cuts, but we are better dealing with the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth in trying to portray a budget to the people and following a particular plan.  Looking back on recent years, it was anticipated that many millions of euro would be saved in various areas, but those savings have not materialised.  In terms of the expenditure report for 2013, which was published at the end of 2012, we were told that the reduction in the cost of drugs and other prescribed items would result in savings of &euro;160 million in 2013 and &euro;330 million in a full year.  Did those savings ever materialise?  In 2014 the expenditure report anticipated savings in the cost of drugs of only &euro;78 million.  That was significantly less than the &euro;330 million that was originally predicted.  </p><p>Clearly, Tony O'Brien was right in predicting that he needed up to &euro;1 billion extra to do the basics.  Basic adding and subtraction seems to be a problem on an ongoing basis in running the service.  I do not think people are more sick, on average, this year than they were last year or the year before.  In taking &euro;1 billion out of the allocation between 2008 and 2010, notwithstanding additional initiatives that were introduced to fill the hole created by the UK's paying less in respect of a fund to which it used to contribute, as well as the shortfall in the health levy, the HSE operated within budget.  We are very far from that position now.  We have had the headless chicken approach to health, with bits and pieces being dealt with.  We had the medical card debacle, which we all agree was a disaster; we had the suggestion of universal provision for children under six, with yesterday's Second Stage debate on the legislation, which was generally welcomed; and we have talk of universal health insurance, but there was never less running out the door in that respect.  That in turn is putting more pressure on the public system.  The Minister will forgive me for stating that we do not have confidence in the system.  There have been debates on all aspects of it over the years and we will have more, but we will be opposing this Bill.</p><p>I note in today's newspapers, following a parliamentary question that was answered yesterday, reports that the review of maternity services has not started yet and that the Minister has not selected the people to conduct the review despite the fact that the now resigned chairman of the West/North West Hospitals Group had prepared a report with his own company.  One wonders under what authority they were acting.  I know he has resigned, but the Minister might indicate whether the former CEO, Bill Maher, or the board as a whole had any input into it.</p></speech>

With all the money we are trying to gather up to run the health service - I tried to give the Minister another &euro;200 million in the measure I introduced yesterday, but his party voted against it - we cannot afford to be dishing out money to board members' companies to do reports that are not even sanctioned from on high.  That is an issue that needs to be dealt with in more detail.  There is some suggestion of the Taoiseach's relationship with members of the board or something like that.</p></speech>

This Bill is another step in the reform programme, as the Minister has outlined.   It clearly sets out the manner in which we are bringing the budget back under the control of the Department of Health under the Minister.  This is the right decision in moving forward in how we manage our health service.  In view of what has occurred in the health service over the past 15 years and how we let many things go unplanned, this has resulted in a huge cost issue.  This Bill deals with the requirement for the amendment of the legislation but it also provides that there will be proper procedures in place to ensure that the people who work within the HSE structure are accountable directly to the Minister and to the Department.  Section 8 is important in that it amends section 31 of Act, which provides for the executive to prepare and submit a service plan to the Minister for his or her approval.  The section providing for the amendment requires the HSE to submit the service plan 21 days after receiving notification of its net determination from the Minister.  There are timelines set out in respect of the service plan and it is a matter of working over the following 12 months within that service plan and delivering the health care that is required.  With regard to the health care budget, we have a major problem in understanding that the money we spend on health care is not Government money but taxpayers' money, and currently it is costing the Irish taxpayer, on average, approximately &euro;254 million per week.</p> <p>That is a huge amount of money and, obviously, will have to be carefully managed.  In the period 2000 to 2010, no matter what occurred, we appear to have accepted what was submitted by the old health boards and later the HSE.  In all those years the HSE has not stayed within budget.  The budget must be looked at in the context of the amount of money that is being spent.  The HSE has a budget of &euro;13.2 billion to maintain services for a very large number of people.  People think about accident and emergency services only if they have to attend them, yet attendances exceed a million per annum.  In the past three years, day case procedures have increased from 650,000 to more than 850,000 per annum.  That is a huge increase in the services provided.  </p><p>We focus a great deal on expenditure in the HSE but not nearly enough on the delivery of health services.  It is easy to complain when one item of medical care goes wrong.  Everyone believes that no mistakes should be made, but given the volume of work, a very good health care service is being delivered.  While we may have criticisms, and it is right that we continue to seek perfection, that is not easy to achieve, but much progress is being made in getting value for money.  In recent years the budget has been reduced by more than &euro;3 billion, yet the number of day case procedures has increased from 650,000 to more than 850,000 in this short period.  </p><p>It is interesting to note that more than 130 submissions have been made in respect of the White Paper on universal health care.  It is important to examine those submissions and take on board any constructive criticism to ensure a comprehensive plan is delivered with regard to how we manage health services into the future.  We can look at other countries and the mistakes made there to ensure we do not make the same mistakes.  </p><p>An area I have focused on in recent years is how to move forward with the recruitment of medical personnel and how to manage those working in administration in the HSE.  I am concerned that positions for administrative staff are being filled internally without being advertised.  Initially the positions are filled temporarily because the vacancy has arisen, whether it is at grade 5, grade 6 or grade 7.  I ask whether that is the best way of building a comprehensive administrative section in the HSE.  I do not believe it is.  The issue needs to be examined carefully to ensure the right people are appointed to the right places and to ensure we do not have a scenario whereby somebody ends up in a position for which he or she is not suitably qualified.  Likewise, we should not allow that to happen in respect of medical personnel.  The Minister's decision to set up a working group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure is welcome.  Its two reports were published in December 2013 and April 2014.  When set up, the hospital groups need to be fast-tracked.</p><p>Of the 4,900 non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, more than 54% are not Irish graduates, and the percentage is increasing.  Also, a large number of our medical consultants are not Irish graduates.  As taxpayers, we are spending large amounts of money on medical education and it is important that there is a return on that expenditure.  We must ensure that those we assist through college with medical qualifications are involved in the future development of our health service.  </p><p>Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It is an important step.  It deals with an issue on which much work has been done in the past three years, but much remains to be done to reach the target of universal health care.  I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.</p></speech>

We were in a situation whereby a largely unanswerable bureaucracy had been given the outsourced job of operations management of the health service, with a rather loose level of political control for the most macro of macro questions.  This brings the military back under civilian control, so to speak, and it is welcome, but it is a way station.</p><p>If I understand the model of universal social insurance that I hope will be implemented, it will be a small step between the HSE and where we are with this, a little piddling micro-step compared to the massive journey we have to make to get to the status of a truly social-insurance-based model.  In such a model, the Government's role will be regulatory.  Its role will be to ensure that the insurance mechanisms are in place, to ensure a degree of redistribution of resources between people who are better off and those who are worse off, which is necessary to make a health insurance system work, to ensure the system is socially responsive and efficient, and to ensure that a mandatory insurance deduction of a fixed percentage will be made against the entire income of every person in the State.  That means that people who have a large income will pay much more than those who have a smaller income, but at the end will walk away with the same insurance instrument in order that they can go to the same hospitals and the same doctors.  It will not be legally acceptable for any institution to cherry-pick and say it will take only people with a certain type of insurance.  I hope there will be - as in countries such as Israel, which has an advanced version of this model - a basket of basic services.  If one goes to the insurance market, insurers must provide certain services.  There is no negotiation on them, and those drugs, procedures, treatments and diagnostic tests are covered completely.</p><p>While the State will assume a major regulatory role, the corollary is that it will lose its management role entirely.  The system will not be owned exclusively and managed by the State and State actors.  I hope that in the new dispensation most of the actors will be not-for-profit insurance companies and not-for-profit hospitals, but they will not necessarily be owned by the State.  If somebody sets up a very efficient private operation, perhaps run by a university or a charity, or even run on a for-profit basis - sometimes they get it right - the only thing that will be mandated of it is that every citizen can walk up to the door, wave his or her insurance instrument and say, &quot;I want to be your patient.  I am supposed to be the patient of the State hospital down the street.&quot;  That has to be the nature of the level playing field.  </p><p>I sometimes misunderstand the types of reform that are taking place towards the goal of universal insurance.  I must avail of this opportunity, as I do not get to speak to the Minister too often, so please forgive me if I take this as a high-end private consultation for the next several minutes.  Some of the reforms which have taken place do not appear to be reforms that are configuring the system towards that kind of insurance model.  Instead, they look as though they are configuring it towards an internal-market version of the NHS, which is a system under which the State still owns everything, runs everything and sets national contracts for all employees.  Under that system, every health care worker is an employee of the State.</p> <p>The only aspect of the principle that money follows the patient in the NHS is that there are different groups, such as fund-holding GPs, which can determine where within the NHS a patient can go.  It is a different model and I hope that we are not aiming for it.  While the term "Dutch model" is frequently used, the Minister will realise that when he entered into coalition with his partners in the Labour Party, the synthetic model which emerged from both parties' laudable health policies resembles to a much greater extent the German model.  It is the "Deutsch", not the "Dutch".  It is a system which has a mix of voluntary-----</p></speech>

It was named after the Iron Chancellor who in 1885 introduced what has become the longest, most durable, most successful, most resilient and most admired health system of any country.  It is a system based on social solidarity, social democracy and treatment according to need not ability to pay.  It is a system based not on the state running everything but on the state ensuring that there is a level playing field for everybody who comes into it.  It is the model we need to emulate.</p><p>I ask the Minister to look critically at some of the way-station reforms which have been made in terms of things like hospital groups and national contracts and understand that the ultimate logic of where we are going with this is that many of the way stations will be obsolete and anachronistic.  In the new dispensation, one may have very different kinds of doctors working.  There may be doctors who are entirely private but take patients coming with their insurance instruments who would currently be called public patients.  There will hopefully be doctors - I would love to be one if the opportunity arose - who are employees of a medical school and real professors unlike the situation we have now where we have nearly no one in that role.  We may have some doctors who elect to work part-time in Government hospitals while others elect to work in partnerships with for-profit clinics.  There will be different models available.  What everyone will have is the same freely negotiable insurance cover.  One can pick and choose the kind of doctor or hospital one wants to go to.  In this system, large State-run hospital groups may not find themselves in a favourable competitive environment.  The notion of having fixed national contracts for all doctors as if they all had the same unitary employer may not be feasible.</p><p>I wish the Minister well with his reforms.  I am hopeful and confident that he will be in the chair he is in now to see through those reforms for the most part during the term of the current Government.  It is potentially historic for our health service if these reforms come to pass.  I ask the Minister not to waver, to keep pushing and to avoid being taken captive by the Civil Service.</p></speech>

The record should read that in the past 17 years, there were 14 years with overruns.  This year's overrun of &euro;158 million, as quoted by Senator MacSharry, represents 0.0166% of the budget.  In a demand-led system, that is not the disaster it has been portrayed to be by my good friend, Senator MacSharry.<br />The Bill is highly technical and gives expression to the Government's objective of retaking financial control of the HSE.  Not many people know that under the terms of the Health Act 2004, the HSE is funded through a separate process to the funding process for the Department.  Under the Act, the Minister has no legal role in setting budgets, which is a remarkable thing.  When the Health Act 2004 was enacted, this was considered a good thing in that it allowed the HSE to have a greater level of autonomy.  However, in the absence of robust - or any - reforms to create an accountable system of health care, the grand idea of HSE independence created a situation in which accountability to the Minister was weakened entirely.  It is difficult at this remove to understand the thinking that informed the decision to go down this route.  Political expediency may have had a little to do with it.  The hands-off model of administration which the 2004 Act establishing the HSE created probably suited the then-Minister who was generally thought to have been the least competent Minister for Health that we have had for a great many years.  He continues to act as leader of the Opposition.<br />Some of us at the time who were involved in the HSE consultative fora, which were established at that time, realised that a bureacracy as large as the HSE was a disaster waiting to happen in the absence of ministerial control and accountability.  I was very vocal about this when I was a member of HSE South's consultative forum, as were many of my colleagues.  Warnings by mere county councillors fell on deaf ears, which is a reason I welcome the legislation as part of the Minister's work to regain control of what many commentators have always described as a bureaucratic jungle.  The creation of a new financial structure is one part of the administrative jigsaw.  It comes on top of the decision to abolish the board of the HSE in 2012, which the Minister was bold enough to do.  He received criticism at the time, but he has turned out to be 100% right.  I commend him for that.  In setting up a statutory funding framework, the Minister takes us a step further, as Senator Crown has acknowledged, towards delivering the wide-ranging reforms set out in the programme for Government.  Change in one area is always felt in another, which is why section 8 provides for the adapting of the service plan to take account of the changes.<br />I am particularly happy with the insertion of sections 34(<i>a</i>) and 34(<i>b</i>) of the Act of a statutory obligation of the Director General of the HSE to appear before the PAC.  It is very welcome in light of what we have seen recently among other senior civil servants appearing in front of the same committee.  I have been critical of the HSE for a long time, mainly due to the difficulty in obtaining information, the cumbersome nature of decision-making and the perceived lack of accountability.  The Minister might advise me as to whether it would be possible in this or another Bill to introduce changes which give real bite to the regional consultative fora which are established in local government.  HSE South's consultative forum is comprised of 39 members of local authorities from seven or eight counties.  All other regions have the same set up.  I was a member and the leader of the Labour Party on HSE South's consultative forum for a number of years and I note the frustration felt at stonewalling by the HSE regarding the provision of relevant information.  Any reform in that regard would offer bottom-up accountability as well as the accountability of the HSE to the Minister.  We would have accountability on both sides of the equation.<br />The Bill is an important step in redressing the weaknesses in the HSE.  Many Bills contain references to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  How will that work out in future given that previous Governments have not established such an office holder?  Does it mean wide-ranging reforms will fall or will one Bill repeal all mention of the public expenditure and reform ministerial responsibility?  What way does it work?<br />We will reflect on those questions and discuss them in more detail on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

It is probably the most difficult task in Irish public life to reform the health service.  I note from the first page of the Minister's speech that we are on a journey to the dissolution of the HSE.  Our briefing document from the Oireachtas includes the steps mentioned by Senator Crown towards more freedom for hospitals in the model to which the Minister is moving.</p><p>I was associated with one of the moves the Minister is reversing - the creation of the HSE - as I served on the Brennan commission.</p> <p>I agree with what the Minister is doing today.  We all learn as we go along.  Health was local, then regional and then national, and now it is being devolved back to individual hospitals.  I think that is the correct way to proceed.  I am not trying to justify anything <i>ex post facto</i>but what influenced us was the fact that the old regional health boards were never able to strike budgets and annoyed a sufficient number of people to the point that their abolition was commended.  Thereby hangs another tale, because there were no savings.  The headquarters in places such as Kells simply transferred to something else.  That is a problem.  People arrive from the south and west in Dublin and see a former hospital changed into offices for health bureaucrats.  When I used to go to matches in Tullamore, the relatively large building on the way into town was the headquarters of the Midlands Health Board and the relatively small building beside it was the hospital.  I think that is being addressed, and the hospital has had an extension.  We have a huge problem in that there are still around 8,500 medical and dental staff but nearly 16,000 management staff.  My sector in education experienced the same kind of problem.  A US economist called it Baumol's disease.  It should not exist and does not need to exist.  When I am sick, I want to see Senator Crown or, indeed, the Minister.  I do not want the other 16,000 administrators doing calculations and converting hospitals into office blocks.  We have the same problem in education.  The basic transaction is quite low-cost.  It involves a podium and lecturer and, hopefully, something happens within 50 minutes with more than 400 people listening.  If one can do it that way, it is an extremely worthwhile proposition.  <br />I hope that the dissolution of the HSE, of which this Bill is a part, will tackle the fact that we gained no administrative efficiencies from the abolition of regional health boards.  I appreciate that the Minister has inherited an extremely difficult situation and that he has managed to run the health service, according to the December 2013 figures we received, with 99,959 staff, compared to as many as 111,770 in previous years.  From the mid-1980s to the peak of the boom, the Minister's predecessors doubled the number of staff in the health service, from 55,000 to about 111,000.  That seemed to take place without any regard to what the outcomes were and whether patients would be better off.  We lost the focus.  This Minister has had to try to correct that.  The Bill is a step along that road.  <br />We have problems such as the bureaucracy I mentioned and the length of stays in hospitals.  A report found that a treatment that would have taken about three and a half days in other countries took more than 11 days here.  Another problem is the lack of competition.  I hope that under the new system, the hospitals will compete.  I do not want layers of bureaucracy.  I want it to be the case that hospital X performs a particular operation because it persuaded a competitive insurance industry it could do it better than anybody else and it does not carry out excessive numbers of tests or keep people in hospital too long.  <br />In developing the GP service, there is evidence that excessive hospitalisation exists because of the de-skilling of GPs, particularly where their practices are near major hospitals.  This needs to be tackled.  It is an immense task.  I commend the Minister on taking on a gargantuan task that has probably been made far more difficult by some of the mistakes made in the past.  It needs to be reduced to the simple transaction between doctor and patient.  The bureaucracy and many of the irrelevancies must be removed.  If we can do that by taking the Minister's route, including the dissolution of the HSE, I support him in that regard.  It is long overdue.  The burden has fallen on this Minister's shoulders, and I wish him well in the task.</p></speech>

It is essentially a technicality whether funding for health services is voted in separate HSE and Department of Health Votes, as has been the case up to now, or in one Vote, as will be the case under this Bill.  What matters is that there is sufficient funding and that this funding is used to best effect.  On both counts, this Government, like its predecessors, is failing.  By the end of 2014, under the HSE service plan, almost &euro;4 billion will have been taken out of our public health services since 2008.  In terms of staff numbers, a further 2,600 whole-time equivalents are to go in 2014 on top of the 12,500 that have gone since 2007.  Under the HSE divisional plans, hospitals are expected not only to function as last year but to perform better with a reduction of &euro;200 million in their budgets.  Acute hospitals that are already struggling face an average reduction of 4% in their funding.  By the HSE's own admission, front-line care is being affected, with a projected drop of 25,000 in the number of day cases and a reduction of 3,000 in the number of inpatient treatments during 2014.</p><p>An example of how unrealistic these plans are is the target of reducing delayed discharge from acute hospitals by 4%.  The allocation for nursing home beds has been reduced, which will mean many more older people spending longer in scarce hospital beds, because there are insufficient nursing home places for those requiring residential care.  It is something I have noted at the briefings we get as Oireachtas Members from hospital groups and primary care representatives.  There always seems to be a lack of joined-up thinking.  Issues that could be dealt with in a primary care setting are often kicked to touch because of budgetary constraints and we end up having to pay far more money in the acute hospital setting to pick up the pieces.  The patient is the person who suffers.  </p><p>The report of the Mental Health Commission shows that only 44% of psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities are compliant with staffing level regulations.  It is ironic that we are here debating this issue when nurses from the Psychiatric Nurses' Association are protesting outside the hospital in Galway about the lack of psychiatric nurses there.  It was predicted after the closure of St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe that additional pressure would be put on University College Hospital Galway.  They are very concerned that while there should be a cohort of 50 nurses in that unit, only nine are there on a regular basis.  They are very concerned about the level of care they are able to give under those circumstances.  Certainly, it leaves much to be desired.  Such policies are endangering the delivery of confident and responsive community-based services, as envisaged in A Vision for Change, which is the Government's mental health strategy.  It is also of huge concern that the Mental Health Commission reports that children are still being admitted to adult units.  A total of 91, or 22.3%, of all child admissions in 2013 were to adult units.  </p><p>This Bill is essentially a technical piece of legislation as it provides for the ending of the HSE's separate Vote in the budget.  In future, it is be funded through the Vote for the Office for the Minister for Health.  However, in light of what I have pointed out regarding budget underfunding in 2013, the resulting necessary Supplementary Estimates and the underfunding in 2014, section 10 of the Bill is a cause for concern.  It would mean an overspend in one year would be carried over to the following year as a charge on the HSE budget.  It is relevant that Senator MacSharry raised the oversight issues that came to light in the West/North West Hospitals Group.  It is very hard to trust the Department of Health on issues such as this when we see that there was an issue with the procurement process in respect of the review of maternity services in that hospital group.  It came to light that the chairman of the group had to resign as a result of that.  If the Minister leaves office, will he make available before then the HSE report on that procurement process, which I know related to that particular review?</p></speech>

Perhaps I will start with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, who referred to fewer long-term care beds being available for lay discharges, as if such were the only solution for someone who did not necessarily need long-term care in a nursing home as we understand it, but more home care packages and a tiered approach to supported accommodation, which is something we are developing with a number of NGOs.</p><p>The Senator discussed the psychiatric nursing situation in Galway.  We are implementing A Vision for Change, which is something with which all sides of the House agree.  The Lower House did not divide on this issue last night.  That strategy requires a change in the model of care, but at the core of everything we are doing is the fact that the basis of any measurement must be better outcomes for patients.  It does not matter how nice a scheme is or how well built a building is.  If the net result is not better outcomes for patients, it is all for naught.</p><p>The Senator also mentioned the issue of the number of children who are still being admitted to adult facilities.  This is something that is not acceptable and we have been working hard on it.  Although the number has reduced year on year, it is still happening.  We want to reach a point at which no person under 18 years of age is admitted to an adult psychiatric unit.</p><p>Senator MacSharry stated that the review of maternity services had not yet started, but it has.  A literature review of best international practice has been commissioned and is due to be completed by the end of this month.  The HSE's review of services across all maternity units is due to be completed shortly and will feed into the process as well.  That will inform the maternity services strategy, which should be finalised by the end of the year.</p><p>I agree with many of Senator Barrett's points.  I accept that he has had to leave but, on the subject of admitting past mistakes, I have told him that we all make mistakes.  In fact, the old saying that the man who never made a mistake never made anything at all is quite true.</p><p>Regarding changes in legislation on consultative forums, this Bill deals solely with the Vote arrangements and is not an appropriate vehicle for making consultative reforms.  However, there is no doubt that there is a deficit in the democratic process arising out of the formation of the HSE.  This must be addressed by giving the forums a real input.  I decried the passing of the health boards.  I was a member of one, although I was not involved in politics at the time.  I wore a different hat entirely, but I was concerned about the loss of the democratic input.</p><p>The designation of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be changed by legislation.</p><p>Issues were raised concerning finances.  Senator Gilroy comprehensively dealt with the fact that, for 14 of the past 17 years, the HSE and the Department of Health have incurred overruns.  This is a difficulty with a demand-led service.</p><p>Senator MacSharry raised a number of other issues, but I agree with him about the HSE having been a disaster, but one of Fianna F&aacute;il and its current leader's creation.  I do not blame the people who work in the structure but those who put a structure in place that has resulted in significant frustration for those who work on the front line, have been trained to deliver excellence and are only too willing and able to do so.  They have been frustrated by a monolithic structure of command and control that has removed the innovative ability of the front line to think on its feet.  The arrival of the special delivery unit, SDU, which engaged with the front line in a meaningful way, has allowed for a resurgence of that innovation.  Despite the loss of &euro;3.3 billion, or more than 20%, from our budget, a reduction of 14,000, or more than 10%, in our staff, and an 8% growth in population since 2008, we have been able not only to maintain the service but to improve it in a verifiable, open and transparent way.  The numbers from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, show this.  Trolley counts were down 34% in the first three years and a further 7% this year, despite all of the challenges that we face.  I pay tribute to and express my gratitude and that of the Government for the people working in the health service and the great job they do on a daily basis.</p><p>To err is to be human.  As the airline industry does, we want to build proper systems that protect patients from the inevitability of errors.  However, there is a major difference between the airline industry and health services.  An airline can cancel a flight, but we cannot cancel an operation when a patient is on the table without him or her dying.</p><p>Several Senators raised the issue of manpower.  I am pleased to report that I met Professor Brian MacCraith just before attending the Seanad.  His third and final report is ready and we will publish it on Monday.  It represents a great deal of work done by him and his team.  I pay tribute to them, as this issue has been lying around for 30 years across successive Administrations.  Like everything else in our health service, manpower has been allowed to evolve chaotically.  We are setting a clear career path for young doctors and allowing a clear understanding of where demand will be when they enter training programmes.  Proper training programmes will now be more reflective of international norms, without making doctors wait 12 years to become specialists when it only takes six years elsewhere.  To those who claim this is too short a time, I say it is not.  Even after 12 years, no one expects a brand new consultant to be as experienced as someone who has been there for 20 years.  This is self-evident in any walk of life.  People's progression will be supported.  We need more mentoring of young doctors so that they can be advised on the paths they might take instead of being left to wonder how to make progress.</p><p>I thank Senators for taking part in this debate.  I re-emphasise the Government's commitment to the health reform programme as set out in the programme for Government.  The Bill will implement one of the commitments contained in that programme.  While it is largely technical legislation and, as Senator Crown stated, only a small step on a long road, it is still part of a process that is designed to give people the health service they not only deserve but have paid for.  It will be a single-tier service in which people will be treated on the basis of medical need, not on the basis of what they can pay, and, if I may say this to the Senators across the floor, one under which all Irish citizens will be happy to be treated in this country and will not need to go abroad.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1143" speakername="John Whelan" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300026#BB01000"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State.  As he will be aware, despite the fact that the school holidays have only commenced, issues surrounding the back to school clothing and footwear scheme are arising already.  This is a particularly stressful and arduous time for families and parents and many thousands of children benefit from the scheme annually.  My concern is those families who, because of income thresholds, do not qualify for or benefit from this worthy scheme.  I am speaking about working parents with two or three children of schoolgoing age who are faced on an annual basis with hefty costs in the purchase of school books.  I have already been contacted by a number of parents who, while they understand they must pay for school books for their children, still cannot fathom why so many schools still do not operate the school book rental scheme.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills, with the Minister, has been pioneering the scheme and that &euro;15 million has been set aside this year for it.</p><p>What continues to baffle and astound me and parents is the reason textbooks change from one year to the next, such that siblings in second and third year cannot pass on school books to their younger brothers and sisters on entering first year.  This is no longer acceptable.  Despite repeated efforts to address this issue, it is still ongoing.  There is no good reason school books, if properly maintained, cannot be passed between siblings in the secondary school system.  Many working families will have to forgo many things this summer, including, perhaps, a holiday, in order to put money aside for school books, the cost of which can amount to hundreds of euro per child.  The cost of school books for two or three children in secondary school and, perhaps, older children starting college is a heavy burden on families.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State on the efforts being made by the Department to alleviate this cost and improve access to the school book rental scheme.  Will he indicate how many schools countrywide are operating the scheme, giving a county by county breakdown, and why particular schools are not availing of it when it is available to them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-03a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070300026#BB01100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it affords me an opportunity to outline to the House the position on the cost of school books.  The Government shares the concern expressed by him and many parents about the high costs associated with children's attendance in school.  In this regard, the Minister for Education and Skills has undertaken a number of initiatives to help to reduce the burden on parents.  In relation to textbook costs, the Minister met the Irish Educational Publishers Association which resulted in the association agreeing to a voluntary code of practice.  The code commits publishers to limiting the publication of new editions and maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  This addresses one of the concerns expressed by the Senator.  The Minister, when publishing the code, outlined that if publishers did not see fit to adhere to it voluntarily, there were other options open to him to ensure they did so.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at a discount in order that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.</p><p>The Department provides approximately &euro;15 million per annum for primary and second level schools towards the provision of school books.  A grant of &euro;11 per pupil is provided for primary schools, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;21 per pupil.  At second level, a grant of &euro;24 per pupil is available, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;39 per pupil.  The Minister has identified book rental schemes as the most effective method of reducing the costs of schools books.  In January 2013 he launched Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and a Guide for Parents.  These guidelines encourage this practice across all schools on the education landscape.</p><p>First and second level schools were asked to make returns to the Department on book rental schemes as part of their annual returns.  Information provided for the Department for September 2013 shows a high level of book rental schemes in operation.  At primary level, 84% of schools operate book rental schemes, while at second level 68% of schools reported that they operated such schemes.  In budget 2014 funding of &euro;15 million over three years was provided to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that did not operate them.  To establish book rental schemes, DEIS schools will receive &euro;150 per child, while non-DEIS schools will receive &euro;100 per child in seed capital in the next two years.  This will cost approximately &euro;6.7million of the &euro;15 million secured in the three year period 2014 to 2016.</p><p>For primary schools with book rental schemes in place, the Minister re-examined the scheme to see if such schools could also be allocated funding.  The balance of &euro;8.3 million will be divided in 2015 and 2016 among primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes, with DEIS schools to receive &euro;20 per pupil and non-DEIS schools &euro;18 per pupil in these two years.  Every primary school has been given the opportunity to benefit from the funding secured for the school book rental scheme.  </p><p>There are some interesting developments emerging in primary schools, in particular, but also in post-primary schools, with teachers and pupils collaborating to generate their own learning content primarily through digital devices such as tablets, netbooks and so on.</p> <p>I envisage a time, perhaps in the not too distant future, when there will be an opportunity for teachers to collaborate in generating their own learning content and not require the use of school books in certain school settings when studying certain school subjects.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond to this matter.</p></speech>

I am heartened to see the commitment of the Minister to the book rental scheme, of which there is a good take-up across the country.  However, there are blind spots and schools that are reluctant; therefore, some effort and co-operation are required between management of a school, the teachers, parents and students.  Perhaps the Minister of State might make available in due course a list of the schools, on a county by county basis, that are availing of the scheme.  We could use it as a means of encouraging parents, in collaboration with school authorities, to encourage the schools that have not yet embraced the scheme to do so.  It would be a great relief to parents and help to offset this annual cost for families.</p></speech>

In view of the recent kite flying by the Opposition, I hope he will provide clarity on the free travel pass issue.  Will he confirm that the current review of the system is not due to any wish on the part of the Government to withdraw the pass, but rather that it wishes to review the operation of the scheme to ensure the avoidance of fraud and in the context of the provision of the service via private operators?</p><p>The scheme permits free travel on most CIE public transport services, the Luas and a range of services offered by over 90 private operators in various parts of the country at an annual cost to the Exchequer of &euro;77 million.  There are in excess of 745,000 customers eligible for the free pass and when spousal and companion passes are included, that figure increases to 1.1 million, or almost 20% of the population.  The fact that the Government is reviewing the scheme does not mean that it is to be withdrawn.  Every scheme operated by the State must be subject to constant review in terms of efficiency and protection against fraud.  Not to do so would be irresponsible on the part of the Government.</p><p>Under the Programme for National Recovery, increases in subventions for private operators were frozen.  It is also the case that no new operators were allowed to join the scheme.  Given the state of the public finances at the time, that decision was warranted.  In these circumstances, I can understand why private operators might have a difficulty, given that inflation, although low, has eaten into the moneys they receive to provide the service in recent years.  A review is, therefore, necessary.</p><p>There has been speculation on another issue in recent days, on which the Minister of State might give the House the benefit of his thinking, the issue of means testing.  Will he confirm, for the avoidance of doubt, that no such action is envisaged?</p></speech>

The scheme permits customers to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, the Luas and a range of services offered by up to 90 private operators in various parts of the country.  Customers of the scheme over 66 years of age who are married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership receive a pass that allows their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant to travel with them for free.  Certain customers can receive a companion pass which allows any person over the age of 16 years to accompany them for free.</p><p>Free travel is also available on cross-Border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  The all-Ireland free travel scheme allows a free travel pass holder, aged 66 years and older, to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services within Northern Ireland using a senior smartpass card.  Similarly, Northern Ireland senior smartpass holders are entitled to travel for free on services in Ireland using their existing senior smartpass.</p><p>When the free travel scheme was introduced in 1967, it was a scheme for old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  At the time of its introduction, the then Minister for Finance described the objective of the scheme as being to &quot;relieve the difficult circumstances of old people who live alone&quot; by giving them &quot;additional help by way of free electricity and transport.&quot;  In 1972 the scheme was extended to people aged 70 years and over.  Although 70 years of age was pension age at the time, this extension also removed the requirement for people to be in receipt of the old age pension or any other social welfare payment to qualify for free travel.  The age at which free travel was available to all was reduced several times until finally it was reduced to the age of 66 years in 1977.</p><p>In 2001 there were 608,000 customers covered by the free travel scheme; today there are 780,000.  This represents an increase of almost 30%.  In 2001 the scheme cost approximately &euro;46 million per year; in 2014 it will cost &euro;77 million, an increase of 65%.  As the House will be aware, funding for scheme was frozen by the previous Government at 2010 levels of expenditure, as outlined in the national recovery plan 2011 to 2014 and the budget for 2011.  During this period the Department has, therefore, not been in a position to increase the level of payments in excess of this level of expenditure or to accept additional routes or providers within the scheme.</p><p>Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Social Protection established a working group with representatives of the two Departments, as well as of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority, to review the free travel scheme.  The purpose of the review is &quot;to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme&quot;.  While the interdepartmental working group has been tasked with ensuring &quot;that its recommendations have regard to the likely impact on costs both immediate and into the future&quot;, it had no specific mandate to identify potential savings based on current funding levels.  The work of the group is expected to conclude shortly.  The Minister will examine its report as soon as it is available.</p><p>The Government appreciates the importance of the free travel scheme and the value it provides for the hundreds of thousands of mostly elderly people who use it.  The Government has no plans to take passes away from pensioners.  We must ensure the scheme which has been in operation for almost 50 years can continue to operate in an efficient and sustainable way into the future.</p></speech>

I am sure many people will be glad to hear that there are no plans to remove the free travel pass from those who are eligible for it.  When the review has been completed, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State returned to the House to report to us on it.</p></speech>
