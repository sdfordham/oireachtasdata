There are now more than 4,000 on the waiting list for gynaecological services in Cork University Hospital and this makes up 42% of the total waiting list of the country.  We opened a brand new maternity unit over ten years ago and two theatres were built.  At present, one is opened for three and a half days a week while the other is not open at all.  It is not available for use because staff are not available.  I am looking for adequate resources to be provided.  Over 8,500 babies a year are born in the maternity unit at Cork University Hospital and there are back-up gynaecology services too but the unit does not have an independent budget and is simply part of the entire budget of CUH.</p> <p>We have had a number of meetings with the consultants and the Minister has met with them too.  Now is the time to move on and for a decision to be made to fast-track people on the list, some of whom have been waiting for over 12 months for an appointment.  It is also possible that we can use facilities in one of the other hospitals, either public or private, to do this.  I am not talking about using the national treatment purchase fund because in that case patients will end up being reviewed by the consultants who are currently looking after them.</p> <p>This needs to be given priority as 4,000 are waiting, many for more than 12 months.  It is a matter of resources and of providing theatre nurses and staff so that one theatre can be opened five days a week and the other also opened.  The latter is a longer-term issue but is needs to be addressed immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-01-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017012600002#A00500"><p>I fully recognise the need to ensure that patients have timely access to health services.  The Department of Health works closely with the Health Service Executive and the national treatment purchase fund to ensure that they implement measures to reduce waiting times.  Budget 2017 makes specific provision for the treatment of those waiting the longest.  In this regard, &euro;20 million has been allocated to the national treatment purchase fund, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In December, the Minister, Deputy Harris, granted approval to the national treatment purchase fund for a &euro;5 million initiative focusing on day case procedures which will aim to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 18 months for a day case procedure, including gynaecology, by 30 June 2017.  The Minister has also asked the Health Service Executive to submit a waiting list action plan for 2017 in respect of both the inpatient day case and outpatient waiting lists.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October 2017.</p> <p>This week the Minister, Deputy Harris, wrote to the Health Service Executive requesting that in developing these action plans a particular focus be given to reducing waiting times in gynaecology.  I am aware that there are difficulties with waiting times for gynaecology services in Cork University Hospital in particular.  On 12 January the Minister visited the hospital to meet with hospital management, south-south west hospital group management and a number of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This allowed him to learn at first hand about these problems, which are in part due to staff resource challenges including those associated with recruiting theatre staff nurses.  He has asked his officials in the Department of Health to work closely with the Health Service Executive and the hospital group to ensure the waiting list for gynaecology procedures is addressed as a priority in advance of his follow-up meeting.  The hospital has advised that the provision of additional gynaecology operating capacity is a priority for the executive management board, as is the optimisation of operating output from theatre sessions which are already in place.  In that regard, the board is working with the gynaecology department and the hospital group to maximise capacity in the theatre sessions already in place, to recruit additional theatre staff nurses to provide additional theatre time and to progress the introduction of pre-admission assessment for these patients to improve efficiencies and patient flow. </p><p>The governance structures for our maternity services are currently being remodelled with the establishment of the Health Service Executive's national women and infants health programme and maternity networks across the hospital groups.  The programme will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services to ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of maternity networks. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has advised me that he expects that the new maternity network, which is currently being established in the south-south west hospital group, will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity and gynaecological resources across the group.</p></speech>

My only concern is that a list was allowed to build up like this.  My understanding is that back in 2009 there was a waiting list of over 2,900.  We are now six or seven years on and we do not seem have a timeline for when action will be taken.  When will the theatre be open five days a week?  When will we progress to the second theatre?  How can we fast-track a review of patients?  The HSE needs to give us a clear timeline of when it expects action to be taken on this matter.  That clarification is needed at this stage.</p></speech>

Many of its comprehensive range of proposals have been successfully implemented while others, such as water charges, continue to be controversial.  One of the stated objectives of the report was to keep the overall tax burden low and to enhance the rewards of work while increasing the fairness of the tax system.  It also sought to ensure that our regulatory framework was flexible, proportionate and up to date.  One of the key words here is &ldquo;fairness&rdquo;.  By fairness I mean, the impartial and just treatment of citizens without favouritism or discrimination.</p> <p>Yet our taxation system continues to remain strategically skewed and inherently unfair.  Our personal taxation system is full of anomalies and the legal loopholes and business arrangements which facilitate tax avoidance seem to be infinite.  Last year&rsquo;s report of the Irish Tax Institute reminded us that the nine consecutive budgets between 2009 and 2016 involved over 50 different tax changes that impacted Ireland&rsquo;s personal tax system.  It not only brought about some unintended consequences, it also created anomalies across all salary levels.  We all know about what is called the &ldquo;squeezed middle&rdquo; and that a self-employed person earning &euro;18,000 will pay &euro;1,820 more in tax than a PAYE worker on the same salary.</p> <p>I am aware that the Income Tax Reform Plan 2016 sought to address some of these issues but while we have been focusing on personal taxation successive Governments have taken their eye off the tax ball and we now know to our immense cost that the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 created loopholes which effectively allowed for the loss of taxes to the tune of &euro;2 billion per year. This, added to the European Commission&rsquo;s judgement that Apple owes the Irish state &euro;13 billion in unpaid taxes, points to a failure by the Government to stop a haemorrhage of taxes from the state, taxes which would have funded much needed infrastructural projects. </p> <p>There has been a lot of focus on the so called vulture funds and the charities which benefitted from them,  but the real question to be addressed by the Commission on Taxation is who was asleep at the wheel, who turned a blind eye to the wholesale strategic and legal avoidance of taxes over the last ten years and how can these loopholes be immediately closed.  The report of the Commission on Taxation 2009 was produced through a social partnership approach with serious input from trade unions, business, agriculture, the charity sector, financial advisers and academia among others.  The cynics among us might say that the Government can no longer be trusted to be the sole decision maker regarding taxation policy and that it has not acted in the public interest.  I therefore believe there is a real need to return to this stakeholder model, a model  which encourages public engagement and wide sectoral consultation, would  strengthen the work of the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Revenue Commissioners and which would bring much needed transparency and reassurance to a now very disheartened public. </p> <p>The reputational damage to the integrity and fairness of our taxation system by the vulture fund revelations is enormous and has left a very sour taste in the mouths of the thousands of distressed residential mortgage holders on whose backs these immense profits were made.  We owe it to them to undertake a comprehensive independent review of our taxation system. It is the very least that we can do.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his time and attention to this matter today.  I hope that he will give my proposal serious consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-01-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017012600002#B00600"><p>I first apologise for my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Unfortunately he has to go to an urgent meeting in Brussels.</p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue in Seanad &Eacute;ireann this morning.  The appointment of a Commission on Taxation by any Government is a major undertaking which often takes several years to report.  Commissions of Taxation tend to focus on the medium-term to long-term as regards the appropriate development of the tax system and since it tends to take many years to implement all of their recommendations they are, as often as not, a once in a generation events.  The last Commission on Taxation was in place in 2008 and 2009, with the one prior to that having existed between 1980 and 1985.  Given that a Commission on Taxation has reported as recently as 2009, it is not clear what exactly would be gained by undertaking such a large-scale task again so soon.</p> <p>It should be noted that, since the last Commission on Taxation reported, the Department of Finance has made major strides in improving the evidence base available to it to inform taxation policy.  For example, a major review of the corporation tax system was undertaken by the Department in 2014 with the extensive range of analyses and outputs published with budget 2015.  The purpose of the research was to quantify the effect of the three elements underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax policy, that is, rate, regime and reputation.</p> <p>Building on this successful review, the Department entered into a research partnership with the Economic and Social Research Institute in early 2015.  This agreement covers research in the areas of macroeconomics and taxation policy.  As well as extensive analysis of the potential effects of Brexit on the economy, a significant volume of taxation-related research has been undertaken under the programme including on important issues such as the relationship between corporation tax rates and foreign direct investment and the volatility of tax revenues.  All of the research is published and is available to inform the wider tax policy debate.</p> <p>In relation to local property tax, the LPT, the 2012 report of the inter-departmental group on the design of a local property tax, the Thornhill group, considered the structures and modalities for a full property tax which was subsequently introduced in 2013.  The Minister for Finance commissioned a review of the LPT in 2015 to consider its operation, and in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to recent property price developments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The review was informed by the outcomes of a public consultation which received over 50 written submissions.<br/><br/>Senators will be aware also that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue the process of unwinding the USC is not a measure that is being considered in isolation, but as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan.  The Department of Finance published, in July 2016, a detailed review of the policy considerations relevant to this reform, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base, and retain appropriate levels of taxation for higher earners.<br/><br/>A detailed review of agri-taxation was published by the Department of Finance in October 2014.  The following year, an independent review of marine taxation was also undertaken, resulting in the Government bringing forward changes to the tax code prompted by the reviews.<br/><br/>The last Commission on Taxation undertook a major review of tax expenditures.  Again, the Department of Finance built on this work and subsequently developed a framework for the evaluation of tax expenditures as set out in the report on tax expenditures published with the budget in 2015.<br/><br/>From time to time, the Department carries out reviews of existing tax expenditures and<i>ex ante </i>evaluations of proposed new tax incentives with the various reviews and evaluations being published in the annual report on tax expenditure.</p></speech>

Workers in this country have suffered hugely from the cuts in recent years.  The local property tax is probably the most unfair tax in the country, given that it is location-based.  God help anybody in Dublin as one can have a massive house in rural Ireland and not pay nearly the same amount of local property tax.  Also, local authorities are redistributing the local property tax.  I ask that we have a complete review of the entire tax system.  The vulture funds, in particular, are hurting people in this country.  I am sure the Minister of State is in touch with his constituency people and I know that he will be hearing the stories that I am hearing about vulture funds having ripped off this country.  That is really the angle that we are looking at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-01-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017012600002#C00300"><p>I have listened attentively to what Senator Craughwell said.  I already described the recent reviews and research into taxation matters by the Department of Finance.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate now to outline some of the incentives that have been undertaken this year.  For example, the development of a new small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, focused share-based remuneration scheme was announced in the budget for 2017 and is scheduled to be introduced in the budget for 2018.  A public consultation has been conducted by the Department of Finance as part of the development process and engagement with the EU to ensure compliance with state aid requirements and this will also be undertaken.</p> <p>Also, in line with the established practice of carrying out periodic reviews of key areas of tax policy, the Minister for Finance has announced in the budget that a review of Ireland's corporation tax code would be undertaken by an independent group, led by the economist, Mr. Seamus Coffey.  Since the review in 2014 there have been significant changes in the international tax environment, including new legislative proposals in the feed of company taxation from the European Union and the ongoing Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, base erosion and profit shifting initiative as well.  In this context it is timely and prudent to carry out a review of the corporation tax code to take into account these recent developments.  Terms of reference were published in the 2017 budget book.  I would note also that during the D&aacute;il Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill 2016, it was indicated that the Minister for Finance had asked Mr. Coffey to examine the strong performance of corporation tax receipts, evident since 2015.  Accordingly, this will also form part of the review itself, which is important.</p> <p>The examples I have cited demonstrate that detailed taxation research is effectively continuous and is given high priority by the Minister for Finance and his officials, given the challenging times we have at the moment.  I will take on board the Senator's views and will convey to the Minister for Finance the issues he raised in his supplementary question.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State will be aware, I have had many discussions with both him and Department officials since first becoming aware of plans to open the centre on Thursday, 5 January.</p> <p>As a community, we, in Ballaghaderreen, understand fully that these refugees who are coming to the centre in Ballaghaderreen have been through the most horrific experiences.  We want to reach out and support them in the best way we can.  There has been a huge amount of media attention about the reaction of local people in Ballaghaderreen.  I want to make it very clear that Ballaghaderreen people will play their part.  We will do our fair share in terms of supporting people who have been through very difficult experiences.  We had a very lengthy meeting as part of the Ballaghaderreen town team yesterday with Department officials in Roscommon.  Arising from that meeting, I have a number of questions.</p> <p>We want to be reassured that the proper resources and services will be in place to support these people when they come in March.  My understanding is that there will be 82 people coming through Greece from Syria.  They will have been vetted by Department of Justice and Equality officials.  Initially, they will be coming to stay in Balseskin near Dublin Airport, where they will have a full medical assessment and they will begin to have a full needs assessment on their educational needs.  They will then come to Ballaghaderreen where they will stay for a maximum period of six months.</p> <p>It is really important that proper communications channels are opened.  At the moment, there is a national task force that brings together all the different agencies.  I urge the Minister that the communication channels locally be opened in terms of engagement with local general practitioners, local schools, the Roscommon County Childcare Committee, the education and training board and all the different and necessary agencies and services that will need to be involved in order to support these people.  Without doubt, there has been a difficulty here and I ask that there is immediate communication and engagement with local service providers who want to provide support in the best way they can.</p> <p>When we talk about the centre being opened in the Abbeyfield Hotel, as a community we had high hopes that the hotel would reopen as a functioning hotel.  That has not happened.  A two year lease has been signed.  The facility is vacant and why not support people who need our help at this time?  That is very much our view.  However, we need to ensure we properly support the community in doing that.  My understanding from the meeting yesterday is that the Red Cross will be very involved with assisting the community and co-ordinating that community support because there has been a huge and overwhelming response from people who want to help and to be volunteers.  That needs to structured and assistance needs to be provided in terms of that integration piece.  From speaking with Department officials yesterday, I know the Red Cross will be very much involved in that process.  As early as possible, we want to ensure these people feel welcome and part of our community for however long they may stay.</p> <p>I want to be reassured by the Minister of State that evidence will be provided to the local community that the proper resources in terms of teaching, interpreters, GP services and all the other allied health professional services required to support these people will be provided from additional resources, not from existing resources.  At the moment, services within our area are already at breaking point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need these assurances and to see evidence locally of communication channels being opened and plans being put in place to support the people who will be coming in the next couple of weeks.  I understand from the discussions that took place yesterday that 82 people will be coming in March and that there is capacity at the facility for up to 200.  Following my visit to the Monasterevin centre, I am seeking assurances from the Minister of State that if there are teething problems or difficulties in service provision, they will be properly addressed before additional people are brought to the centre.  The plan is to place 82 people in the centre initially, with a further 80 to be placed there next month and more to come until full capacity of 200 is reached.  It is important that initial challenges such as occurred in Monasterevin be properly addressed before further people are brought to the centre so as to ensure they will be properly supported.</p></speech>

Many of those coming to Ireland have lost families and homes.  Some 761 persons have come to Ireland so far and 2,000 are due to arrive this year.  The intention is that they will be housed temporarily in emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs, and then move to permanent homes across the country.  The EROC recently announced for Ballaghaderreen is the third such centre in the country.  The other centres are in the Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin and Clonea Strand in Dungarvan.  Therefore, there is experience of the process involved.  The principal aim of the Government in establishing such centres is to provide a safe and calm environment in which migrants, mostly young families who have endured unimaginable loss and suffering, can take time to recover physically and mentally, acclimatise themselves to Irish society, learn English and start planning for their future.  I note that the Senator has acknowledged the awful situation in which the people concerned have found themselves.</p> <p>The centres act as hubs for the important range of services that need to be delivered to these particularly vulnerable persons, including medical services, language training, education, cultural orientation and social protection services.  Key services such as health and education are provided through mainstream services.  The relevant mainstream service providers are engaged in the task of ensuring local services can meet increased demand.  An IRPP task force chaired by the T&aacute;naiste offers the framework for planning for future demands on local services.  Moreover, as has become standard practice when opening a centre, a local EROC management group, comprising departmental officials and local service providers, is being established to oversee the delivery of required services to residents of the EROC and help to pursue solutions to resource issues that may arise for mainstream service delivery in the area.  The EROC management group will include representatives of the HSE, Tusla, the local education and training board and the Department of Social Protection, as well as local community garda&iacute; and IRPP officials.  </p> <p>Community involvement is crucial to the process of enabling refugees to build new lives in Ireland.  As a consequence, I will shortly announce the launch of a funding programme to stimulate communities across the country to take action in support of integration.  I have been very heartened by the welcome given by the people of Ballaghaderreen towards the refugees and asylum seekers.  This goodwill should be harnessed into community action and supported by the Government.  I am examining what support is possible to encourage initiatives that will benefit the local community, refugees and asylum seekers.  I met the Senator and other local politicians on 11 January to brief them on the opening of the centre.  Their support and that of the people of Ballaghaderreen will ensure the refugees will receive a true, warm Irish welcome.</p></speech>

The group to be established, headed by an official from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and tasked with bringing together all local service providers, will be important in ensuring proper communication and planning.  My visit to the Monasterevin centre last week was very productive and helpful.  We need to learn from what is happening in the centres in Monasterevin and Dungarvan.  There will always be a need to improve.  What I learned from my visit to the Monasterevin centre was that we could not make assumptions about what the people concerned needed.  It must be based on individual assessment.  As the Minister of State rightly said, they will need time to acclimatise, relax and put their lives back together following their horrendous and horrific experiences.  For my part, I will work closely with the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste and departmental officials to ensure we do our best such that the centre in Ballaghaderreen will be seen as a good example in this regard.  Ballaghaderreen is already multicultural and people living there want to be seen as a good example in reaching out and supporting those who need our help.</p></speech>

Any advice she could give us based on the visit would be welcomed.  If other colleagues want to visit other centres in a discreet and respectful manner, they can be facilitated.</p> <p>The Senator has raised important issues that go beyond the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, including the needs of rural communities and small towns.  The Government's rural development action plan provides a comprehensive framework for a series of initiatives to benefit rural Ireland.  The opening of the EROC in Ballaghaderreen will create employment opportunities and increase demand for services and goods in the locality.  The contractor is aware of the importance of providing jobs within the locality and sourcing goods and services locally, where possible.  Bringing new people into Ballaghaderreen will boost the local area.  This has been our experience with the other EROCs.  However, I would like to examine how we can foster initiatives within the community to benefit locals and refugees.  Work is being undertaken within the Department of Justice and Equality to see what is possible.  </p> <p>The IRPP task force, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, includes representatives of all statutory service providers.  It provides the framework for planning to meet future demands and developing solutions where mainstream services are struggling to meet the additional demands following the arrival of refugees.  Officials of the Department of Justice and Equality met local representatives on a number of occasions, most recently yesterday.  They will continue to engage with them and officials to ensure planning for the arrival of the refugees and asylum seekers will go smoothly.  As I said, the asylum seekers will not arrive until early March.  As such, there is a good lead-in time for everything to be established.  In this regard, we will take on board what we have learned at the other two EROC centres, as well as the direct provision centres. </p> <p>I again thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

The first is that of rental housing supply in the market.  A report published today by the Simon Community has shown the gap widening between rent supplement and actual market rents.  The report illustrates that 83% of rental properties are beyond the reach of rent supplement.  The Simon Community supports over 8,300 individuals and families at risk of homelessness each year.  We should take heed of the report because the Simon Community is at the coalface of the housing crisis.  Ultimately, we need to address the issue of supply in the market because all these issues are ancillary to that of supply.  There are 2,000 vacant local authority properties lying idle in the country, which begs the question as to why they are not being refurbished.  Why have they not been put back into the mainstream local authority supply of social housing?</p> <p>Yesterday, I raised issues surrounding the first-time buyers grant and explained how the scheme is not working effectively.  We would not need these cobbled together schemes if we had decent supply in the market.  I ask the Minister to ensure that social housing is built and a proper fund put in place so that we can start building.  I have not been to one sod turning ceremony in my constituency, although I would like to attend one to see such construction.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns funding for drug and alcohol prevention task forces both in my area and in many cities around the country.  It has recently come to my attention that the HSE has been reducing funding for addiction services in the south inner city.  For the past 24 months, the south inner city task force has been run on a part-time basis and with the support of volunteers.  Furthermore, members of the south inner city drugs and alcohol task force conveyed their shock to me when they learned that a co-ordinator in a nearby task force was allowed to recruit another HSE staffer when they already had a full-time staff member.  </p> <p>I find it shocking and of serious concern to see more cuts in essential services in Dublin South Central.  I have previously raised concerns in this Chamber about the concentration of homeless hostels in my constituency and the lack of investment in public spaces and green areas.  With a high concentration of homeless hostels, lack of investment in public spaces and cuts to addiction services, it is time to stop using urban areas as a dumping ground for the city's problems and start calling on the Government to begin investing in essential services.  </p> <p>I welcome today's announcement of on-the-spot road checks for the use of narcotics by drivers.  That will go some way towards alleviating road deaths.</p></speech>

In <i>The Irish Times</i>today, and in other media, we see copies of correspondence and reports on the Government's plans for appointments to the Judiciary.  Some points need to be made about this important matter.  Senators will be aware that this House passed a motion and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality gave an undertaking on the establishment of a judicial council, but that seems to have been lost in all of this debate.  We do not know what the T&aacute;naiste plans to do in that regard.</p><p>I am conscious of the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary, which is important for us all to bear in mind.  The Judiciary has served this country with absolute distinction.  Articles 34 to 37, inclusive, of our Constitution, which we all value, clearly regulate how the process of courts and judicial appointments is operated.  The President appoints judges on the advice of the Government.  In practice, the decision to appoint judges is ultimately one made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Although there is cause for concern, I accept it is not the Minister's intention to cause offence or disrespect to the Judiciary.  However, that is what is being picked up and it is the message that is coming across strongly in all reports on these matters.  To suggest that the Chief Justice could not be the chair of an appointments commission for the Judiciary is stepping over the line.  It is an absolute attack on our Constitution which we have a role to defend.  The matter needs to be examined. </p><p>I ask that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality attend this House to explain the rationale and where her proposals currently stand.  More importantly, she should discuss the proposal for a judicial council.  The Chief Justice has repeatedly made a strong and cogent case to have such a council established.  We need to have further discussion on that matter. </p><p>As regards the two other issues, it is my understanding, and I would like the Leader to clarify this, that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is to attend this House on 8 February and make statements on a number of matters related to local government and councils.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader to clarify if that is the case, as I have had it confirmed by another source.</p><p>Will the Leader indicate when the next Stage of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill will be taken?

An ceann is minice agus is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; a bhfuilimid ag caint faoi ar na mallaibh n&aacute; ceist an Breatimeacht n&oacute; an Sasimeacht, that is, Brexit.  I am sure the Leader and all other Senators have been closely following the recent decision of the Supreme Court in London on Brexit.  As Senators will be aware, the North voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the European Union and for Ireland, in its entirety, to remain in the EU.  There has been much discussion about the form that Brexit may or may not take and it is deeply worrying that there is still no indication of what form it will take.  We are almost being held to ransom.</p> <p>In recent months, Senators have taken a highly responsible approach to the issue of Brexit.  While some of us have differences on the nuances and dynamics involved, we have shown a willingness to work together and stand up for the best interests of the people of Ireland.  As part of that dynamic, we have discussed the economy, agriculture, the peace process, tourism and all other aspects of life on which Brexit will have an impact.  I say this respectfully because I want to maintain a spirit of co-operatoin on this issue.  However, the Government needs to up its game and be proactive, rather than simply awaiting the next indication that will come from Theresa May's Government.  We have moved from a scenario in which we were told Brexit meant Brexit to one in which we are being told no one really knows whether it will be a hard or soft Brexit.  The only thing we know is that Brexit will be bad for Ireland.</p> <p>One major dynamic the Oireachtas must discuss and tease out is the core component of the Good Friday Agreement which allows for the reunification of our country.  All of the parties in both Houses profess to aspire to unity.  Within this climate, while we work to deal with the short to medium-term problems presented to us by Brexit, we also need to credibly and seriously begin a discussion on reunification.  This should not be contentious, certainly not in this Chamber, nor should we shy away from it.  Reunification should be a core component of any future programme for Government and a responsibility of any Government.  In the current climate which has, ironically, been forced upon us, we have an unprecedented opportunity to engage in this national discourse and dialogue.</p> <p>The issue of Irish reunification was raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday and I hope the Government clearly heard the case that was made.  Ironically, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will come to the House to make statements on the North this afternoon.  I hope he will refer to the issue and that he is proactively considering it.  It is certainly being considered and discussed by other European states which see the benefit and necessity of reunification given our clearly expressed political mandate to stay in the European Union, which is being actively undermined.</p> <p>The Leader will be aware that two years ago both Houses agreed a motion to recognise the state of Palestine.  This recognition remains outstanding and the Government's latest utterances on the issue indicate it is not in any hurry to proceed.  In the current international political climate there is an onus on Ireland to stand up not only for the people of Palestine but for those who are marginalised, attacked, brutalised and facing atrocious aggression daily, wherever they may be.  I am sure, given the current climate, that it appears to them that things could get much worse.</p></speech>

It outlined how public banking would fit in with Ireland's existing financial services, the regions it would help revitalise and how it could support credit unions, post offices and the communities they serve.  There was considerable expertise evident at the seminar and this expertise has been made available to the State to implement the Sparkasse or public savings banks concept.  We have seen economic recovery, particularly on the east coast, but we have not seen it in areas such as the south east.  One of the reasons for this is that organisations that previously provided funding to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, for example, building societies and banks when they were located on main streets, have ceased trading or have moved online.  There is no one for people to meet and SMEs are being deprived of funding.  As a result, rural areas are not recovering in they way they should.</p> <p>The Sparkasse banks are based on a non-for-profit concept where lending is restricted to businesses in the regional economy.  These banks would fill the gap left by the demise of building societies and provide a public banking system and suitable vehicle for credit unions to invest the &euro;9 billion they have identified for lending to small and medium enterprises.  They would provide credit unions with much-needed administrative support in meeting the increasingly burdensome Central Bank regulations they face.  A presentation on this concept of public banking will be made in the audio-visual room next Wednesday.  It is in all our interests to attend as it will be highly beneficial and I hope the Government will support it.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is due before the House to discuss the revival plan for rural Ireland.  The Sparkasse concept is referred to in action 259 of the plan.  I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister addresses the possibility of establishing a working group to implement this concept. </p> <p>I welcome the announcement on Monday by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, of funding of &euro;324 million for regional and local roads.  Despite the efforts of some Senators, particularly on the Fianna F&aacute;il side, the issue of local improvement schemes was brought to the attention of the Minister last year when a request was made to ring-fence funding to upgrade and make non-public roads safe for use.  There are thousands of such roads in rural areas, for which no money is provided.  Local government and local engineers have been told to take money from the allocation for public roads.  It is not justified to take money from a small fund for public roads and reinvest it in culs-de-sac and private roads.  A ring-fenced fund must be provided for this purpose.</p> <p>I have been contacted by a number of county councils on this matter, most recently in a letter from my local council in County Tipperary, requesting that the Minister specifically allocate funding for this purpose.  He has seen fit to invest money in ensuring adequate supplies of salt are available to tackle Japanese knotweed, which is welcome, but he has not provided funding for local improvement schemes.  I ask that he come to the House to discuss the provision of funding for these schemes from the vast amount of money available to him annually.</p></speech>

I attended the launch of the document this morning with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, and it was a very positive event.  During the recession, the number of apprenticeships declined by more than 80%.  Third level education is not suitable for everyone.  The State agencies, in co-operation with institutes of education and employers, must make this programme a success.  In 2016, the number of new apprenticeships was relatively low, at only 3,500.  The figure prior to the recession was 80% higher.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At present there are 27 apprenticeships throughout the country whereas in Germany there are more than 300 apprenticeships and traineeships on offer.

This is to be welcomed.  It is something which affects every county.  SOLAS and the ETBs run training centres throughout the country.  This is a very positive step because it is about getting people back into employment.</p></speech>

Today, I make a special appeal to anyone out there who may have information on this brutal killing, as a result of which his wife Caroline has been left without a husband and their two young children have been left without a father.  I appeal to anybody with even the smallest piece of information which he or she might feel is insignificant to come forward and contact Dundalk Garda station or the Garda confidential telephone number 1800 666111.  It should also be noted the Irish League of Credit Unions has offered a reward of &euro;50,000 to anyone who might bring forward information that would lead to a prosecution in the case.  Somebody out there knows something.  It is never too late to do the right thing and I earnestly appeal to people to come forward.  If they are not comfortable contacting the Garda they should contact someone in authority who might bring forward the information.</p></speech>

He passed away last night.  He was the holder of a distinguished service medal from the Defence Forces, which he won in the Congo in the 1960s.  He was one of 155 men who were part of the siege of Jadotville, and it has taken us the best part of 50 years to recognise these men.  However, we have not recognised them in the way they should have been recognised.  Slowly but surely these men are passing away and they are being consigned to history.  One of the greatest military achievements of our Defence Forces took place at Jadotville.  How 155 men could hold off 3,500 for a period of time under the command of Commandant Quinlan is studied by soldiers in armies throughout the world.</p> <p>I have spoken to people from Jadotville.  One of the saddest things for me was last Thursday night, when I attended a lecture in Galway and sitting over my left shoulder was a colleague with whom I served at Renmore barracks in Galway and I never knew he was in Jadotville.  I spoke to Leo Quinlan last night, and he did his Ranger training with a former veteran from Jadotville who he never knew was there.  Such was the level of hurt and embarrassment they had because world's political people decided Jadotville was something they did not want to talk about.  They wanted to bury it.  They wanted to forget about it because it was a total screw-up by politicians in the United Nations.</p> <p>The Minister has gone a long way, as has the Government and the previous one, towards undoing some of the wrongs done but we have not gone far enough.  Commandant Quinlan, the commander in Jadotville, named nine people who were to be awarded medals.  None of the nine were ever awarded their medals.  A photocopy of the citation awarded, which was a unit citation, was given to those living and the relatives of the deceased.  This is simply not good enough.  There is unfinished work with respect to Jadotville.  Senator Mac Lochlainn and I have tabled a motion that will be brought to the floor of the House and I hope we, as the Upper House of the Oireachtas, will come together and support it.  I ask that we do so.  We cannot allow more Jadotville veterans to pass away forgotten and consigned to a blank history.</p></speech>

This is an issue I have raised on many occasions.  In light of these warnings we need to introduce meaningful change.  I welcome the fact the Government has indicated a willingness to introduce a sugar tax.  I did research on our VAT system recently and was very taken aback to find out a bottle of water is taxed at the standard rate of VAT at 23% and chocolate milk, which I presume is classed as a milk product, which contains 18.8g of sugar per serving, is taxed at a zero rate of VAT.  Food products such as Nutella spread, which is 50% sugar, is also taxed at a zero rate of VAT.  A sugar tax needs to be fast-tracked but we have difficulties with regard to the UK and when and how we implement it.  When we have such anomalies in our VAT system we should get them right first.  To introduce a sugar tax before we get our VAT system right, when it comes to these glaring anomalies at the very least, seems to be absurd.  Naturally healthy products such as bottled water should not be subject to the standard rate of VAT when products such as Nutella or chocolate milk have a zero rate of VAT.  I call on the Minister to re-evaluate and reform the VAT rates.  It is overdue that we have a review of the way in which we implement and put VAT on certain products.</p></speech>

Recently, RTE "Prime Time" broadcast an excellent report into what has emerged with regard to oyster farms.  We have 30,000 trestles along the shores of Lough Foyle which have no licence and do not require one.  It is a Klondike with no regulation.  I appeal to the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage with the British Government as soon as possible to resolve the ownership of Lough Foyle, which is allowing this farce to continue.  The statement from James Brokenshire, that the whole of Lough Foyle is within the United Kingdom, has not been retracted.  I ask for focus on this issue and I ask the Leader to contact the Minister Foreign Affairs and Trade to make him aware and ask him to respond to the issues raised in the excellent report on RTE "Prime Time".</p> <p>A related issue is the concern of the fish producers and processors which was articulated this week at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Their presentation was stark with regard to the impact of Brexit and the taking into control of what were British waters and which have been shared EU waters for all these years.  The impact this will have on our fishing sector is the most worrying I have seen from any sector in society so far.  I ask the Leader to bring this presentation to the attention of not only the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine but also the Taoiseach.  It will have very serious implications.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The British are claiming control of Lough Foyle so it is related.</p><p>I support the points made about local improvement schemes.

Some 68% of this homelessness is in Dublin.  As the Simon Community report published today reveals, 83% of property in the capital is now priced out of the reach of those on housing benefits such as rent supplement or the housing assistance payment.  Home repossessions are continuing apace forcing more families from their homes and increasing the number of people in desperate need.  Last week, my Green Party colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, spoke in the D&aacute;il regarding a practical measure the Government can take to stem this flow of human tragedy.  She asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify the situation around the recent High Court judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Max Barrett in AIB <i>v.</i>Counihan on 21 December 2016 which seemed to suggest that current home repossessions in Ireland could leave the Irish State in breach of European laws and lead to it being found liable.  These serious concerns were also expressed recently by the Master of the High Court.  Can we be assured that all people responsible in this area are fully informed of the latest legal developments and are properly trained in respect of their legal obligations under EU law?  In my county of Waterford, we saw the county registrar refusing to proceed with several home repossession cases in light of this uncertainty.  This Court of Justice of the European Union has held that where a consumer contract comes before a court, the court must be satisfied that none of its terms is unfair even when the consumer has not called on it to do so.  As a mortgage contract is a consumer contract where the property is a home, it is vital that county registrars, who in reality deal with the majority of repossession applications, are fully aware of the implications of these decisions.  The Master of the High Court is of the opinion, however, that county registrars should not be dealing with these repossessions cases at all.  There is a real and justifiable concern that many repossession orders granted in the Circuit Court may be open to challenge as the EU law has not been applied.  In such a scenario and leaving aside the lenders, it is the State that could conceivably be found liable.  There is a potential financial risk for the State.  Considering the inequality of arms between the thousands of ordinary, hard-working and decent borrowers on one side and lenders on the other with bottomless funds, will the Minister assure families that the full range of protections available to persons are being implemented?  If the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, is indeed correct about what is reportedly and unlawfully happening, the Government needs to take steps to place a moratorium on all such proceedings until it is satisfied that EU law is being applied consistently throughout the State.  Before Christmas, we heard that the Government is to publish new legislation relating to home repossessions.  Can the Leader assure me that these legal issues will be addressed in any such legislation and that this new measure will be sure to put people first in such resolutions?  Could the Leader tell us when this legislation might be brought before the Seanad?</p></speech>

It is good news in terms of the number of new developments in that region.  However, we now need to set out a clear strategy nationally in respect of development and areas we need to prioritise regarding the provision of services.  I raised this issue yesterday in respect of the need for long-term planning in our health service.  I know there is an Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare from which Senators are excluded but I have very strong views about forward planning.  The Minister for Health was here yesterday.  The last major public hospital built in this country was built in 1998.  The population of the Cork region, about which I spoke yesterday, has gone from 410,000 to 542,000.  No new hospital has been provided during that period of population increase.  The population will continue to increase at a very fast rate over the new few years.  In setting out the strategy for the development of this country over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, we need to prioritise the provision of health care services.  We have 2.8 beds per thousand in this country.  The figure in Germany is 8.3 beds per thousand while in the OECD, it is 4.3 or 4.5 beds per thousand.  Even if we were to get the figure up to three beds per thousand, we would have to create an extra 1,500 beds overnight.  It needs to be given priority because it is something we can no longer avoid talking about.  We need to set out a clear plan and timescale for when this is to be implemented.  This is a key strategy we need to develop instead of putting it on the back burner as was the case over the past 20 years.</p></speech>

I was interested in what Senator Mac Lochlainn said about the difficulty relating to Lough Foyle.  There is a form of apartheid regarding fisheries in Ireland.  I met the Minister of State and the chief executive and chairman of Inland Fisheries Ireland yesterday.  Fisheries in Ireland are regarded as free.  Tourists can come here and fish but that does not apply to the midlands where someone can get a 21-day permit for &euro;25 or a family one-day permit for one adult and three children and where there is an adult charge of &euro;45 per year, a charge of &euro;25 for senior citizens and a one-day charge of &euro;10 for juveniles.  This applies to the Rivers Suck, Inny, Brosna, Little Brosna and Camlin and tributaries.  It affects parts of Galway, all Roscommon and parts of Westmeath and Offaly.  In respect of the River Suck, beside which I live, the tributaries of Lough O'Flynn, Hollygrove Lake in Athleague, Stonehams Lake in Castlecoote, Lough Lung and Blacks Lough in Castlecoote are all affected by this charge but nowhere else in Ireland is this charge applied.  We are being discriminated against in respect of attracting tourists.  I compliment the work of Inland Fisheries in respect of investing the money that has been raised in that area to bring about better services and stocking of rivers.  That is fine but we are a small country.  Why should one area be discriminated against when it comes to a charge?  If it applies to one area, it should apply to all areas or it should not apply at all.  That is my case and I cannot understand why others have not raised this issue.  People who own guest houses, pubs and other facilities and who pay rates are being affected yet the people they want to attract from Italy and Great Britain in particular must pay this fee.  People are being told by the magazines that fishing in Ireland is free and that all its rivers run free but that is not the case.  I will use this House to bring about a change.  The Minister of State agreed yesterday that he would look into the matter but I want to highlight it in a broader forum here because in fairness to this House, and the fact that it has been retained, it has a wider distribution of information than the press conference in Buswells Hotel yesterday.</p></speech>

It is a flagrant attack on the Constitution which gives the power to select judges to the Government which is elected by the people and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I was engaged in the process of selecting members of the Judiciary for eight years and did so, if I may say so, with party political impartiality.  Selecting members of the Judiciary is a political function and a duty of the Government.  What is more, it is a function that cannot be abdicated from.  There is nothing more political, with a small "p", than identifying what woman or man should be part of the Supreme Court.  It is not a function of a group of laymen or others but a political and a democratically accountable function which must be performed by the body that the Constitution, to which we all owe a duty of loyalty under Article 9, identifies - the Government.  This is a misconceived hijacking of the Government by the Minister.</p> <p>I strongly support what has been said by Senator Victor Boyhan and intend to raise the matter in the Commencement debate next week.</p> <p>We are sitting in one House of a democratic assembly, one of many across the western world.  We also read in our newspapers and hear in the broadcast media today that the United States of America has decided to reintroduce torture of people it arrests around the world.  I have studied what went on in Guantanamo Bay, the humiliation, the stripping naked and shackling of people to the floor and daubing them in what was alleged to be menstrual fluids.  People had a towel put around their head which was then slammed against a wall repeatedly to see if they had any information.  We all know what happened in Abu Ghraib and about the horror of waterboarding.  I believe I speak for every Member of this and the Lower House when I say we should protest, in the strongest possible way, about the fact that a country that claims to be a friend and ally of this state is breaching human rights in this repugnant and disgusting way.  I register that protest.</p></speech>

Craughwell's comments on the men of Jadotville who were absolutely forgotten about.  I was one of the first Deputies to correspond with the Minister on the way history and the State had mistreated them.  I was delighted when they were eventually commemorated at a ceremony in Custume Barracks in Athlone which I attended alongside many of their families.  That said, I agree with Senators Mac P&aacute;draig Lochlainn and Gerard P. Craughwell that more could be done.  As a House, we must lead the way in that regard.</p> <p>The news that the grave of the former President and Taoiseach Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera was vandalised is very disturbing and I would like to think it would be utterly condemned by the Seanad.

The activities of crime gangs are feared throughout the city by families and communities who are wondering when the next murder or attempted murder will take place.  In the past seven days illegal drugs worth almost &euro;40 million have been prevented from flooding communities around Ireland and bringing misery to families and young people.  Such drugs are wrecking lives and preventing children from growing into healthy adults engaged in worthwhile activities and careers.  An arsenal of high calibre weapons was seized, preventing further deaths, while almost &euro;500,000 was confiscated.  I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and urge it to maintain this level of activity.  On behalf of communities, I thank it for making the country safer.</p> <p>I again raise the issue of councillors' pay having raised it in the House a number of days ago.  There is no logical reason the pay increase of &euro;1,000 should not apply to councillors in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is due to come to the House on 8 February, but I am not sure if we can wait until then to have the issue addressed.  We need to have a serious discussion with him about it.  The local authorities in Dublin, Cork and Galway are dealing with and overwhelmed by the problem of homelessness.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan has referred to the fact that over 7,000 people were recorded as being homeless last month.  In that context, the Minister's decision is unfair and lacks rationale.  Will the Leader to bring the matter to the Minister's attention and ask him to devote some time to the issue during our discussions on 8 February, if we have to wait until then to meet him?</p></speech>

It follows the damage inflicted on the grave of Mr. W. T. Cosgrave in Inchicore last year.  This year marks the 100th anniversary of a pivotal event in Irish history when Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera, in particular, had his finest hour - his first major electoral success in a by-election in County Clare.  He was subsequently elected leader of the Irish Volunteers and Sinn F&eacute;in.  That the graves of two fine men were desecrated is appalling.  I ask the Government to focus on their importance and the wonderful confluence of national interests 100 years ago, long before there were divisions or splits.  It was a wonderful time, with the emergence of a national consensus led by wonderful people.</p> <p>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to address the entitlement to public housing of persons in receipt of rent allowance?  I refer, in particular, to the rental accommodation scheme, under which persons in receipt of long-term support may qualify for private rental accommodation for which the local authority will pay for a period of time.  The local authority will enter into a contract with the landlord on behalf of the tenant.  It is a great scheme which has been operating very successfully all over the country.  However, there are differences in interpretation of the scheme across counties.  In some counties the interpretation is that once a person is housed under the rental accommodation scheme, he or she will automatically come off the local authority's housing waiting list.  This is a serious anomaly.  Most people would like to have the security of having their own home.  For example, I know of a single mother with three children who has been living in rented accommodation for a long time.  She needs a bigger house and wants to move back onto the housing waiting list.  She would then be prioritised, but in some counties this is not allowed to happen.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to examine the issue?</p></speech>

It was wholly unacceptable; there are no other words for it.</p> <p>Senator McDowell spoke about torture and I agree with what he said.  We are ever mindful that thousands of young men in the North were interned, and many of them were tortured, and it is well-documented now in terms of the hooded men.  They went through horrific torture.  It was a political decision to do that, and the Irish Government and this 26 county State were complicit in their silence on that.  I wanted to highlight that.</p> <p>I was surprised yesterday to hear my colleague, Senator Swanick, champion the proposition of an annual national holiday on 21 January to celebrate our Independence because his own party, Fianna F&aacute;il, has been inconsistent in its voting record regarding the issue of a public holiday to celebrate the struggle for Independence and all those who took part in it.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced the Public Holiday (L&aacute; na Poblachta) Bill in October 2015 and before the last general election, Fianna F&aacute;il voted in favour of it.  However, when the Bill was reintroduced in June 2016 and again in November last, in light of the new arithmetic in the D&aacute;il and despite the rise in the national sentiment as a result of the various events organised for the centenary year in which the public played a huge role, all Senator Swanick's colleagues voted against the very same Bill.  I cannot understand why a Bill which was acceptable in October 2015 was deemed unacceptable and voted against the following June.  I use this as an opportunity to urge Fianna F&aacute;il to have the courage to agree with Sinn F&eacute;in when it matters.  We are, of course, flattered by the continuing imitation of many of our policies but the public would gain far more if Fianna F&aacute;il stayed away from the blue abstain button and gave voters the respect they deserve and took a stand on really important issues like this.  Indeed, we saw the same behaviour-----</p></speech>

When it comes up with good ideas, we do our best to facilitate them.  In regard to Senator Swanick's Bill, an annual celebration of the anniversary of when we declared ourselves an independent Republic is an excellent proposal.  We are not seeking to have that day classified as a bank holiday because that would place an extra burden on employers, who have to foot the bill for bank holidays.  We are saying that it is an opportunity for schools and other institutions to celebrate an important part of our history.

For a senior Minister in government to call into question whether the Chief Justice of this State is capable of chairing such a judicial body is an absolute disgrace, and the fact  the Government is allowing that Minister to continue to peddle this is another disgrace.  The sooner the Minister is brought to book the better.  Governments govern.  They are not dictated to by the Independents, or should not be dictated to by them, and certainly when an important arm of our democracy is questioned, the person questioning it should be put in order fairly quickly.  In terms of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, wanting to come to this House to debate an area which in my opinion has nothing to do with him, he is not the Minister for Justice and Equality; Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is.  Granted, he is a member of the Government, and there is collective responsibility, but I would prefer if he dealt with the portfolio that he has direct responsibility for, a portfolio he has made a hames of.  He is treating ordinary public sector workers with disdain.  He can come here and discuss that, and let us put questions to him on the area he has responsibility for.</p></speech>

It is not the end of the world but on Thursdays, because of an arrangement in the Lower House and the unavailability of Ministers, it is unsatisfactory that we are put on hold for an hour and a half in the middle of the day.</p></speech>

It is wrong.  I am not going to resolve it but perhaps we should focus our minds on it because if we did something to discommode the other House, we would hear about it very quickly.  That is just a personal view.  Perhaps, Leader, you can reflect on it or talk to the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

Perhaps the group leaders of all Members of the House, particularly opposition Members, might speak to their party Whips with a view to pairing Ministers for that period of time for voting on a Thursday or even allowing Ministers to be deemed present in terms of casting their votes because it is discommoding Members of this House.  It is also disrupting the business of this House, a Chathaoirligh, and you are correct when you say that if we tried to change how we do our business and it imposed on the other House, we would not be long hearing about it and we would be told we could not do it.  There is merit in your suggestion.  </p> <p>Perhaps it is a matter the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, can take up on our behalf, but it is something we should definitely reflect on.  We speak of new politics but at one level new politics has ground legislation to a halt, whether because of pre-legislative scrutiny, which we welcome, or other matters.  Members of this House are united regarding the approach to be taken to that.</p> <p>I thank the 18 Members who spoke on a variety of issues.  Senator Ardagh raised the issue of housing and of the Simon Community report published today.  I am sure the Senator will join me in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Coveney's decision today to extend the rent pressure zones across the country.  Supply is the issue we have to tackle.  That is why Rebuilding Ireland provides for solutions to address the unacceptable number of people who are homelessness and in emergency accommodation.  We need to see supply start.  I am disappointed that the Senator spoke of not being able to see sods turn.  I would be very happy to bring her to the Deanrock estate in my own constituency, where just this week we have seen bulldozers going in and work beginning on the construction of new units of social housing.  It is important that we see units being built, vacant units being sourced by the Housing Agency and being put back to use and the continuation of the expansion of the housing assistance payment, HAP, for homeless tenants, which happened this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I hope the Rebuilding Ireland targets will be met.  The Minister is committed to coming back to the House as the Senator knows.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter because it is important that we keep it at the top of the political agenda.</p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the funding of drug and alcohol agencies and the task force.  This year's budget includes an additional allocation of &euro;3 million to support drug and social inclusion measures in 2017.  The extra funding given to the HSE and local drugs task forces will, I hope, continue to provide interventions aimed at improving the health outcomes of the most vulnerable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is from Senator Ardagh's constituency and she is progressive, proactive and, I am sure, will be happy to work with the Senator to address the issues she has in terms of her constituency.  There has been an increase in the budget and I am sure we will all work to ensure that increases continue in regard to the issues Senator Ardagh has raised.</p><p>Senators Boyhan, McDowell and Wilson referred to judicial appointments.  The Government is committed to reform in this area.  It is important to recognise that we have been served well by the men and women we have appointed to a variety of judicial posts.  Anybody who wants to investigate or analyse the role and work of our Judiciary will find it is exemplary.  There may have been a minority who acted to the contrary over time, but one will always have that.  It is important to set out that context.  I hope that as part of the discussion around the judicial appointments Bill, common sense will prevail and that there will be a listening to what Members of this House say and to what was said in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality yesterday.  I have great faith in the current Chief Justice as I had in her predecessors and it is important that we allow for that independence of the Judiciary from the Executive to continue.  We are governed by the Constitution.  I hope we do not personalise this into an attack on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who has a very hard view of what should happen.  I cannot answer for him.</p></speech>

The Bill is complex and it requires detailed analysis, probing and consideration.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House but it is important to recognise the significance of the work our Judiciary has undertaken and that it has been independent and served the State well.</p> <p>Senators Boyhan and Devine referred to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government who I confirm will be in the House on 8 February, which is in just two weeks.  As Senator Devine knows, the changes the Minister announced on councillors' pay and conditions will be the subject of a regulation introduced on 1 July.  We must record that for the first time in 15 years, we have a Minister who is willing to make a change.  Whether we agree or whether he has gone too far or not far enough are matters of opinion.  The Minister has been the only Minister in the Department, despite views expressed in correspondence and commentary by certain Members of the House, who has done anything.  I will stand to be tested on that because I know it is the correct answer.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

I note to Senator Boyhan that the next Stage of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill is next Tuesday.  It will be Committee and Report Stages, depending on Friday, which is the closing date for amendments.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of Brexit in the context of the reunification of our country.  Those of us who are republican and wish to see a united Ireland recognise that we have come on a huge journey.  However, I must make the point to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill that the language we use and the way we seek to achieve our aims are important.  Sometimes I wonder about the means some people choose.  It is important in the context of the question the Senator raised that we overcome the issue of Brexit first and embrace whatever happens in that process in addition to the situation with the elections in the North.  We can then answer the question he discusses because it is important to allow for the work of the Good Friday Agreement to be continued and implemented.  I am also happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss Palestine.</p> <p>Senator Landy raised the issue of public banking and I note that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, will be in the House on 9 February when she will be able to discuss that matter too.  I would also be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, attend to discuss the issue Senator Mac Lochlainn raised about regional and local roads.  We all welcome the increased funding in that regard.  The point the Senator made about local improvement schemes was a worthwhile one and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss it.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the action plan for apprenticeships and training and I would be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss it.  As a former director of adult education, I note the importance of further education and skills training which fell from view, unfortunately, in the recession.  I hope we can have that important discussion.  We commend the initiative of Government today on the provision of 50,000 apprenticeships and training places.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell and Feighan referred to the siege of Jadotville.  I pay tribute to the late Walter Hegarty and extend my sympathy to his family on his death.  We have had this as part of a discussion here before.  I am happy as Leader of the House to work with all sides to bring a motion forward that is acceptable to all of us.  It is fair to say that the motion which has been circulated and to which Senator Mac Lochlainn is also a party does not, as currently drafted, reflect some of the things the Government has done.  If we can agree a formula of words, we can bring forward an agreed motion.  It is important to contextualise this.  These are men who served their country and to whom a wrong was done and it is about rectifying that.  The Government has tried to do that over time and as such I hope we can agree a motion we can all sign.</p> <p>Senator Noone raised the important issue of obesity.  The Government's Healthy Ireland umbrella project is a means to tackling that and I would be happy to have the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, come to the House to discuss it.</p> <p>Senators Mac Lochlainn and Leyden raised the issue of inland fisheries and Lough Foyle.  Only yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, said discussions were under way but there has been no resolution yet.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is on record as saying Lough Foyle is part of our territorial waters and that situation has not changed since our last discussion.  I will be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, come to the House to discuss the issues raised by Senator Leyden.  The CEO of Inland Fisheries Ireland, Dr. Ciaran Byrne, spoke at the publication of the report yesterday about the importance of angling in the context of tourism.  Angling is a very important tourist attraction in this country and I will be happy to have the Deputy Kyne come to the House to discuss it.  Equally, work is being done on a new sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction Bill albeit I am not sure how we can marry both issues here.  Let us hope we can.</p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to courts and repossessions and I would be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, come to the House to discuss the matter.  It is important to recognise the independence of the courts in regard to their decisions.  The Minister and the Government generally are very conscious of the fact that they must work to ensure that people stay in their family homes.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke referred to planning for the future and I join him in welcoming and congratulating those involved in the &euro;20 million development in Cork.  This huge development for the city along Camden Place up to MacCurtain Street is one the Cathaoirleach will know quite well.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is working on the document on planning for the future of our cities and I hope that in tandem the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, will do the same in terms of the provision of health services.  The issue Senator Colm Burke raised in relation to the need for 5,000 new hospital beds is one that must be seen to be delivered on in the city of Cork through the provision of a new hospital.</p> <p>Senator Michael McDowell raised the issue of the Judiciary.

As Leader of the House, I join in the condemnation of those who carried out this act.  &Eacute;amon de Valera was a statesman; he was Taoiseach and President of this country.  He played a pivotal role in its history and development.  Regardless of one's political viewpoint, his grave is his resting place.  It is a place where people go to pray and worship and his family to remember him.  Those of us who visit the graves of loved ones join in the calls for them to be left as sacred places.</p> <p>I join Senator M&aacute;ire Devine in congratulating An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its success in recent days and weeks against gang members in Dublin city.  It can only work with information that is in addendum to that gained in its own investigative work.  As public representatives, I hope we will all ask people and impress on them the need to co-operate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provide information.  Those involved in criminal gangs in the capital city are from and living in the communities in which they are known.  It is important that the Garda be given information, whether in community policing fora or privately and confidentially.  It is important that we work with it to out the people concerned and bring them to justice.</p> <p>If Senator Ned O'Sullivan has a specific issue about the rent allowance scheme, I will be happy to speak to him later about it.  I will also be happy to have the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, come to the House to discuss the scheme.</p> <p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh referred to Senator Keith Swanick's Bill.  I think what he is trying to achieve is a celebration and a commemoration of the First D&aacute;il on the date it first met.  We should all aspire to achieving that objective.  It is, however, a little populist and political to make an accusation in the context of votes for the diaspora.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, gave a commitment during the discussion on the Bill that he would come back to the House with another to recognise the diaspora and those living in the North.  It was a political shot because what Senator Keith Swanick is trying to do-----</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the very challenging issues facing the European Union in terms of migration, terrorism and, of course from our own perspective, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, it is important that the accession agenda continues the process of enlargement.

As I said on Second Stage some weeks ago, while the Bill's concern with the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict represents something of a narrow focus, its enactment will be a further important demonstration of Ireland's support for international humanitarian law and the vital role it plays in limiting the effects of armed conflict on civilians and civilian property.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those effects are most clearly seen at the moment and for several years now in the appalling conflict in Syria.  The indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks carried out against defenceless civilians and critical civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and power plants have been, above all, attacks on human life and dignity.  In the circumstances, they are wholly and utterly unacceptable and I know Senators join the Government in condemning these acts.  Likewise, attacks on cultural property and the destruction and theft of cultural property in war are unacceptable.  Buildings, monuments, artifacts of cultural importance are essential to the history, heritage and identity of all people, and to deliberately destroy them is an attempt to diminish the people for whom they are important. </p><p>In passing this Bill and becoming a party a the Hague Convention and its protocol, we will further demonstrate the importance attached by the people of Ireland to the protection of human life and dignity in war.

As they will appreciate, this is a critical time for Northern Ireland, which is again in election mode less than a year after the previous election.  In the weeks before the election was called I was in close contact with the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, and the leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland.  I travelled to Belfast on a number of occasions to meet in person with the Secretary of State and the then First Minister and deputy First Minister.  Both Governments pursued all appropriate avenues to encourage the Executive parties to find a way beyond their difficulties.  However, an agreement could not be found and the Secretary of State, as required under statute when the joint office of First and deputy First Minister cannot be filled, called an election, which is scheduled to take place on 2 March next.</p> <p>The circumstances that contributed to the breakdown in trust between the two parties in the Executive gave rise to a good deal of public acrimony and risk a divisive election campaign.  As the campaign gets under way, I have urged the parties to remain measured and respectful in their electoral rhetoric so that the political institutions are not damaged in the longer term.  The people of Northern Ireland expect nothing less than an effective Assembly and Executive at Stormont underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership.  In my discussions with party leaders, I have strongly emphasised the imperative of the swift resumption of the power-sharing institutions after the election period.  In support of this, I will remain closely engaged with the political parties and the British Government in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>In the time leading up to the dissolution of the Assembly, the question of compliance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement was a key focus of debate and discourse.  The interlocking political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are at the heart of the Agreement and are the delivery vehicle for many of its commitments.  Within this framework, the devolved power-sharing institutions are vital, both for effective government in Northern Ireland and the overall functioning of the Agreement.  For instance, without the devolved institutions, the North-South Ministerial Council cannot operate and North-South co-operation on a wide range of matters is somewhat compromised.  This has tangible and serious impacts on all people across this island of Ireland.  It is, therefore, of vital importance that the institutions of the Agreement return quickly to full operation after the election.  In this regard, the relevant legislation provides a narrow window of three weeks from the date of election to when a new First Minister and deputy First Minister must be nominated.</p> <p>If the institutions are the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, then the principles of the Agreement are its lifeblood and are vital to the success and sustainability of any power-sharing administration in Northern Ireland.  Those principles were articulated in the Agreement and are worth recalling today: "full respect for, and equality of civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos, and aspirations of both communities."  These principles constitute the essential template for political and civic relations on this island and between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  There has been discussion about deficits and shortcomings in upholding these principles and the need for parties that comprise the Executive to fully live up to the commitments made in the Good Friday and successor agreements.  I fully understand the rightful insistence on the principles of equality and parity of esteem being respected at all time.  I also understand the frustration in the Nationalist community when these principles are disrespected.  It is a great pity that the spirit of friendship that Martin McGuinness sought to espouse as deputy First Minister was not at all times reciprocated in equal measure.  While acknowledging the deficits, we also need to find solutions.  I hope, therefore, that in the weeks ahead specific proposals to address the deficits in this respect agenda will be brought forward for consideration and discussion.</p> <p>As typically occurs at moments of challenge in Northern Ireland, there have in recent days been calls on the two Governments to discharge their obligations under the peace process.  I assure the House that neither I nor the Government needs any encouragement to fulfil our responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  That serious and solemn responsibility is hard-wired into the performance of my duties as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Taoiseach and I have been steadfast in acting to pursue the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I may touch on this in more detail in my closing remarks.</p> <p>Looking beyond the Assembly election, Northern Ireland will still have to manage the challenges of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union.  The Government will be fully supportive in this regard.  In the upcoming negotiations, protecting the gains of the peace process and upholding the Good Friday Agreement is one of the four major priorities on the part of the Government.  We are continuing our comprehensive preparations for these negotiations, including through the all-island civic dialogue.  The Taoiseach and I will co-host a second plenary meeting of the dialogue on 17 February and a series of sectoral consultations are under way.  On 13 February, I will convene a sectoral consultation on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement to look at how these are fully upheld and sustained following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  All-island consultation through the dialogue and engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive through the North-South Ministerial Council are essential in addressing the challenges of withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  In this regard, the Northern Ireland Executive is primarily responsible for politically representing the interests of Northern Ireland and it is very important that this direct representation can quickly resume following the elections to the Assembly on 2 March next.</p> <p>The risks posed by Brexit are not the only considerations facing Northern Ireland but they are an example of why fully functioning and effective political institutions are needed.  Northern Ireland requires these institutions to protect what has been built and secure a peaceful and prosperous future for all its citizens.  In the coming days, the Taoiseach will welcome the British Prime Minister to Dublin.  At the top of their agenda will be the welfare of Northern Ireland and its people and the related need to protect the interests of the island of Ireland in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  None of their discussions will be easy but I can assure the House that no two issues are receiving as much priority attention in government.  Our commitment, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, is a constant one, in good times and, as now, when they are more challenging.</p> <p>I expressly acknowledge the commitment of all parties in this House to the Agreement.  That spirit of co-operation, from those of all parties and none, has been an enormous support to successive Governments over the past three decades in achieving and sustaining peace and stability on our island.  I look forward to hearing the perspective and analysis of Members.</p></speech>

I extend my best wishes to the former deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  I acknowledge Mr. McGuinness's contribution to the peace process and his commitment to the institutions when they were established.  I will not claim he and I have sung from the same hymn sheet at all times, as that was certainly not the case, but it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the major contribution he made.  I extend my best wishes to him as he fights his current illness and wish him and his family many years of good health and happiness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would also be remiss of me to fail to mention his replacement, Michelle O'Neill, a good Tyrone lady.  I wish her well in her position.</p><p>One must note that the timing of the Executive collapse could probably not have been worse.  We are facing into Brexit with all the unknowns and uncertainties that brings.  If we ever needed an Executive to be up and running and singing from the same hymn sheet, it is now.  Unfortunately, that is not the case and we are going to be in a state of limbo for quite some time until the elections are concluded.  Hopefully, an Executive will be formed sooner rather than later.  We are all aware of why the Executive failed.  Ms Foster should take note of the situation we now find ourselves in.  If she had taken the advice that was given to her in good faith by all concerned, she would have stood aside until a proper investigation had been conducted into the renewable heat scheme.  Perhaps we would not then be in the abyss we are today.</p><p>The election will come and go and we will find ourselves back in the same position again.  There will then be an onus on all parties, particularly the two major parties which have left the Assembly and which will no doubt come back in the same proportions, to redouble efforts to ensure the institutions in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement are properly worked on and are a success.  There is also an onus on the Irish and British Governments to ensure that the institutions in Northern Ireland are nourished and continue to run in a successful manner.  I find sometimes that the Dublin media in particular ignores Northern Ireland, except when there is a crisis such as the current one.  All of a sudden, there is a clatter to discuss and expose Northern Ireland at that point in time.  There is an onus on all of us to work to ensure that we nurture and protect the peace process on which a lot of people have worked very hard and even lost their lives to get to for the benefit of the entire island.</p><p>That leads us to Brexit.  There is no part of this island that will be more affected by Brexit than the North of the country.  Coming as I do from a Border county, I note the genuine fear among people of what the future will look like.  It appears the London Government has very little sympathy for the plight of the citizens of Northern Ireland and, perhaps, the citizens of Northern Ireland should take note of that.  Until such time as the Executive in Northern Ireland is up and running again, we are in a bit of an abyss.</p><p>I express the sincere hope that the election will not be too bitter and that all parties will stand back if it starts to develop into a slanging match.  That is a temptation, but hopefully it will not happen and the elections will conclude and an Executive formed as a matter of urgency.  That will allow us to get down to the real business of addressing the massive obstacle before us of Brexit.  I hope we can all work together on this island to ensure that we get the best possible deal from Brexit.</p></speech>

I was in Belfast last Sunday and Monday.  It was only on Sunday night that we saw the cowardly shooting of a PSNI officer which brought back the reality of a breakdown in trust and peace.  All parties have worked and are working extremely hard to ensure that we never go back to the awful times we saw in the last 30 years in Northern Ireland, on the island generally and, indeed, around these islands.  We had a meeting of committee "A" of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to consider a great many submissions on the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Some very stark submissions were made and, as someone said, we must muddle through.  In effect, that is what we are doing.  We are muddling through.</p> <p>It was very sad to see the breakdown among the political parties in Stormont.  Trust was breached and things were said which should not have been.  I thank the Minister for going to meet with Mr. James Brokenshire and the leaders of the political parties to try to mend the fences.  Unfortunately, that did not happen and an election has been called for 2 March.  Like other speakers, I hope we continue in the vein of heretofore and that the election is not divisive.  I hope the power-sharing institutions are not damaged.  I believe they will not be and that after the election, the function of government in Northern Ireland will continue to deliver on the commitments made in the Good Friday Agreement.  I thank the retiring deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, for the work he has done.  He has been a great inspiration having come from very difficult times.  He has been a leader and I wish him every success and thank him for the work he has done over the last ten to 20 years.  I also wish Michelle O'Neill every success in her work as leader of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Indeed, I also wish every success to the other parties including the SDLP, UUP, DUP, etc.</p> <p>Human rights must be fully upheld under the Good Friday Agreement.  With Britain exiting the EU, we have to uphold European law on human rights.  The UK Supreme Court judgment yesterday puts a lot of things in play.  From my discussions with many MPs, I am aware that many in the House of Commons were against Britain leaving the EU.  The people of the United Kingdom failed to take into consideration the impact Brexit would have on the Good Friday Agreement, on Northern Ireland generally and on Scotland, as well as on the island of Ireland.  We now have a case to say that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement may well be undermined by an agreement of the United Kingdom to leave Europe.  We must articulate our views to MPs and Members of the House of Lords that, whatever happens in the next two or three months when there is a vote on Article 50, they must now look at the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and avoid undermining all of their great aspects.  The welfare of the people of Northern Ireland and the interests of Ireland must be taken into account.</p> <p>I thank the Minister once again for the work he has done, a great deal of it behind the scenes.  We are committed members of the European Union, albeit we will be at a certain disadvantage in some ways.  However, I know the Minister will ensure that the interests, first of the Republic of Ireland, but also of the island of Ireland, are considered and maintained.  Once again, I note that the structures and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement must be maintained and enhanced.  I wish the Minister well in that regard.</p></speech>

It is a welcome move and it is something that the Minister should consider doing more of in this House, given the current climate and the acute attention that is being paid by both Houses, and indeed by broader society across Ireland.  We are all hoping for a swift, positive and resolute outcome to the current difficulties.  <br/><br/>The Minister outlined his engagement with the British Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, MP.  In his response to the debate will the Minister refer to the nature of this engagement?  Was the Secretary of State aware that the institutions were in danger of hitting the rocks?  Did the Minister articulate the concerns of the broader Nationalist, republican and other communities in the North who have reached the end of their tether when it comes to the disrespect being shown by the DUP, not just to elements and minorities within our society in the North, but also to the core components, as was eloquently outlined, of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements?<br/><br/>We need to choose our language very carefully because we have all been around these corners before and we all know the sensitivities involved in various crises when they manifest themselves.  The Minister made reference to both Governments pursuing all appropriate avenues to encourage the executive parties to find a way beyond their difficulties but that an agreement could not be found.  That almost implies that there was a broad range of problems to be addressed.  It is therefore important to set all of this within its context.<br/><br/>Regarding the alleged financial corruption around the renewable heating incentive, the RHI, details of that scandal are emerging on a daily basis with more allegations coming to light since it first found its way into the media.  A climate of Tory austerity is being driven from London, where the Executive has had a cut of &pound;4 billion from its block grant.  There is now the potential for &pound;500 million being lost to the public purse.  This money could have been better spent in our schools, our hospitals, our infrastructure, or indeed preparing for the negative aspects of Brexit, as have been outlined by other speakers.  I do not know of another Government that would allow for that to happen and not take what I consider to be the honourable and noble steps that Martin McGuinness took in order to bring that to a conclusion.  The Minister will know that Martin McGuinness, privately initially and publically subsequently, offered the DUP the opportunity for Arlene Foster to step aside so an investigation could be carried out into the RHI scandal.  That offer was not taken up, and now we are where we are.  <br/><br/>It also sits very firmly in the context of a failure to deliver an Irish language Act, with regular disrespect and disregard to the Irish speaking population and those who have a gr&aacute; for the Irish language, or indeed simply anyone who has an Irish sense of identity or sees their place within the Irish nation.  This is a regular occurrence, and can be seen through the media in continuous base bigotry, hostility and sectarianism to anyone who differs from a DUP stereotype.  <br/><br/>There is also the context in which the Minister's counterpart in the British Administration, Secretary of State James Brokenshire, MP, claims jurisdiction over the entirety of Lough Foyle.  There is a failure to implement a bill of rights, which has been blocked by the DUP.  Marriage equality has been blocked by the DUP through the misuse of the petition of concern mechanism in the institutions, which as the Minister knows was negotiated as a protection.  There is a horrible irony that a mechanism that was put in place to guarantee protection and defence for minorities is actually being regularly and flagrantly abused and misused by the DUP to hinder progress, rights, equality and respect for all of our communities.  Sometimes I think we should call a spade a spade.  If there is an identifiable problem with something, whether a political institution or something else, we need to call a spade a spade and say, &quot;That is the problem, that is what is holding us back&quot;.  I will stand in this Chamber or anywhere else and defend the record of integrity and leadership shown by Martin McGuinness over ten years.  Every one of us in political life have it easy compared to what Martin McGuinness was asked to do over the last ten years, as someone with a progressive mind and a progressive ideology in politics who wants to see this country, and indeed our community, move forward.  Let us shine a light on where this problem lies. <br/><br/>The Minister said that he is encouraging the speedy resumption of the institutions.  That is hopeful, positive and the correct approach but I would ask if the Minister would be of the same view, given everything that has been outlined, including the scandal around RHI, the alleged financial corruption, and the overt and clear corruption of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, which are indisputable and undeniable.  The Good Friday Agreement and its protections, its guarantees, its institutions and its structures have been warped and are in danger of further warping as a result of DUP manipulation and opposition to it.  We would all love to see a speedy restoration of the institutions.This election will give people the opportunity to decide what kind of institutions they want.  Do they want progressive, thoughtful focus on the institutions or do they want to return to corruption, sectarianism, the misuse of the petition of concern, and the type of politics that says, &quot;We do not trust Muslims to go to the shop for us&quot;?  Do we want to return to the type of politics where we say, &quot;Curry my yogurt&quot; and abuse the Irish language?  Or where we tell our LGBT citizens that they do not have the same rights and entitlements to marry and to express their love in the same way as everyone else?  Or do we want something different?<br/><br/>We could ask for a speedy resolution and pat ourselves on the back if we get it.  However, I think this Government should join with the rest of the Nationalist and republican constituency in the North, and also many from within the Unionist constituency who are saying that there can be no return to the <i>status quo</i>and no return to what prevailed in the past.  There must be a fundamental change.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have laid out our stall under our new leader, Michelle O'Neill, and I thank members for their wishes to both Michelle O'Neill and indeed Martin McGuinness.  The institutions failed despite the best efforts of those of us who tried to sustain them, tried to make them work, who did their best and who put in a huge amount of valiant effort, not least embodied by Martin McGuinness in recent years.  The Irish and British Governments need to step up to the mark and send a very clear message that any resumption of the institutions has to be to the word, letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  We will accept no less than that and the Irish Government should be of the same view.  As the Minister knows, the people, both North and South, decided democratically and with an overwhelming mandate that they are the structures they want to see.  Not conditional, not half baked, not half cocked, but the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, which were hard fought for and hard won, in their entirety.</p></speech>

He has a very big challenge ahead.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Martin McGuinness, who as we all know was instrumental in the peace process.  We all know that he has worked tirelessly to connect with people to whom he has been diametrically opposed politically, most notably the late Rev. Ian Paisley.  We may not see his kind in office again, and I hope he makes a full recovery.  I also want to send best wishes to his successor, Michelle O'Neill, and all of the democratic leaders in the North.</p> <p>The forthcoming elections in the North are taking place in an atmosphere of crisis.  It does not seem likely that a new power sharing executive will be formed easily unless there can be a fresh start, renewing the commitments made in 1998 and 2007.  While we await the people's verdict in the North, we all know what is occurring.  There are also the consequences of the referendum held in the UK last June.  </p> <p>It is not just about that.  We can all agree that the cash for ash scandal needs to be addressed, respecting principles of good and clean government.  The costs to the people of the North must not be forgotten, as they look at the prospects of the drying up of the EU funding of agriculture and numerous other important functions, including cross-Border and peace programmes, which are areas that I am specifically interested in as I have worked in the community in the North on many different occasions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ever since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement it has been obvious that there has been resistance by the DUP to the equality agenda.  In addition the DUP has been reluctant to engage in all-Ireland bodies or to treat nationalists as equals within the Executive.  Sadly, its reluctance to embrace equality goes further as shown by the party's strong opposition to same-sex marriage.  Given that the Irish Government is co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and has equal status with the British Government, will the Minister urge his British counterpart to put pressure on the DUP to fulfil all its current and future obligations?<br/><br/>Theresa May seems on course for a hard Brexit.  All considered opinion suggests this will have a significant effect on the island of Ireland because the Border between North and South will be the only land border between the UK and the EU.  The reimposition of a hard land border will have implications both for trade and security.  Britain's departure from the customs union suggests that there may have to be some physical barrier to the transport of goods between both jurisdictions on this island.<br/><br/>The fact that the Brexit campaign was strongly focused on the issue of immigration also suggests that freedom of movement between the EU and the UK may be at risk, thus affecting North-South travel.  Recent submissions to the parliamentary Northern Ireland affairs committee highlight the impact on people's lives that Brexit will have.  The head of the Northern Ireland arm of Dairy UK has warned of the damage ahead.  No longer being part of EU trade deals will see dairy exports to major markets such as Malaysia and Thailand face at least double tariff rates, which &quot;would kill that business&quot;.  On the possibility of a hard border with a customs barrier, and with immigration officials behind it, he stated:</p><blockquote>This is a major issue for the dairy industry.  We are very dependent on what we call an all-island value chain.  If we have any interruption in the current practices it is going to effect the longer term viability of the industry.</blockquote><p>Now that the ideal outcome of a soft Brexit for the whole of the UK seems unlikely, what plans have been put in place to establish a separate strand in the negotiations focusing on the specific concerns which arise for the island?  Will the Minister be asking our EU partners to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is fully protected?  Will that request include special status for the North to enable it to stay within the Single Market and the customs union, and to place the practical border between Ireland and Great Britain in the Irish Sea at ports and at airports?  That seems the best way to keep the borderless island we were promised by the outworkings of the Good Friday Agreement and which we have enjoyed for over a decade.  The status of the North was supposedly enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement through an act of Irish self-determination North and South.  The modification of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution was based on the understanding that a majority in both jurisdictions had to vote in favour of any change of the status of the island.  <br/><br/>Would the Minister agree that, as currently envisaged, Brexit contravenes these agreements both in word and in spirit?  Has the Minister given any consideration to the possibility of the North and Scotland remaining in the EU and also in the UK, reflecting the wishes of their respective peoples?  Professor Brendan O'Leary has argued that possibility in what would seem to be a rational democratic compromise as both areas voted to remain in the EU.  The case of Northern Ireland is different from that of Scotland because of the Good Friday Agreement and the treaty.  However, we must have regard both to the current and future interests of Scotland whether or not its parliament and people choose to stay in the UK.<br/><br/>In any case, the position advanced by Professor O'Leary and others emphasises the need for Ireland to have a well thought out and coherent strategy before the negotiations begin.  It is the view of most of those I meet in my new role North and South that defending the Good Friday Agreement and the 1999 British-Irish treaty should be the firm red line of the Irish Government both with the UK and our EU partners.  <br/><br/>The Good Friday agreement and the treaty signed by two EU member states assumed a borderless Ireland and created a North-South Ministerial Council tasked with addressing relevant EU matters.  It is vital that no physical land border should be reintroduced, in addition to having no customs posts, immigration officers, police, military portakabins or watchtowers.  This should be a red line for us and Michel Barnier should be so advised.<br/><br/>The ideal scenario would be for the North to stay fully in the EU or, failing that, to keep the North's existing European status as much as possible, for example, within the Single Market and the customs union.  This option would exclude Northern Ireland from full UK exit, but would do so precisely because of the UK's previous commitments to a borderless Ireland.  It would express the preferences of the North's voters.<br/><br/>I understand the Minister's concerns, including protecting the economic interests of our citizens and its resident businesses.  However, these interests have much less traction with Ireland's allies in the rest of the EU because they are our competitors in these matters.  Focusing on the Good Friday Agreement therefore makes moral, political and strategic sense.  It is simply the best way to deal with all the prospective difficulties.  We should also do our best to protect Scotland's current and future interests.  <br/><br/>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court in London decided that the Northern Ireland Assembly need not be consulted as a matter of domestic UK law over the UK Government's decision to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.  This unfortunate and controversial decision is at odds with many Irish people's understanding of what was agreed in 1998, namely, that all of the institutional relations within the North, between North and South, east and west, and between these islands and our European partners, were one complex unity and that any constitutional change required the consent of the people of Ireland North and South.  <br/><br/>I am asking the Minister to explain what he intends to do to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in its integrity, to ensure that the wishes of the majority in the North are upheld, and that the status of all-island relations are treated distinctly as a separate strand in the Article 50 negotiations.</p></speech>

I wish everyone well in the coming weeks and months as they go electioneering in Northern Ireland.  I know that a number of Members of this House will be going up to campaign and canvass for various candidates and parties.  We are all professional politicians and know the strains and stresses of elections, be they local or national, including the hazards of climbing ladders to put up posters, as well as dogs biting and chasing candidates.  I appreciate that it will be a difficult and stressful time but I sincerely wish the best of luck to everyone who enters into the spirit of true democracy.</p> <p>Everyone acknowledges it is unfortunate that we are having an election and that the Assembly did not run to its full term.  It is a good thing, however, that we are having a peaceful election.  We should take care with our own rhetoric in this House and avoid point-scoring or attacking those who cannot answer back.  Let us rather enter into the spirit of the debate.  We should let the parties and individuals contesting the elections in the North have it out.  Hopefully, they will resolve the issue so that we can get a fully functioning Executive after the election in March.  Northern Ireland faces many great challenges at the moment, including Brexit.  I am sincerely disappointed that Prime Minister May will not take the opportunity in her forthcoming visit to address either House of the Oireachtas.  I trust that the Government is going into talks with the other 26 member states ahead of Article 50 being invoked and the Brexit negotiations to put the best case for the island of Ireland. </p> <p>Other things need to sorted concerning scandals and the sheer stability of Northern Ireland.  I fear that we take that stability for granted.  We currently take a lot of things for granted, which was apparent in the referendum.  People took so many of the benefits of EU membership for granted, that they simply forgot how far things have come since Ireland and the UK joined in the 1970s.  An emerging generation is taking for granted the peace and stability we have in the North, which required great sacrifices from every side.</p> <p>The shooting incident in the North earlier this week brought home how closely we could slip back into the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s.  My grandfather would be rolling in his grave to hear me say this, but I too want to add my best wishes to Martin McGuinness.  If it is good enough for Ian Paisley junior to say so, there is no way that I can stand in the way.  He must be commended for what he has done and the sacrifices he has made.  There are many people on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland who have made great sacrifices, as has the average Irish man and woman on both sides of the Border.  Let us take that spirit of optimism and realism into the next few weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have full faith in our Government and perhaps the British Government to act as guarantors and allow these elections to take place in the appropriate environment so that we get a resolution that will allow continued peace and stability on both sides of the Border and will allow Northern Ireland and the Republic to face the unique challenges of the coming years.</p></speech>

I join with others in expressing my thanks to the former deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, for the journey he has taken, his commitment and work in the past number of years.  I wish Michelle O'Neill MLA the very best in her new role.  I disagree with Senator Neale Richmond in his belief that the British Government will act in good faith in terms of its responsibilities as co-guarantors to the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>I watch the debate and I am outraged by the complete and utter indifference of the British Government and the Brexit campaigners to their responsibilities on this island.  They are a massive part of the problem that existed on this island for a very long time.  Now it appears that we are almost completely indifferent to their negotiations and their thought process.  It was very decent of Prime Minister Theresa May to place us at No. 4 on her list of 12 items of concern.  It is possible the Minister had some role in that and is to be congratulated for that.  If it was to be seen in the cold light of day as to where we stand in her thought process, she had an historic opportunity to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to speak in the D&aacute;il and to put on record her commitment and that of the British Government to their responsibilities on this island.  She decided not to do that.</p> <p>I have a deep-felt distaste for hardline nationalism.  It bores me to tears.  I am not necessarily looking forward to the debates in the North when the electioneering begins because I find hardline nationalism on either side particularly tedious.  There are other issues in Northern Ireland to discuss.  I was very taken by a speech by Colum Eastwood MLA on the child poverty rate in west Belfast and the numbers of adults in west Belfast who had no formal qualifications.</p> <p>Other speakers have mentioned marriage equality and other social issues that rarely get an airing.  I was at a meeting in Belfast before Christmas on the issue of drugs.  There are serious social issues, such as equality that need to be addressed.  The hardline nationalistic stances of either side of the debate are the views that come to the fore.  It is the hardline nationalist instinct in the United Kingdom which is now at the centre of the debate on Brexit.  It is the campaigning zeal of those who are in favour of Brexit that has led to Britain walking off from its historic responsibilities in Europe as a whole and has led it to walk off the stage in terms of its responsibilities here.</p> <p>We have had 20 years - perhaps longer - of couching everything we have said about the United Kingdom and our relationship with Britain in friendly terminology.  It has been important to do that.  It was important and responsible that Irish Governments and people representing the State would not say anything that would inflame tensions or make things worse, particularly when lives are at risk.  However, there comes a stage when one has to call a spade a spade.  When the Prime Minister in No. 10 Downing Street is pandering to the worst excesses of British nationalism, I think we must call it out.  The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom had a fantastic opportunity to come to these Houses and speak to the Members about the Good Friday Agreement, her commitment to it and about the fact that Brexit will not impact necessarily on peace in this island, but she is reportedly refusing to do so.</p> <p>May I suggest that it is important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as a representative of the Government, to speak in frank terms about our dismay that Ireland and Northern Ireland are not on the real priority list for Prime Minister May and her Government and also when overseeing and commenting on the events in Northern Ireland in the coming period that it is the social issues, equality, empowerment and the issues beyond those of orange and green that will come to the fore.</p> <p>It is time for the niceties of language and the pretence of friendship to be put to one side for a certain degree because if one cannot speak frankly to people who are walking away from their historic responsibilities, then we are doing the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland a disservice.  This is not about a flag waving blame game.  I am the last person in the world to stand with a Tricolour flying in somebody's face trying to score a nationalistic point off them.  That is not me.  It worries me to the bone that such a powerful country with such historic responsibilities for a place in which it has had a significant impact over centuries, does not give thought to and does not take the opportunity it had to settle the nerves I have about its intentions.</p> <p>I would like the Minister to respond to my remarks.  I understand that he has the responsibility for this Ministry.  His words carry weight.  I think that is very important.  It is important that Members in this House speak frankly about the direction that Prime Minister May and her Government are taking in respect of Northern Ireland the entire island of Ireland.</p></speech>

I was at the presentation at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am trying to keep a lot of balls in the air today.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  At the outset I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing on Brexit.  After that I will start to take things apart.</p> <p>Let me put it in context.  There is a great deal of talk about nationalism in Northern Ireland.  It is no secret that I spent five years of my life in the British army, in the Royal Irish Rangers.  It is also no secret that Sinn F&eacute;in voted for me to have me elected to this House.  I have no axe to grind with Sinn F&eacute;in and I never had.  I would not have seen eye to eye with the IRA down through the years.</p> <p>One of the things that has frightened me considerably is a rise in polarisation in the North.  For the first time, in as far as I can remember, I was attacked recently on social media by a member of the Unionist community, telling me to keep my "effing" nose out of northern affairs.  I was so delighted when I saw some of my Unionist pals kick in and say: "Hey, back off.  This man has no interest in trying to colonise or take over the North of Ireland."  I have no doubt that the North and the South will be unified at some stage, but I am not advocating for it as a result of Brexit.  I want to have due regard to our friends and colleagues who are of the Unionist tradition who want to remain in Britain.  Nonetheless they signed up to the Good Friday Agreement and they are as much a part of the Good Friday Agreement as we are and as our Catholic friends, or at least they should be.  I know that certain things in the recent past would call that into question.  Like most Members who have spoken here today have mentioned, the former deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, has played the greatest role as the leader of the Nationalist group in Northern Ireland.  I have the greatest admiration for the man.  I think he did a good job.  </p> <p>This brings me to an issue I raised on the Order of Business, where I requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the issue following the Supreme Court ruling.  I was told the Minister would be in the House today so I did not press the issue. </p></speech>
