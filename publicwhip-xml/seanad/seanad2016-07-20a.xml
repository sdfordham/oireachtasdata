Given his place in the heart of Ireland, I think he will have a good feel for the ways in which we may be able to improve the domestic tourism market.  I look forward to hearing his views on the matter.</p> <p>I am primarily concerned with the possible negative impacts of the Brexit vote on our domestic tourism industry.  The key objective of the Government's tourism strategy, People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025, which was launched last year, is to use Government policy in an effective way to combine Ireland&rsquo;s key attractions of people and places to maximise the tourism industry.  While I am a little biased, I suggest there is no better example of the success of this approach than the introduction of the Wild Atlantic Way in my native county of Kerry.  This tourist trail, which stretches from Donegal to west Cork, has revitalised tourism along the western seaboard.  I am delighted that the Government intends to commit an additional &euro;100 million in capital funding to take the Wild Atlantic Way to the next level with the creation of blueway and greenway routes and the development of the rural walks scheme.</p> <p>There is no doubt in my mind that in recent years, the Government has been very positive and proactive in promoting this island and all it has to offer.  The increased revenue from tourism is evidence of this.  However, all of this success now faces a real threat as a result of Britain's decision to leave the EU.  Naturally enough, our proximity to Britain makes it our biggest tourism customer.  Hundreds of thousands of British visitors travel to Ireland all year round.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In recent weeks, we have seen sterling take a hammering in the markets and, indeed, it crashed to a new 31-year low, dipping below $1.28 at one point in Asian trading.  We have all seen the volatility in trading and while there remains a shroud of mist with regard to Britain's leave negotiations, there will continue to be uncertainty in the markets when it comes to sterling.</p><p>That is why I am raising this matter.  I believe it is vital the Government has a contingency plan in place to protect our domestic tourism industry when we are confronted with a fall in sterling.  As I mentioned, we have done exceptionally well in promoting Ireland abroad but we need to safeguard the good work this Government has achieved with a clear-cut plan to protect Ireland's tourism industry in the aftermath of Brexit.</p><p>I wish the Minister of State well.  Given his geographic position, I am looking forward to an improvement for places that need further improvement.  We are lacking hotels and hotel bedrooms and we need more infrastructure.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's views on the matter.</p></speech>

I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important issue, particularly in regard to Ireland's response following the British decision to leave the European Union.  In terms of overseas visitor numbers, Great Britain has consistently been Ireland&rsquo;s most important overseas market.  In 2015, which was a record year, over 3.5 million visits were made from Great Britain to Ireland, representing 41% of overseas visit numbers and accounting for 23%, or almost a quarter, of total tourism revenue.</p> <p>As the House will know, Tourism Ireland, an all-island body set up as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, is the agency responsible for the inward marketing of Ireland.  As recently as last week, I had a discussion with Tourism Ireland to better understand where that agency is positioned in terms of dealing with the fallout from Britain's decision to leave the Union.  It is too early to form a judgement on the overall impact of the UK referendum result but there will be some short-term implications.  These are likely to be centred on the possibility that consumers in the UK will be more cautious with their discretionary spending due to the volatility with sterling, which may impact outbound tourism generally from Great Britain.  A second short-term issue is the impact on the prevailing exchange rates between the British pound and the euro.  In terms of the outbound Great Britain market, it should be noted that the relative reduction in the value of sterling will have similar implications for all eurozone countries.</p> <p>In regard to this last point, the very strong tourism performance of the last two years - last year was a record year - has fed through into increased prices for visitor accommodation, particularly in Dublin and in other key tourism destinations.  I met with F&aacute;ilte Ireland last week in regard to the constraints that are becoming increasingly apparent in the Dublin accommodation market.  Up to now, British visitors were somewhat insulated from the full impact of these increases due to the strong value of sterling.  With the recent currency adjustments, the full extent of the price movements will now be more apparent for British visitors.  Therefore, an opportunity exists for tourism accommodation providers to match prevailing prices to the new market environment and ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position is maintained.  If I could get one message out from the Seanad today, it is a very clear and succinct message to Dublin hoteliers and the Dublin industry in particular that this is something the Government is very concerned about.</p> <p>In the short term, there are no changes to how people can travel between Ireland and the UK, and the Government will be doing its utmost in future discussions to maintain the common travel area, which has existed since 1922.  With regard to the longer term, the programme for Government commits to implementing the policy referred to by Senator Coghlan up to 2025 and achieving the targets for Irish tourism within it.  Even prior to the referendum result there was a commitment in the tourism policy to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  However, the British market will remain of significant importance to Irish tourism product in the future and I believe that Ireland&rsquo;s excellent tourism offering will ensure that we continue to perform strongly in that market.</p> <p>As I said, Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation and is due to meet tourism industry representatives later this week.  I will keep in close contact with Tourism Ireland and will continue to meet its representatives to keep abreast of proceedings.  In the longer term, we will work closely with other Departments, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the economic Departments within Government.  I am anxious to take on board the views of the Members of the Oireachtas.  I know Senators have a very strong tradition of using the Seanad effectively to sound out issues of importance to the State, in particular longer-term projects.  I encourage the Cathaoirleach and Senator Coghlan to consider the possibility, when the Seanad reconvenes in September, of a longer-term discussion in regard to the challenges facing Irish tourism, particularly in the context of the UK referendum.</p></speech>

In any case, I am very grateful for the Minister of State's response.  I note particularly what he said about the Dublin hotels, which is a very relevant point.  Perhaps by increasing their competitiveness they might make up for the fall in sterling.  I hope sterling improves, and perhaps it will down the line.  In the meantime, our hoteliers could help, and I hope they will, because they will not want to lose the business.  They could match that fall and still give value for money.  I very much welcome what the Minister of State has said overall and I look forward to further progress and growth.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-20a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072000002#B00700"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, for coming to the House.  I want to ask for a review of parking charges at HSE hospitals across the country to ensure low-cost parking is available to patients and visitors to the public hospital system.  I also want to ask if any single organisation has a contract with the HSE to charge for parking and-or clamping on hospital grounds.  Will the Minister of State inform us of the cost of such contracts and make a statement on the matter?</p> <p>I spoke about this in a different context prior to getting elected to the Seanad in my role as secretary of the National Association of General Practitioners.  I felt many patients were attending hospitals unnecessarily for investigations that could happen in the community.  Various investigations into hospital car parking fees have shown a severe lack of consistency in the rates being charged across the country.  To give some examples, there is a charge of &euro;3 per hour at the Mater Hospital, with a maximum charge of &euro;15 per day; it is &euro;2.70 per hour at Cork University Hospital, with a maximum charge of &euro;15 per day; it is &euro;2 per hour at University Hospital Galway, with a &euro;9 daily rate and a rate of &euro;30 for one week; and at Kerry Hospital, the first 20 minutes is free, 20 minutes to one hour is &euro;3 and there is a &euro;12 daily rate.</p> <p>As the House can see, due to the lack of regulation, there are vast differences across the State.  Going by the above figures, the average daily rate is &euro;10 or &euro;70 per week.  This is a lot of money for many families and particularly for long-term patients.  I appreciate that many hospitals have special consideration for people who require longer-term parking but there are also many instances where hospitals are not identifying people in need of special discounts.</p> <p>This unpopular charge is generating millions of euro of income for hospitals.  For example, Cork University Hospital was the highest earner, collecting over &euro;2.8 million last year from car park fees, working out at an average of &euro;8,000 per day, University Hospital Waterford collected &euro;1.48 million, Wexford Hospital collected &euro;700,000 and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children collected &euro;349,000.  These fees are causing increased distress to the sick and their relatives and are an active deterrent to people visiting hospitals.  Those who have long-term illnesses may need to spend several hours in a car park, and it is, in effect, a tax on a sick person.  There are certain hospitals which add to the distress by imposing clamping fees but the release charge also varies and can be as high as &euro;120 in some hospitals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My colleagues throughout the country have brought this up time and again.  For example, Councillor Norma Foley, a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor in Kerry, has said it is no longer simply an issue for the people visiting the hospital, but one for the entire community surrounding the hospital.  In housing estates in the vicinity of the hospitals residents are struggling to get parking at their houses as a result of the area being overrun with traffic.  There is a knock-on impact as a result of the fees.</p><p>Some people have tried to justify the charges with the argument that they are necessary to deter motorists who are working or shopping from using the car parks for free at the expense of spaces for patients and visitors.  If this is the case, then the costs should be nominal.  Could we consider a flat nominal nationwide fee?  Could we have a barcode system whereby if a patient receives an outpatient appointment, at the bottom of the letter a barcode could facilitate access to a car park and give the patient two or three hours of free parking while attending the hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-20a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am taking it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, who apologises for not being here.</p> <p>I will set out the background.  Over the past decade parking charges have been introduced in many of our hospitals.  It is important to note that these parking charges form part of a series of measures to ensure that the operational costs of providing parking services do not impact negatively on a hospital's overall budget.  As we are all aware, there is a considerable and increasing demand for parking services at our hospitals.  Consequently, the costs associated with providing these parking services are significant.  This is especially the case when we take into account the initial capital costs of purchasing or renting parking areas, the cost of developing extra parking spaces, the need to provide and upgrade security systems in hospital car parks as well as the cost of staffing and general maintenance of parking services.  I imagine we would all agree that it is important that the cost of providing parking services to visitors, staff and patients does not impact on a hospital's budget for providing health services.</p> <p>The HSE has advised that it does not have a single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals.  Instead, each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances.  For example, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, the National Maternity Hospital and Mercy University Hospital, Cork, do not provide public car parks.  Furthermore, some hospitals, such as St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar, Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway, and Mallow General Hospital, do not charge a car parking fee.</p> <p>I am advised by the HSE that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investment in security.  The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget or to fund research or specific patient facilities.  I am aware that those hospitals which charge parking fees are cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families.  Consequently, hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense.  While there is no national HSE policy governing car parking charges, the HSE advises me that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.  In that regard I would advise Senator Swanick to send any specific recommendations directly to the HSE or the individual hospitals.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight the fact that we need an alternative and fairer system.

This is my first time to address him since his elevation.  I congratulate him.  It is great to see him here.</p> <p>We are here to talk about pension abatement.  Contrary to popular opinion, people employed in the public service pay for their pensions and they have a legitimate expectation and right to receive the associated benefits when they retire.</p> <p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 was introduced for new entrants to the public service from 2013.  The Act implemented a number of reforms of public service pensions, including the extension in section 52 of the basis of pension abatement or reduction for rehire of pensioners in the public service from the date when the Bill was commenced.</p> <p>The object of pension abatement was to ensure that the rate of pension, when added to the rate of pay or fee for work in the public service carried out by a retiree from the public service, would not exceed the salary earned pre-retirement by that person.  Given that many senior public servants opted to avail of the various deals under the Croke Park, Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements it was understandable that some methodology would be put in place to ensure a person with a large pension could not benefit in retirement by being rehired or by re-entering the public service.  In particular, there was a concern at the time that Secretaries General, assistant secretaries general, principal teachers and various other senior people who went out with lucrative pensions and lump sums would not be rehired immediately and benefit from both a pension and a new salary.</p> <p>However, the latent effect of the 2012 Act has been to penalise a small number of pensioners while many others enjoy their pensions and their new jobs in public service.  In truth, the pension abatement scheme is riddled with unfairness and inequality.  For example, workers in the health service who are re-employed by the HSE are not subjected to any abatement simply because they are agency workers.  The former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, explained how this could happen in July 2013.  He said that where a private agency employs an individual, the HSE contract is with the agency and not the individual.</p> <p>To highlight the unfairness, I will set out an example involving two public servants who have retired from a security related post at the age of 58 years.  Both still have considerable working life left in them - I imagine the Minister of State will agree with that much.  Let us suppose their pre-retirement salary was &euro;45,000 per year.  They both now have a pension of &euro;22,500.  Then let us suppose both are offered positions in different public hospitals and the salary for the new job is &euro;45,000.  Person A, who went to the job by way of an agency, gets a &euro;45,000 salary and his pension of &euro;22,500 as a result of being an agency employee.  Person B is hired directly by the hospital.  However, because the salary is now &euro;45,000 his pension is totally abated because he cannot earn more or benefit as a result of pension abatement.  This is totally unfair.  Only a small number of people are affected by this because most staff rehired to the public service come through agencies.</p> <p>We have frequently heard from Governments in the past that the pensions of former taoisigh and Ministers are subject to property rights and cannot be touched.  The argument is that the relevant people have earned them and paid for them and that they belong to them.  Yet this does not apply when we are discussing people in the public service who retire on relatively meagre pensions and seek to re-enter the public service or are offered jobs because they have particular expertise.</p> <p>The financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation was brought in to cut all pensions.  The pensions we are talking about have already been cut by the State.  The people concerned are entitled to retain their pension in full.  This must be dealt with in the forthcoming budget.  It is grossly unfair that a small number of people suffer total abatement of their pensions while others, in particular, those in some of the more lucrative jobs, can earns vast sums of money as well as their pensions.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  Thank you for your forbearance, a Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

I have become familiar with this House in recent days because I have been here a good deal.</p> <p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who is unable to be with us and who sends his apologies.</p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for raising this issue.  Abatement in the public service is intended to ensure that when retired public servants who are in receipt of a public service pension are reappointed to the public service, the associated pensions are reduced in order that they receive no more than the pension and pay that they would have received if they had continued to serve in their former posts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The practice of abatement goes as far back as the Superannuation Act of 1834.  The principle of abatement predates the financial crisis and is not considered a financial emergency measure.  The universal application of abatement was not introduced via the FEMPI legislation but rather as part of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012.  With the introduction of the 2012 Act, the application of abatement was widened.  Previously, abatement generally applied only where the pensioner returned to work in the same sector or scheme from which the pension was drawn.  The principle of abatement was not consistent in its application across sectors.  Now, following the introduction of the Act, the principle of abatement may be applicable in respect of any public service employment obtained by a public service pensioner.  For example, a retired teacher going to work in a local authority, a retired Deputy securing a public service post, or a retired garda going to work in a third level college will all be subject to the principle of abatement.  This extension of the principle of pension abatement to the entire public service was provided for in section 52 of the 2012 Act.</p><p>While more pensioners are, in principle, exposed to abatement under the 2012 Act, the issue of whether abatement actually occurs in an individual case, and its extent, that is, whether the pension is fully or partially abated, depends on the circumstances, and in certain scenarios no abatement will apply at all.  I am satisfied that the measures taken in the 2012 Act were progressive, fair and necessary.  The extension of abatement across the public service was appropriate as a modernising pension reform, and it represents a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns about simultaneous payment of pension and salary in the public service.  In exceptional circumstances, the legislation also allows the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to remove any doubt or question arising in the application of abatement and to waive the abatement provision in limited circumstances.</p></speech>

The truth is that I could bring in a list of people who have retired from the public service in education, health, the Garda, the Army and various other places, many of whom are back working in the public service through agencies and are suffering no abatement whatsoever.  Then there is a small number who came directly into a public service job and they are being abated.  That is grossly unfair.  It is a fault in the legislation.  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, is right - because these people are working for agencies, their pensions cannot be touched, but because some poor unfortunate takes a job directly, their pension can be affected.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is here answering for the Department, not on his own behalf.  The Department has to look at this.  We either apply abatement uniformly across the board, irrespective of who the employer is, or we abate nobody.  It is one or the other.  We have to make this fair and equitable and it is not that at present.</p></speech>

I will bring his concerns regarding how pension abatements should affect everybody across the board and the examples he has highlighted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  However, we believe the extension of the abatement to the public service, as provided for in the 2012 Act, was an appropriate measure, as I stated earlier.  It represents a suitable and considered response to legitimate public concerns about the simultaneous payment of pension and salary in the public service.  The Minister is satisfied that the abatement of public service pensions, which is what the Senator is talking about, as provided under the terms of section 52 of the 2012 Act is lawful, fair and necessary.  However, I will bring the Senator's concerns about the issues raised to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p></speech>

If we took five 14-minute matters, it would affect the Order of Business, which is difficult.

We know all too well, and we have discussed it in the House, that Brexit will be difficult for Ireland in economic terms, but there will be a few small possibilities, particularly in the area of financial services.  The area I am concerned with is passporting.  Current EU laws allow European banks to operate branches in the UK that do not need to be separately capitalised from the parent company abroad.  Non-EU banks can use their subsidiary to sell services to clients across the EU.  However, it is looking increasingly likely that the UK will lose access to the EU market as it will not accept EU laws relating to freedom of movement.</p> <p>I was very interested to read a report prepared for Deutsche Bank earlier this month.  It has already looked at the scenario and assessed that financial services institutions are already looking to passport into other EU countries, with Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in particular looking at Dublin, and J.P. Morgan also looking to move elsewhere, moving up to 6,500 jobs at the same time.  The reason this is so important is that in order for companies to do this, they require a banking licence.</p> <p>I am worried that the waiting time many institutions are facing to get a banking licence in Ireland is proving to be prohibitive.  The Minister can correct me if I have got the timeline wrong on this, but like France, with whose capital, Paris, Dublin competes as a financial sector, expected decisions on applications in Ireland are currently taking, on average, 12 months.  However, in other competing jurisdictions, like Frankfurt in Germany and Luxembourg, this is down to just six months.  I have received contact from a number of leading companies and financial institutions who, in the wake of Brexit, have been seeking to relocate their operations to Dublin so that they can passport to the wider European Union.  They have been put off by the expected delays and lack of flexibility from the Central Bank.  I appreciate that our system, as it is, is not a bad system and there is a reason for the way our processes work, but it could be greatly improved.  If we are to capitalise on Brexit, where we can, then efforts need to made to reduce these times so that we are not losing out on potential jobs and revenue.</p></speech>

I appreciate his concern on this and would like to pass on the apologies of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who has an important meeting this morning and has asked me personally to take this  matter on his behalf.  I assure Senator Richmond that I will discuss his concerns with the Minister at a later date.  I will outline to the Senator the review of the application process for companies applying for a banking licence.</p> <p>The primary responsibility for the authorisation of banking licences and its decision process rests with the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank.  They are two very important bodies that make decisions in regard to banking licences.  One cannot do it without the other.  Both bodies are statutorily independent in the carrying out of their functions and have specific missions.  Given the Central Bank of Ireland was established by the Oireachtas, I want to reference its core mission of "safeguarding financial stability and protecting consumers&rdquo;.   That is something we should all remember.  This mission requires it to ensure that every bank operating in Ireland meets certain minimum standards and codes of practice before it can be deemed eligible to carry out its activities.</p> <p>In order to be of assistance to Senators, I will very briefly set out the process for a bank seeking authorisation.  More detailed information is set out on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website, including guidelines on required information and the authorisation process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Breen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In summary, the principal stages in the authorisation process are as follows: exploratory phase; the submission of an application and its assessment by the ECB and the Central Bank; and a decision by the ECB on whether to grant a banking licence.  </p><p>The exploratory phase is the important first stage.  Applicants should demonstrate familiarity with all statutory and non-statutory requirements applicable to credit institutions in Ireland.  These requirements include a knowledge of key codes of conducts such as those on mortgage arrears and business lending to SMEs which provide vital protections for consumers.  If the applicant is satisfied that the proposed business model meets the requirements, he or she should arrange a preliminary meeting with the Central Rank.  If compliant, the applicant submits a proposal for authorisation which the Central Bank will review in detail.  Following this review, it will provide a preliminary view on whether the applicant should pursue the application for authorisation.  If the applicant proceeds with a formal application, the ECB will perform a detailed assessment and further detailed assessment work will also be performed by the Central Bank.  I must stress that given the risks and complexities of operating a bank, there are numerous issues to be considered as part of these assessments, including the structure of the bank and its organisation and management, including key personnel, which is extremely important.  Also important are the risk oversight mechanisms and its capital, funding and solvency projections, among many other areas.</p><p>When the review of the application has been satisfactorily completed, the ECB will make a decision on whether to grant a banking licence.  Such a licence will only be granted where both the ECB and the Central Bank are satisfied that the applicant complies with the authorisation requirements.  The Government is fully aware of the possibilities and opportunities arising from firms and funds potentially seeking to locate in Ireland.  In this respect, the Central Bank has confirmed to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that it is committed to providing a clear, open and transparent authorisation process which, importantly, is open to all applications.  In assessing such applications the bank will ensure a rigorous assessment against regulatory standards so as to continue a high and consistent level of consumer protection.</p><p>The Minister for Finance is fully aware that this authorisation process takes time, but we have learned all too well about the consequences of having a light touch regulatory regime.  It may be of interest to the Seanad to learn that a number of recently authorised firms have informed the Central Bank that they would be uncomfortable with the operating environment in Ireland if the authorisation process was too speedy or insufficiently challenging.</p></speech>

I agree with him on the need for licences to be granted in a transparent and, most importantly, rigorous manner.  We have learned lessons from having a light touch regulatory regime.  I ask the Minister of State to convey my fear to the Minister for Finance that we are missing a trick, especially in the light of Brexit.  I will give one anecdotal example.  Not long ago representatives of a very large multinational company came to see me and a colleague.  They told us they had exhausted the process, having gone back and forth to and from the Central Bank for a period of up to four years.  Ultimately, the company was able to complete the entire process in just ten weeks in Luxembourg and as a result 150 jobs were lost to this country.  There are briefings in financial institutions which warn companies which are looking to relocate from London to expect delays in Ireland and that there are other options available in competing jurisdictions, be in Frankfurt or Luxembourg.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Department of Finance is monitoring the position very closely.  We must, however, learn from what happened during the downturn in the economy and the lessons from having a light touch regulatory regime in the banking sector.  The Minister for Finance is in constant touch with both the Central Bank and the ECB.  We have regulations in place and must learn from what happened in the past.  As the Senator outlined, I am sure the Minister is committed to making the most of the available opportunities for financial institutions and that Ireland is ready to avail of them with the proper scrutiny and regulation.  The Senator has made a very good point, one that I will convey to the Minister.  I again thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

The constituency of Dublin South Central is home to one of the highest proportions of people in the country living with a disability, with more than 15,000 people.  A total of 12% of the population of that constituency has a disability, compared to the national average of 9.3%.  Last week, I was contacted by a constituent, who I will not name, who is sleeping on our streets with her guide dog.  She has been told by Dublin City Council that it has no suitable accommodation for her.  We called Dublin City Council, which referred us to six different disability organisations.  They confirmed there is no supply of emergency accommodation in the city suitable for a disabled person.  The lady has attended many hostels with her dog and confirmed to us that her dog has been kicked and shoved out of the way.  She was unable to stay in the hostel as it was not safe for her dog on which she relies.</p> <p>Yesterday's national housing strategy outlined an ambitious plan that will inform the specific supply responsible for people with disabilities at a local level, including accessibility requirements in new local housing stock.  The report outlined that &euro;10 million will be ring-fenced to provide for the implementation of the strategy, which seeks to secure people in their local communities.  Meanwhile, the cuts to the housing adaptation grant which were introduced by the previous Government run counter to the policy of trying to move people into communities and enable people with disabilities to live independently in their own homes where possible.  Grants such as the housing adaptation grant make it possible for people with disabilities to remain in their own homes, providing vital support for installing essentials such as handrails and lifts to assist people to get around their homes more easily.</p> <p>It is imperative that essential grants such as these are not filleted further by the new Government.  They need to be adequately resourced and funding made available because they are often the difference between a person remaining in his or her own home or being forced to enter a care facility such as a nursing home.  While budget 2016 aims to increase the allocation by 10% to &euro;55 million, the programme for Government states it supports further increases in funding for the scheme.  It is imperative this commitment is delivered.</p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto calls for a restoration of the grant to 2011 levels, which would require an extra &euro;25.5 million in funding.  We hope the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has responsibility for the grant, will begin the process of working towards restoring it to more adequate levels in the next budget and will honour the commitment to increase funding to the scheme, as committed to in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

This is truly an historic moment for the Seanad and the people of Ireland, regardless of where in the world they live.  I stand here as the first Irish citizen emigrant to be appointed to this Chamber.  I am here to give official voice to the millions of Irish men and women who have left these shores but have not forgotten the land of their birth or lost their innate sense of Irish identity.  More than 70 million people throughout the world claim Irish ancestry.  My appointment to the Seanad is an official and long-overdue nod to Ireland's diaspora and an acknowledgement that the people of this proud and ancient island desire a modern and mature relationship with their fellow Irish men and women who live in other lands.  I look forward to sterling debate and action in the Seanad for all the undocumented in the US.<br/><br/>It is with great honour and a deep sense of humility that I take up my post in this Twenty-fifth Seanad of the Irish Republic to represent Ireland's emigrants.  I thank the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and his Government colleagues for their continued commitment to the diaspora.  This has been made manifest by my presence in the Chamber today.  Like countless men and women before me, I left Ireland to begin a new life for myself and my family in the US.  In my case, I left for Chicago in 1998.  Ireland and the US share a deep and enduring bond that has been forged over the centuries in common kinship, epic struggles and shared values.  More than 40 million Americans claim Irish ancestry.  Many of them are descended from the more than 1 million desperate men and women who fled this country during the ravages of the terrible Famine.  I remind Senators of what President John F. Kennedy said on this issue when he addressed the Oireachtas in 1963:</p><blockquote>And so it is that our two nations, divided by distance, have been united by history.  No people ever believed more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United States.  And no country contributed more to building my own than your sons and daughters.  They came to our shores in a mixture of hope and agony, and I would not underrate the difficulties of their course once they arrived.</blockquote><p>When they arrived in America, they faced a cold welcome, not unlike that received by today's desperate immigrants and refugees fleeing war and famine.  Despite that, the Irish set about building a new life for themselves and in the process helped to build the United States of America.<br/><br/>Emigration from these shores continues today, although it is diminishing rapidly, thank God.  If one stands on the south side of Chicago, one is likely to hear brogues from the four corners of Ireland.  The Irish continue to make their mark on the US and on countries throughout the world.  From Argentina to Australia and from Dubai to Italy, Irish citizens are moving, innovating and working in every conceivable industry.  In an era of global citizenship, when people are more mobile and nations are more interdependent than ever, Ireland has to choose between adapting to an ever-changing definition of nationhood and of Irish citizenship by embracing her diaspora, or looking away and focusing inward.  The revolutionaries of 1916 certainly did not choose the latter option.  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, I am confident that the lofty ideals of the Proclamation's reference to &quot;cherishing all the children of the nation&quot; are being fulfilled.  Today's open and inclusive Ireland is redefining the meaning of nationhood and, in so doing, is reaching out to our diaspora in ways that have never been done before.  My appointment to the Seanad is just the first step in this process.<br/><br/>Last Wednesday, I listened on the Internet to some of the speeches that were being made in this House.  I thank Senator McDowell for introducing the Seanad Bill 2016, which proposes reforms that would not be before time.  I am committed to making the Seanad a legislative body that is designed for the Ireland of the 21st century.  I commend the Taoiseach on his willingness to extend voting rights to Irish citizens living abroad.  If 25 of the 28 other EU member states can facilitate this - indeed, it is provide for in 125 countries throughout the world - so can we.  I suggest we should start with the 2018 presidential election.  If we allow people in both the North and the South to vote in that election, it might be the catalyst for them to vote for a united Ireland.  Ireland will only benefit from engaging her dynamic emigrants in the democratic process.  The thousands of people who flew home to vote in last year's referendum on marriage equality showed us that Irish citizens who live abroad truly want a say in the country they call home.  I respectfully challenge this Chamber to ask itself what it can do for the diaspora, rather than what the diaspora can do for it.  This challenge rings particularly true for vulnerable Irish emigrants, such as the elderly in Britain, who were affected by the recent RTE longwave controversy, and the undocumented in the US, who continue to need our support.  I stand committed to providing a voice for such people in this Chamber and beyond.<br/><br/>I would like to touch on a point that was made last week by Senator Norris, whose career in the Seanad I have followed for many years.  I have enjoyed his oratorical analysis and his great wit, but I was surprised last week to hear him castigate the Taoiseach on his 11 appointments.  Of course I am one of the 11 appointees.  Was it not the Taoiseach's constitutional duty, as set out in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, to nominate 11 Senators?</p></speech>

I took great inspiration from his personal story of humble beginnings and self-education.  I feel the same sense of pride that made the hairs on the back of Senator Boyhan's neck stand up when he first walked through the hallowed halls of this Chamber.  I come from a dairying background, having once supplied milk to most of the restaurants in Galway city.  It has often been thrown at me that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  Given that from the age of six, I got up at 4.30 a.m. seven days a week, including Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day, I have often wondered what a golden spoon would have felt like.</p></speech>

I had not intended to raise this issue again but I am doing so on foot of a telephone call I received this morning from a young woman called Mary, who was diagnosed with lymphoma four weeks ago and whose experience underlines the human difficulties being caused by the lack of beds in University Hospital Galway and elsewhere in the west.  She started her treatment plan and had her first session of chemotherapy three weeks ago.  Her chemotherapy sessions were planned for 21-day cycles.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She was told to ring between noon and 1 p.m. on Monday, which she did, only to be told a bed was not available.  She was told to telephone again yesterday, which she did, but again she was told a bed was not available.  The nurse then indicated that it would be better to be honest and told her she was 16th on a list and that even when her name was reached, she was not guaranteed a bed.</p><p>Mary is 30 years of age.  She was supposed to have blood taken on Monday and Thursday, but as she was supposed to travel to Galway, she could not get to Castlebar, 50 miles away, where blood is taken only on Mondays and Thursdays and then sent to Galway.  She is a young woman who has been left sitting in her home in north Mayo, not knowing when she will receive the life-saving treatment she needs.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case.  For as long as I have been a public representative, I have been dealing with people such as Mary.</p><p>I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, explain to the House how he proposes to deal with the lack of hospital beds.  Decisions taken by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government to cut bed numbers are causing premature deaths, particularly along the western seaboard.  People like Mary are dying prematurely because they are being denied the essential treatment they need.  Hospital bed numbers were cut under the stewardship of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats and the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  The Government will tell us its decisions cannot be reversed in the same way it told us medical cards could not be given to children with disabilities.  That claim was proved wrong in the D&aacute;il yesterday evening. </p><p>We can no longer pat ourselves on the back or run around like self-licking lollipops as we praise ourselves for what we are doing when people are dying prematurely because they cannot afford basic health care and have been denied such care by successive Governments.</p></speech>

We must bear in mind that the number of children in emergency accommodation increased by 67% in June compared with the same month last year.  Hundreds of children are living in emergency accommodation and the State must take measures to make this accommodation as safe as possible.  The ISPCC has consistently called for physical and management standards to be introduced for emergency accommodation.  Emergency accommodation is provided under a contract agreed between the State and a commercial provider.  These contracts should contain physical and management standards which hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation providers should be obliged to meet to ensure the protection of children.  The standards required include Garda vetting of hotel staff, access to safe areas to play, access to drinking water and a minimum threshold for physical and management standards.  It is simply not good enough that such standards are not yet in place.  Some 1,394 children are living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin and the inherent risks they face are not being addressed.  While the housing action plan addresses house building and finance, it is also essential that structures are put in place to support people who are forced to live in emergency accommodation.  The safety of children living in such accommodation is of the utmost importance and all measures must be taken to ensure these children are safe. </p> <p>I also welcome the renewed conversation on building relationships on the island in the light of the decision by England and Wales to vote for Brexit and the decision of Scotland and the North to vote to remain in the European Union.  My contacts in the voluntary and community services in the North are very concerned about the prospect of the North being taken out of the European Union.  People living on Rathlin Island, from where my father comes, are talking about having an independent island to get away from it all.</p></speech>

Led by Dr. Kurt Huebner, director of the Institute of European Studies at the University of British Columbia, the findings of this research indicate that the unification of Ireland would have the potential to deliver &euro;36.5 billion for the island in the first eight years after unity.</p></speech>

In the week in which Mr. Donald Trump is to be nominated the Republican candidate for the presidential election in the United States, anybody with a sense of justice should reject Mr. Trump's racism, xenophobia and sexism at every opportunity in the coming months.</p> <p>I raise the issue of disadvantage, particularly in the light of another visit by the Taoiseach to the north inner city of Dublin today.  I greatly welcome this visit as it shows the Taoiseach's commitment to the issue that is ongoing in that locality.  As Senators constantly try to remind ourselves, a criminal justice response to murderous feuds will not make a long-term difference.  What would make a difference in areas such as the north inner city are investment, empowerment and education.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to the House to discuss the roll-out of the area based childhood, ABC, initiative introduced by the previous Government.  We should discuss the investment made under the programme, its success or otherwise and other initiatives that could be fleshed out to empower young people and parents.</p> <p>The House should also discuss literacy issues.  It is interesting to note that studies undertaken in the United States show that when the country's prison system, much of which has been outsourced to private interests, is planning its capacity needs for ten or 15 years hence, it examines literacy rates among current ten year old children.  The reason is that identifying literacy rates among ten year olds allows the prison system to calculate how many prison spaces it will need in 15 years.  We are also aware of studies of the oral language capacity of children of different backgrounds and income thresholds.  We often have a knee-jerk reaction to feuds, killings, shootings and murders.  If we are serious about long-term investment and change in areas of disadvantage, we must address parental and child empowerment because they will make a difference.  I know that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is deeply committed to this change given her background and constituency.  A debate on this issue would be highly beneficial. </p></speech>

The group that contacted me wishes to keep Gaelic games free to air.  Negotiations on broadcasting rights have commenced between the GAA and various companies.  This is a major issue which affects all sports.  At the weekend, for example, the British Open was broadcast for the first time on Sky Sports, having been broadcast previously on the BBC.  Some Senators may recall that under a deal agreed between the GAA and Sky, 14 games were broadcast for the first time on an exclusively pay-per-view basis.  Ordinary supporters believed they had not been consulted at the time and they fear the number of pay-per-view games will increase in this round of negotiations.  Having discussed the issue formally at a committee, I understand it is a matter for the governing bodies and television companies.  At the same time, the Government has a role to play in the matter.  In the case of Gaelic games, the only games ring-fenced, if one likes, for terrestrial television coverage are all-Ireland finals.  If they wished, the governing bodies could agree to have all other games broadcast on a pay-per-view basis.  The GAA has done tremendous work in promoting its games.  I commend Senator Billy Lawless for his contribution on the diaspora.  In this regard, the GAAGO platform allows thousands of followers of Gaelic games living abroad to tune into games and connect with Irish culture, which is important.  A review of the sports events to be shown on terrestrial television was carried out in 2014.  I raise this issue because all hell broke loose three years ago when the broadcasting rights to certain GAA games were sold to Sky Sports.  Given that the issue is under negotiation, I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to outline his views on the matter.</p></speech>

This week, I was told of an autistic child in the Waterford region whose specialist therapists, who the child knows well and has become comfortable with, were removed.  Instead of four specialist therapists with whom the child is confident and content, the child will now just have one unfamiliar general therapist.  The specialist therapists, who provide vital language and speech support and occupational therapy, have been reassigned to the general system.  If the child wishes to be seen by them, the child must begin from scratch on the waiting list.  How can it be that this child, for whom routine is so important, is left without any kind of specialist therapy and can be put on a waiting list for as much as a year?</p> <p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, recently published the first major report in 14 years on the education of students with autism.  The report indicates that almost 14,000 students, just 2% of the total, had an autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  The report also shows that a July provision scheme, which is similar to summer school, open to the country's 13,874 students with ASD and valued by parents, could threaten the well-being of students.  The NCSE believes that the staff recruited will not be familiar with the behaviours and needs of individual students, which could lead to challenging behaviours.  Like so many others, autistic children require specific help that is tailored to their needs.  Instead, they are being let down by a Government purporting to help them.</p></speech>

I am sorry to see him go, but I hope he does not mind that I will consult my notes from time to time during my contribution.</p> <p>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the Chamber to address us on the benefits of sport, not just in terms of health but also in its social capacity?  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned a number of concerns.  Sport and participation in sport can benefit communities and individuals.</p> <p>Many of our athletes are heading to Rio.  We are just coming off the back of a fantastic Euros campaign.  The Irish athletes who are heading to Brazil will lift the spirits of the entire country.  The Irish hockey team received a great farewell from the Northern Executive's junior Ministers.  In Belfast, our boxing heroes, many of whom will be familiar to Senators - Paddy Barnes, Mick Conlan, Brendan Irvine and Steven Donnelly - were seen off and wished every success recently.  What fantastic ambassadors for our country and people.  They are ordinary guys and girls, many of them from the same streets and parishes that we have had the privilege of representing.  I wish these athletes all the best.</p> <p>We are heading into a break, but could the Minister attend the House post our recess to expand on how to utilise and capitalise on the goodwill that will be engendered across the country, particularly among young people when they see our sporting stars, many of whom are amateurs, in order to create a new generation of heroes as opposed to thinking only selfishly from a sporting or medal-winning point of view?  How can we expand on this and utilise sport as a tool against some of the socioeconomic issues facing our communities, be they urban or rural?</p></speech>

It is wonderful to see one of our diaspora in the Chamber articulating the views of many millions of people whose voices have not been heard as much as they should have been.  More members of the diaspora should be included under the Seanad reforms.</p> <p>Brexit has happened and is presenting major challenges, but a positive can be found in the large number of multinationals in England wishing to relocate to the Republic.  They want a foothold in Europe.  I know of an agency with more than 700 jobs that is coming to this country.  There is a major opportunity, not for Dublin, which does not have the capacity, but for the rest of the country.  I would like the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to be invited to the Chamber so that we might ask her what is being and will be done.  It will represent a significant opportunity if Ireland Inc. can attract these multinationals, European agencies and high-profile jobs.  They will be considering other countries, such as France.  Brexit is causing our country many problems, but we must consider the positives as well.</p></speech>

His contribution was uplifting.  He is a prime example of a young man who headed off to the USA and made a great success of himself.  "You reap what you sow" is an adage that can be used in respect of him.</p> <p>I wish to address the charity sector.  Unfortunately, the Console controversy has done the sector untold damage.  For volunteers and contributors, it was sad news.  I trust that the Charities Act 2009 will address governance and management issues in that regard.  It is estimated that Ireland has approximately 7,000 charities, which contribute approximately &euro;500 million each year to worthy causes.  Every Senator present knows of charities and organisations in every parish and town throughout the country, from Tidy Towns to residents and sports groups.  We are very fortunate to have so many.</p> <p>Many of these bodies have expressed to me a difficulty with the amount of red tape and management that are necessary if even a simple residents' association is to conduct its business.  Some struggle for funding sufficient to cover their annual insurance costs.  In many cases, red tape is acting as a deterrent.  They have voiced their frustration in this regard.  In most groups or organisations, it is just one or two people who are putting their shoulders to the wheel.  Only for them, our society would be lost.  I do not know whether anything can be done to assist such small organisations in terms of the administration and governance tasks that are rightly required of them, but perhaps we might examine the matter.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to determine whether they can be given assistance?</p></speech>

I will defend the right of every person in the Chamber to speak, be it scripted or unscripted.  Most right-minded Senators would agree with that.</p> <p>I understand Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's concerns for the longer term and agree with him on the area-based childhood, ABC, school programmes.  Early intervention is important.  The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, the second free preschool year and the special needs package that were put in place will help in that regard, but other initiatives are required.  We all acknowledge that an immediate law enforcement response is necessary.  It is not an either/or situation.</p> <p>Senator Feighan mentioned Brexit, which I have touched on previously.  I agree that there will be opportunities, but I will remind him that there is plenty of capacity in Fingal.</p> <p>I wish to raise a serious issue that has exercised many of my constituents and many others around the country, namely, the fact that Tusla has a guideline to the effect that there should not be 40 years or more between a prospective adoptive parent and the child he or she is adopting.  This is out of date and comes from a different era.  It is incensing, insulting and offensive to many people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am sure there are people of my vintage in this room who have siblings whose mother was over 40 years, certainly I have, when they were born.  I know that many women are leaving childbirth to later for one reason or another.  This morning, I spoke to the Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street and was informed that there has been an increase from 3% to 7% of births in the hospital to women over 40 years of age.  What are we saying?  As Senator Swanick will know, GPs can now work until they are 72 years of age in General Medical Services, GMS.  Why have this guideline in place?  It is antiquated and out of date.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to discuss this matter.  I am sure she will have heard about it this morning and will take the opportunity to get Tusla to review the guideline.  Perhaps we will have a more satisfactory situation than we currently have at the moment.  Most people now live a different life and have much better longevity that is associated with living in this country.  Therefore, it seems utterly unreasonable to have such a guideline in place.  Many people who are parents of children who are more than 40 years younger than them find the guideline offensive.</p></speech>

Its recommendation is nothing short of disgraceful.  Key sectors of the economy where low pay and precarious work is widespread, such as retail and hospitality sectors, are experiencing unprecedented economic growth.  This morning, I heard somebody from IBEC on the radio say that while IBEC believes in the minimum wage it does not consider that now is the right time for an increase.  This is at a time when activity in the hotel sector is up by somewhere around 30% but IBEC has deemed now not to be the right time for the lowest paid people in society to receive a pay increase.</p> <p>If one accounts for inflation, which is between 1.7% and 2.2%, the proposed 10 cent increase would mean workers earning the minimum wage will suffer a pay cut.  I ask Senators to think about that situation.  After all the talk by this new Government about new politics and fairness, the lowest paid workers in society face a cut in the real value of their pay.  It is striking that the Low Pay Commission's trade union representative felt it necessary to issue a minority report, as did the Migrant Rights Centre, where they were critical of the report's recommendations.  They noted the Low Pay Commission's failure to apply parity of esteem to the competing interests of workers and business.  They said that the persistence of this approach would be a serious challenge to the work of the Low Pay Commission going forward.  Indeed, this disgraceful proposal underlines why it is important for all workers to be members of trade unions.  Ultimately, it is through collective bargaining with their employers that workers will most likely achieve payment of a living wage, as well as other key benefits such as sick pay, pensions and security of hours.  </p> <p>The latest report calls into question the usefulness of the Low Pay Commission about which my party has always had serious reservations.  It is too easy for the Members on the Government side to shrug their shoulders and say the commission has made its recommendation.  I accept that there were good intentions behind the establishment of the commission but issues of low pay, in-work poverty and labour market inequality belong in the political arena.  They have societal wide consequences that are far too important to be relegated to a commission that is comprised of 12 people who meet now and again.  I call on the Minister to reject the recommendation and instead make the first in a series of step increases towards a living wage figure of &euro;11.50 per hour.  I ask him to set out concrete steps to end the scandal of poverty pay in this country.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to attend the House at the earliest opportunity when we reconvene to debate the issue of low pay. </p></speech>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to attend the House at the beginning of the next session to debate and discuss, in a detailed manner, how to direct help at the smaller dairy farmers and help them survive the present situation.  We must parallel that effort with looking at international markets and seeing where to establish new markets.  I do not think that we have fully exploited the Chinese market yet.  I talked to people from Taiwan the other day who also have tremendous potential to accept more product from us, and the same applies to a number of countries.</p> <p>We must examine the whole market in question in order to overcome the problem in commodity pricing in the dairy sector.  The problem affects a lot of dairy farmers in Cavan, Monaghan and throughout the country.  The pricing problem will spread to the beef sector shortly.  All of which makes this is a very serious problem.  I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's indulgence.  I wish to say to the Leader that I would like to know that we will act on the agricultural pricing crisis shortly.</p></speech>

The sector is an important part of the education system, yet it continues to be under-funded.  </p> <p>I commend my colleague, Senator Swanick, for his Commencement matter this morning on parking charges at general hospitals and other hospitals.

Senator O'Reilly mentioned the beef trade and Senator Feighan mentioned investment.  I would like to make two points.  First, as I mentioned before to the Leader, we need deeper and stronger debates on the impact Brexit will have on the Irish economy.

It is a wise decision.  It would not be smart for a country that has indicated it will leave the Union to hold the Presidency while the most important negotiations take place.  It is vital that another member state steps up to the plate and takes over the Presidency.  I call on the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to put it to the European Council that Ireland is willing to be at the heart of Europe again in 2017 and is willing to take on the European Presidency.  We did an outstanding job hosting the Presidency in 2013.  It was a huge boost to the Irish economy and Ireland's standing within EU politics.  We have had great successes during previous Presidencies when we oversaw German reunification, the accession of ten new member states in 2004 and agreed the multi-annual financial framework in 2013.</p> <p>Crucially, the next two rotations of the Presidency of the European Council are by two new member states.  After the UK was due to hold the President it was meant to be two new member states.  Therefore, it is vital that an experienced proven member state, that is also sympathetic to the ongoing Brexit debate, steps up to the plate and takes on the Presidency.  I repeat my call for the Taoiseach to offer Ireland to hold the Presidency in this case. </p></speech>

However, we were disappointed to hear this month of the closure of Cinemobile in Galway.  It was a powerful resource over the past 16 years.  It brought a mobile cinema experience to community projects, festivals and schools across the island, North and South.  The board of  Cinemobile took significant steps to increase commercial revenue to fill the gaps left by constant erosion of public funding but these did not prove sufficient.  It was a small one-of-a-kind, not-for-profit organisation that brought the magic of cinema to communities across Ireland.  Compare the benefits of Netflix to the benefits of communal viewing on social occasions.  The National Theatre of Scotland has an innovative model of theatre without walls.  The Scottish equivalent of the Abbey Theatre does not have a permanent public space and the result is a more democratic form of art, a greater outreach and a more diverse experience for its society.  Bringing art outside the confines of four sterile walls can lead to public art in phone boxes, at bus stops, in gardens, in schools and in community centres.  For the past 16 years, Cinemobile did just that and guaranteed a diverse experience for our society.  I commend the founders of that not-for-profit organisation on their work during the past 16 years.</p><p>Am I out of time?</p></speech>

It does not make for very good reading.  It suggests a potential conflict of interest on the part of the former CEO, Mr. Bill Maher, who has now gone.  At this juncture, the chairman at the Saolta group is operating on an acting basis.  The Minister needs to appoint a chairman immediately to deal with this situation, which gives rise to considerable concern, particularly in view of the fact that not so long ago the then chairman, Mr. Noel Daly, resigned in similar circumstances.  This is not the first time the Saolta group has been rocked by this type of situation.  The current thinking is that businessmen should head up all sorts of public authorities such as Saolta and other Government agencies.  With the old health boards presided over by politicians, this sort of conflict of interest did not arise and it was not an issue that came to the fore.  We may need to reconsider what politicians can or cannot do.  I ask that the Minister move immediately to appoint a formal chairman as the person there at present is filling the role on an acting basis.</p></speech>

Democratic accountability in the HSE is at an all-time low.  The old health board system had democratic accountability.  The current forums do not represent democratic accountability.  Major issues are emerging across the HSE budget which are very often beyond scrutiny.  The Minister should consider beefing up the health forums to give democratic accountability to locally elected representatives to sit on those forums and to hold the executive to account.  Currently, that is not happening.  The consensus among local authority members is that the forums are just talking shops.  We need to beef up the democratic accountability to which reference has been made.</p> <p>Ba mhaith liom d&aacute; dtiocfadh an tAire St&aacute;it le freagracht as an nGaeltacht isteach anseo go luath agus is f&eacute;idir tar &eacute;is sos an tsamhraidh chun d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a bheith againn ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta ar l&aacute; amh&aacute;in.

I have received calls from individuals who are stranded abroad.  One couple left their hotel yesterday morning to go to the beach.  When they returned, their belongings were in the hotel room but they did not have access because the Lowcostholidays did not pay for the accommodation.  There are major issues arising.  To be fair, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the banks seem to be co-operating.  However, there is a bigger issue with the regulation of cheap holiday companies such Lowcostholidays, which went into administration at 4.30 p.m. on Friday last but which was still taking bookings at 4 p.m. that day.  There are questions to be asked and the Consumer Protection Agencies should be required to forewarn customers when companies are in financial difficulty, if that were allowed.  It may require change to the legislation but it should be considered.</p></speech>

We want people to feel comfortable in contributing in whatever way - either with or without a script.  I am sure I could easily be attacked for saying things off the cuff simply because I do not consult a script.  I was disappointed with the Father of the House making such an intervention.  I have a very high regard for him and I ask him to reflect on his comments.</p> <p>Flooding affects many people and in recent years has affected many of our communities, particularly in County Clare, which were devastated in 2014 as a result of the significant storm damage and flooding caused.  Similarly, last year a number of estates in south-east Clare were affected by severe flooding, as were other places, including Roscommon, Athlone, Galway and so forth.  It is important to keep the issue on the agenda of the House.  In September or October when we are back here, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to the House to give us an update on the Government's work programme on flooding.</p></speech>

I defend the right of Senators to raise any matters they want on the Order of Business and to do so in whatever manner they feel appropriate.  Senator Ardagh has always been very gracious on the Order of Business and she does not try to score political points.  She has a dual task of representing her party and representing her local area.  She is entitled, as are the rest of us, to raise any matter.  How we do so is up to us.  The father of the House should consider this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some of us are new in the House, while others are new to the Oireachtas.  It is a matter of finding one's feet.  We are all learning and I make mistakes every day of the week.  In fairness to Senator Catherine Ardagh, therefore, I defend her right to do her job as best she can.  She has been a very willing partner with other leaders in managing the business of the House, for which I thank everyone, during this term.  I will be very happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue she raised about people with a disability and accommodation.  If she wants to raise it as a Commencement matter, she can.</p><p>I commend Senator Billy Lawless and thank the Cathaoirleach for his graciousness to him.  It is a wonderful day.  Cuirim m&oacute;r f&aacute;ilte roimh an Seanad&oacute;ir nua.  He represents not just the diaspora but all of us in the House.  We are very happy to have him here and I look forward to the contribution he will make.  We wish him well following his hip replacement operation.  He has certainly not lost his zeal for life after it.  We should all reflect on his remarks and how we can work to bring our emigrants home, as well as on how to bring investment to the country.  I look forward to working with him in that regard.</p><p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised an important and sensitive issue about a person named Mary.  If she wants to give me the details, I will happily give them to the Minister.  However, we should be careful in the language we use in referring to premature deaths because, as we all know from our work, it is a sensitive issue.  There is increased funding in the budgets and there are more GPs than ever before.  There is greater access to primary care services and we are moving towards having a universal health care system.  As I said, if the Senator gives me the information, I will be happy to bring it to the Minister's attention for her.</p><p>Senator Frances Black raised the issue of accommodation and housing.  We will have the Minister in the House this evening for statements on the subject.  </p><p>Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in referred to the inner city which the Taoiseach is visiting today.  The Taoiseach has established a task force and a working group.  I agree that it is imperative that we empower people through education and training, by finding them jobs and investment in their local areas.  I agree with the Senator completely that we must give people the tools and skills to live an alternative life to the one some of them are living.  It is most important to have people in work.</p><p>Senator John O'Mahony raised the issue of pay-per-view and the availability of Gaelic games, in particular, but also other sports which it was important to make available on free-to-air and terrestrial television services.  I would be happy to have both the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, come to the House to discuss the issue.  </p><p>Senator Keith Swanick referred to autism services.  If he wants to give me the details of the particular case mentioned, I will provide them for the Minister responsible.  I am surprised by the remarks made because the last Government increased the funding for speech and language therapy services.  Speech and language and occupational therapists have been recruited and we have a plan to deal with people with disabilities, particularly young people and those with autism.</p><p>To respond to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, I would love to see a cross-party group come together in the Seanad to promote sport and its importance in all of our lives.  I will certainly invite the relevant Minister to the House to discuss the issue.  We all join in wishing our sports stars, including our athletes, boxers and other Olympians, every success in Rio de Janeiro.  It will be an extraordinary opportunity for us as a nation to showcase our sports heroes.  I wish each and every one of them every success.  I had the privilege of being at the Olympic Games at Atlanta.  It is a fantastic feeling to watch an Irish athlete compete and almost win a medal.  To see someone in the green jersey do so well gives us a great sense of pride.  I also wish our Paralympians well this year because sport unites us, as we saw at the European championships.  Sport and its benefits are important and I hope to arrange the debate in the autumn.</p><p>Senator Frank Feighan raised the issue of Brexit and the potential in that regard.  I will come back to the points made by Senator Neale Richmond, but it is an important issue that we must look at again.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell made the point that we could play a role.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might discuss the matter.  </p><p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the important issue of the charities sector and highlighted the anomaly in it regulation in the sense that things are becoming more and more bureaucratic for residents' associations, sports clubs and charity organisations in terms of red tape and bureaucracy.  While we all want to see regulation, it makes life more difficult for small, voluntary groups.  I hope we can see the matter being rectified in time.</p><p>Senator James Reilly referred to Tusla.  I agree with him on the issue of guidelines.  At a time when more and more people are having children later in life and presenting to become adoptive parents, the guidelines need to be looked at.  I will certainly address the Senator's request for the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to come to the House to discuss the issue.  </p><p>Senator Paul Gavan referred to the Low Pay Commission and the report published yesterday.  The balance we have to strike is between the employer and the employee and maintaining competitiveness and increasing the number of jobs while ensuring people have a decent income.  The recommendations made by the commission are independent of the Government.  There was a wide variety of people involved in the commission.</p></speech>

It considered a wide variety of data before reaching recommendations.  I was not part of it.  I certainly want to see people have a decent wage, but I also want to see the country open for business and being competitive.  That is the balance we must strike.</p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson raised the critically important issue of Youthreach.  I commend him for his work in the area.  He has been a very strong advocate and innovative when it comes to further education for young people.  As a former director of adult education, I agree that Youthreach is something we must continue to pursue and fund adequately.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue.</p> <p>Senator Neale Richmon, as always, made a timely and important contribution on Brexit, as well as on the Presidency of the European Union in 2017.  I agree with him that it would be a huge honour, given the way in which the country performed when it last held the Presidency, to have it bestowed on us again.  I will certainly take up the matter with the relevant Minister.  I hope I speak for the House in saying it is our view that the Taoiseach should make the case in Brussels for Ireland to fill the vacancy in 2017.</p> <p>Senator Fintan Warfield referred to Galway and the arts.  We wish it well as capital of culture.  As a member of Cork City Council when that city held the honour, I note that it is not only a great opportunity for the arts but also the wider city.  I take on board the Senator's about the Film Board and funding and will ask the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come to the House to discuss the issue.  I am not sure why the Cinemobile has been removed.  If the Senator gives me the details, I will forward them to the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Michelle Mulherin referred to the ongoing issues for the Saolte health group.  I will be happy to take up the matter with the Minister for Health and to have him come to the House to discuss it.  </p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of HSE accountability.  As a former member of the HSE forum, I agree fully with him that such fora are complete talking shops.  I remind him, however, that it was his party leader who, as Minister, got rid of political democracy in HSE fora.  I am not being political, but it was a huge mistake.  There is no accountability and the forums are just talking shops as a result.  They let the executive away with a great deal.  No mandate is provided for public representatives to question it and hold it to account.  I will be happy to support him if there is anything we can do to make it happen in a different way.  That is part of the problem.  To be fair, there are very good people working in the HSE, including many strong and vibrant managers, but they need to be held to account, either at local level, on a quarterly basis at the Oireachtas committee or before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I strongly believe the local dimension in the old health boards is missing.  We need to go back to that model.  I will be happy to pursue the matter with the Senator.</p> <p>T&aacute; an suim ag an Aire St&aacute;it teacht chuig an Teach sin tar &eacute;is na laethanta saoire le haghaidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar an teanga, an strait&eacute;is agus cursa&iacute; Gaeltachta.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, is willing to come to the House.  We had hoped to bring him here before the summer recess, but, unfortunately, the legislative programme in the Houses precluded him from coming.  </p> <p>Senator Martin Conway raised the wider issue of flooding, not just in County Clare, to which he rightly referred, but also in many other parts of the country.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canny, about the matter and he is willing to come to the House at a later stage to discuss it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we have an update on the plans put in place since the flooding of last year and earlier this year.

We all know the background to this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What I and the Government are trying to do is to create a space and a window of opportunity for a discussion, the input of experts and recommendations to come through an expert commission to an Oireachtas committee.  That can then allow us, in nine months time, to make a democratic decision as to how we want to pay for domestic water supply and the treatment of wastewater from households.  We have had a lot of heat politically on this issue in Ireland for the last two to three years and people have taken very hardline positions on both sides of this argument.  Whoever is in government in three, five or ten years time will have an obligation to ensure we are improving our water infrastructure nationally.  We have a disgracefully bad infrastructure at present whereby nearly half of all the water leaks through the pipes before it gets to its destination and many households have been on boil-water notices for long periods.</p><p>There has been a decision, which I think is now accepted by most, that moving away from 34 - it is now 31 - different local authorities all doing their own thing on water, and moving towards a single utility model, makes sense.  The Government is now putting a process in place to decide how we pay for that, whether that be through general taxation, as some would argue, through a cost recovery model where individual homes pay the full cost of delivering and treating water from their homes, or through some blending of the two, reflecting important issues like ability to pay but, at the same time, ensuring we have incentives around water conservation, better water management and putting a value on the cost of delivering and managing water and wastewater.</p><p>The expert commission is a group of very well qualified people.  We took advice in regard to the skillset we should get and the number of commission members there should be from abroad and at home, and we acted on that advice.  We had a setback in regard to the first chair but that has now been corrected and I am confident the new chair will do a very competent job.  When the commission reports back in five months time, it will then be up to the political system to decide to respond to the recommendations in that report.  That will initially be through a special Oireachtas committee that will be set up, and in which I am sure the Seanad will have an involvement.  Then, after about three months, that committee will bring recommendations to the political system - to the D&aacute;il initially - in order to have a debate and vote on what our international obligations are and how we respond to those.  There are also key issues around whether we can create political consensus on something on which, as with other fundamental resources we have to provide to homes and people, we should try to get more political consensus than we have been able to get in the past.</p><p>Some people have taken a purist view on this.  I know the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, took a very hard line and this was the wrong thing to do.  We are living in a new political reality.  We had to make choices and the choice was this: either we put a process in place that could get majority political support and will, hopefully, result in a sustainable political outcome in terms of how we pay for water, or people just stay in their corner and hold their lines.  Both Irish Water and water charges would have been abolished after the election in the political heat of that debate.  I believe that would have been a massive setback for both water infrastructure and the approach to water on which we need to have a mature and informed debate.</p><p>This legislation simply suspends water charges and all matters relating to that for nine months.  That nine-month period can be extended if the committee asks for more time or if the Minister thinks more time is needed for the process.  It will not be suspended just to be politically convenient in terms of extending for another two years, out past the next election - that is not what this facility is about.  At some point in the next nine months, or maybe slightly later than that, if necessary, we will be faced with an important democratic decision that the Government will facilitate and the D&aacute;il and Seanad will debate and decide on.  I look forward to that process concluding and I hope we will be able to make decisions that make sense and can find acceptance across communities and will also respect the international obligations we have made around the water framework directive and other commitments.</p><p>Most importantly, I hope we can have a sustainable outcome to the water debates that communities and the political system can accept is the right way forward, and that we can get on with actually financing and fixing the infrastructure that is needed to be able to provide safe water for families and their homes into the future.  Once again, I thank Senators for their timely and speedy consideration of this legislation.  We will enact it now and get on with the process.</p></speech>

I am representing my colleague, Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, who cannot be present today as she is at another engagement.  She sends her apologies.</p> <p>I welcome the suspension of water charges for a period of nine months.  I welcome this legislation providing for the expert commission to look into the whole area of water charges and how we are going to pay for water, because we have to pay for water.  As the Minister said, coming to a consensus as to how we do that is what this project is all about.  Unfortunately, it is not going to be an easy task because the vast majority of the representatives in the Lower House are against the manner in which water charges were to be introduced.  The whole concept has been badly handled from the outset, as I believe everybody will agree.  The then Minister, Mr. Hogan, made a hames of it.  The former Minister, Deputy Kelly, was thrown in at the deep end when the mess was created and, in fairness, tried his best.  Now, the baton has been passed to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I wish him well with his endeavours in this regard.</p> <p>I am in favour of water charges but my party policy, with which I am in total agreement, is that the infrastructure should be in place before any charges are made.  However, we are where we are.  I wish this project well and I hope it works.  With regard to political consensus, no matter how logically the case is made, there are some people who will not accept it because it is not in their political interest to do so.  That is another reality.  From my party's perspective, we hope a reasonable proposition can be made by this expert commission.</p> <p>I was sorry that Joe O'Toole, a former colleague in this House, had to step down.  He is an excellent, capable and competent person.  It is important to put on the record that he was not to be paid for doing that job, so if some people think he is losing out financially he is not.  I wish him well in the future.  I wish this legislation speedy passage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-20a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072000002#P00300"><p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for outlining the rationale behind what is essential legislation.  As I outlined in the debate last week, it is legislation that was formulated to facilitate Government formation due to the make-up of the political parties and the political will in the Lower House and this House also.</p> <p>I want to reiterate my concerns with regard to the future of Irish Water.  I feel this is something that was capitalised on to a large degree in the last general election for populist reasons by many political parties.  It is a political issue, I have no doubt, but it also a societal issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope this legislation will now give the necessary space, as the Minister has said, for mature debate on the requirements of the country, society and citizens as well as the need for quality water infrastructure in the country for the years ahead.  We need to have a sustainable system that provides quality drinking water and treated water that does not pollute our rivers and bays.  We need to ensure we do not have concerns around capacity in our major urban environments.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh relayed some of the things that have gone wrong in Connemara.  In my area in Waterford, contamination occurs and people cannot drink the public water supply.  When that happens, the people hold their politicians to account and hold the system to account.  It is not a question of if things go wrong but when things go wrong with our water networks.  If we cannot point to the responsible actions of investment, the same populist politicians calling for abolition of charges will have to be held to account.</p><p>I wish the Bill well and in particular I wish the independent expert commission well.  Those involved will now undertake an important body of work.  I mean no disrespect to the politicians in this Chamber or others but I genuinely believe there is more mature debate in many of our primary schools and among our children on sustainability in our water network than we have seen in the public discourse during the past year or two.  I honestly mean that.  We could learn more about sustainability and the need for a quality water network in the green schools in our country than from many of the popular notions we have heard in the public discourse in recent weeks.</p><p>The Bill will suspend charges for nine months to allow space and I accept that.  I have concerns that this is a retrograde step, but let us give it space.  I encourage all political parties to be responsible in their engagement and propositions.  Ultimately, someone has to pay for this quality network.  This will have to happen through the polluter pays principle, something we have agreed with our EU partners.  We have Water Framework Directive responsibilities that we cannot abdicate, ignore or neglect.  There are issues around the EU derogation as well.</p><p>I sincerely hope we can reach outcomes that the majority can live with and that can sustain our networks in future.  Essentially, if consumers are not paying, it will fall back on the taxpayer again.  It will fall back on those in the squeezed middle we often refer to.  They are working people and PAYE workers.  Some may think they will have a lesser charge because these charges are being suspended, but in fact PAYE workers will be paying far more in trying to sustain a network that literally has failed in recent years.</p><p>We need to grasp this nettle once and for all.  I look forward to engaging in the debate in the coming months and I encourage others to do so as well.  I thank the Minister for outlining the rationale and I wish the Bill well.  I sincerely hope that at the end of this process the majority can agree at least that we will invest in our water network in a sustainable way for the future.</p></speech>

I remember eight or nine years ago when the cryptosporidium problem occurred and there was no drinking water in Galway for four or five months in a city that depends on tourism.</p> <p>Since The Gathering tourism has increased by 15% year on year.  A visitor cannot even get a room in Dublin anymore.  Tourism is valuable and we must have a proper water system to support it.  I remember farming 30 years ago down around Tuam.  All those areas had their own group schemes.  People were paying far more than &euro;3 per week.</p> <p>We must have water and proper water systems if we want tourism to increase, and that is happening now.  We have been lucky in recent months and I hope it stays that way with regard to terrorism.  Anyway, Ireland is a sought-out place and we have to have proper infrastructure and water for our people and for when our tourists come.</p></speech>

We all know this legislation is a kick to touch to save face for Fianna F&aacute;il in light of the extraordinary public mobilisation on water charges.  Fianna F&aacute;il needed to kick this issue to touch politically for nine months to try to rejuvenate itself.  It is clear, even from the statements this morning, where Fianna F&aacute;il stands on water charges.</p> <p>We have heard a great deal of talk about the new politics in these Houses as well as the need to respect the mandate and the need to put a Government together.  I put it to those in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that if they really believed in that, then they would have put the issue of water charges to a vote in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Maybe it would have been defeated, but surely that would have been part of the new mandate as well.</p></speech>

We will support any mobilisation and any campaigns of the Right2Water movement to try to refocus political minds on what we regard as very unfair water charges and the unfair implementation of water charges.</p> <p>The elephant in the room has to be the shambles that is Irish Water.  I do not believe anyone in the Chamber could stand over the way Irish Water has functioned since it was set up.  I note that in Connemara people are having water meters installed again.  It started again last week.  They are angry because water pipes are leaking and they have not been fixed.  Other water pipes have not been buried, etc., yet, there seems to be plenty of money to continue with the water metering system.</p> <p>There are major issues around Irish Water and that needs to be tackled as well.  We have made these points on the record and we will continue to do so.  It is with reticence that we support the Bill.  We do so merely since it takes the pressure off stretched citizens.  However, no one should be under any illusions: this is the new politics of Fianna F&aacute;il forcing Fine Gael to put this legislation to the Houses in order that they can kick to touch politically.  They have succeeded in doing that.</p></speech>

I know he has had a busy week.  I welcome the proposed suspension of water charges in this Bill.  It is clear that the people are not going to accept water charges.  They have shown this through the major demonstrations on the streets to oppose this unfair tax.  The recent figures from Irish Water show a significant drop in the number of people paying water bills.  This number will grow as people realise that these charges will eventually have to be scrapped, irrespective of the findings of the expert commission.</p> <p>The majority of Deputies returned at the last general election were against the imposition of water charges and were for the abolition of Irish Water.  I believe that a vote by democratically-elected representatives would be the best way to solve this issue.  We need to find a way to use our current funds to make up for the under-investment by previous Governments.  Let us look for opportunities to reduce waste throughout public services.  Let us reduce our reliance on outside consultants and agencies and let us provide a water service that our citizens deserve.  It is of the utmost importance that a referendum is held to ensure that water remains in public ownership.</p> <p>I live in inner city Dublin in the Liberties.  People stop me on the street.  One of their fears is that even though the cost of water may be only &euro;3 per week, the reality is that people have to pay for extras and it is all too much.  The cost of going back to school is extraordinary, including books, uniforms, etc.  There is widespread fear of the company going into privatisation.  It can be rather daunting to have extra payments on top of everything else.</p> <p>We charged for water in the past through central taxation.  In charging for water we have a duty to deliver it for the people.  I hope the water commission will find alternatives for us to the current regime, but I look forward to the day when we have a vote on water charges.  I said it last week and I will say it again: I will be standing with the thousands of families throughout the country.  I will be opposing extra water charges.  It is awful for people who cannot afford it.  In this context I am supporting the Water Services (Amendment) Bill.</p></speech>

That meeting is to be held tonight and I welcome the fact that the Minister agreed to it before the summer recess.</p><p>I do not envy the Minister his task on this issue.  I sat in this House with the former Minister of State, Senator Coffey, in the dark hours of long nights in the middle of winter debating water services.  We went through the issue, heard the views across the House and heard the views of the people.  We witnessed the opposition to it but we saw the process being completed with the establishment of Irish Water.  Our party stood by it.  I believe Senator Coffey used the word "cannibalised" when referring to the election.  Perhaps he did not, but that is what I heard.  If he did, I agree with him.  When I canvassed on behalf of Deputy Alan Kelly we witnessed the same event, day after day.  Much of it was not to do with water but with other political agendas.  As Senator Coffey knows, I know Waterford very well after having worked there for 13 years.  I could name some of the people who were involved in stirring this up.</p><p>I respect the fact that people are opposed to paying for water.  However, consider the figures for payment that Irish Water had reached before the discussions on the formation of a Government.  They had reached over 60%.  There was a reluctant acceptance that people had to pay for water in order to improve the infrastructure and to ensure that there would be a good quality supply, as was mentioned earlier in the discussion.  However, where are we now?  We have stopped the process, which is why I do not envy the Minister his task.  That was the price of forming the Government.  I envisage positions hardening further in the nine months of this process, rather than people coming together.  Unfortunately, what I hear from people who are opposed to water charges is that they will be ready in nine months' time to oppose them again.</p><p>To sum up, we went through a process and reached the other end of it.  We started issuing bills and reached a rate of more than 60% for payment.  Then we stopped the train, put it into reverse and now we are stalling it in the station for nine months.  That is not good enough.  I wish the Minister and the commission well.  Perhaps they will reach a meeting of minds but, as has been said already, the current Houses of Oireachtas would vote against water charges if a vote was put to them.  That is the final arbiter on this issue, and we will arrive at that point nine months hence, two years hence or at the next general election.  Some people were telling the electorate to pay for water but when there was a by-election in Tallaght and the result went the other way, they started telling people not to pay for it and said they would not pay for it themselves.  That is the populist politics we are dealing with, as Senator Coffey mentioned earlier.  Politicians of certain views, colour and political persuasion will tell the electorate anything it wishes to hear to get votes, knowing that they will not go into power to carry out what they promised.  They refuse to go into power.  Confronted with such a situation I say to the Minister, for the third time, that I do not envy him his task, but I wish him well with it.</p></speech>

It is the Government's new action plan for housing and homelessness.  This is a very significant effort by the Government to start a process by which, in time, it will fix a broken property market and respond more effectively to the needs of very vulnerable people who find themselves homeless and to the complexity of those needs.  We will start and deliver a dramatic increase in the building of social housing and we will make a big impact on the private sector in terms of getting enough houses of the right quality and at affordable prices built in the right places.  This will create some normality in the property and housing market in Ireland.</p> <p>There is no need to tell people that there is both a broken rental market and a broken housing market.  Last year, approximately 12,600 houses were built.  A total of 6,000 of those were one-off houses across the countryside.  Of the other 6,000, a large portion were from finishing out unfinished housing estates or unfinished apartment complexes.  A relatively small percentage of the total were new builds that started in the last couple of years.  The extent of the challenge we face is significant in terms of getting to a point where we are building approximately 30,000 housing units per year, which is what Ireland needs.  We must increase, quite dramatically, the percentage of social housing built as part of those 30,000 housing units.  We have committed &euro;5.5 billion of public money from now to the end of 2021.  A sum of &euro;200 million from that will be in an infrastructure fund which will enable us to open up sites that are currently not moving to construction because of added infrastructure costs and so forth, which developers must shoulder and therefore cannot make the margin they believe they need to be able to progress with the project.  However, &euro;5.35 billion is for directly providing 47,000 social housing units.</p> <p>From my perspective, that is the heart of this plan.  Ireland's overall housing mix has 7% to 8% social housing, which is a long way behind Europe where the average is approximately 17%.  There has been an over-emphasis on reliance on the private sector to deliver for social housing need in Ireland through rent supplement, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  When the rental market gets really squeezed as it is at present, where we simply do not have enough housing units in that market and rents are being driven up, it causes huge pressures on vulnerable low-income families and drives them out of rental accommodation.  It is also causing a steady increase in homelessness each week, be it individual rough sleepers or families who are homeless.  The State requires a more co-ordinated and determined response to that, with a sense of urgency, which I intend to provide, and the financial backing on which the Government has signed off.  I believe the outcomes over time will dramatically improve the outcomes for the many families who find themselves in pressurised situations.</p> <p>The plan we have put together has five pillars.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While it is not the perfect solution and does not provide all the answers, it is a significant step in the right direction.  Other measures will be added to the plan as we move forward.  At budget time, for example, a tax package will be introduced specifically to support first-time buyers who are seeking to buy new homes.  This will provide an incentive to developers to build more new homes for first-time buyers.  This type of home is not being built in the quantities or at the price needed because many developers have concluded that first-timer buyers cannot afford to buy homes at the price builders can afford to build them.  I will return to the issue of first-time buyers in a moment. </p><p>We are starting this overall plan with five pillars and it is not an accident that homelessness is the first chapter or pillar.  I will not stand over the current circumstances in which hundreds of families are living for long periods in hotel and bed and breakfast emergency accommodation.  This is not acceptable in a decent society and we will change it.  For this reason, I have stated that within 12 months, we will no longer use hotel accommodation other than in exceptional circumstances and for small numbers of people.  We must provide more sustainable homes, even if these are provided on a temporary basis.  Children are growing up in hotel rooms without a kitchen or play room and with insufficient space.  They are sleeping every night in the same bed as their parents who have to take them outside to walk around the city for exercise or to try to find a playground and bring them to and from school.  This is not how a state should look after its children and, as I stated, we will change this.  While this will take some time, I am determined to change the position and I hope many others will help me do so. </p><p>In my political lifetime, family homelessness has never been the significant issue it is today, although we have often dealt with and discussed homelessness among individuals who were sleeping rough and so on.  The solution to family homelessness is simple, namely, we must find housing units for most of the affected families.  While some have challenges caused by family breakdown or mental health issues and require additional supports, the majority of the families concerned simply need a house or housing unit.  We need to address this issue by expanding the rapid building house programme.  The programme will be trebled in terms of ambition from building 500 units to building 1,500 units.  We will force this issue and achieve this target. </p><p>We are also allocating &euro;70 million to the Housing Agency to start a purchase programme for vacant properties.  Homeless families will be prioritised in using some of these acquisitions and, over time, the agency will be geared up to purchase approximately 1,600 houses.  </p><p>We are also examining the provision of additional supports for homeless families.  I have been working with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, a former Senator, to produce more targeted and effective support programmes.  We have, for example, signed off on free use of the public transport system for homeless families.  We will also introduce nutrition and health programmes, ensure children attend school and receive the education they need and provide the supports children and families living in emergency accommodation require.</p><p>This is not aspirational stuff.  We have agreed to provide the Health Service Executive with a significant increase in its funding for homeless people.  This year, the HSE has a &euro;2 million fund for providing supports to homeless people.  This figure will treble to &euro;6 million next year.  We also have an agreement with the HSE to work with a service provider which is seeking planning permission for a large addiction detoxification facility in the inner city.  We have agreed that the HSE will staff the facility once it has been built at a cost of approximately &euro;2.25 million per annum.  The HSE contribution for homeless services could, therefore, increase from &euro;2 million this year to &euro;8.25 million within a few years.  This will ensure we are not simply focused on trying to find housing units for people but also trying to rebuild their lives in terms of helping them to take on the challenges they face, whether they are medical, mental health or addiction problems or a combination thereof.  This is the least vulnerable people, many of whom are fighting for their very survival, can expect from their Government.  </p><p>We are also trying to build on what works.  It is planned to provide 100 housing units in Dublin under the successful Housing First model.  I understand 54 of these 100 units have been provided so far this year and we intend to treble the target to 300 next year because we know this model works.  In simple terms, this means providing a person who is experiencing troubles or difficulties with a house first and subsequently developing infrastructure and a support system around the person and making these supports work in helping him or her to rebuild his or her life.  Having the stability afforded by a home dramatically increases the likelihood of success and while this approach gives rise to social challenges, for example, objections from communities that do not like it, this is what we are endeavouring to do. </p><p>In terms of the response to homelessness, we want to end our reliance on hotels for homeless families within 12 months.  We also want to increase the support services provided by the Health Service Executive in the areas of primary health care, addiction and mental health and to respond to many other physical and medical challenges faced by rough sleepers who face uncertainty night after night.  Some of them must make a telephone call at 10.30 p.m. to try to get into a hostel such as the Br&uacute; Aimsir facility.  We must also ensure sufficient emergency accommodation is in place before winter.</p><p>Last night, we released the figures on homelessness for June.  While the increase in numbers has not been at the same pace as it was some months ago, the number of homeless people continues to increase and the figures are stark when compared with last year.</p><p>There is a determination in the action plan to try to respond to, address and work with people who find themselves homeless to secure much better outcomes for themselves and their families.  We also want to avoid people becoming homeless in the first instance by providing new supports for people in mortgage arrears and relaunching the mortgage-to-rent scheme, which has not worked for the numbers expected and must be rethought.</p><p>Social housing is the second pillar of the plan.  Last year, all of the local authorities combined built 72 social houses.  While they acquired many more housing units and brought approximately 3,500 voids into use, which was a major success, we are in the ha'penny place in terms of where we need to be in building new units managed by local authorities.  We will change this.  We have already provided many more staff to enable local authorities to gear up for the new approach.  We now need to deliver, which means working in partnership with local authorities, rather than having me beat them with a stick.  Partnership must take the form of project management to ensure projects are completed and the streamlining of decision making processes.  We have sufficient money to do this in a substantial way. </p><p>We have set a target of having 47,000 social houses built by the end of 2021 and &euro;5.3 billion has been committed to achieving it.  This is a significant portion of the resources available to the Government and a signal of intent that this issue is our No. 1 priority.  We will also rely on and work with the National Treasury Management Agency to try to create off-balance sheet funding mechanisms to deliver significantly more social housing.  Of the 47,000 social houses we want to build, approximately 5,000 will be delivered by a NTMA backed vehicle that will fund, in the main, approved housing bodies to build or purchase social housing.  We could significantly increase the figure of 5,000 if this approach works and EUROSTAT and the European Commission confirm that the funding for it is considered off-balance sheet.</p><p>While the establishment of a housing delivery office sounds like a classic political solution to a problem, in this case, the position is different.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some people have said we should set up a housing authority separate from the Department.  I think we would spend the next 12 or 18 months trying to do that and trying to get it right.  I am hand-picking and head-hunting the most talented people I can find.  They will be put in a wing of the Custom House, where they will work as project managers.  They will have autonomy in my Department.  Some of them will be experts from local authorities who know how the system works and others will come from the private sector with expertise in project management.  They will report to me every fortnight.  Their simple role will be to make the rebuilding of Ireland happen in line with the timeframe we have set out.  They will need to be able to pursue construction projects, some of which will be structured in a complex way, one after the other.  For example, there may be public private partnerships on public land.  There will also be some straight build programmes.  In other cases, these officials will have to work with private developers to get the decisions they need in a timely manner from local authorities and from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government if it has a say in the process.  We will see how it works.  If it does not work, we will change it.  I am not one of those people who says that the plan is the plan and that it will be the plan come hell or high water.  If there are mistakes in the plan, we will change it.  If we need to upgrade, add to or amend the plan, we will do so.  My only agenda here is to solve the housing crisis.  I need and want the help of Senators in that regard and I will ask for it.</p><p>We had a debate in this Chamber the other evening on the important question of the housing needs of people with a disability, Travellers and elderly people.  We need to ensure that our social housing build programme caters for the different sectors of society that need social housing support.  We had a good discussion on disability in this context last week.  I am happy to say that there is a pretty strong paragraph on disability in the new plan.  We will develop that as we go.  In the case of Traveller accommodation, the approach in recent years has been to accommodate the needs of Traveller families within the broader social housing mix.  We are going to review that and assess whether more needs to be done separately from mainstream social housing provision.  A similar approach is being taken in the case of accommodation for senior citizens and the elderly.  I have just come from Dolphin House where we announced a &euro;25 million urban regeneration project for a great community that has faced all sorts of challenges in recent decades.  As part of the overall plan for that complex, a special redevelopment project involving the construction of houses for the elderly will be led by an approved housing body called Fold Ireland.  I think that is exactly the kind of mix of tenure that we need to have within these bigger overall projects.</p><p>I ask Senators to believe me when I say we are serious about this.  I know some people assume that a Fine Gael Minister who talks the talk on social housing does not really believe it.  I assume some people are thinking that as they look at me now.  I would not have fought for the funding I have obtained if I did not believe in this.  I hope people will see it as a signal of intent that the two biggest things I have done so far in this portfolio have been two urban regeneration projects.  The project in the north inner city involves the provision of 74 new apartments at a cost of &euro;29 million.  The project in the south inner city, which I announced today, involves the provision of 100 new apartments at a cost of &euro;25 million.  We are going to invest heavily in this area.  We also want to change the way we accommodate social housing as part of a broader mix.  Most of the social housing in my own city of Cork was built in the 1970s and 1980s.  The vast majority of houses were built on one side of the river and most private houses were built on the other side of the river.  As a result of that, there was stigmatisation and unfair and inaccurate perceptions of what it means to be in a social house or a private house.  We need to challenge that.  By the way, that will not be a comfortable debate for people like me.  I refer to what sometimes happens when perceptions are challenged.  I think Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about this issue during last week's debate.</p><p>I would like to see public lands used strategically for genuine integration in our social housing projects.  We need to see local authorities working in partnership with private developers on developments that consist, in part, of normal private residential housing and in part of affordable housing, affordable rental and social housing.  The various forms of housing will be mixed in clever designs so that when people drive into these developments, they will not spot which houses are social houses and which are private houses and will not be able to distinguish who is living where.  That is a huge change in the policy approach to social housing in Ireland.  It will not be easily done.  I will need the help of other political parties to get it done.  I will not be helped by those who take a populist approach locally and those who do not like change.  That is why the way to start the new approach to social housing involves the strategic use of State-owned landbanks.  We need to bring private housing into that mix, rather than trying to force social housing into private housing estates before there is an acceptance of that.  Of course, we are going to force that too.  That is what Part V is all about.  We are not going to allow what happened in the past, when developers bought out their social housing responsibilities, to happen again.  The Part V rules that say 10% of private developments have to consist of social housing need to mean precisely that, as far as I am concerned.  I hope we will go beyond that by adopting a mixed-tenure approach to development.  That would be healthy for everybody because it would facilitate genuine integration within communities.  If children should grow up looking over the hedge to their next-door neighbours without making a distinction between social and private housing, that creates the ambitions and the ability to dream big for everybody in terms of what they want to achieve in life.  I hope that does not sound patronising.  It is certainly not meant to be.</p><p>The second pillar is social housing and the third pillar is output, which involves getting more housing built.  Some people say to me that private developers should not be allowed to build because they are making margins on the backs of other people, etc.  We cannot simply solve a housing crisis by doing everything through public housing.  Private housing needs to be a big part of the mix too.  If we are going to build approximately 140,000 houses in the next six or seven years, the vast majority of them will have to be delivered by the private sector.  There will have to be an increased percentage of social housing as part of that mix as well.  What are the blockages at present?  The planning system is a blockage, so we are changing it.  Any developer who intends to build more than 100 houses will engage in preplanning consultation at local authority level and will go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for an application after that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has informed me that it will make decisions within 18 weeks, so we will have a much quicker turnaround time.  I am pretty confident that we will still get the right planning decisions.  This is not about cutting corners - it is about streamlining decision-making while still getting the right decisions.  The reality is that the vast majority, if not all, of large-scale developments end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for decision in any event.  We are trying to make those decisions much faster.  We are aware that planning permission has been approved for the construction of almost 28,000 houses in Dublin.  However, just 4,500 houses are being constructed in Dublin at present.  That discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the numbers do not add up for some developers because the infrastructure costs associated with opening up sites are too high for them.  We have committed &euro;200 million over the next two years to intervene in these circumstances by picking up part or all of the cost of providing infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, gas or wastewater connections.  We think that will make a big difference in getting many of these sites up and running.</p><p>There has been quite a bit of talk about what we intend to do for first-time buyers.  We did not announce the detail yesterday.  When there is ambiguity, there is lots of speculation.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will announce a package for first-time buyers on budget day.  I want to make it clear that this will not be about simply giving first-time buyers the capacity to spend more on houses, thereby overheating a market that is already overheated.  This has to be about driving supply for first-time buyers as well.  Any package we introduce will be about incentivising the construction sector to build more houses for that market.  Currently, this is not being done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to increase capacity.  We have a problem in that regard at present.  The prices for which builders are building and selling houses are higher than what the vast majority of first-time buyers can afford.  Therefore, builders are not building houses because they know they cannot sell them.  First-time buyers are trying to but cannot get mortgages in order to be able to get on the housing ladder.  We have got to close that gap by reducing the cost of building houses.  We are doing that through the infrastructure fund, a better planning system, using public land strategically and a number of other initiatives.  We will help first-time buyers in terms of getting mortgages.  Those who made criticisms today do not appear to understand that the main focus here is about increasing supply as well as improving demand.  Otherwise, we will continue to have thousands and thousands of first-time buyers who want to buy houses but who simply cannot afford to do so because nobody is building houses they can afford.  That is a crazy situation.  All those people then find themselves driven into the private rental market, which puts more and more pressure on the rental system.  In turn, this drives those on lower incomes out of that system and into either homelessness or relying on the State, through housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, rental accommodation system, RAS, rent supplement or whatever.  We have to stop that downward pressure which is creating increasing reliance on the State to provide housing outcomes.</p><p>The next pillar of the plan is around the private rental sector.  I got some criticism on this issue from Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular, and I do not quite know why because its members knew exactly what was coming with respect to this particular pillar.  We have made it quite clear for some time that we are committed to a detailed review of the broader rental market between now and end of the year.  We were not going to announce a series of initiatives without going through a proper process.  We have had a broken rental market for as long as I can remember.  What I mean by that is that rents in Ireland seem to be always rapidly increasing or else collapsing, which is a little like the position with house prices.  We have a boom and then a bust followed by another boom and bust, one after the other.  Everyone jumps on the bandwagon when matters are going well, including the banking system, and then the whole thing gets to a totally unsustainable level and it crashes.  My fundamental job, as Minister with responsibility for housing, is to end that cycle, and I am going to do it if I get the time to do it.   What that means is creating a stable predictable housing market in terms of price, whether it be rent or purchase prices.  We will look at international best practice in terms of how we can do that.  We need to do it in a way that does not frighten off investment in the short term.  That is why there needs to be proper stakeholder consultation before we finalise any decisions in those areas.</p><p>We have made two decisions in terms of early actions.  One is what people in my Department refer to as the Tyrrelstown amendment.  We want to ensure that when institutional investors sell an apartment complex to another institutional investor, a vulture fund or whomever, that the tenants will not suffer as a result of that change of ownership.  Tenancies will remain intact through that change of ownership which is not the case at present.  Currently, when a sale occurs, a tenancy starts from scratch, which gives the new landlord an opportunity to hike up rents or evict people, but we are going to change that.  Any complex comprising more than 20 units that are being sold together in the same development will have the protection of that new amendment, which is a good step forward.  On the other side, we will strengthen the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that if tenants are behaving in a totally irresponsible manner, there is a process by which the RTB can assess the position, make a judgment and get an outcome much quicker.  That is also a fair measure.  Everybody, from landlords to tenants has equal responsibility here.</p><p>We are committed to having a broad assessment - and making decisions on the back of that - of the rental market before the end of the year.  Some of the initiatives taken by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, had a positive impact in terms of insisting on rent reviews only happening on a two-year basis, pushing out timelines to give people notice of change of tenancies and so on, but we need to do a bit more in that area.  We will have a good deal of stakeholder consultation to make sure we get it right.  To rush it for the launch of the plan yesterday would have been silly.  I found the criticism I received for not doing that strange. </p><p>I also received some criticism for not doing more on student accommodation.  We are doing quite a bit on student accommodation in this plan around new funding models and so on.  If we can get students out of private rental accommodation into student purpose built accommodation, we will free up considerable space and we will do much more of that.  There is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned.  There are approximately between 20,000 and 25,000 students in private rented accommodation who could be in student accommodation, or certainly a proportion of them could.  Even if 5,000 of them were to move into student accommodation, that would free up a great deal of space that families could occupy.</p><p>I will conclude by commenting on the final pillar.  I have been speaking for a while.</p></speech>

The final pillar of the plan relates to using vacant properties more effectively.  There are approximately 200,000 vacant properties in Ireland.  Most of them are in areas where there is not a great deal of demand for housing but some of are in areas where there is a demand.  There are certain counties I know where one in five houses is vacant.  These are in areas where there is not huge housing pressure, but we still need to examine much more strategically how we can use that vacant housing stock and get it back into use.  There are many initiatives and ideas as to how we will do that and these make sense.  Members can read about them in plan.</p><p>I suspect I will be in this House repeatedly talking about housing, whether it be to discuss social housing, private housing, student accommodation, homelessness or meeting the targets we are setting for ourselves.  From my perspective, this is by far the most important job I have as a Minister.  Issues around Irish Water are very tricky politically but in comparison to the housing crisis in terms of a tiering of importance, housing is ten times more important.  We need to deliver on the commitment, the promise and the potential of the Rebuilding Ireland plan and we need to add to it as we progress the latter.</p><p>I hope I have shown a capacity to take on ideas from others and other parties in regard to this plan.  In appendix 2 or 3, we have looked at the key amendments, some 23 of them, from the all-party Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  I deliberately asked that this be done.  We  outlined how each of those recommendations is being addressed - or not addressed,<i>per se</i>, and why -<i></i>in this plan.  That shows we are taking very seriously what other parties and the Oireachtas committee called for.  I look forward to hearing comments from others on the plan to date.  If Members want to correspond with me at a later stage about individual problems we are not addressing, I look forward to that as well.</p></speech>

It is quite comprehensive.  To be fair, he has listened to other parties and to all those who made submissions.  I know several bodies that met him and he gave them a fair hearing.  I have a few suggestions that he might take into consideration and they might be helpful with respect to the plan.</p> <p>As the Minister knows, plans are easily devised but the hard part is their delivery.  There is one serious flaw in the plan which relates to the fundamental problem of a lack of housing.  Has the Minister tried to secure a builder to do any work recently?  I have but with great difficulty.  Builders are busier than ever.  Skilled workmen are exceptionally hard to get.  The Minister's plan is very ambitious and rightly so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I have a bad feeling.  It gives me no pleasure to say it but, when the Minister gets to the top of the hill and looks back, his generals will be consoling him and cushioning him with advice, but his foot soldiers will not be there.  I have concerns about the availability of skilled workers.</p><p>I am also here to give answers.  I am not like some Members who only like to voice negatives and have nothing positive to contribute.  When she was here recently, I asked the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, about the apprenticeship scheme, which employs 8,000 people.  I am uncertain as to how many are skilled builders, but it is less than half.  In 2008, 30,000 people were in apprenticeship schemes.  The costs involved are an impediment to joining schemes, as employers lose that manpower and are out of pocket because they pay for the training.  Addressing this problem would increase builder numbers.  Saying this gives me no pleasure, but it is a genuine concern.</p></speech>

I hope that Senator Coffey will forgive me.  I credited him, Deputy Kelly or the Government of the time with 75 houses, but the Minister stated that it was 72.  There is a disconnect.  I do not want to misquote the Minister, but my understanding is that we are discussing just under 50,000 houses within five years from next year onwards, or a little under 10,000 houses per year.  We will mainly secure those through building.  Is that correct?  The Minister can revert to me.  How will we move from a position of only building 10,000 private and public houses across the entire country to the number outlined?  The Minister stated that it would be demanding, but I do not know how we will secure 10,000 houses per annum.</p><p>I wish to make a couple of suggestions that might be helpful and are worth considering.  We must urgently strengthen the apprenticeship programmes.  What can we do to help employers in this regard?  We must consider a scheme to encourage people to return to the building industry.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is dealing with county councils directly.  We must make their housing officers and relevant directors responsible.  Every county should have a certain output of units <i>per capita</i>and per annum in line with their waiting lists.  Long gone are the days when no one would take responsibility for something and it would land on the Minister's desk.  The Minister stated that he would be active with the councils, the numbers look great and he has testified to the numbers nationally, but there should be a breakdown per county and he should explain what he expects councils to do.  Let their directors, housing officers and managers stand over their work.  This would be a step forward.</p><p>In my time with councils, I was shocked by housing bodies and the money that some of them were hoarding.  The balance sheets of some are incredible.  Many sat on their hands in recent years while we were in the depths of a housing tsunami.  I was involved with several on a number of projects during my time as a councillor.  It was &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;Might be&quot; and going around in circles.  It was all a great game, but nothing materialised.  Not enough pressure is put on the bodies in question to cough up money and build housing lest they face repercussions.  The Minister needs to use a stick with some of the housing agencies.</p><p>A couple of other issues are worth addressing again, for example, the factors that fed into this problem.  Under the spatial strategy, 10% of lands were dezoned indiscriminately.  It might be helpful to consider another issue.  If one's planning permission ran out in recent years, one could renew it once for five years further.  Many people renewed their permissions in 2008 and 2009.</p></speech>

Being able to renew a permission a second time would be a step forward.</p> <p>As to the over-regulation of engineering, we all want houses built to a certain standard and our standards are high, but they incur a significant cost on building.  Perhaps this issue could be re-examined.</p> <p>The Minister touched on the question of deposits and first-time buyers.  We will await the budget in that regard.  The Minister also mentioned that one in every five houses was unoccupied in some counties.  I believe that, as I do not live far from some of them.  It might be worth considering a grant scheme to repopulate country areas where houses have been built but are not occupied.  Some people living in other peripheral places would be delighted to move to another county.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the priority that the Government is giving this issue as well as the Minister's personal commitment to it.</p> <p>The Minister has outlined the various actions under the action plan's five pillars.  The first pillar is addressing homelessness.  Every Member agrees that seeing young families in emergency accommodation is unacceptable.  We acknowledge that there are complex issues in the case of some homeless people, for example, they may have medical needs or addiction issues.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is now engaging in a positive way with Departments to address some of these homelessness issues.  Having served in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, I know that it and the Minister cannot tackle homelessness alone.  It is a complex and personal issue for many of the unfortunate people in question.  They require ongoing support if they are to address their homelessness.  I welcome the Department of Health's engagement in this regard.</p> <p>The second pillar is accelerating social housing.  This is welcome.  An ambitious programme of social housing has been approved for various local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, around the country.  I will refer to this in greater detail shortly.</p> <p>The third pillar is building more homes.  Critical to this is addressing the issue of supply in the public sector, which provides social housing, and in the private sector.  The Minister knows that we must build the right type of houses in the right places.  There is a strong role for the Housing Agency in identifying these requirements and utilising that information to allocate and prioritise funding where it is needed.</p> <p>The fourth pillar is improving the rental sector, which is under significant pressure, be it in the private sector, student accommodation or so on.  As the economy grows further, that pressure will increase.  This matter requires constant attention, evaluation and review.  Expanding on the work of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which is the Minister's intention, will help to improve capacity in that regard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The fifth pillar involves the utilisation of existing housing.  This is critical.  It is a no-brainer that we sweat the assets we already have, be they private or public.  Much progress has already been made in the public sector, where, under the previous social housing strategy, thousands of void houses have been turned around, especially in the Dublin area but also throughout the country.  This is welcome progress on which we need to continue to expand.  Given the extent of our housing lists, it is unacceptable that there are vacant, boarded-up council houses around the country.  This will require continuous attention and evaluation.</p><p>When I was in the Department, I proposed an asset management system for our social housing stock.  The Minister may have already taken this on board.  Unless the voids that have been turned around, even in the past year, are managed as assets, properly maintained and kept up to date, we will have to work on them again down the road.  It involves a huge capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer.  A maintenance and asset management plan, similar to that introduced for Irish Water, is long overdue.  Unless we have such a plan, we will not put a value on the assets.  If that asset management plan and system had been in place ten or 20 years ago, boarded-up units would not have been allowed to reach their current state of degradation.  In addition, local authorities would have been benchmarked and measured in accordance with their asset management plans.  It is essential that, as we turn local authority voids around, we benchmark the investment and introduce an asset management system that holds local authorities accountable in respect of the cost of the upkeep and maintenance of stock and also regarding how long it takes to turn a house around once it becomes vacant.  Any public representative here will tell one that if a local authority house that becomes vacant is not upgraded and re-let in the short term, it can become derelict, thus costing more to the local authority and, in turn, the taxpayer.  I ask the Minister to focus on an asset management system within the Department and local authorities.</p><p>I note that the Minister has allocated &euro;70 million to the Housing Agency to acquire further housing units throughout the country.  The agency will determine the right types and locations of houses.  That is on top of what has already been approved under the previous social housing strategy for acquisitions for the approved housing bodies and local authorities.  A problem persisted in respect of the latter in that some local authorities were competing with approved housing bodies to purchase the same properties.  Therefore, what the Minister has done here represents the correct approach.  He has brought in the Housing Agency, which is independent and will buy the right properties at the right price in the right locations.  This is a welcome development under the new housing action plan.</p><p>With regard to Part V, some progress has been made on removing the cash-in-lieu provision.  The Minister referred to this in previous debates in this House.  I ask him to raise this with all the local authorities that may have Part V funding still on their books.  This is important funding that could be put towards the provision of housing.</p><p>Eight minutes is not enough time to address all the issues concerning housing.  I wish the Minister well with his ambitious plan.  It requires serious engagement on the part of all stakeholders, including policymakers, irrespective of political persuasion, and the public and private sectors, including the construction sector, to which Senator Davitt alluded.</p><p>Challenges arise over apprenticeships and skillsets.  It behoves the Government to ensure a cross-departmental response to address them.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, will assist with the apprenticeship schemes.</p><p>The Minister has endeavoured to streamline the process.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, one of the first steps I took along with the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, was to provide the funding and resources for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The big problem we encountered concerned delivery.  Once we approved projects, we found there were many barriers and stoppages along the way.  We need to drill into the problems and streamline the process from concept and design to planning and construction so we can fast-track, in both the public and private sectors, as many housing units as are required as soon as possible.  I seek to engage continually with the Minister and his officials on finding housing solutions.  That is a responsibility for all of us.</p><p>Access to credit for small builders is critical to providing buildings, including housing units, around the country.  From what I am hearing, they are still finding gaining access to credit from banking institutions seriously problematic.  I acknowledge Dublin is the crunch point in terms of housing but there are housing lists in every local authority.  Unless we address the issue of access to credit, there will be less private building among young couples and greater pressure on the private rental and social housing sectors.</p><p>The housing assistance payment is a very positive step in which I was involved.  It removes the poverty trap associated with rent supplement, which was essentially meant to be a short-term measure.  More local authorities need to roll out the housing assistance payment.  We need to see more engagement in this regard right around the country.</p><p>I look forward to engaging with the Minister again.  As stated, eight minutes is not enough.  Many more Senators will have ideas.  If we all approach this crisis in the spirit of trying to find solutions, we will achieve the progress we really need.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an Aire as ucht &iacute; a thabhairt chun cinn go luath.  Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an gCoiste um Thith&iacute;ocht agus Easpa D&iacute;dine as ucht an obair a rinne s&eacute;.  I welcome the report and the fact that the Minister has introduced it sooner than expected.  I congratulate the members of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness on their work.  For a committee that was set up and went about its work during the hiatus after the election, it has achieved an awful lot.  It also shows that, when political will exists, normal parliamentary constraints can be set aside and proper work to address key problems can be undertaken.  This report is better than what has come from Governments previously but we believe it needs to include more.  I am glad the Minister is willing to take on board the suggestions we have.</p> <p>The first point we take issue with is the fact that it was reported in the Government&rsquo;s own media spin on the statement that there was to be a &euro;2.2 billion increase over six years, whereas the reality is that it is an increase of &euro;1.1 billion on the Kelly plan figure.  My colleague Deputy &Oacute; Broin pointed this out in the D&aacute;il yesterday.</p> <p>I am concerned that not all the key or priority recommendations of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness were taken on board.  Only seven out of 23 were referenced in appendix 2 of the report.  These are only the priority recommendations.  There are 84 other recommendations of the committee that need to be addressed also.</p> <p>I am worried about the lack of movement to help those in mortgage difficulties who may face losing their homes.  The commitment in the programme for Government to set up a special court to deal with these cases seems to have disappeared.  Instead, the Minister for Justice and Equality will ask the courts to hold these cases at certain times and places.  The commitment to hold these cases in private has been put in doubt also, with the housing action plan raising concern about the constitutionality of this move.  Gone also is the programme for Government commitment to amend the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, pointed out the backsliding of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on this issue when he told him the commitment referred only to non-bank lenders such as vulture funds.  It is clear that even that commitment has been reduced to an assessment of existing sustainable solutions.  Likewise, the commitment to raise the thresholds for accessing the personal insolvency system has been downgraded.  There is now only a possibility of raising them, where appropriate, instead of a commitment.</p> <p>There is welcome detail on the new advice service and the powers available to it.  However, we have seen many schemes like this before that were promised but never delivered.  As we have seen, there is a long way between what this Government promises and what is actually delivered.  It is eight years since the banking crash, yet it is as if Fine Gael is only now waking up to the mortgage crisis.  The 85,989 families in arrears cannot afford any more slippage on what were, in the first instance, modest steps right direction.</p> <p>I recently attended the District Court in Galway.  One hundred and twenty families were before the registrar due to mortgage difficulties.  This startling figure should be a wake-up call to the Government that this remains a key problem facing families.  I have noted in this House previously that there may be a public perception that most of the people in the courts over mortgage arrears are not really making any efforts whatsoever to repay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I found, from sitting there for a day, that it was the opposite.  The vast majority of those people had paid huge portions of their mortgages, had made huge efforts to keep up payments and were making all efforts necessary to try to repay their mortgages or any outstanding arrears.  In some cases, however, the financial institutions - the banks and the vulture funds in particular - were relentless in going after those people, even if only small amounts remained to be paid.  This must be addressed.<br/><br/>The report contains next to nothing on rent certainty.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe rent certainty is essential to put a stop to the phenomenon of hidden homelessness, that is, those who must stay with relatives or couch-surf.  I believe this section of people rightly feel let down and ignored by this report.  The issue of rent certainly appears to have been put on the long finger, not because of the complexity of getting to grips with it but through sheer lack of political will to deal with a broken private rental sector to which even the Minister himself alluded.  Sinn F&eacute;in has never shied away from asserting this lack of political will directly correlates with the number Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who have a direct interest in the private rental sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in produced a Bill on rent certainty in the D&aacute;il, which we had hoped would pass in this era of new politics in which we are meant to be living.  Unfortunately, despite referencing rent certainty in the lead-up to the election, Fianna F&aacute;il decided it could not support the Bill and prevented rent certainty from now being law.  What changed so much in the space of a few months?  It was hardly the fact Fianna F&aacute;il is now a <i>de facto</i>Government partner with Fine Gael.  Rent certainty has been kicked down the road to be considered at a future date.  This is a recurring theme of the cosy deal into which the Government entered, as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have knocked other things on the head for 12 months, including pay-by-weight bin charges, water charges and banded-hour contracts.  This type of delayed promise is wholly unacceptable, as the most recent homelessness figures prove.  There are 4,152 adults in emergency accommodation, which is an increase of 160 since the previous count, while 2,206 children will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight, which is an increase of 29 since the previous count.  It is also unacceptable for all those who are sofa-surfing or living in overcrowded accommodation, those at risk of homelessness due to repossessions or excessive rents, the 130,000 or more households languishing on local authority housing lists for up to ten years, as well as those priced out of the first-time buyer's market.<br/><br/>There is a sense of ambition in the report but it falls short of the Oireachtas committee targets that were put forward.  I also listened to a representative of Focus Ireland this morning who welcomed the report but stated the organisation had concerns that as certain elements of the report called for the drawing up of further reports, there will be a lack of immediate action on certain issues.  I welcome the Minister's comments on student accommodation, the elderly, disability, etc.  All Members agree there are issues in those areas.</p></speech>

In fairness, Members have shared these comments many times in these Houses over the past five years.</p> <p>The issue of Traveller-specific accommodation must be tackled as it is not simply an issue of trying to settle Travellers into social housing.  There must be an approach that is cognisant of the specific needs of the Traveller community.  This morning, I attended the launch of a report on people in direct provision and how they are trying to transition into social housing and they also have highly specific difficulties that must be addressed.  I have concerns that there appears to be a huge emphasis on the private sector supporting many of the initiatives that have been put forward.  Members of Sinn F&eacute;in obviously always put forward our views that the State should have more of a role.  The Minister mentioned that only 72 houses were built last year by local authorities whereas in previous decades, ambitious State building programmes were undertaken.  Sinn F&eacute;in seeks much more of an emphasis on that type of programme, which appears to be lacking here.  I am concerned there is an over-emphasis on the private market doing the building and so on.  Some such concerns have in fairness been raised by Senator Davitt about the availability of people for the workforce but the way the private sector has approached the building sector in recent years also leaves a lot to be desired.</p> <p>I will conclude on a point that was raised with me yesterday, on how there certainly will be pressure on local authorities to row in behind the scheme.  I attended an Oireachtas Members briefing with Galway County Council yesterday at which we were told the council is already under pressure due to lack of staffing and has a &euro;2 million shortfall for next year.  I also find that between Galway city and county councils, an amount of between &euro;1 million and &euro;1.5 million has been lost because of the global valuation of rates.  The councils are under huge pressure and do not have staff in-house to do this.  The Minister might address the issue of how local authorities with their existing staffing complements will be able to support the ambitious programme he has put forward.  I look forward to further debates with the Minister in the coming months and I am sure we will have many of them.</p></speech>

As for Dolphin House and the regeneration, it is an area - around the canal communities - in which I have worked for a long time.  I wish to recommend reading a book by a man named John Bissett on the failures of the public private partnerships, PPPs, in St. Michael's Estate, on the negative experience the community there had with the PPPs, on how many times they withdrew, and on how that community was completely torn apart and was obliged to move away.  I note only a small number of those people remain there.  The book outlines that experience and the Minister should ensure this does not happen again in either the areas about to undergo regeneration or those areas that were promised it, such as O'Devaney Gardens and St. Teresa's Gardens.</p> <p>While I also welcome the Minister's comments on not being able to tell the difference between public and private housing, that is, between social and private housing, as someone who has lived in social housing I note that family make-up can determine where one lives and as a single mother of two children, it is a very negative experience.  Given the make up of my family, I am expected to live in small accommodation on top of a family home but because another family does not have children of the same sex, it gets a bigger house with two floors, separate bedrooms for their children and a back garden.  It is not good for the emotional and psychological well-being of the children in the family with same-sex children that they do not get to experience a garden or their own bedroom.  When social housing construction is under way, housing for life should be considered and it should allow families to expand if they so wish, instead of being forced to live in small accommodation.</p> <p>As a student, I welcome the recognition of the large and rapidly-expanding student population.  It appears as though the Minister agrees that housing students is not simply an issue for higher level institutions and the construction industry but with regard to accommodation and city planning, is an issue that affects us all.  As noted in the plan, a report drawn up by the Department of Education and Skills last year projected an increase in student numbers from 168,000 in 2014 to 193,000 in 2024.  A large portion of these will congregate in the cities and large towns in already strained housing markets.  Students and their families will once again struggle to cope with shortages of available beds, as well as uncontrollable rents and the uncertainties of an unregulated rent-a-room relief scheme.  I call for a review of the rent-a-room scheme to provide more security for both tenant and landlord.  During my time as a student union president in Trinity College, I saw at first hand the impact of the housing crisis on student welfare.  It means skipping meals and classes to meet soaring rent costs and sometimes and it also means dropping out of university due to a complete lack of suitable accommodation.  One way in which the provision of such accommodation can be achieved is by partnering with those being affected by the shortfall.  This report recommends that the Government should work with the students themselves through the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.  It is worth acknowledging this mature approach, which I believe will lead to a more sustainable solution that hopefully can prevent the current situation from recurring.</p> <p>I have already mentioned this is not merely a student issue.  Due to the nature of taking on a degree, most students are prevented from taking on full-time work.  This puts them in the same approximate budgetary range as those receiving rent allowance, which means that in our competitive housing market, people are being pitted against one another for a dwindling pool of available accommodation.  In addition, one must remember that in many cases where the cost of education is being supplemented by the family, the burden of unpredictable rents is being borne at home.  This is a city planning and family issue and by providing purpose-built student accommodation, one takes students out of the rental market and opens up the rental sector for lower-income families, as well as those in emergency accommodation who need long-term solutions.  While the report mentions the commitment of higher education institutions to provide several thousand units of purpose-built accommodation in the coming years, this will not match the projected increases in demand of more than 25,000 students by 2024.  Some of this will be accounted for by developments through the private sector but one cannot be sure that this will cover the demand or produce affordable accommodation.

While a forward-thinking strategy would be a positive development, short-term action must also be taken.  CAO results are only weeks away and it should be a serious concern for the Members of this House that students and their families will once again be taken advantage of while they are in a panic.</p><p>I will conclude because I am encroaching on Senator Dolan's time, but I have a couple of other points about NAMA and student accommodation which I will send on to the Minister</p></speech>

I welcome wholeheartedly the hope and solutions offered in this plan for so many people, young people and families.  However, I must regretfully reject it because it is not worthy of an Ireland that has resolved to also solve the housing issues for people with disabilities.  The Minister mentioned page 55, the section on disability.  There are no statistics in the plan on the current unmet need that could drive the rationale for strong action.  There is no ambition in that regard and there are no targets.  There is language about structures, processes, strategies and implementation frameworks, but there is no real meat in that section.  That is a real issue.</p> <p>Last week we had a very good debate here in the House and the Minister mentioned Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and the Government's commitment to ratify it.  It addresses the opportunity for people with disabilities to choose where and with whom they reside at a particular time.  The key aspect to it is that this should be "on an equal basis with others".  I have serious difficulty with the approach taken in the plan to deal with this.  It does not provide equal space for the housing needs of people with disabilities.  No civil or public servant is going to see the level of unmet need that actually spurs action and targets to deal with the issues.  I cannot see councillors finding any solace in this in regard to dealing with the housing needs of people with disabilities, including adaptation and so on.</p> <p>We will ratify the UN Convention.  I am clear about that and the commitments that have been made.  This plan, in whatever way it develops - hopefully it will develop - will be before the relevant committee as part of setting out the case as to how Ireland is dealing with Article 19.  I am asking the Minister to guarantee that the action plan will ensure that people with disabilities will be included in the outcomes in a way that is easy to see.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say last night and this morning - I keep hearing him say it, and rightly so - that there will not be a difference between someone in a social house and someone in a purchased house.  I am concerned that in this context we will not know there are also people with disabilities who should be able to live easily in those houses or to have them adapted as they need them.  Please recognise the outstanding need.  Acknowledge it and act on it in respect of the equal disability housing crisis.</p> <p>My final point relates to the fact that the attitude and culture of the old politics is still evident in this.  Somebody said last night that it was important to doff the cap in regard to people with disabilities and then deftly and silently move on.  That is why I take umbrage at those four paragraphs on page 55.  They nod towards the inclusion of people with disabilities but there is nothing in there about their way into proper housing.  The Government and the Department did not distinguish between waving back at people with disabilities as they moved on to deal with the bigger issue and take real action.</p> <p>There is a major housing crisis and I do take from that for one moment.  It is great that we are going to tackle it but it must be done on the basis of equality that includes people with disabilities.</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the huge body of work that is the action plan for housing and homelessness and to compliment the Minister and all the stakeholders and individuals who have taken a keen interest in this.  It is a critical issue.  It is good to see that we have this document before us now.  The challenge is to drive it on.  I have no doubt that is what the Minister intends to do.  We know at this stage that it is a complex issue.  It involves everything from the standards employed in the construction of housing, which we have to get right, to looking at market forces.  In general we do not like to interfere with the market but needs must.  We are living in emergency times for all the people without homes, those who are hard-pressed paying high rents and those who cannot buy their own homes.  Affordability is an issue.  Fundamentally, the question is how we create cohesive communities where individuals and families can grow and thrive.  It is more than a house.  A house is a home and part of a community.</p> <p>It often strikes me, coming from my neck of the woods, that there are two sides to the one coin, as is clear in the figures.  There are empty houses, schools in danger of closing down or losing teachers, GAA teams unable to field players, and so on.  The population in such areas is being depleted.  We saw the census figures last week, which showed that counties like Donegal, Sligo and Mayo are losing population.  I have no doubt that it is young people who are gone and that they have migrated.  Based on the employment figures and their skillsets, they have gone to the big cities.  Then one comes to the city and sees severe pressure on services.  We have services and facilities, to an extent, in more rural areas, yet we cannot keep people there.  There is a huge challenge for spatial planning in this country, so that we do not leave things the way they are and that we intervene with appropriate supports, especially in areas like the west.  In terms of investment and growth, we have seen the least growth in that area, notwithstanding efforts in the regional action plan for jobs.</p> <p>Now that we see continuing growth and employment and continuing increase in Exchequer figures, especially the tax intake, I would like to think we can further support initiatives to develop these areas, which will in turn allow people to stay.  People will not have to live on fresh air.  No matter how beautiful the area one comes from, while there may be tourism, we need more than that.  That is how we are going to fill houses and allow people to sustain their families, especially in rural areas.</p> <p>I am disappointed in regard to the area of town and village renewal and how it is set out in the plan.  The partnership programme for Government contains an ambition to develop a scheme similar to the Living City initiative, which would incentivise businesses and people to move into the urban centres that are covered under that scheme.  This is going to be looked at under the Minister's policy document towards the end of the year.  If one goes around any of the market towns, practically any of them around the country - it is not just Mayo - it becomes a depressing experience.  They are the saddest places.  No wonder people are depressed or despairing at times and that is notwithstanding whatever other improvements there are, whether in small indigenous industry jobs, agriculture and so on.  When one goes into them, one sees shops shut down and houses shut down and empty.  They are like tombstones for a time gone by.</p> <p>This has been happening since the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  Retail has changed and people are shopping online.  We have to create a new vision for what these towns and villages will look like.  It needs specific intervention.  It is past time that we had a proper scheme to repopulate our towns and villages.  We need to get people back living in them like we see on the Continent, where they have services and all the rest.  This would involve the local authorities and would involve looking after our small independent traders, so there are shops, pubs and restaurants that people can use.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is the least fleshed out part of the proposal before us whereas, to me, it is the most relevant when I go beyond the cities and it is not being addressed.

I hope the passion he has shown today in his opening contribution can be sustained over the period needed to see this plan implemented.  He is going to meet a great deal of opposition and difficulties.  I wish him well.</p> <p>By way of being helpful, I want to ask whether the Minister will take on board a number of issues my party sought to address in a Bill on social and affordable housing that we published this week.  The first of these is the recommendations from the long-discussed Kenny report.  In the Minister's action plan, he said that lands are currently zoned to satisfy a population of 6 million but there is no breakdown of these lands.  The Minister knows - given that he alluded to it and answered a question on it yesterday - that one of the big problems is that financial investment funds are buying up land and storing it in order to make a killing.  By not implementing the recommendations of the Kenny report, how does the Minister believe we will prevent this from happening and how is land going to be freed up?  How much land is owned by the State that is specifically for the building of houses and how much is private land?  The Minister might tell me the mix of both, if he has that figure.</p> <p>I want to express my disappointment that NAMA has not been broadened out, as recommended in our Bill, to make it into a housing development and finance agency.  NAMA had a specific role and it is fulfilling that, but it now needs to move on to the next phase.  I would like the Minister to comment.</p> <p>I am also disappointed that the whole matter of private rent increases has not been dealt with in the action plan.  The Minister said there will be provision for landlords who own in excess of 20 units.  However, the reality is there are many accidental landlords in this country who own two or three units and who are mortgaged up to the hilt.  These people are trying to extract the maximum rent from tenants in to pay their own bills.  The Minister needs to look at the smaller landlord.</p> <p>Senator Mulherin spoke in regard to village and town centre renewal, which I support.  We had a plan many years ago to provide funding for landlords to upgrade accommodation above their shops but it never took off.  We need to revisit this because rural Ireland needs this type of upgrading.</p> <p>In regard to the planning process, much has been made of sending planning applications for developments of more than 100 units straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I put it to the Minister that he is actually taking away the local democratic input of councillors and local authorities in respect of planning.  In many cases, councillors representing the people bring to the table a lot of local issues that would not be known by local officials and, in some cases, by the developers, which would actually assist the process.  Moreover, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a finite resource in terms of staffing.  If all of these proposals are going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will the Minister provide extra staff for it and how many will he provide?</p> <p>With regard to student accommodation, it is like the saying, "Live horse and you will eat grass", in that the Minister is pushing it out to another strategy in 2017.  With respect, I know the Minister brought this plan forward in 100 days but there is plenty of evidence and information that would have allowed him to bring forward specific proposals on student accommodation rather than saying he is going to prepare a strategy in 2017.  It has come to my attention that 2,000 units of commercial accommodation have just fallen of the map in Dublin city in recent months.  Will the Minister comment on where they have gone?  Have they gone to Airbnb or have they disappeared?  One building in the city centre was removed as a commercial property and put into Airbnb, and it took in &euro;79,000 in income in 2015.  There are a lot of things going on which the Minister might say fall outside of the remit of his Department but there is no regulation of Airbnb in this country.  It is, however, regulated in other jurisdictions.  Many students will get sucked into this because there is no other avenue for them to get accommodation, particularly in this city and to a lesser extent in the other cities.  I would like the Minister to comment on this issue.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well with the action plan.  Like Senator Coffey, I could talk for another 20 minutes but I do not have the time.  The Minister might address my questions when he responds.</p></speech>

I read his action plan three times last night and I then decided I would go back and look at A Programme for a Partnership Government.  There was much play on the first 100 days and seven housing items in the programme were to be delivered within that period.  Obviously, all of that has not happened but it is perhaps on the way.  I commend the Minister on the work done.  The way he is driving this demonstrates his absolute commitment in respect of the issue of housing.</p> <p>I have been a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council since the early 1990s.  I am very familiar with housing issues and local government, and I have been involved in the Association of Irish Local Government and attended many conferences on housing.  There is a real dynamic in this regard.  This is one of the most important issues for the Government, and I acknowledge and salute the Minister for that.</p> <p>I was a bit taken aback to see that there is a very high reliance on the private sector.  That is obviously a deliberate policy of the Minister and a continuation of the policies of previous Governments.  I do not have too much of a difficulty with some of that.  However, let us remember that we have over 30 local authorities, all of which have a statutory function for housing - they are the housing authorities.  I took the trouble to telephone six local authorities this morning to ask what they think.  I also took the time to flag this report for and send it to every chief executive, every director of planning and every council in the country last night when I received it because I think it is important that they know what is going on.  I want to point out that there were mixed feelings.  The one thing that is clearly coming out this morning from local government planners is the importance of local knowledge and local understanding of the demographics, including among councillors.  There is a partnership approach between strategic policy committees on planning and the directors.  The Minister would know better than most, given the work of his Department, of the lack of performance of some local authorities versus others, and that this is driven more by some than by others.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well.  The report is 114 pages long and contains 84 action items.  The Minister, under five pillars, has clearly set out the description of the actions, the objectives and the timescales, which is practical.  It is up to parliamentarians and councillors to keep the pressure on and to see there is delivery.  I remind the Minister that he has a very large bloc of Fine Gael councillors across the country, as do Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Moreover, what happens in the Oireachtas does not necessarily permeate down through his organisation to the local authorities.  There is a terrible record of councillors opposing social housing and Part 8 developments.  I want the Minister to have a conversation, as part of his promotion of this action plan, with his party membership.  I want him to ask his parliamentarians and councillors whether they are on board and committed to this Fine Gael-led Government and its policies.  This is very important because, on the ground, county mangers will say - and I have observed - that some party councillors are not supportive of Traveller accommodation and emergency accommodation.  For example, there is no emergency accommodation in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area for people who must leave their homes due to domestic violence, which is a terrible indictment of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, one of the most prosperous local authorities in the country.  It is worth making that point.</p> <p>I do not know what the Minister is doing with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The latter is continuously failing in respect of its 18-week deadlines and I can think of one case in my own county where this has happened on three occasions.  I rang this morning and was told the earliest we will have an outcome is at the end of August.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unless the Minister is going to tell us something different today, to make an appeal - or observation, as it likes to call it - to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will cost &euro;50.  I rang it this morning, although I was aware of it, but I wanted to check my facts.  To object or make an observation or submission - against or for - someone might want to make contact with the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it will cost &euro;50.  Has the Minister taken this on board?  I want him to address the issue today because it is a really important measure.  The board advises me that the cost is &euro;50.  Are citizens who have a right to engage in the planning process, as of today, expected to pay &euro;50?  It is the same in the case of critical infrastructure projects.</p><p>My next point takes it a little further.  There were major shortcomings in An Bord Plean&aacute;la which, as the planning authority, is also within the remit of the Minister.  If I am in County  Kerry and a Deputy, local authority member or citizen and want to look at a file on An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I cannot view it online.  Again, the board confirmed this to me this morning.  I must travel to Marlborough Street in Dublin to request to see a paper file.  The board needs to smarten up and make everything available online.  On the other hand, in my planning authority, I have the right to walk into the council office to request and look at the file.  Every citizen has the right to engage in the planning process.  There are EU directives on environmental freedom of information.  People cannot be required to come from County Kerry, County Mayo or Cork to Marlborough Street in Dublin to look at planning files.  I want the Minister to address that issue.  There is a real deficit in open and transparent planning.  Perhaps the Minister intends to do something about it.</p><p>We know that students are under pressure in finding accommodation and that they are competing with others who want to rent accommodation.  There are no clear, strong commitments other than objectives - not even objectives - to provide student accommodation.  I want to know how the Minister will answer that question.</p><p>I spoke to the Minister last week about the Part V contributions.  We know that there are many millions on deposit in some local authorities, including mine.  I rang today to find out exactly how much and was told it would take some time but that I would receive a reply this afternoon.  Last week I asked the Minister to write to every local authority chief executive to ask for a statement.  I do not know if he has done it.  I know that he is a busy man and do not expect him to jump to something I might suggest here, but I reiterate my question.  He should ask them to do so.  I will be able to furnish him with the information on Tuesday or Wednesday.  However, as Minister, he should know it.  He and his departmental officials should know about the substantial number of millions of euro sitting in accounts which has been collected under Part V for social and affordable housing.  I want that money to be ring-fenced and used.</p><p>The Minister should not overlook the direct provision and construction of social houses by local authorities.  They do it well and have a strong record in doing so.  They deliver locally which creates employment in the construction industry.  I still think there is a role for them in the direct provision and construction of social housing for the many thousands on local authority housing lists.  I genuinely and sincerely wish the Minister well with this plan.</p></speech>

I commend him for this ambitious and bold document.</p> <p>One of the key instruments of housing has to be the old-fashioned building programme undertaken by the local authorities.  The Minister is to put 47,000 social units in place by 2021.  Already that work is under way in Limerick.  The Minister announced &euro;9 million in funding to provide 50 homes spread throughout the city, with 24 on the Childers Road and another ten on Sexton Street North, in Thomondgate and Kileely Court.  There will be 12 on Burke Avenue and four near Athlunkard Boat Club towards Corbally.  While funding is extremely important, what is often overlooked is the timeframe between funding being granted and housing being built.  It has to be fast-tracked as the process can often be very slow.  It is not just about funding being allocated but also about the speed at which they are built.  The 50 homes to be allocated represent a start.  There is a large local authority housing waiting list in Limerick.</p> <p>Limerick City and County Council is carrying out an assessment of housing need in Limerick.  Forms will be sent to all those on the housing waiting list by the end of July.  They will need to be returned to the local authority by 21 September.  I urge everyone who receives the form to ensure it is completed.  If they have queries, they should go to the local authority, but they must get the form back in as we need to operate with crystal clear data.  It is most important that everyone who should be on the waiting list be on it.  All too frequently reviews have been carried out and people dropped from the list.  This may be because the form is inadvertently sent to an incorrect address or people just do not return it.  Those who believe they are on the housing waiting list but do not receive a letter by the end of July - the form may have been sent to a different address - should go to the housing section of the local authority on Merchants Quay and put their case to it.</p> <p>I will make some observations on the proposals made.  I very much welcome the proposal to provide 47,000 social housing units.  It is critical that the programme get under way and become a sustained policy of the Government.  Towards the latter end of 2000 it had dropped off and the private sector was picking it up.  The private sector is also important.  It is extremely important to have a social building programme in every village, town and city on a consistent basis.  The target to build 25,000 annually is ambitious but achievable.</p> <p>The document refers to first-time buyers and I understand it will be brought forward as a budgetary proposal.  It is critical that no measure introduced lead to a rise in the price of houses for first-time buyers.  We need a supply and a demand element to ensure first-time buyers will have an incentive to buy property at a reduced price.</p> <p>Regarding town and village renewal, there are many villages in east Limerick, including Murroe, Cappamore, Caherconlish, Castleconnell and Ballyneety.  It is extremely important that something be put in place - I know that it is mentioned in the document - to encourage people to live and work in these areas.  I know that the Minister has made reference to this, but it needs to work easily.  It could be in the form of grants or on some other basis, as there may be some other mechanism that could be introduced.  We must, however, make it attractive for people to live and work in villages which are all integrated and extremely important.  </p> <p>This is very much a working document and I commend the Minister for introducing it in such a short time period.  As he stated yesterday, he is looking for further ideas to advance the housing plan in place.</p></speech>

It is ambitious.  I have not read it in detail, but I have looked through it.  I also listened to some of the debate in the other House yesterday.  To achieve anything, it is necessary to have a plan which we now have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a blueprint that everyone needs to row in behind and push.  I have concerns and a number of suggestions, but I welcome this initiative.</p><p>We are in a crisis.  According to the recent census figures, the number of housing units nationally increased by 18,981, bringing the housing stock to 2.02 million.  In the same period, the population grew by 169,700 to 4.756 million.  Such metrics lead to our skewed housing provision.  Many commentators, including the Housing Agency and its chief executive, who is someone for whom I have the utmost respect, have written and spoken about this.  The published plan will go some way towards meeting the challenges.</p><p>Many Members have referred to housing output, be it private or social.  Both outputs fell off a cliff after the 2010 EU-IMF package.  Output levels were at approximately 80,000 units in 2007, dropped to 40,000 or 50,000 and then fell off a cliff, ending up with a national housing output of 10,000 or so.  While I welcome the plan's ambitious targets, are they achievable and measurable?  They are time-bound.  How will we achieve the objectives required to deliver the plan?  I have some concerns in this regard, as most people do.  I am sure that the Minister does as well, since he must deliver on the plan.  The new housing office within his Department must be well resourced and have the necessary expertise, communication channels, be they open channels or back channels to local authorities, and every delivery vehicle available to it.  Legislation accompanying the plan will need to be introduced, so it is important that that happen forthwith.</p><p>Something that struck me about the recent census figures was the number of vacant properties around the country.  Of the approximately 260,000 such properties, some 61,000 are holiday homes for people living in Ireland or abroad.  There are many vacant properties up and down the country.  I examined my parish last weekend.  It has many vacant properties where, for example, a grandparent, aunt or someone died and left the property to family members, it fell into a state of disrepair and then became uninhabitable.  We do not know how many such houses there are.  There are no data to suggest that they number over 100,000, but neither are there data to suggest the contrary.</p><p>The Housing Agency compiled a good report on this matter recently.  It used the 2011 census figures, but it made a number of suggestions with which I concur.  According to the latest census figures, there are 16,321 vacant apartments and 7,795 vacant houses in Dublin at a time when 6,000 people are officially homeless, including 2,000 children, and 130,000 people are on the social housing list.  The Housing Agency made a number of suggestions that merit consideration and are not covered by this report.  For example, it recommended a two-year timeframe for identifying the number of vacant properties with a view to enabling a strategy or template on vacant housing, the empowerment of local authorities to carry out this research locally and an examination of a scheme to bring those properties into productive use.  I suggest that we consider schemes that have been introduced in other countries, such as grant aiding people to bring properties into productive use and allowing them to rent the properties out or lease them long term to local authorities.  Since that would be prohibited by our current tax regime for landlords, this matter needs to be examined, as it has not been identified in the report.  Some 130,000 people are on housing waiting lists, but what is there to say that there are not 130,000 vacant housing units owned by individuals who would lease or sell them were they brought into a state of repair?</p></speech>

I can get carried away.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for attending and commend him on this plan.  He has shown leadership in this regard.  I will point out a couple of elements that should be included, but it has a number of very good aspects that, if implemented properly, will work as required.</p> <p>We are mindful of the ever-changing situation, in that 160 people were made homeless in the past month.  If the situation remains the same, 12,000 families will be made homeless during the plan's lifetime.  We must bear this in mind.  I raise this point because I was in the Castlebar court a couple of weeks ago to witness repossessions that made families homeless.  This issue needs to be tackled in a way whereby we can intervene with the banks.  On behalf of one family with two children, a bank was offered &euro;50,000 to settle the &euro;66,000 owed to it, yet the bank refused.  We need a mechanism whereby banks can be made to take responsibility.  After all, the &euro;64 billion that we gave them would have gone a long way towards building people new houses.</p> <p>A number of people have been, and others will be, made homeless because of the pyrite issue affecting Mayo and Donegal.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will visit Mayo and has been to Donegal to see the situation at first hand.  I visited a house last week to see the renovations that were required because of pyrite.  I would not call them "renovations", as all that was left of the house were the foundations and the roof.  Everything else needed to be rebuilt from scratch.  Given that such houses are continuing to deteriorate, hundreds more families will be made homeless because of pyrite.  A relief scheme similar to the one provided in the east must be made available to prevent these people from being made homeless.</p> <p>I come from a local authority background, namely, Mayo County Council.  As Senator Boyhan pointed out, local authorities have statutory responsibility for providing houses, but they need resources if they are to work this plan in a timely manner.  Consider the length of time it takes to get from the planning stage to houses being built, even in small developments.  For example, just six houses are to be built in the Glenamoy housing scheme, but because the local authority does not have the expertise or adequate personnel, the process is taking too long.  The Government can claim that the money is being made available, but the money is not doing what needs to be done because local authorities do not have the requisite resources.</p> <p>The impediments and extra costs encountered during the planning process by people who want to build their own houses make no sense.  Planners telling people that they can build at this end of a field but not at the other puts building a house beyond affordability.</p> <p>How long should it take a local authority to build a house once it has planning permission?  Is there an average time and has the Minister agreed targets with local authorities on how many houses will be built in the next six months?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am pleased that the plan has flexibility for local authorities to purchase houses.  There is provision to give grant aid to people who need to refurbish their houses or bring them up to a standard where they can be bought or rented by the local authority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-20a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072000002#CC00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and I also welcome the plan.  As others have said, it shows real commitment by the Government and real leadership by the Minister in addressing this issue.  It is an ambitious plan, with an annual level of residential construction of 25,000 homes and the delivery of 47,000 social housing units in the period to 2021 while, at the same time, making the best use of existing housing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant and responsive private rental sector.</p> <p>Others have touched on the five key pillars of the plan.  These include addressing the homelessness situation and providing early solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation.  I cannot overstate the importance of this.  It has an impact on the young children who must live in hotels with no sense of normality and no cooking facilities.  They move from hotel to hotel and do not know whether they will attend the same school.  All of these are terrible stresses on young children.  It is urgent and a priority that this be addressed.</p> <p>There is also the situation of people having to sleep rough and the dangers involved in this.  The State has a duty to keep people in their own homes.  We want to accelerate the social housing stock, and this will be funded with &euro;5.35 billion to deliver the 47,000 units.  I welcome this serious commitment by the Government.  There is also a commitment to build more homes, increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices.  There will also be an infrastructure fund of &euro;200 million to open large sites in areas where people need homes.  Fingal is such an area, with the highest population growth rate in the country at 8%.  It will also improve the rental sector as others have outlined.  There is much work to be done because there has been a haemorrhage of landlords from the area for a host of reasons.  Many people who bought second homes did so to provide for their future and pensions.  They were small investors providing for themselves in their old age.  We need to address these issues.  There is also the issue of utilising existing housing stock, which I welcome.</p> <p>Another area I would like to mention, and I know the Minister may have heard me say this before, is encouraging downsizing by empty nesters to smaller homes, and giving them an incentive to do so if it is their desire.  Nobody wants to move people from the house of their life if they want to stay there, but very often they would be comfortable if there was an incentive.  We need to get rid of the blockages that exist at present locally and nationally.  I will return to this point.</p> <p>What people want to see from the plan is an increase in the delivery of housing.  It will require the implementation of all of the actions outlined in the plan by the Minister.  It will also require an overwhelming team effort by all stakeholders to achieve these targets.  There will need to be a strong focus on behalf of all stakeholders to reduce any bureaucratic, or other, blockages to achieving this and the national targets included in the plan.  There will be a need to treat the plan as an emergency response to a national crisis.</p> <p>Irish people are of the land, as we know, and we place a high value on ownership of home and land.  Ones house is one's home, one's sanctuary, one's place of safety and where families gather.  When one does not have a house it goes to the heart of one's sense of well-being in a very negative way.  We know there are blockages with regard to Part V and other issues to be addressed.  The Minister has alluded to this in the plan.  I suggest that if needs be, we look at suspending it for the duration of the crisis.  The extent of departmental monitoring and the approval requirement of local authorities needs to be looked at and I know the Minister is doing this.  I do not know how many different stages there are, but one must go back and double-check with the Department at every stage along the development.  We need to address this.</p> <p>There is also the issue of quick build housing.  This has a bad reputation, but we know Germany has been doing this for years and has bespoke housing constructed offsite and built onsite in a matter of four to six weeks.  This is being done in Ireland by a company which delivers four houses per week.  These are of a high standard, higher than the regulations that apply and they are guaranteed for more than 70 years.</p> <p>Some local authorities have struggled to meet targets, but Fingal County Council has managed to exceed them.  It had a target of 1,376 for the period from 2015 to 2017 but in the period it expects to deliver 2,000 social houses.  It has been buying houses and it has reduced the number of voids from more than 200 to 45, which is 1%.</p> <p>I commend the Minister.  This problem goes to the core of our democracy.  We need to treat it as an emergency and priority and I am glad to see the Minister is doing so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-07-20a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016072000002#CC00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and commend him on the leadership he has shown on this and his genuine and passionate engagement with the House earlier when he put forward his vision for this area.  I particularly commend him for underscoring his commitment on the question of social housing.  I also admire his strong leadership in keeping the housing delivery unit very close to hand with fortnightly reporting.  It is commendable that there will be such strong public accountability and oversight.  I commend the Minister for holding responsibility in this area.</p> <p>Previous speakers have highlighted the concern in the House about the role of the private sector.  It is very strongly emphasised and it would be very important as we implement this to examine the experience of public-private partnerships, and that we examine the extent to which the case is made for public-private partnership.  Is the profit component which is brought in wherever there is a private partnership outweighed by the added benefit?  I ask that this case be made again and again rather than assumed as it comes into practice so we have a rigorous rationale in each case as to why the option is being chosen.</p> <p>As others have stated, we need to build up our local and public capacity in the provision and construction of housing and, in the long term, in the management of housing.  This is an area in which we have seen a depletion at local authority level and a pulling away from managing housing.  When we speak about putting people into houses through social housing, people will need to continue to live in these houses in the long term.  We need to look at maintenance staffing levels, which have been so severely depleted at local authority level.  In the west, many housing estates are half-finished with no clear responsibility.  If we are looking at housing on a grand scale there needs to be thought about how these housing estates will be maintained in the long-term and where responsibility will sit.  We do not want to see companies benefit in the short term and pull away from responsibilities in the medium term.</p> <p>I was a little concerned to see the question of infrastructure placed in the section on building more houses rather than in the section on social housing.  It is very important that if the State invests in infrastructure that it does not simply serve to open up greenfield sites for private development but that it is largely focused on mixed or public housing development, and that this is a priority when it comes to the concrete allocation of these infrastructure funds.  This is a practical suggestion but the detail will be important as to where it goes.</p> <p>We cannot completely sideline the planning question.  This has been adequately discussed by others in the House.  We have seen the fast-tracking of housing on flood plains in the past and the impact this has had.  There is a role for planning which must be maintained.  When we speak about infrastructure and amenities, people living in homes also need to live in communities.  As we look to bring land banks on board and put public land into use, let us also ensure we leave space, even if it is in the medium term rather than the immediate term, to plan for amenities such as green spaces that will make these homes into communities.  This is particularly the case with regard to schooling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=20"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I expect the Minister to work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills in that regard.</p><p>I welcome the Minister placing predictability at the heart of this measure.  There is a concern about leases and that concern will accelerate as the ten-year leases signed in the past five or six years expire.  Where any private vacant stock is taken on board, I urge that purchase be favoured over leasing.</p><p>My final point and perhaps the most important relates to the hidden homeless.  Hidden homelessness is a particular issue for women, particularly for those coming from situations of domestic violence.  In addition to the fact that we must consider refuge places that are appropriate for women leaving violent situations, there are medium-term issues to be addressed.  We must consider the fact that many women who have left such situations are staying with family members in unsuitable conditions and feel very distant from any option to secure accommodation.  At local authority level, for example, they are often required to be living in an area, but they might wish to change location.  This might be crucial to their well-being and family's safety.  Moreover, they might technically have a share in a house.  I might correspond further on the issue of domestic violence, if the Minister is amenable.</p></speech>

There are elements of the programme which relate to victims of domestic violence, but if the Senator has further suggestions to make, I would like to hear them.  </p> <p>Regarding disability issues, I accept the points the Senator made.  In this document there are many areas in which we are signalling intent, but we do not go into precise detail.  There is almost a full page on the subject.  There is a commitment to extend the national housing strategy for people with a disability and ensure it takes effect.  I will talk to the Senator again about the issue separately.  However, there is no lack of ambition.  It is an attempt to include a series of different priorities and ambitions in a single document, without over-emphasising one over the others.</p> <p>In response to other concerns outlined by Members, I wish to get a couple of things straight about the planning system.  Many of the really bad planning decisions made in the past were made under the system in place.  Sometimes councillors were at fault; sometimes it was the fault of planners and sometimes An Bord Plean&aacute;la made poor decisions.  Building large housing estates on flood plains should not have happened, but the changes I am making to the planning system will not make them any less likely to occur.  We must have a system that is robust and that we can trust but in which decisions are made faster.  There is an emergency and the idea that we continue as normal, give everybody his or her say as normal and stick to normal time procedures will not do what we require.  We must make decisions faster, but I emphasise that does not mean that we make poor decisions.</p> <p>Primary legislation will be required to allow and instruct An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do what we will ask it to do under it.  It will be brought through this House as well as the D&aacute;il.  Senators will have an opportunity to make the points they have made about the cost to the public to make objections and observations, the availability of information online and so forth.  We can discuss all of those issues.  I will ask the House to facilitate the passage of that legislation early in the autumn.  I cannot simply say all planning applications for more than 100 houses must go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The current provision is protected by primary legislation which I will have to change.  There will be an opportunity to tease out all of these issues and ensure we protect members the public in their ability to understand what is taking place and make observations and objections should they wish to do so.  At the same time, however, we must resource An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make decisions in a timely manner - 18 weeks.</p> <p>The approach of An Bord Plean&aacute;la will change.  Instead of asking for further information which often pushes a process to over a year in length, it will make decisions in 18 weeks.  The reason I have asked it to do this is that it will put a massive onus on developers to get the application right, consult locally and engage in proper and detailed pre-planning consultation with local authorities to ensure consistency with local development plans and so forth.  Early on I suspect there will be a significant increase in the number of refusals by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as opposed to giving the board the option of seeking further information and the process continuing.  I am telling developers to get their applications in but to ensure they get them right before they are sent in in teasing through all of the issues.  We are changing the emphasis by increasing the responsibility placed on the applicant and then ensuring the system makes decisions faster.  I believe this can work.  Local government will still have a big role to play in pre-planning consultation.  If that consultation does not take place and if the application is not consistent with what local councillors have decided on in the local development plans, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not grant planning permission.  That is the thinking behind what we are doing.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to vacant properties.  There is a great deal in the action plan about what we could do in that regard.  One of the Senator's suggestions is to provide grant aid to renovate properties to make them fit for purpose for rental.  That is exactly what we are proposing to do.  In fact, we are copying a scheme that has been very successful in the United Kingdom under which local authorities can approach a property owner and offer him or her three or five years rent upfront, which can act as a grant to get the property into a suitable condition for renting.  After five years he or she will have a much more valuable property and he or she will have had a sustainable tenant for that period.  There is a series of other proposals to make it easy to make the transition from commercial to residential without having to go through a long planning process to seek a change of use and so forth.  I share the sentiments expressed by the Senator.</p> <p>I wish to make a really important point about public private partnerships, PPPs, although I will probably run out of time.</p></speech>

We are not doing this.  We are setting up a partnership to deliver mixed tenure communities.  It involves private sector input, as well as local authority or approved housing body input, in order that we can have private houses next to social houses, affordable houses, affordable rental accommodation, perhaps some student accommodation or accommodation specifically designed for the elderly or for people with a disability.  It is about trying to achieve mixed tenure.  We will have three flagship projects under way before the end of the year to show how it can be done.  That is what I mean when I talk about the strategic use of public land.  We can provide space on zoned land to put these new projects together.  It is a different approach towards providing social housing.</p> <p>Incidentally, I welcome what Councillor Daith&iacute; Doolan said at one of the stakeholder sessions we held, when he spoke about supporting this approach, whereby 40% or 50% of a housing development might be private sector housing, 20% or 30% might be affordable housing and 20% or 25% might be social housing.  In that way we will create a mix with diverse communities.  We can move early to show how it can be done better than we have in the past.  The idea that every acre of publicly owned land must be filled with mono tenure social housing that is all the same in housing estate after housing estate has created problems for us which we must try to avoid in the future.  The 47,000 new social housing units we will create in the next six years must be integrated, where possible.  Obviously, there will be some social housing estates, but we must also have mixed, diverse communities growing up together and achieving better outcomes.</p> <p>I hope that gives Senators a flavour of the plan.  If they have other suggestions to make, they should send them to us and we will try to take them on board.</p></speech>

I am pleased that it has received such wide support in both Houses.  While that support is a reflection of the consultation with representatives of the Opposition in developing the provisions of the Bill, it is also a reflection of the shared commitment in the Houses to ensure that the commission of investigation into transactions conducted by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, is given every opportunity to perform its functions effectively and efficiently.

If people seek a definition of "new politics", and I have heard many people talking about that definition, this Bill epitomises what is new politics and what politics should be about, namely, achieving consensus in as many areas as possible.  This Bill is the result of extensive negotiations between the Government and the Opposition primarily focused on ensuring the commission of investigation can do a proper job to get to the bottom of these issues on behalf of the citizens of this country.</p> <p>The Bill is important and it will yield results.
