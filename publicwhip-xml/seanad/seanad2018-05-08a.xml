I thank the T&aacute;naiste for taking the time to come to the Chamber.  I know he is very busy, so I appreciate his presence to debate the issue I am raising.</p> <p>I submitted this Commencement matter after last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which heard from Mr. Peter Bunting and Mr. Conal McFeely of the independent assessment team.  They repeated their general frustration that the case of Tony Taylor is not getting the public attention it deserves.  Given that over two years have passed since the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of Mr. Taylor, our view is that his continued detention is wrong and a violation of his human rights.  We have consistently stated that if there is evidence against Mr. Taylor, it should be presented to him and his legal team in open court.  I contend that the most basic right of those who find themselves in prison, particularly for such a prolonged period of time, is to have an opportunity to address and challenge any evidence or any case against them, if such evidence or such a case exists.</p> <p>As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, the problem is that we are being asked to place our trust and our faith in faceless secret British intelligence agencies and services.  The same people have refused to release their files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and told us there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  I suggest that these obscure outlets are not exactly the most trustworthy.  Therefore, it is appropriate that any evidence that exists is not kept hidden and is instead put before Mr. Taylor in court.</p> <p>Over the past two years, the British Government has failed to produce any evidence that could justify Mr. Taylor's continued detention in any way.  We have to appreciate the strain this continued detention is placing on Mr. Taylor's wife and on members of his family, including his parents.  I believe their public description of their stress has shifted this case from the political domain, where it warrants much concern, to the humanitarian and human rights sphere.</p> <p>I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's attendance today.  I was moved to submit this Commencement matter by the frustration of reputable and eminent figures like Mr. Bunting and Mr. McFeely, who are very frustrated about the lack of publicity, focus and attention being given to the case of this Irish citizen.  I hope that through the T&aacute;naiste, we can lift their frustrations and bring the case of Tony Taylor into a warranted public space where we can challenge the very real political and legal concerns that exist regarding his case and his ongoing detention.</p></speech>

Last week, I had an opportunity to brief the D&aacute;il on my engagement regarding Mr. Taylor's case.  I assure the House that my officials have been engaging with this matter on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>The background to the Tony Taylor case is that he is from Derry and in recent years was a member of a dissident republican group.  In 1994, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison after he was seriously injured in a premature explosion in Derry.  He was released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  He served a further three-year sentence from 2011 to 2014 for possession of a rifle.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">The T&aacute;naiste:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In March 2016, he was returned to prison after his early release licence was suspended by the then Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers.</p><p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s case has been discussed regularly with the Northern Ireland Office through my officials at the Belfast secretariat.  My officials have also made visits to Mr. Taylor in Maghaberry Prison on two occasions, most recently in the past few weeks.  I have written to the Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, on the case and I spoke to her on the matter when we met in London last Thursday.</p><p>The Parole Commissioners for Northern Ireland held a parole hearing on Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s revocation of licence in May 2017.  The decision of the parole commissioners at that time was to continue the revocation of licence.  A further review by the parole commissioners is under way and there had been an expectation that the review would conclude in the coming weeks.  However, we understand from discussions with the Northern Ireland Office and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s legal representatives that there may be some delay in that process.  This is clearly not ideal and we have urged that every effort be made to avoid unnecessary delays.</p><p>I am aware that Mr. Taylor has publicly renounced any future engagement in dissident republican activity.  That is to be welcomed as there is no future on this island for political ends to be pursued through violence or the threat of violence.  I have also received a letter from Mr. Taylor's wife, Lorraine, and I am aware of the couple's difficult family circumstances.  I am also aware, as Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile indicated, that there is considerable concern in Northern Ireland across the broad nationalist and republican community about the basis and nature of Mr. Taylor's ongoing detention.  These have all been reflected in our ongoing engagement with the Northern Ireland Office on this matter.</p><p>The recent indications that Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s new parole hearing may take longer than expected is of particular concern, as he has been back in detention for more than two years without being charged or convicted of any offences.  I assure Senators that I and my officials will continue to actively monitor developments in the case and will continue to raise it with the Northern Ireland Office, including, as necessary, the Secretary of State.</p></speech>

The concerns around this case, while predominately emanating from the nationalist and republican constituency, extend throughout a broad spectrum of humanitarian and legal organisations as well as the legal profession in general.  This is effectively a case of internment via remand, which warrants a great deal of concern.</p> <p>I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's comment that his officials are keeping a watching brief on the issue.  His statement will be welcomed by all those inside and outside the Oireachtas who have an interest in the case.  I also share his concern regarding recent indications of a delay in the case, whether intentional or otherwise.  Is this position satisfactory?  What measures can the T&aacute;naiste take above and beyond monitoring the issue?  I am not asking him to step outside the constraints within which he must operate.</p> <p>I was reminded on my journey from Belfast to Dublin this morning that the average period of internment for those interned between 1971 and 1975 was two years.  Tony Taylor now finds himself in prison without evidence being put to him or his legal team for more than two years.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste again for taking the time to come to the House.</p></speech>

It is also appropriate in this debate that we call on all dissident republican groups that have not yet done so to renounce violence and commit to exclusively democratic means of pursuing their political aims.  I pay tribute to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its ongoing work in dealing with the threat posed by dissident republican groups.</p> <p>On the case in question, the dissident republican group to which Mr. Tony Taylor was connected has made clear statements renouncing violence, which I welcome.  I do not know whether information is held on Mr. Taylor that can justify him being in prison.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have raised our concerns about the case.  Holding somebody without publicly producing evidence against them raises real concerns, as I have witnessed in Derry in speaking to people.  I have raised the matter directly with the Secretary of State and will be talking to her again this week.  There is a process under consideration with the parole commissioners.  That is the appropriate process to use in making any decision in this case.  I hope we can ensure decisions will be made without further delay.</p></speech>

There is a presumption that everything goes to plan.  Those who sit in their offices think we will wait for the next person.  We have already been delayed by a few minutes.  It is not your fault, but it is safer for those who have tabled Commencement matters to be here.  In my time, I was here for the start.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  As he will be aware, we are in the full swing of a referendum campaign.  This referendum in particular has taken a turn that is unprecedented.</p><p>The use of social media has been a growing campaigning platform for the past ten years or so.  Unlike other platforms, it has a distinct ability to be financed and co-ordinated online from foreign sources.  This was highlighted by potential Russian influence in the US presidential elections and subversive alt-right campaigns during the Brexit referendum.</p><p>We are only two weeks into the referendum, yet extensive investigative journalism has shown that the use of websites and paid advertising from the &quot;No&quot; campaign has been used at a cost of six figures per day.  Some of the videos are presenting themselves as being RT&Eacute; news bulletins and other websites appearing to be fact-based and objective have been targeted at people's online profiles.</p><p><i>Undecided8.org</i>purported to be unbiased and targeted Facebook users with what seemed to be an unending war chest.  It is linked to the Protect the 8th campaign and it has been sourced, run and funded by a US PR firm linked to Cambridge Analytica.  <i>Undecided8.org</i>used Facebook and Google trackers with the intention of helping with future retargeting, including of people who had clicked on the advertisements before.  The users' data is then vulnerable for future guerilla targeting, as are users of a similar demographic.  <i>Undecided8.org</i>has been shut down thanks to stellar investigation work by technology journalist Gavin Sheridan.  </p><p>However, this is only the start.  Numerous Facebook pages with few followers have suddenly poured resources into paid advertising targeting voters.  These advertisements are dishonest and subversive, and are intended to scaremonger voters who seek to establish their own views.  Referendums have always been subject to differences of opinion and interpretations of proposals.  However, these advertisements are blatantly ignorant of the facts and seek to undermine our democracy.  While I believe the State should never seek to censor campaigns that aim to present their views to the voting public, it also has a responsibility when the voting public has been targeted by a foreign source seeking to deceive undecided voters with resources that eclipse those of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and the Referendum Commission and completely undermine their work.  </p><p>In an unprecedented move, Facebook has written to the Government and SIPO on the topic, the first time Facebook has reached out to any state government in regard to fake news during a public vote.  As of the past hour, Facebook has announced that it is suspending all referendum based adverts from sources outside the State.  This is a most welcome move and it should act as a call to action for Google and, more important, the State.  </p><p>We are now in a space where a private entity has done more to uphold democracy in the State than the State itself.  We are also failing to deal with the issue of hundreds of thousands of euro per day from foreign sources being spent by a campaign.  We are failing to uphold any notion of fear and even playing fields.  We are failing to deliver any resources which allow SIPO to effectively investigate whether campaigns receive donations from international sources and are failing to update our electoral legislation to deal with online campaigning as a platform.</p><p>I welcome that the Government has agreed to progress the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in would amend the Bill and its objectives are timely.  It will make the sources of fake news transparent, but we still do not have regulation from a State level of what comes after.  SIPO needs effective resources and powers here and now.  We are 17 days away from a public vote, and all of the Government responses seem to be after the fact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Like the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election, I fear we will look back on the referendum in late May and say it was influenced by false reports online, and we will be left to deal with the consequences of that.</p></speech>

I must apologise for the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is unable to attend but he has asked me to respond on his behalf.</p> <p>Senator Warfield is familiar with the 1997 Electoral Act, which provides the framework for dealing with political donations and sets out a wide range of related matters on the funding of political parties; the reimbursement of election expenses; the establishment of election expenditure limits; the disclosure of election expenditure; the setting of limits on permissible donations; the prohibition of certain donations; the disclosure of donations; and the registration of third parties who accept donations given for political purposes which exceed &euro;100.</p> <p>The Act also provides for the independent supervision of the donations regime by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  In broad terms, where a political donation in excess of &euro;100 is received by an election candidate, an account in a financial institution must be opened in the State.  In addition, there are a number of reporting requirements that need to be met in regard to the holding of such an account, for example, financial statements itemising all transactions in the account are required to be produced annually.  While SIPO does not disclose the contents of political donations accounts unless ordered to do so by a court, donation statements made by election candidates, Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament or political parties are, on the other hand, made publicly available.  A donation statement is required when a political donation exceeding an aggregate of &euro;600 is received from a donor.</p> <p>Furthermore, under the Act an election candidate, a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament, a political party or a third party who accepts donations for political purposes may not accept a range of donations, including a donation, of whatever value, from an individual other than an Irish citizen who resides outside the island of Ireland or a donation from a body corporate or unincorporated body of persons which does not keep an office in the island of Ireland from which one or more of its principal activities is directed.  Clearly, foreign donations of any amount are prohibited under the Act and where such donations have been made, it is incumbent upon the recipient to either return the donation to the donor or to remit it to SIPO.  In addition, the recipients of prohibited donations must comply with a direction given by SIPO in the matter.  Failure to do so is an offence under the Act.  The Standards in Public Office Commission may make such inquiries as it considers appropriate and may require any person, political party or third party to furnish any such information as it considers appropriate for the purpose of exercising its duties under the Act.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the principal purpose of the Act is to provide for openness and transparency with regard to political funding at elections and at referenda.  The Act's provisions relate to persons, political parties and third parties who accept donations for political purposes.</p> <p>The Senator is concerned that under the current law persons or organisations who do not accept political donations do not fall within scope of the Act and are not prohibited from using their resources in support of promoting a particular outcome at an election or a referendum.  Legislating to change that would require considerable consideration by the Oireachtas before it would be changed.  However, the Senator is raising an issue of systematic operations that may be targeting elections that have nothing to do with any of those contestants in the election.  That is an issue we need to consider as an Oireachtas in terms of how it is appropriate that that sort of activity should be regulated but as I said, the Standards in Public Office Commission is empowered to pursue anyone who accepts donations from overseas as they would be breaking the law.</p></speech>

I understand about political donations.  Many of us here have been through two election campaigns.  Does the Minister welcome today's announcement by Facebook?  Would the Government encourage Google and, by extension, YouTube to do the same?  The Minister mentioned the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  Could SIPO not be empowered with finance to take on its role under legislation in this campaign?  Are conversations being had at Cabinet level about the regulation of this entire area?</p></speech>

It provides a challenge to us as to how a political system should manage that.  We, of course, value freedom of expression and the right of people to make their views known.  However, there are clearly levels of activity that would be a cause of concern.  It would appear that Facebook also feels that the level of activity is a cause of concern to it.</p> <p>Legislation, however, cannot be made on the hoof.  This is an area in which the Minister cannot assume powers which the Oireachtas has not given him.  We would need to think carefully about the implications of seeking to regulate this area because it goes to the heart of people's right to express themselves.  We need to think long, hard and carefully as to how we would address this issue.  There is no doubt that as one scans the world stage, one sees activities, whether they be bots or other operations, which are a cause of concern to anyone who wants to see citizens make a discerning decision based on objective and fair information being presented to them, as well as people having the chance to campaign for or against a proposition in a fair way.</p> <p>While I cannot speak for the Minister, I recognise there is an issue to which the Oireachtas will need to return if it is not regulated at European level, as this is not just an Irish issue.</p></speech>

It was originally designed for Scoil Cholumb&aacute;in and Scoil Therese primary schools.  When they closed, St Gabriel's was allowed to use the building.  It is fair to say that this building was never designed to be a special needs school.  The building's conditions are unacceptable for the 43 pupils and staff.  These are children, between the age of four and 18, who are most vulnerable with severe to profound intellectual disabilities.  I have met with the parents and visited the school.  The school campus does not match the mission statement of the school or the philosophy espoused by the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills.  Neither does it match the capital building programme outlined by the Department or the investment in education facilities, particularly in special needs, across the city of Cork.</p> <p>Urgent funding needs to be put into this school's buildings.  The school&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; association has commenced a GoFundMe page.  This is a matter of priority.  This is a statement of how we treat the most vulnerable children who need the help of the State.  The education they are receiving is absolutely exemplary.  The school building, however, is unbelievably bad.  Many of the pupils are non-verbal.  The school enrols children with dual diagnosis with severe to profound intellectual disabilities and autism.  The school building, however, is not fit for purpose.  If we believe in early intervention to allow students to achieve their full potential, then this school&rsquo;s building requires a complete overhaul and a commitment from the Government to change it as a matter of urgency.  I hope the Government will prioritise the upgrading and refurbishment of this special needs school.  It would send a message to the children, parents and staff that we will provide for them.</p> <p>Being involved with the COPE Foundation, I recognise the importance of every individual in society.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on this plea for help from St. Gabriel&rsquo;s school and its community.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the matter and the Minister for being present.</p></speech>

My Department clearly accepts that the accommodation in St. Gabriel's special school is not fit for purpose.  It has spatial limitations, particularly for children with challenging behaviour.  The school caters for 43 pupils and it has a strong complement of teachers and SNAs.  The pupil-teacher ratio is 1:1.9 and, therefore, the State provides significant support but there is a recognition that the facilities need to be addressed.  I understand the school applied last year for improved accommodation and my officials have visited the school and assessed that need.  They have also taken the opportunity to discuss with the NCSE the general need in the area and the school will have the potential to expand the scope of its services to meet the local need.</p> <p>The adjacent accommodation is owned by the Diocese of Cork and Ross.  St. Gabriel's special school currently occupies two classrooms in this adjacent building by agreement with the diocese.  My Department will send an official to visit the school authority tomorrow, 9 May, to progress the assessment of the proposed works, finalise the scope of works and work out how they can be moved forward and in what delivery mode they can be done.  My Department recognises the seriousness of the case and will work with the school to seek a solution to its needs.</p></speech>

It is a unique school and it shares a site with the Brothers of Charity and the Diocese of Cork and Ross.  The staff need has been met by the Department but changes are needed to the built environment and the learning environment.

He said during his visit to the US that the customs partnership is a crazy plan because it will create a whole new web of bureaucracy.  He has gone against his own Prime Minister on this issue.  Of course, he has not offered a different plan other than to come up with what has been termed the "Boris border".  This type of seamless and frictionless border has not been tested because it does not exist anywhere in the world.  We know this because a month ago, it was confirmed in a House of Commons report that no technological solutions, other than the theoretical, are available anywhere in the world to keep the Irish Border open if Britain leaves the customs union and the Single Market.  The enterprise secretary in Westminster has said that thousands of jobs will be lost if Britain does not sign up to one or the other because of the extent of Britain's reliance on frictionless trade with the EU.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for organising statements on corporate manslaughter.  I propose to circulate to Members a letter from the Irish Haemophilia Society on this issue.  This is relevant because the hepatitis C scandal is being seen again in a new guise.  Neither the hepatitis C scandal nor the CervicalCheck cancer issue that is now before us can be attributed to mismanagement alone.  Once more, the health service has covered things up by not informing people when they should have been informed.  That is what happened 27 years ago in the hepatitis C case, which resulted in two tribunals, more inquires and recommendations.  In 2006, the Law Reform Commission recommended that a corporate manslaughter Bill should be introduced to ensure people who fail to act are held to account, not by losing their jobs, resigning or going off with their pensions, but by going to jail for up to 12 years.  Such a Bill has not been passed in this House, however.  There are times when we do statements.  Maybe the next legislation we debate should be the Committee Stage of the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016.  I will raise this again during the statements on corporate manslaughter.  Why are we talking about investigations by commissions of inquiry?  Such investigations should follow criminal investigations and interviews carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda.  We can put in place the systems that are required after that.  People have died as a result of mismanagement.  We were told in this House less than two years ago that there was no need for the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016 because people could go to jail under existing legislation.  That can be tested now on foot of a Garda investigation, rather than an investigation set up by this House or the other House.</p></speech>

I explained how the Carltona doctrine or principles allow public servants, including those who took decisions and hid information in this case, to remain faceless.  I want to see Tony O'Brien go, but there are other people who need to go too.  If he goes, what about the people beneath him who did not report?  Where does the responsibility lie?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Nowhere is more the case than in the health service where we have had scandal after scandal, yet the wrongdoers always remain in place and there is no accountability.  I am all for protecting workers and ensuring they are treated fairly and correctly.  However, when senior officials deliberately set out to hide information that cost people their lives, there must be accountability.  Surely it cannot stop at the desk of the Minister or chief executive officer as they cannot have their finger on every pulse at all times.  <br/><br/>My colleague, Senator Mark Daly, spoke a few moments ago about the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson.  The <i>EUobserver</i>website features an interesting article under the title, &quot;At Northern Irish border, Brexit risks hard-won peace&quot;.  It begins as follows:</p><blockquote>In Belfast's Alexandra Park stands a very hard border.  A three-meter high wall cuts through the hilly green meadow, separating the republican Catholic and the unionist Protestant communities. </blockquote><p>The piece then discusses the risks presented by a border in the event that Brexit goes wrong.  The utterances of the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, and some other British Ministers indicate that Brexit is going wrong.  As I have stated numerous times, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, have done a tremendous job.  However, all of their work will come to nothing if the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom falls apart and the Brexit negotiations collapse.  It is beginning to look as if that could happen because the clock is ticking and nobody seems to have a clear idea of where we are going.  One of my fears arising from the current cervical screening disaster is that the importance of Brexit may slip off the agenda.  For this reason, I seek an assurance that Brexit remains a high priority.<br/><br/>Last week, I asked for a debate on corporate governance in the public sector, with particular reference to the Carltona doctrine, which protects individuals who clearly act wrongfully in their positions, and how this principle made its way into the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</p></speech>

We must, in legislation, address open disclosure and the issue of corporate manslaughter.  Major questions also arise regarding procurement and ensuring the best and most appropriate outcomes in this area.  I will bring proposals to the House on this issue before the summer.  I hope all sides will work with me on that.</p> <p>Facebook has announced it will not accept advertisements purchased abroad in the lead-up to the referendum on the eighth amendment.  I first highlighted this issue last November at the World Forum on Democracy, which focused on big data.  In recent months, I have been pressing relentlessly for the implementation of necessary regulation and legislation in this area and for social media platforms to step up and take some responsibility in the interim.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago, officials from Facebook appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment at which I and others challenged them to take action in response to the large amount of political advertising and sponsored content being targeted at Irish voters, including advertisements from unaccountable, unidentified and international actors.  We urged them to ensure Ireland would not be another bad example of this practice.  The committee was informed that Facebook did not have the technical capacity to provide the transparency required.  I urged the company to stop selling advertising if it could not deliver transparency.</p> <p>When I made the same demand last week, I was informed it was almost impossible to meet, yet today Facebook has agreed to stop selling advertisements to unaccountable international actors in respect of our referendum and the decision which is for Irish people to make as part of our electoral process.  The company's decision is correct and in line with the spirit of our electoral laws.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nonetheless, our electoral laws and online regulations need reform and the ultimate solution must be legislation.  The onus is on Google, through its advertisements, and Youtube to take responsibility and ensure they follow the spirit of our electoral laws by also declaring that they will not take internationally purchased referendum advertisements.  I urge Google and Youtube which are linked and any other relevant platform to take action.  </p><p>As well as the legislative work needed for online regulation, there is a concern about a loophole in the Data Protection Bill 2018 which could potentially allow parties or candidates to hire companies such as Cambridge Analytica or Cantor.  That is not in the true spirit of Article 9.2(d) of the general data protection regulation.  It exceeds what is included in it.  It behoves the Government to take the opportunity to get this right from the beginning by ensuring we close any loophole which could be manipulated in that way.  I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality will take this on board.</p></speech>

From today such advertisements will be rejected.  <i>The Irish Times</i>reports that a combination of machine learning and good old-fashioned people power will govern this initiative.  Facebook has some automated tools at its disposal that would help to identify and reject advertisements.  In case anything slips through the net, the advocacy groups and the transparent referendum initiative will have an input into the reporting process.  These groups have dedicated communications channels with Facebook.  While there are no facilities for ordinary citizens to contact Facebook directly and report advertisements, one could bring an advertisement to the attention of the advocacy groups and the transparent referendum initiative.  I encourage all citizens to be proactive in the absence of legislation.</p><p>We are in the full swing of the referendum campaign that has taken an unprecedented turn.  <i>undecided8</i>has been shut down thanks to the stellar investigation carried out by the tech journalist Gavin Sheridan.  However, as he knows, it is only a start.  The State has a responsibility to the voting public which has been targeted by a foreign source which is seeking to deceive undecided voters and its resources are greater than those of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and the Referendum Commission combined.  It is undermining their work.  This should absolutely be a call to action for Google, Youtube and the State.  The State is failing to give resources to SIPO to investigate effectively whether campaigns are receiving donations from international sources.  Will we continue to have zero defence against foreign influences on public votes and will the online free-for-all continue? </p></speech>

She was very maternal.  She was one of the founders of the National Woman's Council of Ireland, NWCI.  She held passionate views which she expressed strongly but she was never nasty.  There was not a nasty bone in her body.</p><p>Another thing I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the increasing spread of a noxious form of political correctness around the place and employed by civil servants around this House.  I sent a letter to a group of my voters.  It was returned to me on the advice of the joint services committee, I believe, because the letter had the temerity to mention two words, one of which was "abortion" and the other of which was "referendum".  It is bloody ridiculous if, as a public representative, one cannot exercise one's freedom to express one's opinion on these matters which are a matter of significant current national debate.  What kind of little earwigs are there around the place who are trying to stop people from expressing opinions?  It is nonsensical.  I would like to see something done about it.  Is somebody somewhere, apart from myself, going to stand up and say, "Enough is enough".  We are elected public representatives.  We are elected with the intention of expressing our views publicly and it is not up to some little nitpicker to say one cannot use the words "abortion" or "referendum" in a communication with the electorate.  It is absolutely nonsensical.  I would like to ask the Leader if he can do something about it.  Can he raise the matter and see what the committee is at?  Why is it doing these sorts of things?  Why is it curtailing freedom of expression for public representatives?</p></speech>

Maybe the Leader can raise the matter at a higher level.  I do not think it is emanating from the civil servants within the House.  There is a political foundation for it.</p></speech>

She was one of the individuals in our political system who would have spread enlightenment and brought the country forward.</p> <p>In regard to the second point the Senator raised, I would agree with him if I felt there was any attempt to curtail the right of an elected representative to make his or her views known to his or her constituents or electorate.  I am sure the Leader will address that.</p> <p>I also want to mention that on 26 April I highlighted the very serious issue of the lack of school places for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, in the country, in particular in Fingal, specifically Skerries.  There were certain inaccuracies during the course of that debate, which I want to clarify.  S&iacute;olta provides an excellent preschool service for children with ASD free of charge.  Georgina, who was one of the parents I mentioned, is very pleased with her tutor.  </p> <p>Today I want to ask the Minister for Health to publish the two reports commissioned in August 2017, one by the Department of Health and another by the HSE, in respect of autism and those on the ASD spectrum.  We were told they were two essential pieces of work in order to further inform the Bill which was to ensure we have a national strategy for people in the country who have autism.  I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, is extremely busy, especially over the past two weeks with CervicalCheck and the referendum on the eighth amendment, and much else besides.  We need the reports to be published and the ASD Bill to go to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We need an ASD strategy, and it should contain an action plan such as that which we had for jobs and have for housing.  An action plan is badly needed so that our children and adults with autism can make their full contribution as citizens to their country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Failing that, I would like the Minister to come to the House and explain what is delaying that Bill, which we first debated a year ago last Thursday.

This is an issue that will not go away.  It is an issue that is urgent.  Somebody mentioned earlier that the clock is ticking.  The clock is ticking for these children whose parents watch in anguish when they see more time pass that does not allow them avail of the services that could allow them progress.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister and encourage him to publish these two reports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#S00200"><p>I am sad to say I am raising yet another issue with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I am getting calls from people anxious about whether the Government is making investigations into the drug sodium valproate, branded as Epilim, after it emerged that it was linked with birth defects and developmental issues.  The HSE said it was preparing to create a register of all the women in Ireland whose babies may have been damaged in the womb by the drug.  Again, we have families wondering if they are on the register of people affected by this drug.  We are still talking about what will happen to the women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal and here comes another one.</p> <p>There may be as many as 400 Irish children with birth defects and developmental issues because their mothers took Epilim.  Before 2014, there was no warning label on the drug's packaging.  The Oireachtas health committee heard last month that there was a mismatch between risks of the drug being known and women being told about them.  Health professionals in the United Kingdom were warned about the dangers of the drug ten years before those in Ireland were informed.  There was also the difference between what health professionals knew and what patients were told.</p> <p>Again, there is a problem with communications.  Why does the culture still exist whereby doctors can withhold patients' information and leave them in the dark about their own medical history?  Primary care should always put the patients first.  If something shows up on a test and the treating doctor is informed, the patient - man or woman - needs to be contacted over the telephone.  There should never be a practice of sending a text telling the patient to make a new appointment to discuss the matter.  Patients should make an appointment, but they should not have to pay another fee.  The fact that they may be asked to pay a fee for going back to the doctor is another issue.  That practice has to stop.  </p> <p>Patients must be able to trust that they are getting the full facts as soon as possible from their doctors, who in turn must feel free to be able to share the sensitive information without fear of legal consequences.  That has to include issues that become apparent about drugs which were prescribed in the past, but there must be change from the top down.  Too many Departments are keeping things from Ministers, the way the HSE keeps things from its patients across all areas.  Not only does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing, no one knows what is going on.</p> <p>We need to call time on that.  Enough is enough.  We can no longer reel from one controversy to another and act as if it is business as usual.  The HSE has got to work better for us.  We are paying for it.  We can no longer hear the words, "lessons were learned and it will not happen again".  Our citizens voted for us.  We work for them.  We should be their voice.</p> <p>In terms of the HSE, the Taoiseach has said there needs to be radical change.  I am sure people are rolling their eyes now wondering what will change.  If we are still sitting here and getting it wrong, there has to be change.  I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what is happening with this drug.</p></speech>

First, can the Leader update us in the coming days on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016?  This Bill was No. 100 of 2016 and was sponsored by the Leader, Senator Buttimer, on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I understand there are some difficulties going on in the background with respect to this Bill, which require further work.  Clearly, the Minister is aware of all of that.  I had some discussions with parties on this Bill in recent days and I am led to believe there are now difficulties with it and the progression of the legislation appears to have been stalled, but let us get the correct version of what is happening.  The Leader might forward me a briefing note on it.  The Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is busy.  She is doing a great deal of good work but the Leader might provide me with a briefing note or some clarification on the status of this Bill, where it is now and when it is proposed that the next Stage will be taken.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I formally second the amendment proposed by Senator Warfield regarding No. 20 on the Order Paper.</p></speech>

Between 11,000 and 12,000 calls have been made to the helpline but only about one third of these calls have been returned.  The helpline has stated calls from women who had a diagnosis of cancer are given priority, which is proper order.  In recent days, 500 calls were made to people who were concerned about their tests.  The CervicalCheck helpline could not give a date, however, as to when the rest of the calls would be addressed.  That is not good enough.  The Minister has made funds and resources available to GPs to look after patients who have concerns and to do repeat smear tests.</p> <p>While the Minister is busy and should not necessarily be requested to attend the House, would it be possible for Members to get a briefing or update on where we are at with this helpline?  We must not forget the thousands of women whose lives have been saved because of smear testing.  That should not go unmentioned.  We must urge women to continue to have smear tests done.</p></speech>

This is to be welcomed and we hope Google will follow suit.</p> <p>There may be a loophole, however, with regard to Internet ad-handling companies.  These are Irish-based companies which can receive funding from international companies to advertise on their behalf on the Internet.  We have to be cognisant of this.  There is a short window of opportunity for international companies to advertise and, in some cases, give false information to the Irish people.  We are in the lead-up to the referendum on 25 May.  It is important that the Irish people receive correct information and there is not interference from foreign companies with digital advertising.  Irish companies, which are in the business of ad handling, should be aware that Facebook has taken some leadership today, and it we hope to see Google do likewise.  I hope these Irish-based companies, for the want of a few bob, will not advertise foreign companies and take advantage of a potential loophole.</p></speech>

I attended the funeral this morning and the homily given by the priest was very fitting of the varied career she had both in politics and education.  I know we are thinking of her husband, Bob, and her family at this time.</p> <p>A recent survey found Irish people have an 80% positive viewpoint of immigration and migration in general.  This is to be welcomed.  When one looks at the atmosphere in the UK, France and across continental Europe where, unfortunately, far-right nationalist parties are beginning to gain traction with anti-immigrant rhetoric, it is good that Ireland, an open country with its own history of migrants - I know myself as someone who emigrated many years ago - is proud of and celebrates immigration.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to discuss the possibility of an international immigrant day in Ireland in the near future?</p></speech>

However, I prefer to listen to the Business Secretary, Mr. Greg Clark, the Brexit Secretary, Mr. David Davis, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Philip Hammond, and the Prime Minister, Mrs. May.  We are well aware of the divisions within the British Government and the Tory Party.  However, they all know they have to avoid a hard border within Ireland and they do not want a border between the islands of Ireland and Britain.  These are matters for negotiation and we will have to be patient while the negotiators hammer out the issues behind all our backs in Brussels.</p><p>Another debate on this would be welcome but not until the outcome of the leaders' summit in June is known.  I plead with Members to be patient until then.  I wish Michel Barnier and all the other negotiators well as they attend to their work diligently.  Let them at it.</p></speech>

I served with her on the justice committee and I travelled abroad with her.  I always found her affable and she was a formidable but fair opponent.  She will be a loss to politics.  If my memory serves me correctly, her father was from Dunmanway in west Cork where he served as a police officer.  She had that west Cork link and she was a close friend of a great ally, and sometimes foe, of mine, the great former Deputy, P.J. Sheehan.  They were great friends but her west Cork connection may be where she got her fighting skills from.</p></speech>

On my own behalf and on behalf of my party, I offer my sympathies to Monica Barnes's husband, Bob, and her family.  I commend her on a life well lived.  She should be extolled for her diligence as a public servant.  She probably was the epitome of the wing of Fine Gael many of us want to be part of.  I had the pleasure of meeting her a few weeks ago at the back door of Leinster House and she was full of life looking forward to the referendum campaign.  She was due to take part in a press conference last week.  That shows how vulnerable we all are and how precious life is.</p> <p>Monica Barnes was a politician I grew to admire and I had the pleasure of meeting her on a number of occasions.  She was always effusive in offering support and encouragement.  As previous speakers said, and as has been reported in the media, she worked tirelessly on behalf of women and her constituents.  She did the State a huge service and I extend my deepest sympathies to her family.</p> <p>Senator Daly raised the issue of Brexit and the ongoing machinations within the UK Government.  It would be preferable if we did not get involved in that.  The Government is clear regarding the priority of Brexit and its position on it.  There has been no deviation from that.  As Senator Coghlan said, Mr. Barnier and Mr. Tusk have been clear regarding the Commission's approach and it is incumbent on us to allow for progress to be made at the next Council meeting.  We are clear as a Government on what is our position.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, will continue to represent the Government and build alliances throughout Europe.  It is important though, as Senator Daly correctly said, that the issue be well flagged and that we highlight the rolling maul that is the British position while, at the same time, recognising that we have an obligation and a duty to respond as a Government on behalf of our citizens and on an all-island basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am glad the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, will be in the House later on regarding corporate manslaughter.  I would be happy to have that matter discussed.  I would remind Senator Daly that his own party has Private Members' time any time it wishes to bring the Bill forward.  That time is available to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Government is not blocking the Bill coming back as he knows quite well.  It is a matter we will tease out with the Minister for Justice and Equality this evening.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of accountability.  It is important that we recognise that there is a need for accountability.  The Government has been very clear on that, on the matters of the health system or on any matter to do with governance of public bodies, moneys, utilities or services.  People want accountability and the Government wants it.  We demand that and it should happen.</p><p>There is a question that must be posed and I do not fly a flag for anybody, other than the Irish citizens that we represent.  What do we want to have here?  Do we want to have the HSE chief executive gone now or do we want to see the mess cleaned up?  This is a tragedy.  This is a scandal.  I do not believe it is served by saying a head is needed, and I do not say that Senator Craughwell is saying that to be fair to him.  This is about ensuring that everything that can be done in the next few weeks to reassure the women of Ireland and the families can be done so that we will never revisit this again.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that there is a need to have a high priority in terms of corporate governance and what it means to be in a position of responsibility.  I fully subscribe to that viewpoint.  People cannot be left to walk away and left without having to pay the price of being held to account.  I am always of that viewpoint, but let us get to the facts.  That is why we have established an independent investigation.  Let us then make our decisions based on the results that come back.  I am happy to debate that at any time.</p><p>I refer to the points made by Senator McFadden on the issue of cervical cancer.  I am told the helpline had nearly 11,000 phonecalls.  There are over 7,600 callbacks to be made.  Some of that involves a clinical consultation, some of that involves a doctor or nurse being involved and checking and collating information.  In accepting some of the criticism that has been made, I think it is important to reassure people that the quality of the callback that will be given is important as well.  We all accept that the concerns and fears of the women and families must be addressed and we must do everything possible to ensure that the callback from the telephone helpline takes place in a timely, prompt manner.  I hope that will happen.</p><p>I know the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Taoiseach have been very strong and strident on the returning of calls and the provision of accurate clinical information.  We must respond in a matter of days rather than prolonging it for people.  That is something we need to see continually kept at the heart of this.  We must give information to women and reassure them, as the Taoiseach and the Minister have done, on the smear test and redress.</p><p>I refer to the issue of Facebook as raised by Senators Higgins and Warfield.  I welcome the decision of Facebook to ban paid political advertisements from outside the jurisdiction.  I commend the transparency campaigners who have highlighted the need for this type of influence to be stopped.  It is also important to recognise that Facebook has a responsibility which today it is living up to.  As Senator Higgins rightly said, if there are anomalies regarding the GDPR in Article 9.2(d) then let us get it right rather than having to continually revisit it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The whole issue of social media advertising, as well as publishing on social media, is an area where we need to see quick action taken.  Senator Warfield tabled a Commencement matter this afternoon in which he mentioned the Russian election.  Of course we do not know that the Russians influenced the American election yet but we will await some of the results.  I believe it is important that we call out people who interfere in our democracy.  I welcome the fact this is taking place.</p><p>The level and type of campaigning has changed.  As Senator Warfield said in his remarks earlier, it is important to recognise that the way we do business is different now.  This means we must all be aware of the consequences.  It is important that we have an electoral commission in our country that will grapple with the idea.  This morning we saw a most despicable attempt to denigrate and degrade the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, by certain people who put up posters outside his constituency office on a route to a school.  It beggars belief that this could be tolerable or acceptable in any democracy.  I condemn such behaviour in any shape or form.  As politicians, we can argue within the four white lines of the D&aacute;il, Seanad or council chambers.  We can participate in elections and we are held to account.  We have rules and regulations under which we are governed, but some of the behaviour is unacceptable and should be called out for what it is: thuggery of the worst type.</p><p>I join Senators Norris and Reilly in seeking clarity with regard to the publication of materials.  You are right, a Chathaoirligh, that it is not from the Civil Service, to be fair.  I believe it has to do with the issue around the McKenna judgment and what can and cannot be used by the Houses of the Oireachtas when it comes to the printing of material.  I do not believe we are precluded from communicating with our constituents but we are prohibited in electoral contests, whether for the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, or in a referendum from expressly asking for a "Yes" or "No" or a number one vote.  However, it raises a question that perhaps we could look at through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or perhaps in a wider forum such as the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The question relates to how we communicate with people and what we can and cannot do.</p><p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of his Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill.  Again, I am happy to have the Minister come to the House.  It is not that we are trying to preclude the Bill from coming back.  There are issues the Minister is keen to get right in the Bill, from what I am told.  Again, we will be happy to see that come back.  I commend Senator Reilly on his work.</p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of Epilim medication.  I know that in 2014 and 2017 the European Medicines Agency strengthened and enhanced the advertising restrictions on its use.  I suppose it is fair to say that the majority of doctors, GPs and nurses do not communicate bad news over the telephone.  They do so in a certain way.  Communication over the telephone is not the practice but Senator Murnane O'Connor might be best advised to raise it as a Commencement matter.  She may get a more expeditious response in that way.</p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  My information for the Senator is that the work around amendments to the Bill continues as we speak.  Several issues are outstanding, from what I am told.  I do not have the specific information the Senator is looking for.  Amendments were being worked on but I do not have any new information or an indicative timetable for the Member.  However, I would be happy to keep him involved when I get that information for him.  It is important legislation that we need to see coming back to the House.  I am happy to take Senator Warfield's amendment to the Order of Business, which I forgot to mention that.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan referenced Facebook, and I have responded on that point.  Senator Richmond has an interesting proposal relating to an immigration day.  As he said, it is important to recognise that 80% of people have a positive viewpoint.  That is something I welcome.  I certainly concur with Senator Richmond that we cannot allow a situation where we adopt a far-right approach in our rhetoric, behaviour or attitudes.  One of the best things that happened was when Alan Shatter was Minister for Justice and Equality and he brought in the citizenship ceremonies.  We also have need for an ongoing integration policy that must live up to the highest standard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend Senator Richmond on his proposal.

I am also pleased to report that it received broad support on its recent passage through the Lower House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill is substantial and will completely overhaul Ireland's anti-corruption regime.  It consolidates seven anti-corruption Acts from as far back as 1889 up to 2010.  As well as repealing and replacing the previous legislation, the Bill before us introduces a raft of new offences.  Most important, it will provide for more severe penalties for those who engage in corrupt behaviour.</p><p>The Bill is a central piece of the Government's 2017 white collar crime package.  It is a priority piece of proposed legislation from the Government, aimed at combatting corruption at all levels of society.  This is extremely important as Ireland needs to protect its reputation on the world stage as being a safe place in which to do business.  The Bill is also a response to a number of international organisations which have a monitoring and evaluation role in regard to corruption.  Ireland is a party to a number of these international conventions.  We take these commitments very seriously.  The Bill reflects those international commitments.</p><p>The instruments include the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, the EU anti-corruption convention, the UN Convention against Corruption and the OECD convention on bribery of foreign public officials.  Our membership of these key international anti-corruption groups affords us a further opportunity to review the various anti-corruption measures we have already in place and to improve our laws in light of our experience and participation in these important international fora.</p><p>This Bill addresses the public and private sector.  However, it has a particular focus on public officials acting in the course of their position and I believe this is only right, having regard to the high level of trust placed in them.  The penalties proposed are severe and fit with the seriousness of the crime involved.  The penalties for conviction on indictment for the main corruption offences are up to ten years imprisonment and-or an unlimited fine.  There are additional penalties a court can impose on certain public officials for a breach of the public's trust through corruption.  The courts have been given powers under the Bill to remove certain officials from office and to exclude them from holding office for up to ten years, subject to the safeguards as set out in the Bill.  This can be in addition to any other penalties under the Bill. </p><p>As regards suspected bribes, while they can already be seized and forfeited under existing legislation, the Bill strengthens these provisions by allowing the courts to order the forfeiture of assets equal to the value of any bribe received.  I am pleased to be providing for a number of recommendations from the Mahon tribunal.  For instance, the Bill provides for a new offences covering public officials who use confidential information obtained in the course of their duties to corruptly obtain an advantage.  There is another new provision which criminalises making payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends, in turn, to use them as bribes.  </p><p>It is also intended to enhance the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to bring prosecutions by providing for extended presumptions of corruption.  For instance, a presumption of corruption may arise where a person with an interest in the functions being discharged by a public official makes a payment to that official.  This could be, for example, where an applicant for planning permission makes a payment to a planning official.  This presumption will also now apply to payments made to persons connected to the official, such as family members and close business associates of that official.</p><p>Turning to the detail of the Bill, I wish to outline its key provisions.  Section 2 defines the key terms used in the Bill, such as "Irish official", "foreign official" and "Irish public body".  These categories need separate definition as some particular provisions apply specifically to those within the public sector, such as Part 4 of the Bill which contains the presumptions relating to corruption.  The term "corruptly" is defined addressing a recommendation from the OECD in an earlier evaluation in this regard and the text replicates the definition contained in the 2010 Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act.</p><p>Section 5 of the Bill defines the offences of active and passive corruption, meaning persons who corruptly offer an advantage which is active corruption and those who corruptly accept a bribe which is passive corruption.  These offences may be prosecuted under this section and no longer contain reference to corruption of or by an agent.  While this term was used in the description of the original offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, the modern definition of "agent" was expanded to cover a very broad spectrum of people so that the agency principle is no longer applicable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As was previously the case, the offences encompass corruption within both the public and private sectors and the reference to office employment position or business is intended to cover all public and private sector occupations, including voluntary bodies and sporting and charitable organisations.  Deleting the usage of the term "agent" was recommended by the OECD in the course of its evaluation of Ireland's implementation of the OECD anti-bribery convention.</p><p>Section 6 gives effect to a recommendation from the Council of Europe.  It provides for a discrete offence of trading in influence, which prohibits the promise of an undue advantage to someone who asserts they can exert an improper influence over a public official's decision-making capacity.  Like the corruption offence, this section covers both active and passive trading in influence.  Subsection (3) makes it clear that it is immaterial whether the alleged ability to exert improper influence existed or whether the supposed influence led to the intended result.  The provision in regard to trading in influence is also contained in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.</p><p>Section 7 criminalises any act of an Irish official carried out in the course of their official position with the intent of corruptly obtaining an advantage for anybody.  It differs from the main corruption offence in that it is not required that another party is involved.  A new provision in subsection (2) makes it an offence to use confidential information obtained through their office for this very purpose.  This new provision reflects a recommendation of the Mahon tribunal.</p><p>Also giving effect to a recommendation from the Mahon tribunal, section 8 contains a new offence of giving a gift etc. to another person where the donor knows or ought to reasonably know that the payment might be used to facilitate the commission of an offence under the Act.</p><p>Section 9 extends the existing offence of knowingly using a false document, to include the creation of such a document with intent to induce another person to carry out an act relating to his or her office or business, and contains an updated modern definition of "document" at subsection (3) covering a broad range of electronic records.</p><p>Section 10 provides for a new offence of corruptly threatening harm to a person, intending to influence someone to carry out an act in regard to his or her office, employment or business.  I believe that this provision is a worthwhile innovation, reflecting the fact that a threat can be used in place of offering a bribe, when seeking to influence the actions of another in a corrupt manner.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill contains provisions in regard to the jurisdiction of the State in circumstances where elements of the corruption offence take place outside the State or indeed only partly within the State.</p><p>Section 11 clarifies that a person may be tried in the State if any element of the offence occurs here, for instance, where an offer of a bribe Is made abroad but received in Ireland, reflecting a similar provision contained in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.</p><p>Section 12 provides for extensive extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of corruption occurring outside the State, for instance, where the relevant act takes place aboard an Irish ship or aircraft, or where the person concerned is an Irish citizen or official, or an Irish registered company or body corporate as set out therein.  Subsections (3) to (5) of section 12 are additional provisions inserted to give full effect to Article 7 of the European Convention on fighting corruption, and to address certain jurisdictional requirements in this regard.</p><p>Section 13 simply states that where an offence was committed outside the State proceedings may be taken in any place within the State.</p><p>One of the key elements of this legislation lies In Part 4, which sets out the presumptions which are applicable where proceedings for corruption offences under the Act are under way.  They adjust the burden of proof by requiring an accused person to demonstrate that they did not act in a particular way or carry out a particular action as opposed to the usual requirements for the prosecution to prove that a particular act had been carried out.  Of course, these presumptions can be rebutted by evidence proving the contrary.  The standard of proof is the civil one, which is the balance of probabilities.  These provisions are to assist prosecutors in securing a conviction in white collar trials, which are often complex and difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>Section 14 contains a rebuttable presumption that where a payment or gift is made to an official or a connected person, and the giver has an interest in the way those functions are exercised, then the payment or gift is deemed to have been given corruptly as an inducement or reward for the person acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duties, unless the contrary can be proved.  Subsection (3) lists the functions or decisions of officials which are applicable in this case, which include the acquisition or sale of property, award of tenders and contracts, licences and passports, as well as the exercise of judicial functions and the administration of justice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Subsection (3) lists the functions or decisions of officials which are applicable in this case, which include the acquisition or sale of property, award of tenders and contracts, licences and passports, as well as the exercise of judicial functions and the administration of justice.  The functions of Irish officials regarding the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2010, are included, as well as functions relating to NAMA and the Central Bank.  Reflecting the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, the presumption extends to gifts or advantages given to or received by, or for the benefit of, a connected person of the official as defined at section 14(i).  That includes family and close business relationships.</p><p>Section 15 provides for a presumption whereby if a person to whom the section applies fails to disclose a donation exceeding the relevant amount specified in the Electoral Act 1997 or the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, and the donor had or has an interest in the recipient's actions, the donation is deemed to have been given and received corruptly as an inducement.  This presumption is based on that contained in section 3 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.  This presumption, as recommended by Mahon, will also apply where a recipient fails to return a donation exceeding the limits set out in the electoral legislation.</p><p>Section 16 relates to Irish officials defined as members or office holders providing for a presumption of corruption where persons who are required to declare certain statements of interests pursuant to the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001 failed to make the necessary declarations.  When corruption proceedings are taken against such a person, the section provides for a rebuttable presumption of corrupt enrichment in respect of the undeclared interests, that is, that the property concerned derives from a gift or advantage received, on account of the person carrying out an act in relation to his or her office or business.  Article 20 of the UN Convention against corruption required Ireland to consider such a measure.  There are some new components in Part 5 of which deals with penalties and enforcement, and the objective is to provide for stronger penalties for the offences, including forfeiture of office, and to clarify the criminal liability of corporate bodies for corrupt acts committed by their directors or officers.</p><p>Section 17 outlines the penalties applicable to a person when convicted of a corruption offence under the Bill.  The offence of trading in influence carries a maximum of five years imprisonment for conviction on indictment and an unlimited fine.  Conviction on indictment for offences under sections 5, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and an unlimited fine.  The sanctions in this section also include forfeiture of office under subsection (4) in respect of certain Irish officials, other than those officials whose removal from office would require a parliamentary impeachment procedure, or where there are particular constitutional provisions protecting their independence.  It is important to note that the application of these penalties can only occur after a determination by a court, where a judge considers that is in the interest of maintaining or restoring public confidence in the public administration of the State and where it is in the interests of justice to proceed with forfeiture.  A court may also order that a person found guilty on indictment may be prohibited from seeking certain public offices for up to ten years.  The penalties for bodies corporate under the section 18 strict liability offence are fines.</p><p>Section 18 provides that where a relevant offence has been committed by a person such as a company director or any other employee, with the intention of obtaining an advantage for his or her company, then the company as well as the individual may be liable for the offence.  Subsection (2) provides for a defence that the body corporate took all reasonable steps and exercised due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.  Under subsection (3), where it is proved that an offence by a body corporate was committed with the consent or connivance or was attributable to any wilful neglect of a director, manager or secretary of that body, then that person as well as the body corporate is deemed guilty of the offence.</p><p>Section 19 is a standard provision, providing that a certificate from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding a person's citizenship shall be evidence that this is the case.  This would be particularly relevant to corruption offences occurring outside the State.  Section 20 relates to the seizure of a suspected bribe, and section 21 enables a Circuit Court judge to order the forfeiture of seized property.  Section 22 says that provisions contained in sections of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 will apply to seizure and forfeiture provisions contained in this Bill.</p><p>Part 6 covers miscellaneous matters, including providing for consequential amendments to other legislation as a result of the amendments in this Bill.  Sections 23 to 28, inclusive, update the references in other legislation, as appropriate to realisable property, corrupt conduct, corruption offences, offences against the administration of justice and relevant offences.  I should specifically mention the provision in section 26 which was introduced in the D&aacute;il as a Report Stage amendment.  The OECD had recommended that Ireland remove the dual criminality requirement for the bribery of a foreign official as a predicate to money laundering.  Paragraph (c) of the definition of criminal conduct now provides for that.</p><p>Sections 29 to 33, inclusive, will amend legislation relating to the election or removal of Deputies, Senators, MEPs and local authority members.  This is to provide clarity around the procedure involved should a court order the forfeiture of an elected office.</p><p>In conclusion, the Bill before the House marks a significant improvement to our laws against corruption.  By repealing laws that date back to the 19th century, I am happy to be bringing forward a comprehensive and easy to access modern statute.  These measures will increase transparency in how public officials conduct themselves in office, while ensuring those officials who transgress the high standards required by their office are adequately dealt with.  I have said before that the reputation of a State and its business community can be affected by the rigour with which it tackles corruption.  Too often, the public believes that comprehensive reports produced by or for Government end up being stacked on shelves.  This Bill shows that, in terms of corruption, that is clearly not the case.  It is a clear response to a number of international evaluation reports regarding corruption prevention in Ireland.  It is a clear demonstration of our engagement with international efforts at the United Nations, the OECD, the European Union and the Council of Europe to tackle the problem head on.  By expanding our range of offences, presumptions and extra-territorial jurisdiction in the area of corruption, it ensures that our international obligations to tackle bribery and corruption both domestically and abroad are being properly addressed.  In enacting this Bill, the Oireachtas will be sending out a strong message that we treat corruption prevention extremely seriously.</p><p>Finally, I should inform Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; that Ireland will be subject to a number of international reporting processes on preventing and tackling corruption in June this year.  This Bill will be evaluated by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OECD.  I hope that we can have it enacted before those evaluations commence and I seek all-party support in this House to make that happen.  I believe it will stand up to scrutiny and we will be proud of having a comprehensive, strict and fair statute enacted to address corruption in Ireland.  In the meantime, I look forward to an intense debate on this measure and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am happy to see the legislation before the House.  It is right, proper and prudent that we strengthen the current legislation.  I am also pleased that Fine Gael is doing something on this issue because the programme for Government in 2011 contained a promise to do so and like many things contained in that programme for Government, we did not see any delivery on it.  Therefore, I am pleased the Bill is before the House.</p> <p>The Bill is based on a general scheme which was published in 2012 and approved by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in 2013 so it is to be welcomed that Fine Gael is finally acting on its promise.  For far too long there was no political will to do anything about white collar crime.  I can pre-empt what my good friend, Senator Conway, will say.  He will throw some shade at Fianna F&aacute;il and add some comments about Fianna F&aacute;il being corrupt and refer to the Mahon tribunal.</p></speech>

I have prepared for this debate and I know exactly what Fianna F&aacute;il did in this area.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government we introduced a comprehensive series of measures to ensure the highest ethical standards are maintained.  I will outline a couple of those if I can.  The objective of the white collar crime Bill, which we published, could not be achieved in 2011 because the D&aacute;il was dissolved.  We also published the register of lobbyists Bill 2012, measures to limit spending by local election candidates in 2009, the Civil Service code of standards and behaviours in 2004, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, the code of practice for employees of local authorities in 2001, the Local Government Act 2001, the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 and the political donations Bill was also published in 2011.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Fianna F&aacute;il has a proud record of acting in this area, and I am glad to see Fine Gael is finally bringing some legislation before the House.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#GG00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will be supporting the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I am struck that since the onset of the financial crisis and the passage of two major corruption tribunal reports, particularly those of Mahon and Moriarty, white-collar crime prosecutions are sorely lacking in this country while the number of offences that have been created and legislation that has been passed is quite remarkable and numerous.  There is a disconnect between the Minister's desire and that of his predecessor to place more emphasis on combating corruption and white-collar crime and investigators' capacity to identify these crimes when they occur and to ensure they are correctly prosecuted.</p> <p>With all of these new corruption offences, what State bodies will be principally charged with investigating alleged offences committed under the Act?  Will the new offences under the Act be subject to mandatory reporting obligations similar to those offences specified in the Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 2011?  There has been a lot of talk in recent weeks about the importance of adequately resourcing the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ensure its ongoing investigations into INM are not impeded.  It was only a few months prior that those same persons were calling to disband the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement after revelations that one of the investigators had shredded evidence in the course of the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial.  It should be a mandatory requirement that with the introduction of every new criminal offence the offences are matched with not only adequate but appropriate new resources.</p> <p>While being placed 19th out of 183 states in the most recent corruption index is not bad, we are still considered more corrupt than developed European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK.  In each of these states white-collar crime investigation and prosecution is more adequately and appropriately resourced and that is where Ireland continues to be sorely lacking.  It is no use having all these laws if the bodies charged with investigating the crimes do not have the skills or the manpower to do what is required.  Lessons have been learnt from trials such as the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial where prosecutions were unsuccessful and other high-profile cases such as when the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission raided the offices of CRH only for the Supreme Court to say it had overreached its powers.</p> <p>It seems to me that the only agency of the State that understands criminal investigations is the only agency that has been undertaking criminal investigations for the past century and that is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Why is there no dedicated stand-alone division in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which alone is charged with investigating all white-collar crimes, executing all search warrants and collating all documentary evidence?  The piecemeal approach we have in Ireland with different State agencies having different investigatory powers is not working and is leading to hapless prosecutions.  As we debate the passage of this Bill through this House, will the Minister consider how these offences will be resourced?  As we continue to develop a lengthy book of statutory white-collar criminal offences, perhaps the Minister will explain how we can improve our investigation and prosecution of these crimes.</p> <p>I have spoken in recent days in the House on the Carltona doctrine and how it finishes up masking the wrongdoers in public life.  Unfortunately, Ministers take the fall for decisions that are made which they may not have been aware of at the time the decisions were made.  We have seen that recently in the cervical cancer scare.  We saw it in both the PTSB and Brigid McCole cases.  All of these cases were taken and the State defence commenced without the Minister being advised of what was going on until it was up and running.  The Minister cannot be in every Department and every part of every Department all the time.</p> <p>The legislation is good.  The Minister has done a good job.  It is a bit late in coming but it takes a long time to work these things through the system.  The Minister is to be congratulated on it.  It is my view that what we need to do now is ensure we resource the offices correctly and give them the powers they need to be able to detect white-collar crime and ensure that prosecutions are successful.  We do not want to see unsuccessful prosecutions.  I know from speaking to the Minister casually that it is not something he would want either.  I know he is desperately anxious to get this through.  It is my hope we will facilitate the speedy passage of the Bill through the House and that it will be enacted by June as the Minister requested.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</p></speech>

It has a lot of work to do but it has done a serious amount of work.  I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the success it has had in bringing an end to a production facility in Celbridge.  There is a lot we can celebrate.  The significant budget that has gone into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increases every year.  It is a commitment of the Minister and Government.  We should consider figures such as &euro;1.65 billion and the enhancements to Garda ICT and transportation facilities.  In terms of dealing with crime and white-collar crime, the Government has not been found wanting and will not be.</p> <p>The legislation is very important, not just to put a mechanism in place to deal with people who are corrupt and who choose to abuse their positions but also in terms of bringing us into line with best international practice and ensuring the country is meeting its obligations under various EU treaties.  As the Minister has quite correctly pointed out, there are periodic reviews.  An important review will take place in June to ensure we comply with OECD and UN obligations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is all important.</p><p>Unfortunately, white-collar crime is borderless.  It is no longer specific to any one country or region.  We have to be an important component of an international response to these issues.  No more than cybercrime, white-collar crime involves money, resources and criminal activity moving from one jurisdiction to another with great ease.  Dealing with white-collar crime requires an international response.  The Bill will help to bring us into a sphere whereby our structures are compliant with best international practice.  I have no doubt that the Bill will evolve.  As time goes on and new forms of corruption are identified and new mechanisms to deal with corruption are identified, we will have to introduce further amendments to the Bill.</p><p>The Bill is a significant incremental step in the right direction to ensure that Ireland has as good a suite of measures to deal with white-collar crime as any other country.  As I said, dealing with white-collar crime continues to be a work in progress.  Unfortunately, criminals always seem to be one step or two steps ahead of various jurisdictions.  They work together and share their intellectual blaggardism.  It is up to Governments, through Europol and the work we do in association with our international partners in Europe and elsewhere, to ensure that our laws continue to improve and loopholes are closed.</p><p>I am privileged, along with Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, to represent this country on the European scrutiny committee on Europol which is essentially an intellectual sharing organisation.  It does not perform policing, but deals with intellectual crime and ensures that intelligence gathering is at the best level it can be.</p><p>I know from having attended meeting in Brussels that the work Europol is doing in respect of white-collar crime is groundbreaking.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feed into that and is also benefitting from the intellectual capacity and gathering ability of Europol. </p><p>The Bill is important.  It is overdue, but it is coming in under the watch of the Minister and I sincerely hope it gets all-party support in the House as it did in the Lower House.</p></speech>

We will support the Bill.  Like me, the Minister probably did not expect the debate thus far too have taken on such a tetchy or defensive tone but perhaps that is indicative of from where we are coming and reflective of earlier politics.  That is why the Bill is important, as has been rightly acknowledged by everyone despite the back-and-forth debate.</p> <p>The Bill brings current laws on corruption up to date and consolidates them.  It also implements a number of international and EU obligations on the State, as the Minister has outlined.  The Bill aims to clarify and strengthen corruption offences in this jurisdiction and those from outside the State who act within it.  It provides greater clarity on trading in influence offences, which is overdue.</p> <p>Whether in public life, business or commerce, corruption has been part of the history of this State.  We have had tribunals of inquiry investigating various issues, including planning corruption, zoning controversies, bribery, corporate fraud, significant Government contracts awarded in a process subsequently found to be biased and defective, unexplained payments and a banking crisis in which nobody paid the price for their actions other than the ordinary citizen.  </p> <p>This State&rsquo;s attitude towards corporate fraud and corruption, however, has been casual and slack up to now.  It appears that some Governments have been most passive in this area.  However, the Bill recognises little has been done in this area since the Government came into office.  I hope it will address such cultural issues, particularly in institutions and sectors where questionable practices almost appear to be the norm.</p> <p>This culture of corruption goes right to the top of many institutions, be they private or public, throughout the State.  To state otherwise would be blind to the past.  The body responsible for eradicating corruption is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Last November, it was announced that this office was being overhauled.  This was welcome news given the history we all know about.  The office brought no prosecutions and achieved no convictions over the past two years.  Only 43 prosecutions have been brought by the ODCE in the past decade, a shockingly low amount over this time, especially given the context of what happened since 2007.  In addition, the annual reports of the ODCE show that almost &euro;6 million in its allocated funding has been returned to the State over the past three years, including &euro;2.7 million in 2016.  In the same year no prosecutions or convictions were achieved by the agency.  There is clearly a requirement for an overhaul of the agency as well as more investment therein.</p> <p>One matter which most frustrated people over the course of the recession was that while people suffered, some grievously, it appeared no one was brought to justice for the banking crisis.  We did not see the level of court cases that were brought in the US or in other jurisdictions where corrupt and immoral practices took place.  This may have been due to deficiencies in legislation, and that is why this Bill is welcome.  It also happened because of the under-resourcing of and lack of support for the ODCE.  It needs extra powers and additional resources.</p> <p>The corporate liability of the Bill needs to be strengthened.  In particular, the defence of reasonable action needs to be clearly explained.  Members know from the Paradise Papers and the scandals involving AIB and other banks that financial institutions will use any chink in the legislative armour to squeeze more money out of the taxpayer and their customers.  Corruption comes in many different forms and ways.  As we all know, there has been institutionalised white-collar crime and corruption in the Sate that was facilitated by legislation.</p> <p>We saw this spectacularly in the Apple tax debacle.  Much-needed income for public services was lost by the Government&rsquo;s inaction and failure to tax this company.  The Government&rsquo;s track record on dealing with, challenging and holding people to account for white-collar crime is appalling.  The key to eradicating corruption is not just legislation, and robust legislation at that.  It is also about pursuing those who are corrupt and bringing them before the courts.  There can be no tolerance of or hiding place for people involved in white-collar crime.  They have to face the full rigour of the law.  That is why I welcome the Bill and look forward to working in partnership with the Minister and colleagues in the House to ensure that we bury that past culture of negligence and utilise and harness the proposed legislation to its fullest to work co-operatively and ensure the kind of culture and crimes we saw committed in the past are not allowed to be repeated in the future.</p></speech>

The Bill will ensure that at least some of them may face this prospect.  It was a long time coming.  The general scheme of the Bill was introduced in 2012.  What has happened in the past six years?  It is updating legislation which goes from 1889 up to 2010.  As I said, there was a very long gestation period.  </p> <p>There is also an interesting ancestry for the Bill, which includes the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OECD and, of course, the lamentable Mahon tribunal which went for years and cost millions of pounds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I will not rehearse what is in the Bill because I am sure the Minister either has done so or will do so.  I will just refer to a few of the elements of it because the intention of the Bill is to register the fact that this kind of corruption leads to serious social and economic damage to the fabric of the State.  For this reason, a sentence of up to ten years is provided for as well as unlimited fines, and I say hear, hear to that.  I would like to see this happen because the people involved in this usually have the acumen and material capacity to hire the best lawyers in the State and wriggle their way out of it.  The Bill provides for a penalty of forfeiture of office if an Irish official is found guilty of corruption on indictment.  Again, I say hear, hear to that.  However, the extraordinary thing is that Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann or D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann get away scot-free.  They are not subject to this penalty.  This is a nonsense.  I know there may be some twiddling difficulties with it, but let us twiddle and tweak it, even if a referendum is necessary because if anybody should go to jail or be fined for this, it is public representatives.  They are the people who should be least susceptible to corruption.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the Bill to cover Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  After all, we are excluded from various jobs.  We are excluded from sitting on certain committees and we are not allowed to do this, that and the other and yet we cannot get a go to jail card.  Why not?  I would like to quote the Minister's own words in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last year.  He said, "I believe that Members of this House understand that it is only by holding ourselves up to the highest standards, that we can tackle corruption and white-collar crime effectively and maintain or improve the trust, respect and support of the Irish public", but this Bill does not do that.  I said I was not going to disagree with the Minister but I could not resist the temptation because this is a fundamentally important step.</p><p>One other thing to be welcomed is that we will, more or less, be waving tatty bye to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  That is a damn good thing because it was useless.  I remember hearing the director of corporate enforcement say there was nothing wrong and that we would have a soft landing.  It was utter, complete and total balderdash.  He was not up to the job.  The office has been severely criticised because in addition to this rubbish which went on in the lead up to, and during, the crisis, it utterly failed in the prosecution of Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  It made an total, complete and utter bags of prosecuting Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick and it was criticised by the judge in the case.</p><p>There is a new offence of trading in influence and that prohibits the promising of an undue advantage to an official.  There is also the crime of an applicant for planning permission makes a payment.  This is something that has really vitiated the situation at local authority level.  I must say I am rather na&iuml;ve and I was utterly shocked at the level of local authority corruption that was revealed.</p><p>The other good thing that will happen is that companies and public bodies will have to develop anti-corruption policies, roll them out and give training to their employees.  It astonishes me that the average employee or company director would not recognise corruption when it faced him or her.  I certainly would but perhaps that is part of the religious background of being an Anglican.</p><p>I welcome this Bill.  It is a good day for Ireland as it is about bloody time that we got it.  I will wait to see it being implemented and I will be there to applaud when the first company director, official or whoever it is, or if the Bill is amended in the way I would like to see it amended, the first Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is on his or her way to the clink.  I say well done to the Minister as it is about time.  He is the one who has done this, so he gets the full credit.  This will help to improve standards in Irish life.</p></speech>

The main reason I wish to speak on this Bill is to say that no one should be above the law, whether for stealing an item from a shop or for white-collar crime.  There is a perception among the public that white-collar crime is not something for which people can be sent to jail or held accountable but this legislation will do that and it needs to be implemented.  I welcome that.  I suspect that if it had been in place prior to the crash in 2008, we would be in a different place today.</p> <p>The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, has worked in fighting corruption and one can never put enough resources put into it.  It cuts across every area of crime and we need to ensure it is kept properly resourced and that we consider it all the time.  Something I feel strongly about, and which is being included in most legislation coming through, is that when an organisation is established, there should be a review in terms of due diligence every three to five years.  I would like to see that apply to organisations like CAB to make sure they are moving apace with technology and in the context of the types of crimes being committed because they are evolving all the time.</p> <p>I very much welcome this Bill but everything is not a separate component; everything is integrated.  This is all about garda&iacute; on the ground and about CAB.  It was always said that the lady robbing a sliced pan for her family was held to account more by the State and by the legislation than perhaps the company director raiding the pension fund.  This legislation sets that right and it is something I very much welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#JJ00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I acknowledge this significant piece of legislative work which has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I will make a few points and will then express concern at one aspect of the legislation.  </p> <p>I note the Bill provides for nine corruption offences, namely, active and passive corruption in section 5, new offences of active and passive trading and influence in section 6, corruption in office and employment in positions of business in section 7, corruption through intermediaries in section 8, creation and use of false documents for corrupt purposes and a new offence of intimidation for corrupting purposes in section 10, and corruption by and on behalf of corporate bodies, including a new offence of a failure to avert corruption in section 18.  That all has to be welcomed as it is all very significant.  Corruption manifests itself in bribery, the misuse and influence of power and the theft and misallocation of resources.  That is worth spelling out because some people think this is far removed from their personal, political or business life.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that corruption comes in many forms.  Political corruption undermines the legitimacy of democracy.  Mahon, in his final report, said that it is a fundamental breach of public trust and inherently incompatible with the democratic nature of the State and is a form of social rust which corrodes the political and institutional systems in which it takes root.  That is particularly important.  Corruption also manifests itself in the administration sphere for citizens and their fair treatment and rights and it diverts resources and investments for the common good.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In business, corruption undermines and distorts the market and hampers development. <br/><br/>I will speak briefly on the findings of the Mahon report and what Mr. Justice Mahon described as a vicious cycle of corruption that affected political and planning life in this State.  We must learn from the Mahon report.  While I do not intend naming the local authority in question on the basis that due process must apply, anyone who read the newspapers at the weekend will be aware that a report on alleged planning corruption is sitting on the desk of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The response attributed to the Minister in the weekend's media reports was that he needed more time to consider the report.  I call on him to examine the report quickly and publish it if possible.  It is important for the planning authority in question, its staff and elected members that the truth and facts relating to alleged corrupt activities are placed in the public domain.  Information regarding the report has entered the public domain as it was covered in the media at the weekend.  I call on the Minister to publish the report. <br/><br/>The briefing note circulated with the Bill states the legislation provides for the seeking of a court order prohibiting an individual seeking a public office or post following conviction on indictment for a corrupt offence.  However, this prohibition will not apply to any individual seeking office as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the European Parliament or a local authority as it is not intended to interfere with the electoral process.  I do not accept this proposal.  It is wrong and needs to be revisited.  It is my intention to introduce an amendment to address this specific matter.<br/><br/>I would like to work with the Minister and his officials in this regard.  Having listened to Senator Norris's comments on the election of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the European Parliament and local government, it is my view that the same regulations should apply to people who are elected to office.  I will reserve my position on this matter.  We should put our heads together and introduce severe penalties, without exception or favour.  If politicians are found to be in any way corrupt, they must be sanctioned.  I ask the Minister to address this issue and spell out clearly what is meant by the current proposal in case I have misunderstood the position.  I hope we can work together to clarify any misunderstandings that may arise and give effect to the Minister's comments in the D&aacute;il about leading by example, to which Senator Norris referred.  We are elected to high office and we, too, must pay a penalty if we are found to have fallen short or to have been involved in any form of bribery or corruption.  To be precise, my main concern regarding the legislation relates to section 18(4)(<i>c</i>), which addresses the issue of people seeking election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the European Parliament and local authorities.</p></speech>

As the Minister stated, this is significant and substantial legislation which overhauls our anti-corruption regime.  None of us is above the law, irrespective of who we are or where we are from.  There can be a sensational rush to populism and to be all things to all people.  I have always taken the view that politics must not be the preserve of a few and it must be open to everyone to become involved in politics and to run in elections.  As politicians, our words and actions are very important.</p> <p>As Senator Craughwell stated on the Order of Business this morning, we must always hold people to account.  However, we must do so based on all the facts.  For this reason, I welcome the more severe penalties which will apply to those who engage in corrupt behaviour and practices.  The key phrase in this connection is "behaviour and practices".  Politicians must always lead by example, both in what we say and how we behave.  I was slightly amused, therefore, by Senator Clifford-Lee's pre-emptive strike against Senator Conway at the beginning of the debate.  I ask Members to cast their minds back to Tim Sebastian's interview with Bertie Ahern.  Perhaps we should reflect on that. </p></speech>

I remind Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile of the import of what he suggested regarding Apple.  The Government and Apple have appealed the decision of the European Commission in 2016.  Apple will pay money into an escrow account which will be held on behalf of the Government.  Apple and the Government are challenging the Commission's ruling in this matter.  The language we use in discussing such matters is important.</p> <p>People were driven cracked and daft by the failure to hold anyone in the corporate world to account for the collapse of the banking sector, despite numerous inquiries and decisions by the Office of Corporate Enforcement to take cases.  While we must accept the decisions of juries of our peers in these cases, people also want accountability and it drove them berserk that no one was held to account.  There is a perception among some that we are soft on white collar crime and wrongdoing in the corporate world.  I hope this perception will change as a consequence of this legislation. </p> <p>I will not prolong the debate as I understand the Minister is scheduled to attend another event.  He is a reforming Minister and I do not mind that it has taken so long to reach this point.  This Bill demonstrates his bona fides and the Government's commitment.  Methinks those who complain about the time taken to reach this point protest too much on the grounds that, as the Minister stated, the Bill consolidates seven anti-corruption Acts introduced since 1889.</p> <p>This is a great day's work on which I commend the Minister whom I have always found to be reforming and supportive and positive on many issues.  To digress for a moment, his speech on the Civil Partnership Bill in the D&aacute;il was a landmark moment.  This Bill is another landmark for him and the Government.</p> <p>We must make abundantly clear that we are collectively committed to tackling white collar crime.  The package of measures the Minister has announced is a significant demonstration of the Government's intent in this regard. </p> <p>Senator Norris referred to politicians being exempt from certain provisions of the Bill.  I hope everyone will be held to account in the same way.  I commend the Minister on his work in the Department.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the broad support for this legislation which undoubtedly echoes the broad level of support the Bill received in the D&aacute;il.  We all agree that corruption in all areas of society needs to be tackled.  The Bill introduces a range of new offences.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will be a welcome addition to the Statute Book once processed and enacted.  As mentioned earlier, it will go a significant way towards meeting our obligations under various EU directives and international anti-corruption conventions.  It is important that Ireland is recognised on the global stage as a safe bet for business, investment and development.  As I said earlier, the Bill will be considered in Paris in June of this year by the OECD working party on bribery.  I believe it will be seen as a significant improvement in our laws to date and that it will receive broad support in that forum.  <br/><br/>While the Bill addresses both the public and private sectors, Senators will have noted a particular focus on public officials acting in the course of their duties.  We must ensure that public officials who make use of their positions for their own corrupt benefit or those who facilitate corruption are adequately punished.  Public officials have a unique duty to the society they serve and, as such, they should be held to account for any misdemeanours or breaches.  While I believe that corrupt activity among public officials is the exception rather than the norm, we cannot be complacent and we must continue to improve our systems and laws.<br/><br/>A couple of points were raised during the course of the debate that I would like to mention.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell called for due diligence and a review of technology and resources for the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  I can confirm for Senators that there is to be a review of the anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures as part of the while collar crime package and the issues relating to the Criminal Assets Bureau will be examined in the course of that process, which is well under way.<br/><br/>On the concerns raised by Senators Craughwell and &Oacute; Donnghaile, as mentioned previously the Criminal Justice Act 2011 provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with innovative tools for the investigation of white collar crime.  Furthermore, the extended presumptions in this Bill will significantly enhance the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to bring forward a prosecution for offences under this Bill.  The upcoming criminal procedure Bill will also deal with the matter of pre-trail hearings, which will significantly reduce the length of complex trials such as those involving white collar crime and corruption.  In addition, my Department is committed to conducting a wider review of the effectiveness of State bodies with a role in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of engagement on fraud and corruption with a view to ensuring that, as stated by Senator Craughwell, our continued effectiveness in dealing with white collar crime is not in question.  <br/><br/>Senators mentioned the matter of resourcing.  As part of the white collar crime package announced last year, reform of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, is central.  This will require not only restructuring but also resourcing.  Senators will be aware that the reform of this office is being overseen by my colleague, Deputy Heather Humphreys, Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  <br/><br/>A number of Senators mentioned the matter of the delay in bringing this Bill to the House.  This Bill reforms and consolidates seven major pieces of legislation dating back to the 19th century.  It gives effect to numerous requirements of international conventions, as well as the recommendation of the Mahon tribunal and other policy considerations.  This is a technical area of the law.  As such, time and care was needed in drafting the Bill to ensure that we have provisions that are robust and produce the intended result of criminalising corrupt practices in all sectors and to ensure the law is in a position to punish those involved.<br/><br/>Senators Norris and Boyhan stated that public representatives will not be subject to the offences or penalties under this Bill.  That is not accurate.  Under the Bill, the only penalty that does not apply to public representatives is the prohibition to seek another office in the future.  I am happy to debate the detail of this measure in the context of an amendment on Committee Stage from Senator Boyhan or any other Senator.  I would be concerned if we were seen to be interfering unduly with the democratic process.  I want to assure Senator Boyhan and Senator Norris that, as in the case of public officials, elected officials, Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, members of local authorities and Members of the European Parliament can be prosecuted and subject to penalties, including forfeiture of office.<br/><br/>The issue that the Senators are concerned about is the matter of future fitness for office.  I am not sure to what extent we can disqualify people from going before the electorate but I am happy to come back to the issue on Committee Stage.  In addition, section 17(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill provides that where a person is convicted of a corruption offence, the court may make an order prohibiting that person from seeking to hold public office for up to ten years.  Such a penalty can be imposed where a court is satisfied that to do so is in the interests of justice and in the interests of maintaining or restoring public confidence in the public administration.  However, there is no provision in the Bill for a court to prohibit anyone from seeking to be elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the European Parliament or a local authority, following a conviction for a corruption offence.  There were some constitutional issues raised in regard to a prohibition order that would prohibit a person seeking to be elected a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Any conviction would, of course, be a matter of public record and, as such, the voters, whether a D&aacute;il or Seanad electorate-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#NN00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I will outline to Senators what is intended by the Bill.  Under ordinary rule of practice in the civil courts, there is a judge-made rule in respect of costs that dates back in the medium term to 1968 and a case called Vella <i>v</i>. Morelli.  Prior to that, it dates back to the early 19th century.  The Irish courts, where a challenge is brought to a will, generally follow the rule that, if the challenge is brought in good faith and is reasonable, the challenger is entitled to have the costs of the challenge - this is in addition to the costs of defending it - paid out of the estate even if he or she fails.</p><p>My reasons for believing this rule is unfair are as follows.  The Constitution guarantees the general right to devise, bequeath and inherit property, subject to the provisions of the Succession Act, which afforded extensive protections to parties so as to ensure that they were dealt with properly.  We have a new statutory rule under which children and persons in the position of children are entitled to challenge a will that fails to make adequate provision for them, except where all of the estate is given to that child's parents by the child's father or mother.</p><p>Those kinds of case are fine, but this Bill addresses a growing problem.  Recently, the President of the High Court said that one would need to be either a millionaire, billionaire or pauper to go to law voluntarily these days.  I will not dwell too long on how legal fees have grown, but they have increased.  I know that from my own experience.  As a consequence, any kind of case in the Circuit Court or High Court can be very expensive and outside the grasp of ordinary people to conduct.  Such cases can be dealing with limited estates, for example, the value of a small house in Dublin, which is &euro;300,000.  If that gets involved in a tangle between the executor, one of the children and another of the children and everyone starts looking for costs, the estate often gets gobbled up or seriously dented rapidly.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to change the situation so that the ordinary rules of handling costs in litigation should apply in challenges to a will.  The costs follow the event subject to a discretion of the judge not to do so.  This Bill would effectively reverse the line of case law that is referred to in Vella <i>v</i>. Morelli to make it in future the ordinary rule that, if someone brings an unsuccessful challenge to a will, such challenge will normally be at the challenger's own expense and he or she will be liable to pay the costs of the executor in defending the will if the challenge is not merited.</p><p>I do not wish to discuss cases in which I have been involved, but I know as a matter of general experience that, where a challenge is mooted or brought, the reaction of the executor and the people who are likely to gain from the defence of the will is frequently to say that, although they do not believe there is any merit in the challenge, they will need to buy off the challenge in light of the rule in Vella <i>v</i>. Morelli.  Consequently, people who are not entitled to a share in the estate or are entitled to a lesser share are suddenly put in the position of effectively having, I do not want to use the term pejoratively, a blackmail value to their challenge, which means that the people who are entitled to succeed to an estate in a will must effectively buy them off.</p><p>The rule increasingly acts unjustly.  It is easy for someone to imagine that he or she has a good case against a brother or sister for using undue influence to procure a will in the sibling's favour.  It is an easy charge to make.  To put, for example, the woman who stayed at home to look after her elderly mother in a position of having to defend herself against a charge that she somehow got her mother to leave the house to her when the brother, who is well-to-do and so on, is able to challenge her behaviour, lose the case by a long distance and still say that he had reasonable grounds to challenge the will, creates a significant injustice.</p><p>When Mr. Justice Kearns was in the Supreme Court, he stated that the rule in Vella <i>v</i>. Morelli was not an absolute one and that, if someone instituted proceedings and it subsequently became clear that he or she had no case, he or she would not be liable to the costs involved if he or she proceeded with the matter.  My view is that it would be far better if there were fewer challenges to wills and if people who wanted to challenge one faced the ordinary rule that they could not get the costs of making an unsuccessful challenge paid out of the estate, except in extraordinary circumstances that justified such a call.</p><p>As I understand it, the rule was followed by the Courts of Chancery in Ireland in the 19th century on the basis that there was a public interest in there being scrutiny of wills and documents that were produced as wills.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now the great majority of wills are drawn up with the assistance of a solicitor.  The old idea is somewhat outdated that people take out a small piece of paper from under the bed or something else and say it is a genuine will.  It is now much more difficult, as a matter of practicality, for somebody to produce a false or bogus will than it was in the 19th century when there was not such a facility.<br/><br/>Some Members have said they would favour the creation of a registry of wills or some system for registering wills such that, although the fact that there is a will would not be known to members of the public, after the death of somebody, the fact that a will had been brought into existence could be established.  It would be instead of having advertisements placed in the <i>Law Society Gazette </i>looking for a will in a case of intestacy.  That is a good idea, but it is different from the point I am making in this short Bill.  I am strongly of the view that the time has come to change the rule established in Vella <i>v. </i>Morelli and save small estates, in particular, from the added burden that they can be challenged at the expense of the estate by somebody who will lose the case but suffer no penalty.  It is in those circumstances that I bring forward the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum sets out the background circumstances.  I hope the House will give it a favourable hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#OO00200"><p>I second the Bill.  If ever there was a truism, it is that where there is a will, there are relations.  We have all heard horror stories.  I recall one story from the Minister of State's neck of the woods of a man who owned a farm and had two daughters but no son.  Living some distance from him was another family with the same family name but unrelated to him.  He called to them and asked the woman of the house what was the name of her young fellow.  She told him and asked why he was asking.  He said he would leave the farm to him.  The woman pointed out that the man had two daughters, but he said neither of his daughters had his surname.  There is that type of mentality in parts of Ireland.  We have all heard stories of people standing around a bed when someone was drawing his or her last breaths, pleading with him or her to sign over land or property.</p> <p>Senator Michael McDowell in his Bill is setting out to take out the uncertainty of a situation where those who seek to profit almost blackmail the beneficiary of a will into buying them off in order to avoid litigation.  If the Bill did nothing else, it would provide that level of certainty.  It would stop people rushing to the law in the belief they were entitled to something to which they were not entitled and hoping to profit from it without having to appear in court.  In many cases, that is what happens.  It is high time we provided that level of certainty.</p> <p>We also need to be more honest with each other.  I recall speaking to a relation who had done very well in a bequest from another relative whom he had been advising.  He was both the executor and the recipient.  However, the advice he had given from a tax point of view was nonsense and he finished up paying half to the tax man, when it could have distributed among his brothers and sisters.  These things happen.  We need to be more open with one another about what we will do with our estates.  We need to talk about it.  Families need to sit down and talk about it.  I have a rule when I meet my family that we never say "remember when".  My memory of "when " and theirs very often differ. </p> <p>I support Senator Michael McDowell.  It is high time these provisions were brought forward in the House.  I hope both it and the Minister of State will support the Bill and it being brought into law.  Families deserve and need this certainty in the context of what is a very high cost alternative.  I am glad that Senator Michael McDowell is the man who has brought the issue into focus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#OO00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton.  This is a very good proposal from Senator Michael McDowell and the Government will not be opposing it on Second Stage.  There will always be an opportunity to enhance and improve it on Committee Stage.  I encourage Members who have a viewpoint that will enhance what has been proposed to engage in the process.  It makes absolute sense.  Senator Michael McDowell has significant experience and knowledge which are of huge benefit to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Every day we see examples which prove the benefit of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and this Bill is one such example.  In the last Seanad I proposed a motion which called on the Government to embrace the principle of e-conveyancing, which is different from what is being proposed.  When somebody purchases a house, the conveyancing process can take a number of weeks to complete.  If it was electronic, it would cut the time involved by 80% to 90%.  When the Minister of State was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, this was an issue we examined.  Similarly, in the case of wills taking out probate takes far too long.  The process is cumbersome and time consuming, which leads to significant extra costs.  The principle of limiting costs as outlined by Senator Michael McDowell is of great importance.  If passed, the Bill will certainly deal with that issue.  We also need to look at streamlining to ensure the taking out of probate will happen in a timely manner.  When nothing is being contested and everything is kosher and agreed to, the time gap is still completely unacceptable.  </p> <p>The registering of wills proposed by others in the House is something with which I absolutely agree.  It is ridiculous that one has to advertise to establish whether there is a will.  I would say 90%, if not 95%, of wills are now drawn up through a solicitor.  Establishing such a register with 95% accuracy is possible.  I suggest to the Minister of State that we need to look at the issue of probate and bring the process into the 21st century.  We need to embrace e-conveyancing and provide the necessary funding in collaboration with the Law Society of Ireland which is a big proponent of the idea.  We need to reduce dramatically the length of time it takes to take out probate, especially when a will is uncontested.  We certainly need to implement what is proposed in the Bill in the case of contested wills.</p> <p>I commend the Bill and look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I wish to briefly refer to the points made by Senator McDowell about the buy-off many defendants in these matters undertake.  As he outlined, that significantly eats into the estate, and also if a case continues the costs are borne by the estate, which is not satisfactory either.  However, I am concerned that if the rule is taken away plaintiffs will be put off from taking cases of merit.  That is a very fine balancing act.  Senator McDowell also made reference to the comments today in relation to being either a millionaire or a pauper in terms of bringing legal action.  I am fearful that this would come into play in probate cases.</p><p>Senator Craughwell made reference to a surprising attitude towards women in some parts of Ireland.  As a woman, I am not totally surprised by that and I do not think any woman would be surprised at outdated and backward attitudes towards women, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.</p><p>Senator Martin Conway referred to the cumbersome process and long delays in the Probate Office.  The Government should consider providing more funding for the Probate Office.  Parliamentary replies and research undertaken by Fianna F&aacute;il have shown that the probate waiting times in Dublin are 17 weeks if one is doing it through a solicitor or 48 weeks if it is done by a layperson.  That is not satisfactory given that one has families that are grieving and paying out funeral costs and other related costs and trying to cope with the situation.  It is unsatisfactory that people must wait up to 16 weeks before the estate is distributed.  That is unsatisfactory.</p><p>Given that 30,000 people pass away every year in Ireland and nearly 90% of them own a home, if the process takes up to 16 weeks there are thousands of homes lying idle across the country and that is unsatisfactory in the context of the current housing crisis as well.  I am pleased to see cross-party support for the Registration of Wills Bill proposed by my colleague, Senator Terry Leyden.  I will pass on the good wishes and support on that to him.</p><p>In an era of people moving around the country, less association with family solicitors and frequent movement between solicitors it is only right and proper that we would implement the Bill without further delay.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for bringing forward the Bill.  There is always a lot of work involved when anyone introduces a Private Members' Bill.  I compliment the Senators on the Bill.</p> <p>I agree with what my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, said about delays in probate.  Likewise in Cork, if I lodge an application for probate at the moment it is four months before I will get a query back, if there is an issue to be raised.  If there is a query, when one replies, it might take a number of weeks before one can get the probate, so there is quite a long delay.  Before one lodges the documents in probate one has to ascertain the valuation of properties and one now has to get balances from the banks on what were in accounts at the date of death.  We now find that we have to fill up a huge volume of documentation for the bank before we are even given the information we seek.  Before lodging the documents with the probate office it takes, on average, between eight to 12 weeks and then another four months before one gets a reply back if there is a query to be raised.  Nine times out of ten there is a query to be raised and then one finds one has to reply to that, so in a lot of cases it is between eight and 12 months before one gets a grant of probate out.</p> <p>That is fine if one has money in the bank and one is not concerned about the management of property but if one has property to be managed in the meantime then security issues arise.  People know when a person has died and that a property is vacant so additional costs are incurred, which is of concern.  When someone acts as an executor, he or she acts in the interests of the estate but there are many obligations imposed on them as well and that is of concern.  I agree with my colleagues that we must consider whether there is a need for additional staff or how we can expedite the process.</p> <p>I have concerns about the Bill.  The courts have a fair amount of discretion.  When an application is made to suggest the will was not properly done or the person did not have legal capacity at the time and the person who is challenging the will loses, in many cases the court tends to grant the costs to the unsuccessful party in order to prevent an appeal being lodged.  That is one of the issues arising.  In other situations I have come across cases where judges have said the parties are entitled to their costs but if an appeal is filed that will not follow, and the provision is put into the order.  We must be careful in doing something like this given the effect on the discretion of a judge.  In fairness, judges take into account the mood of the parties as they go through the legal process.  If discretion is withdrawn from a Circuit Court judge one may end up with a lot more appeals going on to the High Court.  That is something to take into account.</p> <p>I was interested in what Senator McDowell said about wills.  My first experience of dealing with a complicated will was one made by a parish priest in west Cork.  It was a homemade will which had a number of changes, so I had to track down the witnesses.  I travelled around west Cork and it took me an entire day to find the witnesses who were a father and his daughter.  The only time they were in the priest's house was when they went to make arrangements for her wedding.  They understood that the document they were signing related to her wedding when in fact they were witnessing his will.  All they would do for me was to sign an affidavit to confirm that it was their signature but they would not swear that they witnessed his will.  It just goes to show how things were done long ago.</p></speech>

Farms are always a very emotional issue.  We could not find a will but we eventually found a carbon copy of the will in a handbag in a wardrobe in the person's house in England.  If there was no will different parties would benefit in a particular way and other parties would benefit in a certain way if there was a will.  We applied to the High Court for the carbon copy to be admitted into probate.  As people know, a carbon copy does not have evidence of signature.  The High Court did allow the carbon copy to be admitted into probate.  There was no challenge from anyone who was unhappy with the contents of the will, even though people could have challenged it.  The only thing we could get from the solicitor, who was in his 80s when he got to sign the affidavit, was that he did remember drafting the document but he would not swear that he witnessed it ever being signed, but it was admitted to probate.  That goes to show that families do agree at times even when it is difficult to work out what the person wanted, but in this case they were satisfied that this was the intention of the person who had died and there was no contest of the carbon copy will.  It is one of those cases which worked out very well.  It is a problem that is arising more and more in that challenges are more frequent.  I agree with the Senators proposing the Bill that people make the challenges because they are advised that they do not have to worry about costs.  Some system must be put in place to make sure that where there is a challenge it can only be brought in a very genuine case.  There are cases where the challenges are not genuine but people know it is worth it and that they might end up securing something out of the will.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Another one I dealt with was the successful issuing of what we call a Calderbank letter, putting certain things on the table and saying if they are not beaten in court, the other party will definitely get caught for costs.  It forced a settlement on the matter.  This goes to show the process is complicated and not every case is the same.  Each estate is different and it is important to work out the intention of the person making the will and what way he or she wanted the estate to be distributed.  It is about ensuring the estate is distributed in accordance with such people's wishes.</p><p>I thank the Senators for bringing forward the Bill.  It is certainly something we must look at as there is a problem.  In the past five years I have found there have been more challenges to wills than there were in the previous 20 years in which I practised.  It is a problem.</p></speech>

There is no need to engage in unwarranted repetition but I will make some points at this early Stage of the Bill, and in doing so I begin by thanking the proposers who have brought what is, no doubt, a very sincere piece of legislation before us today.  We will support passage to the next Stage but we have some reservations about the application of this proposed legislation.  I have no doubt we will try to address that in co-operation with colleagues in the time ahead and as we get to additional Stages of the Bill.  It has been said there is a raft of deeply personal and emotive matters, and they have been outlined extensively.  That is correct because of the severity of how this affects people's lives.  It is a very sincere effort by the proposers in bringing the Bill before us today.</p> <p>I do not need to rehearse everything at this stage.  It is an important matter that must be addressed and the proposers are seeking to do that.  Collaboratively we can get to a stage where we can get this right.  Currently, for all the reasons outlined thus far, people are being failed or let down; they are experiencing added stress at a time of great emotional burden and trauma for themselves.  If there is anything we can do to assist practically and tangibly in the process, we have the responsibility to do that.  I look forward to working with the Minister and colleagues, not least the proposers of the Bill, as we move ahead.</p></speech>

I was very happy to sign my name to this legislation as there is much merit in the Bill.  It is not the intention of any of the proposers of the Bill to in any way dull or limit the potential of any citizen to litigate with respect to a will.  It is a right that people have clearly set out in the Succession Act in the administration of probate.  People have the right to litigate, which is very important.  If people are unsuccessful in their challenge to an estate, somebody must pay for it.  We are speaking in particular about small estates and I have seen and heard about such small estates where the money has dwindled away between the lawyers and litigation, leaving poor folks with nothing.  That is unacceptable.  I am mindful of a case in County Cork of an illegitimate child - I do not wish to keep getting back to Cork - but that person suffered an ordeal trying to chase a small 15 acre holding in Dunmanway, that lovely little part of the world.  That person went through all the litigation to try to get some sort of inheritance from his mother, who always wanted to make contact with her boy who was stuck in Dublin.  In the end, it was all lost through litigation.  It was sad but things have moved on since.</p> <p>It is important that we note that the Bill aims to reform the law with respect to the liability of unsuccessful parties to pay the costs of certain civil actions connected with them and in challenging the validity of a will.  It is the kernel of this legislation.  It is simple, appropriate and important.  I welcome the Minister and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  The real kernel of this is we do not want to in any way dull people's ability to make a challenge through the courts and the legal process, if necessary.  If they are unsuccessful, they should have to pay some, if not all, of the costs.  We cannot allow estates to dwindle because of litigation, much of which is vexatious or arises from other motives.  It is an important piece of legislation and I hope we will get support across the House.</p></speech>

He was here earlier for quite a while on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill.</p><p>The Government considered this Bill at its meeting this morning and agreed to the Minister's recommendation not to oppose the Bill but to accept the merits of its underlying principles and to agree that the Government should engage with the Bill's sponsors to address some problems that have been identified in the Bill as drafted.  The Minister's understanding is that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that persons who unsuccessfully challenge entitlements under a will or on intestacy, or who unsuccessfully challenge the administration of an estate, should not be able to do so at the expense of the estate and hence of the persons who would share in a distribution of the estate.  We have heard some examples from Senators this evening of where things go wrong.</p><p>The explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill states that, in practice, challenges that are unlikely to succeed are settled to avoid a costly court hearing and this legislation aims to bring an end to that practice.  The Government acknowledges that there is merit in the policy objective of this Bill.  Many of us may be aware of cases where the assets of an estate are eaten by legal battles, some of which are unjustified, and which have the effect of alienating family members and depleting the estate.  We heard examples of that this evening.  The Minister welcomes the Senators' proposal for legislation to address some of the unsatisfactory aspects of succession law in practice but I wish to highlight some issues with the Bill as drafted, which we believe require further work.</p><p>The approach taken in the Bill is to provide that in specified probate proceedings, an unsuccessful party shall not be entitled to an order that his or her costs be paid out of the estate of the deceased person.  This would represent a fundamental change to the determination of costs in such cases.  As Senators may be aware, there is a long-established practice in the courts that a court, when considering the matter of costs in civil proceedings relating to probate matters, will consider the facts of the case and, in particular, will consider two questions.  These questions are whether the unsuccessful party had reasonable grounds for litigation and whether the proceedings were taken in good faith.  Where the court considers that both these questions can be answered in the affirmative it is the usual practice of the court to order the general costs of the action be paid out of the personal estate of the deceased.  This rule of practice was affirmed by the Supreme Court in the 1968 Morelli case, as has been referenced already.  In the course of his judgment on the case, Budd J stated:</p><blockquote>It would seem right and proper to me that persons, having real and genuine grounds for believing, or even having genuine suspicions, that a purported will is not valid, should be able to have the circumstances surrounding the execution of that will investigated by the court without being completely deterred from taking that course by reason of a fear that, however genuine their case may be, they will have to bear the burden of what may be heavy costs. It would seem to me that the old Irish practice was a very fair and reasonable one and was such that, if adhered to, would allay the reasonable fears of persons faced with making a decision upon whether a will should be litigated or not.</blockquote> <p>The Minister is of the view that the Bill as drafted, while attempting to end what might be considered unintended consequences arising from the Morelli judgment, may give rise to unintended consequences of its own.  That is, while reducing the number of unjustified claims, this legislation may also run the risk of preventing those who have genuine concerns regarding a will or the administration of an estate, from seeking to exercise their right to access to justice.  To ensure that this is not the case, the Government wishes to engage with the Bill&rsquo;s sponsors to amend the Bill as necessary.</p><p>The Minister also draws the attention of the House to section 168(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which provides that a court, in proceedings concerning the estate of a deceased individual, or the property of a trust, may order that the costs of or incidental to the proceedings of one or more parties to the proceedings be paid out of the property of the estate or trust.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Minister points out that there appears to be a difficulty of interpretation in the Bill as published.  Section 3, which provides that an unsuccessful party shall not be entitled to an order that his or her costs be paid out of the estate of the deceased person, is subject to section 4.  Section 4 preserves the jurisdiction of the court in terms of the determination of costs in accordance with the rules of court or procedure.  Perhaps it is intended that the rules of court could effectively override the provisions contained in section 3.  The Minister would welcome some clarification as to what is intended here.</p><p>Reference has been made to probate.  A working group has been examining an operational probate system and the work is nearly completed.  I am also interested in the reference that has been made to a registered wills Bill.  That is something that should be examined further.</p><p>As I indicated, the Government acknowledges the merit in the Bill's underlying proposals insofar as they seek to deter frivolous or vexatious claims against an estate which may be settled before reaching court.  For the reasons that I have set out, however, the Minister considers that the provisions will require careful scrutiny and, in all likelihood, amendments to ensure coherence with existing practice in probate matter and to ensure that the right to access justice is not restricted unfairly.  To that end, the Minister will consult the Attorney General to ascertain whether the objectives of the Bill can be achieved in an alternative manner and would be happy to engage with the Bill's sponsors in this regard.</p><p>This area is quite interesting and challenging.  We all have examples and heard anecdotes of what happens, especially in some parts of Ireland.  The cases are not all from Cork and I am sure instances happen in other parts of the country as well.  I thank the Senators for bringing forward the legislation and for the interesting debate on same.  We look forward to engaging further.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the Government for the decision they made today in respect of same.</p><p>As Senator Boyhan has pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is not to take out a meat cleaver and say that in no circumstance could anybody get their costs out of the estate.  The purpose is to say that the ordinary discretions granted to a court to do justice, and the ordinary procedures, including lodgement and things like that, would be far more just if they were applied to probate actions than the rule in Vella <i>v. </i>Morelli.  Section 4 of the Bill explicitly states:</p><blockquote>A court shall have jurisdiction to exercise its discretion or to apply and operate the ordinary rules of court or procedure for the time being applying generally to costs in civil proceedings, including interlocutory proceedings, in respect of actions or proceedings to which this Act applies.</blockquote> <p>The idea was to give judges discretion but tell them that in future one does not, as a matter of presumption, go to the estate as the first port of call in determining where the money is to come from to pay for lawyers and cases.  That is as far as the Bill goes.</p><p>I am very grateful to the Minister for pointing out to me section 168(1)(b) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 because I had not seen that getting in under the radar.  I thought that it was all to do with barristers, solicitors and the like and I had not seen the particular provision.  It is relevant to how this issue should be dealt with and I am grateful to the Minister for drawing it to my attention.</p><p>Of course, I have no doubt that all of the sponsors would be agreeable to looking at how, on a collaborative basis, this issue can be best approached, and this is what the Minister is saying.  Quite obviously this is a single purpose Bill.  If there was a civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill travelling through the Department at greater speed than this legislation, we will not be selfish and we will not be dogs in the manger.  If the issue can be dealt with in a way that is agreeable to everybody, I am quite happy to let that happen.  The idea that the costs of an unsuccessful challenge to a will come out of the estate as a matter of course is an unfair idea.  It could be fair in some circumstances but the presumptive rule in Vella <i>v. </i>Morelli is that it operates that way.</p><p>In these litigious days, and I was interested in what Senator Colm Burke said about the growth of litigation in this area, it is strange that as we are getting wealthier, we are becoming more litigious.  I think the rule in Vella <i>v. </i>Morelli has something to do with that growth and that it is why it should be changed.  In those circumstances I am very grateful to all of those, including Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and Fine Gael colleagues, for allowing this Bill to go to the Third Stage.</p></speech>

He has asked me to make a statement on his behalf in terms of the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill that has been introduced by Senators Mark Daly, Robbie Gallagher and Lorraine Clifford-Lee.  I thank the Senators for providing me with an opportunity to restate again the Government's approach to the draft legislation.</p> <p>The Bill completed Second Stage in October 2016 and is based on a draft contained in the 2005 report by the Law Reform Commission on corporate killing.  As Members will be aware, in each of its reports the Law Reform Commission publishes a draft Bill to translate its recommendations into draft legislation.  It is the Minister's understanding that it is not expected that such Bills will be accepted without due consideration by the Attorney General and without appropriate amendments, whether from Government or Opposition.  Each draft Bill requires careful consideration and generally much work.  To the best of the Minister's knowledge, this has been the approach to such Bills to date.  In saying this, he recognises the value of such draft Bills and also the excellent and valued contribution of the Law Reform Commission to public policy development through its reports.</p> <p>The Bill sponsored by the Senators is almost identical to the draft Bill published by the Law Reform Commission in its report on corporate killing.  As the House will know from the Second Stage debate, the Government did not oppose the Bill in principle but did highlight specific aspects of the Bill as drafted that would require greater consideration.  The Government also highlighted that a range of Government amendments would be needed.  Consequently, some of the sponsoring Senators met officials from my Deportment in March 2017.  As the Minister understands it, the officials outlined the complex issues raised by the Bill and indicated that further legal advice would be sought.  Expert legal advice was subsequently received and, essentially, confirmed that the Bill raised concerns that would need to be addressed.</p> <p>The present Minister understands that the then Minister subsequently wrote to Senator Mark Daly in May 2017 explaining these legal concerns in detail and offered to facilitate a further meeting to progress the Bill.</p></speech>

The expert legal advice confirmed that the following main issues would need to be clarified and addressed: the range of public bodies to which the Bill would apply; the range of unincorporated bodies to which the Bill would apply; the availability of appropriate defences and exemptions, with particular regard to work that necessarily involves a risk of death or serious injury, such as emergency services; and the threshold for the offences under the Bill.</p> <p>The advice also raised particular issues on the proposed individual offence in section 3 of grossly negligent manslaughter causing death.  One of the issues here is the extent to which the offence, which is focused on eliminating risk, should apply to circumstances where there is an unavoidable element of risk.  The Minister understands that consultations across Departments have identified concerns that the proposed new offence could have unintended effects on services which inevitably involve a degree of risk.  There is no doubt that persons guilty of serious wrongdoing should be held to account.  We must, however, guard against unintended consequences where employees and volunteers are unduly exposed to criminal liability.  For example, the Minister is advised that even the perception of potential liability to prosecution could have a chilling effect on the involvement of volunteers in some sectors.  We must also try to ensure that there is no undue tension between prosecuting wrongdoing and encouraging, or indeed requiring, openness and candour.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important to remember, too, that there is already a common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter.  In the neighbouring jurisdiction, when legislation on corporate manslaughter was enacted in 2007, it was decided not to enact an individual offence also but to rely on the common law offence.  The Minister wants me to reiterate that the Government is ready and willing to work with the sponsoring Senators and the whole House in addressing the issues raised by the Bill.  The Minister and I would like to repeat the offer of further engagement with officials, if Senators it would be helpful, and that we are open to other suggestions they may have.  We do need to make progress on this important issue, but we also need to get it right to avoid what could be serious unintended consequences.  That will involve some more work in analysing the issues involved and preparing amendments, but the Government is ready to continue this work with the sponsors of the Bill. </p><p>On behalf of the Minister, I once again thank the Senators for raising this important matter.  The Minister and I look forward to seeing progress made on it.</p></speech>

Out of the 1,700 women who were knowingly infected by contaminated blood products, 240 had haemophilia, of whom, to date, 112, or nearly half, have died.  One could imagine of the 1,700 who were knowingly infected by they health service by contaminated blood products, that at least half of them are dead.  In 2005 the Law Reform Commission produced a report, Report on Corporate Killing, LRC 77-2005, in which it recommended the introduction of the Corporate Manslaughter Bill.  The Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill is long overdue, not just because of the hepatitis C scandal but also a litany of cases in which people died as a result of action or inaction, for example, the fire at the Stardust nightclub, in respect of which the families involved continue to be affected.  Was there inaction?  The answer is yes.  Did things happen because of breaches of the fire code such as fire exits being locked?  The answer is yes.  The train crash near Cherryville junction in County Kildare in 1983 and at Buttevant, County Cork in 1980 were the result of serious mismanagement.  The Whiddy Island disaster was the result of a decision taken by the owner of the <i>Betelgeuse</i>at board of management level not to renew longitudinal and codation protections for economic reasons.  If the instruments had been in place, the accident would not have happened.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service and the Health and Safety Authority have a range of convictions but only in relation to accidents at work.</p><p>Let us bear in mind that the contentious section of the Corporate Manslaughter Bill is section 3 which I have read numerous times this week, but this is literally the Bill the Law Reform Commission produced in 2005 which contains an offence of grossly negligent management causing death.  Section 3(a) refers to where management knew or ought reasonably to have known of the substantial risk of death or serious personal harm, failed to take reasonable efforts to eliminate that risk or that failure fell far below what could reasonably have been expected in the circumstances.  Let me state what was included in the reply I received from the Department of Justice and Equality that a fear of prosecution could militate against the public interest by discouraging employees in certain sectors from being candid about mistakes and that the perception of potential liability to prosecution could have a chilling effect.  Let us bear in mind that this is the reason the Department wanted section 3 to be removed.  </p><p>The hepatitis C scandal occurred nearly 30 years ago when 1,700 people were knowingly infected.  The person concerned knew that the product was contaminated.  If it is of any comfort, we were not alone, as the same happened in France where people were knowingly infected with HIV and the government knew it.  There was a trial, but it was a farce as nobody went to jail.  </p><p>The response from the Department on the most critical section is that it actually could cause those who know not to act.  We have seen that failure time and again, where people knew and did not act.  Why did they not act?  They simply did not care.  There were economic consequences and as they were management, they did not act.  If they did not act in the public interest, my argument is that section 3 should remain in full in the Bill, as recommended not by Fianna F&aacute;il but by the Law Reform Commission because 1,700 people were given a death sentence when they were contaminated by the health service as a result of serious mismanagement.  If people will not act in the public interest, they might act in their own because they would go to jail for up to 12 years because of their inaction or an omission.  We have been unable to get the health service to act in the public interest.  Senior management has failed time and again.  It needs to be held to held to account, not by being fired but by being put in jail because it is putting women in their graves.  Unfortunately, that has been seen to happen time and again.</p></speech>

I have huge sympathy for the Bill.  For the past fortnight I have been speaking about political responsibility overshadowing those who took decisions that led to events such as the cervical cancer screening disaster, the hepatitis C scandal and various others in the past 25 to 30 years, with which we are familiar.  There has been a doctrine since the 1940s, the Carltona principle whereby Civil Service officials speak with the voice of the Minister in charge of a Department, regardless of whether the Minister knows it.  Most Members do not know that when they take ministerial office, they will not be informed of this.  Officials take decisions.  Some of the decisions taken in recent years were to try to cover up mistakes that had proved life threatening and cost people their lives.  Time and again, we have heard calls for a Minister's head to be put on the chopping block.  Why?  When we have the Minister's head, they are gone and whoever made the decision to cover up is still there and carrying on in exactly the same way.  That is the problem.  I have spent 25 years of my life defending workers' rights and will stand four-square behind any worker who is trying to do a decent day's work for a decent day's pay, but for a person to knowingly cover up something, that is behaviour I cannot understand.  </p> <p>The fear expressed about the Corporate Manslaughter Bill 2016 is that it will kill off voluntarism.  Like most young peopIe, I was in the Irish Red Cross and various other voluntary institutions when I was 12 or 13 years of age.  I do not think the Bill sets out to catch some volunteer who rushes to the aid of a citizen.  I appreciate that there might be a problem which should be ironed out as the legislation passes through the Oireachtas, but what we are looking at is the role of senior managers.  Today there are calls for the head of Mr. Tony O'Brien, but will that get to the individual who covered up the scandal?  Mr. O'Brien cannot have his finger on every pulse, although I do believe he should go.  I have great sympathy for those in political life who carry the can for "Yes, Minister" officials who keep serious issues hidden from the public.  For that reason and that reason only, there should be capacity to identify an individual.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the individual is identified, that individual should be charged and there should be retribution.  The public should be able to see that one cannot hide serious issues from them.  One simply cannot do that.  One has to be able to come forward as soon as something is recognised.  If one does not come forward, that is no different from taking a knife and sticking it into the chest of a person who then dies.  If someone is aware of something which will kill people and keeps it quiet, then he or she may as well be a murderer.  That is my view for what it is worth.</p><p>We need to take our heads out of the sand.  Corporate responsibility should go the whole way down the line.  If something emerges it should be brought to the attention of senior management immediately and finish up on the desk of the Minister before it finishes up on the desk of the State Claims Agency which takes an extremely aggressive approach to everything that is ever brought in front of it.</p><p>I have sympathy the with the Bill and would love to hear what the Minister's Department would like to do to make it workable.  I would like to be able to try to support that.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is very hard to argue with the motivation behind the Bill, especially given what we have seen over the past couple of weeks.  What Senator Craughwell said is correct.  Too often there is political accountability, and rightly so, but it is rare that there is accountability in terms of official Ireland.  We all remember the issue of hepatitis C, which was a national scandal.  Knowingly contaminating and killing people is totally wrong.  In my view, there had to be accountability.</p> <p>There are issues with the Bill and the Minister of State has outlined the concerns.  He very forcefully concurred with the sentiments behind the Bill, as we all do.  The role of the House is to scrutinise and improve Bills and make them workable.  That happened with the Irish Sign Language Act, which Senator Daly successfully sponsored.  There is no reason that should not happen with this Bill.</p> <p>The Minister of State's reflections and concerns are genuinely held, given the professional advice available to him.  The suggestion which has been made, namely, that there should be engagement between Senators Daly and the Minister of State's officials, as has happened successfully before, should happen.</p> <p>It is absolutely correct to say that this is a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  It does a superb job in identifying where we need to reform the law.  When we and elements and organs within the State do wrong, there should be political accountability and accountability on the part of individuals when that wrong is deemed to have been done maliciously, knowingly and in a cavalier way which ultimately cost people their lives.</p> <p>This is an important Bill.  I am speaking in a personal capacity and have spoken with Fine Gael colleagues.  We want to see the Bill progress.  The debate here is important and I sincerely hope that following on from that there is high-level engagement between the Senator and the Minister of State's advisers and officials and the Bill comes back to the House in early course.  I hope that we can get it passed by the House and moved to the Lower House and that it becomes law.  Senator Daly was quite right when he said that until such time as there is the threat of jail, there will not be the type of accountability we want to see, which the public expects and the citizens of our country have a right to.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#TT00500"><p>We are a high-tech Chamber.  It goes to show how busy we were this afternoon that I had so many notes to print and discuss.</p> <p>For the past 15 years we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been urging the Government, and have supported previous attempts, to introduce such safeguards into the workplace, including in the form of a corporate manslaughter Bill tabled by my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien, in 2016.  According to the Health and Safety Authority, 421 people lost their lives at work between 2008 and 2016.  This huge loss of life should act as a call to action for the Government.  There should be no further delay in this matter.</p> <p>Hundreds of families are grieving the loss of their loved ones.  The Government and employers owe it to those carrying the burden of that loss from the workplace to ensure that no more deaths due to deliberate neglect occur.  Corporate killing, that is, death in the workplace as a result of employer indifference, needs to be put on a statutory footing.  It is totally unacceptable that companies, through dereliction of their duty of care to those they employ, are endangering lives.</p> <p>The sentiments I am expressing today would then apply to workplaces North and South.  In the North, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act came into effect in 2007.  Its first application occurred in a Belfast court in May 2012 and resulted in a firm being convicted of the death of an individual due to neglect.  The firm in question was fined a considerable sum of money in respect of the death of its employee.</p> <p>Safety in the workplace makes sense for workers and employers.  It protects both.  It is important to highlight that we too have a workers' memorial day to remember all those who have died.  In remembering them, we are also saying that no more tragedies at work should occur as a result of deliberate negligence.</p> <p>Health and safety in the workplace is not conditional on the ability of the employer to pay for it, nor should it be subject to a cost-benefit analysis.  A price should not be placed on a worker&rsquo;s life by an employer or the Government.  In circumstances where an employer is responsible for an employee&rsquo;s death, it is unacceptable that it is too difficult to hold the company to account and be made liable for that death, as outlined comprehensively by previous speakers.</p> <p>As a bit of an aside, we need look no further than the Grenfell Tower fire in London last June and the devastation that appears to have been caused by a dereliction of duty on the part of Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council, all in an apparent attempt to save costs.  The official figure of those who lost their lives as a result was 71, although there is a general consensus that this figure is higher given that some people are unaccounted for.  In citing that example we do not need to look very far.  Senator Daly outlined some of the more well-known tragedies which have occurred closer to home.  </p> <p>It is clear, at least in my eyes, that the reason the people in Grenfell died was not because of some unfortunate tragedy but rather as a result of their perceived socioeconomic class.  If this had been in another part of Kensington and if it had not social housing, we would still be outraged to this day.  However, as these were, for the most part, welfare recipients, it has been swept under the carpet.  As I said, we have seen similar devastation caused by fires closer to home at a halting site in Carrickmines and the apparent mismanagement on the part of the council to maintain the site to the point that it descended into a state of disrepair which caused, at least in part, the death of ten people, including children.</p> <p>I do not make the accusation that this fits the definition of corporate manslaughter and understand that a case is being taken by the family as of very recently.  I do not want to adjudicate on something that is before the courts.  However, there is to this day an apparent lack of accountability or recourse in light of the deaths of these people.</p> <p>The Law Reform Commission compiled a report on this very topic in 2005.  The report contains two main recommendations.  The first is that a new statutory criminal offence of corporate manslaughter should be enacted which would make an undertaking, such as a company, a public body or a partnership firm, responsible for a death arising from its gross negligence.  The second key recommendation is that there should be an offence for senior managers of grossly negligent management causing death.  A former Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Arthur Morgan, produced a Bill on the back of this report, but unfortunately it lapsed.  I hope the Government does not allow that to happen again this time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not clear why it is failing in its duty of care to the working population in the introduction of a corporate manslaughter Bill.  We can speculate about the motivation of employers when they oppose such legislation.  If there is opposition from them, the Government must not be deflected from its primary responsibility in this important area.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes a legal incentive is required to concentrate the minds of the Government and corporate bodies and would support the Bill were it to progress further.  There should be no further delay in protecting workers' rights and their safety in the workplace.  No person should ever have to go to work fearing that he or she will not return to his or her family owing to the incompetence of an employer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-08a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050800002#UU00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton.  I have had the opportunity to read through his response twice and he makes many valid points.  We must tread carefully and have regard to advice and the need to avoid litigation.  I understand the advice of the Attorney General has been sought as there comes a point when we have to take professional advice.  When we are put on notice, it is important that we heed the advice given.  This is a complex issue.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for the manner in which he set out the concerns of the Minister and the Department.  I acknowledge that I do not detect any effort to stall this process.  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Mark Daly on the issue, about which he is very passionate, as is evident every time he speaks about it.  In the past two weeks we have heard many women give testimony and speak about terrible ordeals in relation to the cervical cancer screening programme and about the huge resistance of and lack of support from State agencies in response to what had been done to them.  There are women who remain in the dark about their health, as do their families.  This Bill would be of no consolation to them.  At the end of the day, it is important that people be held to account.  Every day both in this House and the D&aacute;il I hear politicians bellyache about the need for accountability.  Subject to due process, we must hold people to account and sanction those found to have done wrong.  It is important that there be due process, but there must also be justice, particularly for victims.  We must support them by putting a system of redress in place.  Words are meaningless, as are a slap on the wrist and people saying they are sorry.  We are tired of this; we need justice, the provision of support and sanctions.  Ultimately, we must never be afraid to put people behind bars if they knowingly set out to inflict damage and suffering on others.  </p><p>Rather than go into any great detail on the Bill, I want to share with Members a letter from the Irish Haemophilia Society addressed and sent to all councils on 9 March 2017 which I will also place in the public domain later.  It states:</p><blockquote>The Irish Haemophilia Society support the addition to Irish law of a provision or law on corporate manslaughter. The experience of our small community and of other groups affected by contaminated blood scandals in Ireland provides an example of the type of situation where such a law may be applicable. In Ireland, 1,700 people were Infected with Hepatitis C through blood and blood products supplied by the state.  Of these 1700, 240 were people with haemophilia with the others being recipients of Anti D, blood transfusions or treatment for renal disease.  Of the 240 people with haemophilia infected with Hepatitis C, 105 were also co-infected with HIV. To date, 112 of these 240 people with haemophilia have died including, in several cases, brothers or more than one member of the same extended family. This appalling tragedy resulted in a catalogue of human misery and despair which has been ongoing for the past 32 years.  The contamination of the blood supply was the subject of two separate Tribunals of Inquiry - the FinIay Tribunal and the Lindsay Tribunal in 1997 and 2001, respectively.  Following the Lindsay Tribunal, the Irish Haemophilia Society has worked proactively with the Doctors and the Department of Health in ensuring that we have a formal voice in policy and other decisions on treatment of haemophilia through a statutory National Haemophilia Council and a formal role in the selection of safe and effective medications for treatment of haemophilia.  At the end of 2016, we were able to announce the effective eradication of Hepatitis C in our community through access to new treatments.</blockquote> <p>I beg the Acting Chairman's indulgence for one more minute because it is important that I quote the letter as is.  It continues:</p><blockquote>Those who survive with HIV or Hepatitis C in our community have endured a long struggle.  We will never forget those who have died as a result of contaminated blood but a fitting memorial to them would be a law on corporate manslaughter.  We must learn from history if we are not to repeat it.  The report of the Tribunals and in particular the Finley Tribunal, catalogue a series of deliberate actions or inactions which resulted in the infection and death of many people.  Despite requests from the relevant patient organisations, neither report was forwarded for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions, nor did any successful criminal prosecution take place of any individual.  We must learn from this and ensure that the public in future are protected from malfeasance or deliberate actions, inactions or omissions which result in the death of individuals.</blockquote></speech>

This is very important.  The letter continues:</p><blockquote>We are not seeking prosecution for simple errors or failure to foresee future threats.  However, where actions, which result in death, were deliberately taken for financial gain or risks deliberately ignored to protect institutional reputation or events covered up to prevent disclosure, then there should be a remedy in criminal law.</blockquote> <p>I read the letter because it is very important.  It says it all.  I know that the Minister of State is committed to taking action.  The sooner the Bill is progressed the better.  While noting the advice about which the Minister of State cautioned, it is important that we move at speed, particularly in the light of what has happened in the past two weeks.  </p><p>I thank Senator Mark Daly for his enormous work on and commitment to bringing foward this legislation.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence of Senator Ian Marshall and congratulate him on his election to the House.  I wish him well in his time here and look forward to working with him.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this important issue of ensuring undertakings and the individuals who work for them that have been grossly negligent to a high degree resulting in a death are held accountable for their actions.  Everybody who has contributed to the debate mentioned the Law Reform Commission and acknowledged the very good work it does.  I would like to be associated with those remarks.  Draft Bills from the Law Reform Commission will be accepted, but it is not expected that they would be accepted without due consideration by the Attorney General and appropriate amendments, whether from the Government or the Opposition.  The Government cannot just accept such Bills and the Law Reform Commission does not expect it to do so.  The Government did not and does not oppose this Bill.  However, as stated, there are serious concerns that, as drafted, it could cause legal and practical difficulties which might militate against prosecutions.  We must take the advice we receive very seriously.  In addition, public services, emergency services, community and voluntary services could be unnecessarily and negatively affected, from the paramedic to the fire fighter, which would be to the detriment of the community.  Therefore, we need to strike the right balance.  We cannot disregard the advice we have received.  </p> <p>I agree with Senators that we must work together to find solutions that are acceptable to everyone in the context of the concerns raised about the Bill.  I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, wants this to happen.  I reiterate that there is already in place a common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter.  In 2007, when the United Kingdom was legislating in this area, the common law offence was relied upon and law-makers opted not to enact an individual offence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As I have said, the concerns outlined by the former Minister for Justice and Equality during the Second Stage debate on the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016 have been confirmed in further legal advices to the Government.  As Senator Boyhan has said, the Bill in question deals with a very complex area of law.  It needs to be amended.  The Government has endeavoured to be constructive.  We wish to engage and work with the sponsors of the Bill to find solutions that are acceptable to all so that we can make progress with it.  I suggest that this should happen at the earliest possible date.  I invite Senators to engage with us on this matter so that we can get the Bill into law, while taking account of the serious considerations and advices of the expert lawmakers we have engaged to advise us on this.</p></speech>
