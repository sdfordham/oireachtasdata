I am grateful to him for coming to take this urgent Commencement matter, one that has been raised quite a number of times for the attention of successive Ministers for Health.  I raise it again in order to keep the pressure on as it is hugely urgent and impacts severely on the experience of patients within the health care system.</p> <p>To put it briefly, I ask the Minister for Health to inform the House when he intends to bring forward the legislation promised to change the criteria for medical training to alter the eligibility requirements for doctors in Ireland from non-EU countries to enter specialist training programmes here.  There are doctors working here in psychiatry and a number of other specialist divisions who were trained in other countries.  They are permitted to work here as non-trainee doctors, but they are not allowed to enter the trainee specialist divisions because they have not completed a recognised internship.  I am told that there some doctors from non-EU countries such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa who have been recognised from 2006 onwards.  There is, however, a significant number of doctors from other countries work who should be on specialist registers but are unable be included because the necessary legislation has not been brought forward.  Certainly in the field of psychiatry there are doctors from India, the Philippines and Nigeria who should be allowed onto the trainee register but are not.  This means that they do not receive the supervision they should if still in training.  It also means that it is very hard to recruit or retain doctors where we need them because they do not receive the training opportunities and recognition they would receive if the legislation was to be brought foward.</p> <p>There is a bizarre anomaly in the health system.  I have spoken to colleagues who work in the sphere of psychiatry and elsewhere who have told me that it is bizarre and recognised as such.  It has an impact on patient safety because there is no supervision to the required level.  It also has an impact on waiting lists because the necessary specialist doctors cannot be recruited or retained.  The effect on patients is very clear and has been recognised by successive Ministers for Health.  I know because I spoke to our colleague, Senator James Reilly, when he was Minister for Health.  At the time he promised to bring forward the necessary legislative change.  A simple amendment is required and would be supported by the Medical Council and every other stakeholder.  There is no political disagreement on the issue.  It seems to be due to a bureaucratic delay.  In late 2016 the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, promised that the necessary legislation would be brought forward in the first quarter of this year.  Previously, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when Minister for Health, said he would bring forward the legislation.  I am told that the most recent ministerial comment is that it will be brought forward in the final quarter of this year, but that is simply not good enough.  The deadline for doctors in training is July 2018.  Therefore, the legislation must be concluded by the start of January 2018.  Bringing it forward in November or December will be too late to enable us to see the benefit in having a sufficient number of doctors on the specialist register next year.  The matter is urgent and the legislation must be brought forward.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a political commitment to doing it and I am simply seeking to apply pressure in that regard.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Alan Kelly, our spokesperson on health, will also apply pressure about this.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister why the legislation has not been forthcoming.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-06-13a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017061300002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Bacik for raising this important issue.  I also take this opportunity to wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, well.  As I speak, tributes are being paid to him in the D&aacute;il.  From my perspective, having worked with him as a Minister of State over the past 12 months, he has always been very positive and inclusive.  He did not have issues with people having different views.  He was very supportive of me and my portfolio as Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues.  I wish him, his wife, Fionnuala, and all his family well for the future.</p> <p>This is an opportunity to update the House on the position relating to amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 regarding specialist medical training in Ireland and entry to the trainee specialist division of the Medical Council register by doctors from non-European Economic Area, EEA, countries.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides that nationals of non-EEA countries are registered in the trainee specialist division of the Medical Council&rsquo;s register if they have passed the council&rsquo;s pre-registration examination system, PRES, or are exempt from the PRES in line with legislation, have an approved training post and have been granted in a third country a document which, in the opinion of the council, is at least the equivalent of a certificate of experience.</p> <p>The certificate of experience is the certificate received on completion of an Irish internship.  The Medical Council recognises internships in a number of countries as equivalent to Irish internships.  These include Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sudan and Malaysia.  However, internships from non-EEA countries outside of those countries are not currently recognised by the council, and I am aware that this creates difficulties for doctors from those countries who wish to access specialist training programmes in Ireland.  Given these difficulties, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has decided to remove the certificate of experience as a requirement for registration in the trainee specialist division.  This will mean, in effect, that entry to the trainee specialist division for doctors who obtained their qualification in a non-EEA country will be by way of the pre-registration examination system - unless, as previously mentioned, the applicant is exempted from sitting the PRES in line with legislation - and the offer of a specialist training post by the HSE in a recognised training programme.  The requirement to hold a document considered by the Medical Council to be at least the equivalent of a certificate of experience will no longer be a prerequisite.</p> <p>The amendment will be introduced by a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, a complex legislative measure which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in liaison with my officials.  The drafting of the Bill was delayed due to the transposition of the modernised professional qualifications directive, which was transposed on 17 January 2017.  The current timeframe is to publish the Bill by the end of 2017, but this is subject to no major issues arising.  It is important to mention, however, that Ireland is committed to a national policy of health worker self-sufficiency and has signed up to implementing the World Health Organization, WHO, global code of practice on international recruitment of health personnel.  The code establishes and promotes voluntary practices for the ethical international recruitment of health personnel and the strengthening of health systems.  Article 3.6 of the code recommends that member states "strive to create a sustainable health workforce and work towards establishing effective planning, education and training, and retention strategies that will reduce their need to recruit migrant health personnel".</p></speech>

I join him in wishing the Taoiseach well on his retirement.  I offer best wishes to him, his wife, Fionnuala, and his family.  However, I am disappointed with the substance of the Minister's reply, which does not bring matters forward in any way.  Indeed, it simply re-states a decision that had previously been made by the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, some years ago and which was re-stated in August 2015 by the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  It appears that nothing has changed.  In 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, told <i>The Medical Independent</i>that legislation was being drafted at that time.  It is a simple amendment to the 2007 Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a huge Bill, as I understand it.  </p><p>The Minister of State also raised an important ethical issue, which is that currently we are poaching doctors from developing countries without offering them any opportunity to increase their specialisation or to train in a recognised training structure here.  That is why we are losing people and that is why we cannot retain or recruit sufficient numbers of qualified doctors to bring down our horrendous waiting lists in the health system.  I know that the Minister of State is a passionate advocate for reform in the health system.  This is a very simple reform and I do not see how the Minister for Health can say that the timeframe is to publish the Bill by the end of 2017, subject to no major issues arising.  This is an urgent matter.  One of the organisations that has consistently highlighted this is Overseas Medics of Ireland.  Its former general secretary, Dr. Shakya Bhattacharjee, emigrated to the UK from Ireland out of frustration and to access a training post in neurology there.  We cannot keep the doctors that we need here and that has a knock on effect on our own people, as well as on the developing countries from where we are poaching doctors.  I will continue to raise this and I will also rely on Deputy Alan Kelly to raise it in the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister of State to bring the message back to the Minister for Health that this must be dealt with more urgently than is currently the case.</p></speech>

I also take her point about the deadlines being too late and I will bring that back to the Minister for Health.  I acknowledge the Senator's disappointment and accept that if it is a question of drafting a relatively simple amendment, we should go ahead and do that.  I will give Senator Bacik a commitment that I will highlight this particular issue with the Minister and my Government colleagues.  I agree with the Senator that the question of poaching doctors is an ethical one that must be resolved but at the same time we need people to work in our health services who are well trained and qualified.  I will bring all of the Senator's concerns to the attention of the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

The next Commencement matter is from Senator Michelle Mulherin, who has four minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-06-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017061300002#D00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and thank her for being here today to address this issue.  First, I commend her for the passion and commitment that she has demonstrated for early years education and child care in this country, which has been on the back foot for many years.  The Minister secured a 35% increase in this year's budget, on the back of a 35% increase in 2016.  I welcome the extension of the free pre-school programme from one to two years and the commencement of the affordable child care scheme which will kick in this September.  The Government is urging parents who were pushed out of the labour market because they could not afford child care to revisit their decision to stay at home to mind their children and to see if they can now re-enter the workforce.  There is a whole suite of measures to which the Minister will refer, I am sure, including additional funding for the child care subvention scheme.  The Minister also provided funding to address short-term issues that arose such as the removal of unqualified CE scheme workers from the child care provider ratios and for non-contact hours.  I highlight all of these measures because I recognise the serious inroads that the Minister is making.  However, issues remain to be addressed, as I am sure the Minister is very aware.</p> <p>The fact that the early years education and child care sector is undervalued is not new.  This has been the case for many years and Ireland is really trailing behind.  It is fair to say that it is no coincidence that this is an area that has been and continues to be dominated by women.  There is a direct correlation between that and the fact that the work is undervalued.  Notwithstanding the fact that most of those working in the sector have been undervalued for many years, it is the case that the sector has become increasingly more regulated in terms of buildings and physical infrastructure and the requirements placed on service providers by the State, particularly with regard to education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When children go to child care, it should not just be about childminding - they should also be stimulated and educated.  We all recognise that if children can get a good start at a formative stage, it can set them up very well for the future.</p><p>As the Minister will be aware, there is a crisis in this area.  Regulatory and educational requirements have increased.  The service providers and professionals working in this sector are at their wits' end because of pay issues.  The highly qualified people who deliver these services want to be able to stay in this sector.  We know their hourly rate of pay, based on the average for the entire year, is approximately &euro;10.</p><p>SIPTU is running a campaign on this issue.  I attended a meeting it organised in Castlebar, County Mayo, last Thursday night.  There was palpable frustration among the many workers in attendance about their terms and conditions.  I will mention two particular issues they raised.  They are paid for just 38 weeks of the year.  This means professionals have to sign on or find other work for the summer.  That is the position in respect of employees.  Service providers do not get paid at all during this period.</p><p>I know the Minister has secured some funding to recognise the administrative preparation that is required to deliver child care services.  Frustration has been expressed by those who believe this is way too little and argue that they need much more.  The suggestion is that all of this leads to unsustainability.</p><p>There is a disparity between community service providers and private service providers.  Many private service providers are frustrated because when problems are noticed by the State in the community sector, providers in that sector are immediately supported and financed so that those problems can be fixed, but the contrary is the case in the private sector.  In my experience over the years, the private service providers are doing their best.</p><p>A great deal of frustration was expressed at the meeting in Castlebar about poor communication.  I pointed out that there is an early years forum, but people generally-----</p></speech>

The Senator has already mentioned some of the ways in which the Government is investing in the early years sector.  As she indicated, the 35% increase I achieved in budget 2017 was on top of a similar increase in 2016.  Such increases reflect the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  As a means of addressing the cost pressures being faced by providers in the sector, I secured &euro;14.5 million for 2017 to enable providers to be paid for non-contact time.  For an average early childhood care and education service with 25 children, this will mean an additional payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum.  I announced yesterday that an extra &euro;3.5 million will be made available to child care providers in the form of a non-contact time payment.  This will benefit child care providers who participate in the community child care subvention and training and employment child care programmes.  All services that sign up to deliver these schemes from September will be invited to apply.</p> <p>In the slightly longer term, the programme for Government commits to an independent review of the cost of providing quality child care services.  When this review has been completed, it will feed into future policy development and into the design of the new affordable child care scheme, including payment levels to services.  A new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their child care, to be known as the affordable child care scheme, will eventually replace the existing targeted child care subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The affordable child care scheme will encompass universal and targeted elements which can be incrementally expanded over time.  It is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates over time as further Government investment becomes available.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In advance of the introduction of the new affordable child care scheme, changes are being made to the existing schemes to improve subsidy rates.  From September 2017, up to 33,000 children aged between six months and 36 months who are availing of registered child care will benefit from a new universal child care subsidy.  The maximum weekly subsidy payable will be &euro;20 for children attending full-time care.  Moreover, from September up to 23,000 children and their families who currently avail of child care support under the community childcare subvention, CCS, programme will benefit from significant increases of up to 50% in the subvention rates provided under the programme.  Up to 7,000 children and their families currently availing of the training and education child care support programmes will also see increases in subsidy rates.  Up to an additional 7,000 children are expected to benefit from the CCS scheme for the first time from September 2017 due to improved access to the scheme.</p><p>Capital funding is in place to support the sector.  Funding of &euro;4 million was made available under the early years capital programme for 2017, with a separate &euro;3 million allocated for services providing school age child care.  Applications for these schemes are being assessed currently.</p><p>Notwithstanding these improvements in the area of affordability and the significant additional resources that have been secured for early years, it is recognised that the sustainability of services remains an issue.  A fund of &euro;1 million has been made available to child care services to help replace unqualified community employment scheme workers.  Further, officials from my Department have met several providers to understand better the sustainability challenges they face.  The learning from these interactions is informing policy in this area, especially as it relates to the annual Estimates process and the decisions around resource allocation.</p><p>Staff in the child care sector play a critical role in delivering high-quality child care services, and they deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.  It is acknowledged, however, that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector and can lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.  My Department is engaging with colleagues in relevant Departments and with the early years sector to explore how this might be addressed in the short, medium and long term.  While my Department is somewhat constrained in what it can do in this regard as it is not an employer of child care workers, it accepts that it is a major funder of the child care sector and, as such, has a role to play.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge the good work going on in partnership throughout the early years sector to bring about improvements in all the areas we are discussing today.  While much has been achieved to date, much work remains to be done to ensure Ireland achieves its aim of being a model of early years delivery.</p></speech>

I am raising an issue relating to a school in Innishannon, a small village between Bandon and Cork city that has seen significant growth in recent years.  This village has seen significant numbers come into the area.  We are trying to ensure this school can develop and that the entire campus or site can develop in an appropriate way.</p> <p>In the past six months the school has received planning permission from Cork County Council for two classrooms on the site, both of which would be 80 sq. m classrooms.  First, the Department of Education and Skills granted approval for the building of one of these classrooms.  Then, last week, the Department granted another approval for the school to build a special education teaching unit as well.  This would be a 15 sq. m room.</p> <p>To me it does not make logical sense to provide for a situation whereby we will spend money on building this new unit.  We have no planning permission for it.  We have planning permission for two classrooms.  We were allowed to build one and now we have been given approval to build a smaller one.</p> <p>The school is looking for a logical solution that would allow it to build the two rooms for which it received planning permission.  The money involved is small.  The school has been granted &euro;34,000 for the small 15 sq. m room.  A further &euro;100,000 would ensure the two classrooms would be built appropriately.  This is basic common sense in many ways and it suits the practical dynamics of the site.  This school will develop further because it has developed over the years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another classroom will be needed in time.  It does not make logical sense that the Department of Education and Skills should provide &euro;35,000 for a 15 sq. m classroom when planning is in place for an 80 sq. m classroom.  We need to have a vision for the school in terms of where it is going to go.</p><p>The Department should examine the landscape of the school's location and consider the logical suggestion that it should build both classrooms.  If the Department builds both classrooms, it will mean that the school has a long-term focus.  It does not make sense to build one and then the other, and then build an add-on in between.  That does not make sense for the State.  The school has been granted &euro;34,000 for a 15 sq. m classroom.  An extra &euro;100,000 would mean the school would have an 80 sq. m classroom.  That is the appropriate size.</p><p>I realise this is not the domain of the Minister, Deputy Zappone.  However, it is an issue the Minister for Education and Skills may have to consider in the next number of weeks in order that we have a logical solution to a very practical issue.  The classrooms need to be built.  There is approval for one.  Let us build two and plan for the future.</p></speech>

I offer him this response on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It provides me with an opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Skills in regard to the accommodation needs of Scoil Eoin in Innishannon, County Cork.</p> <p>The Senator is aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years, including in the Cork area.  In that regard, the six-year construction programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including special schools in areas where demographic need has been established.  In addition, the capital programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in schools, including special schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified or an additional teacher has been appointed.  It is open to schools to apply for funding for additional classroom accommodation where required.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that Scoil Eoin is a co-educational Catholic ethos primary school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class.  The staffing at the school for 2017 will be one principal, 11 mainstream class teachers and four special education posts.  The enrolment in Scoil Eoin is 295 pupils, reflecting a 6% increase in enrolment over the past five years.  </p> <p>Scoil Eoin submitted an application to the Department of Education and Skills in December 2015, seeking two additional mainstream classes, as the Senator has pointed out.  Approval was granted for the provision of one mainstream classroom.  This approval was to address the mainstream classroom accommodation deficit that would prevail with the appointment of an additional mainstream teacher from September 2016.</p> <p>The school subsequently submitted a further application to the Department in March 2017 for the provision of an additional mainstream classroom.  The application was assessed by the Department of Education and Skills and it was determined there was no deficit of mainstream classroom accommodation at the school.  The Department determined, however, that in light of the special education teaching hours at the school there was a deficit of special education teaching accommodation. </p> <p>It is in that context that the Department of Education and Skills approved an additional special education teaching room for the school in addition to the mainstream classroom previously approved.  The decision was recently conveyed to the school.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I can confirm the Department's commitment to progressing the devolved building project in the case of Scoil Eoin.</p></speech>

It is an issue which can be sorted out quite simply because it is a very practical issue.  There is planning permission for an 80 sq. m classroom.  We need to build it as otherwise the process will be delayed.</p></speech>

I will get straight to the point.  The Government made a commitment in respect of the matter I am raising.  Commitments are about honour and delivering something.  The commitment to which I refer has been restated by the Minister and her colleagues in government.  I attended a conference last week at which I heard the stories of many people who have experienced issues in terms of direct provision.  I also heard about families that need to be reconnected and other matters.  We need to challenge the myth that Ireland is the country of a thousand welcomes.  That notion needs to be re-evaluated.</p> <p>It is important that we stand in solidarity with people in need and that we honour our commitment to take 4,000 individuals into our country.  While we face other issues and challenges, this matter is about our tradition as a country which, historically, has known emigration and our people's need to flee and find refuge in other places.  This issue resonates in the hearts and the minds of Irish people generally.  There is a good spirit about that and an openness, acceptance and firm belief that diversity, difference, culture and background enliven and enrich our society.  There is general acceptance of that and it is a great thing to be able to say that in a true republic and to mean it.</p> <p>What is the Government's plan to fulfil the commitment made in this regard, which was agreed with our European counterparts?  I acknowledge that there are difficulties involved but perhaps the Minister might, with the aid of her script, outline that plan.  I appreciate that she has a job to do.  I want to keep this matter on the agenda, maintain the focus on it and see how we can get back on track and deliver on our commitment to those 4,000 people.</p></speech>

Under that programme, the Government pledged to accept up to 4,000 persons overall into the State by the end of 2017 under the EU relocation and resettlement programme.  Under the programme, people have been arriving in Ireland since January 2016.</p> <p>Ireland has an established national resettlement programme under the UNHCR-led scheme and our past successes in implementing this programme have greatly assisted in a successful delivery of our commitments under the EU programme.  We were one of the first EU member states to fulfil our pledge under the July 2015 agreement, a full year ahead of schedule.  As a result, we doubled our quota in terms of resettling people from Lebanon, from 520 to 1,040.  A total of 779 people have been resettled thus far and the remainder have been selected and will be brought to Ireland by the end of the year.  It is likely that further resettlement missions will be undertaken to Lebanon to bring more people to Ireland under the resettlement programme post-2017.</p> <p>The relocation programme has been more challenging.  An EU-wide solidarity mechanism on this scale is unprecedented.  Our voluntary opt-in to the programme was warmly appreciated by our EU partners.  Naturally, there have been some difficulties in establishing the necessary infrastructure and standard operating procedures at Union level, particularly given the very challenging environment of the island hot spots.  In total, just over 20,000 people have been relocated across the EU member states to date.  We have relocated 459 asylum seekers from Greece and a further 320 people in Greece have been assessed and cleared for travel.  By September, we will have relocated just under 1,100 asylum seekers from Greece.</p> <p>Relocation from Italy has not yet been possible because the authorities there have not allowed the law enforcement authorities of other member states to conduct security assessments of candidates on Italian soil.  We have made repeated efforts at all levels, including at senior ministerial level, to resolve this issue and the European Commission has called on Italy to show greater flexibility in this regard.  If an acceptable solution is found, we can commence relocating eligible candidates from Italy.</p> <p>The Deputy should also be aware that the number of asylum seekers who have been registered in Italy and Greece and who are eligible for the relocation programme falls well short, at present, of the 160,000 originally envisaged in the context of the two EU Council decisions.  A concerted effort by all member states between now and the end of September could ensure that all those eligible are relocated.</p> <p>Ireland is doing everything it can to give effect to its commitments. The intensive efforts and resources that the Department has invested in the relocation programme should not be underestimated.  In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable people caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All unaccompanied minors who have been referred to us by the French authorities have been admitted to Ireland.  These unaccompanied minors have programme refugee status on arrival, the highest form of protection the State can offer.  Should it be the case that despite all Ireland's efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in sufficient numbers of asylum seekers under relocation, the Government commitment to take in 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms, should this prove necessary.</p><p>As the Senator is aware, the conflict in Syria and the tragic scenes emerging almost daily are rarely out of the media these days.  Consequently, and rightly so, the Government's efforts to provide a humanitarian response to the European Union migrant crisis resulting from this and other conflicts is subject to intense scrutiny by the non-governmental organisation community, the media and Irish society in general.  However, more important than being able to satisfy this level of scrutiny is the need to ensure those most vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers arriving under the programme are fully supported.  The support of our local communities is key to this success, and the people of Ballaghaderreen have provided a model of support that can be replicated in other localities.  Should it be the case that, despite all our efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in sufficient numbers of asylum seekers under the programme, the Government commitment to take in these 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms, should this prove necessary.</p></speech>

It is to be welcomed that there is no question of reneging on the commitment to take in 4,000 people.  That may happen through other mechanisms, systems and channels, and we can accept that as fair enough.  I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the third paragraph of her reply, as it states "Deputies" should be aware and I suppose it should read "Senators".  I hope the Minister and her colleagues around the Cabinet table will keep this issue on the agenda.  It is my intention, as long as I am here, that I will keep this as one of approximately six issues that I will bring to the fore as it is important we do it.  I thank the Minister for coming here and giving the response.</p></speech>

Having participated in one aspect of the initiatives through the Department of Justice and Equality - my Department was involved with the matter of unaccompanied minors - I saw at first hand the complexity of the issues involved to do what we want, particularly in terms of working closely with another country.  Italy is a case in point as it will not allow us to bring law enforcement people into the country to provide checks there.  It is part of the mechanism for relocation.  I am heartened to know, and I will work with them in this regard, that should we not be able to accept those numbers, it is the intent of the Department of Justice and Equality to find other mechanisms.  With the Calais issue, for example, it was our intention to accept up to 200 unaccompanied minors, but it was very difficult to find the 20 that have come in.  As they become available, effectively we have accepted them.  It seems to be the case with the other programmes that as people are made available to us through mechanisms, we accept them.</p></speech>

It highlights the Government's intentions towards women and how they are treated.  The delay is due to staff shortages across the HSE because of its own and the Department of Health's failed staffing and employment policies.  That is the backdrop to what is going on.  This week we heard about a case in which a child attempted to invoke her rights under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act only to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.  It is a frightening thought for any woman who is pregnant and will experience any kind of difficulty during her pregnancy.  It is meant to be a joyous time, but her life is at risk, not by her own hands but by those of the State.  It is incredible.  One would not have read about this in a newspaper in Ireland in the 1950s, but one can today.  I condemn this act and ask the Minister to establish an independent inquiry to find out precisely what happened in this case.  It is clear that the legislation is flawed and that women deserve a lot better.</p><p>I also refer to housing.  The elephant in the room is supply.  Some 22,000 homes for which there is full planning permission have not been built.  It is scandalous.  Dr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute has suggested the idea that the Government finance large-scale rental developments.  It is a fantastic idea which would work hand in hand with other suites of measures aimed at reducing the cost of new builds.  The Government promised 2,000 rapid build housing units last year and this year.  Of these, 22 have been developed.  Tonight, in south Dublin city alone, 479 homeless person beds will be occupied and that number does not include the 695 in private hotel accommodation across the city.  There was a promise to eradicate this figure by the summer, but that has not happened.  Now that the leadership contest in Fine Gael is over, I urge the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to return to work and make meaningful inroads in alleviating the housing crisis.</p></speech>

I also wish the new leader of Fine Gael the best as he takes the reigns and moves forward in seeking to remain in government until 2020.</p> <p>We were promised that the Sale of Alcohol Bill would be brought before the House and completed prior to the summer break.  I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality brought amendments to the Cabinet today that are required to expand the Bill as presented by Senators Billy Lawless, Michael McDowell, Victor Boyhan and me to include areas not included by us.  I hope the Leader will be able to give us some news on when the Bill is likely to be brought back before the House. </p> <p>I understand the Minister of State with responsibility for defence matters will make an announcement on the issuing of the Jadotville medal.  I thank the Leader for his assistance in having the issue dealt with on the floor of this House.  I also thank Deputy Noel Grealish for his assistance in the D&aacute;il.  If medals are to be issued to all of the Jadotville tigers, it is not before time, but the Minister of State is to be commended for doing so.  I express my thanks to the Leader for his assistance behind the scenes which is not always seen but which was much appreciated in this instance.  The next time the House sits I will revert to my usual self and recommence criticising the Government.</p></speech>

Irish politics faces two highly significant and unprecedented moments involving far-reaching change in the State.  Earlier we witnessed the resignation of the Taoiseach.

That is no mean feat.  He could end up here yet; one never knows.  I wish him and his family well.  It is an important time for them.  Deputy Varadkar will be elected as the new Taoiseach tomorrow and I too wish him well.  I hope his term of office will be notable for a more direct and hands-on involvement in the North, bringing the authority of the office of Taoiseach to bear on the overall direction of Irish politics.</p> <p>I hope it is not an indication of what is to come but I am somewhat disappointed that the incoming Taoiseach took the time to contact Arlene Foster on the DUP's recent electoral success but failed to do likewise with any of the other parties in the North.  The other highly significant event that I referred to earlier is of course the electoral results in the North.  For Sinn F&eacute;in, this is the biggest vote for nationalists since partition and is the first time across the North that more votes were cast for non-unionist parties.  The DUP also had a good election.  Given this political context in which we now find ourselves as a result of the election and the impending threat posed by Brexit, it is critical that the new Taoiseach implements the long-standing promise that MPs from the North would, as of right, have speaking rights in this Oireachtas.  I am glad to say-----</p></speech>

They have said they want no part in Westminster and, of course, that Westminster should have no part with them.  That would be a more appropriate response than the comments we have heard from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and other regional party leaders such as Fine Gael and Labour, who have told us that republicans must take their seats in Westminster and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen of England.  I wonder whether the same people would have advised those who set up the first D&aacute;il in 1918 that such a bold and decisive decision was folly and that Sinn F&eacute;in MPs should take their seats at Westminster instead.  How dare they stand on the sidelines as passive observers of politics in the North and tell the huge expressed democratic mandate endorsed for the Sinn F&eacute;in stance that they have to ignore that and travel to England?</p></speech>

This shows what a complete failure the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act 2013 has been in respecting the human rights of women in this country.  The girl qualified for a termination under this legislation and was denied one.  I would also like to read a comment from the then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, who stated, during a D&aacute;il Committee Stage debate on the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill in 2013, "the very notion that one could section a woman who is expressing suicidal ideation but is not depressed to keep her confined for the duration of her pregnancy would be utter anathema and would not be tolerated or countenanced".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is truly extraordinary, given recent media reports, that we should be so naive as to think people will ultimately do the right thing in such circumstances.

I think the first priority for the incoming Taoiseach must be to set a date for the holding of a referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I am delighted that the committee is being established.  It is important that the committee would do its work and consider what sort of legislation might be introduced were a referendum on repeal to be passed.</p> <p>We have heard about several cases this week, particularly the appalling case Senator Ruane described of the young girl who was denied a termination of pregnancy and who was sectioned in circumstances where she and her mother understood they were being offered a termination of pregnancy.  That appalling case alone would be enough to warrant the holding of an urgent referendum on repeal.  On top of that, however, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has today issued a second decision to hold Ireland in breach of human rights law for failing to offer any sort of compassionate response to a case of fatal foetal abnormality.  I am referring to the case of Siobhan Whelan, the Wexford woman whose treatment, if one reads the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee, was appalling.  She was treated with an utter lack of compassion by all the health professionals in Ireland with the exception of one locum doctor.  She was eventually offered the termination of pregnancy she sought on foot of the very harrowing and cruel diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality in Liverpool, not in Ireland.  The UN Human Rights Committee described her treatment as cruel, inhumane and degrading.  We are told again, as we were last year in the case of Amanda Mellet, that our laws are simply not good enough for women.</p> <p>The UK Department of Health has today published statistics which show that, last year alone, 3,265 Irish women travelled to the UK for abortions.  This has to stop.  We have to stop exporting these most harrowing and tragic cases, we have to stop exporting thousands of our women and we have to repeal the eighth amendment.</p> <p>I think the key priority for the incoming Taoiseach must be to set a date for the holding of the referendum.  The members of the Oireachtas committee can then discuss what follows and what replaces the amendment in terms of legislative provision for abortion in line, for example, with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  The clear need for holding the referendum has been laid out.  It needs to be held, I would say, by the end of February or early March of next year.  I think that date should be set.  There is a growing momentum around the realisation that the referendum is necessary.  Successive generations of Irish women, my own included, have been failed over decades.  It is time we stood up and said that no more children be detained and no more women be denied the compassionate services they require here in Ireland.  We need to act now.  I call on the incoming Taoiseach to do that.</p></speech>

By any reckoning, having restored the country's finances, the party's fortunes and our reputation internationally while making serious progress on social issues, he has succeeded on all levels.  We all accept there is much work left to do.</p> <p>I stand over the quotes attributed to me regarding the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, and I made it clear earlier that I want an investigation into the circumstances that led to a citizen of this country heading to Dublin in the belief that she was going for a procedure only to find herself incarcerated.  That is utterly unacceptable and I want the truth of what precisely happened exposed.  Laws and protocols are in place to prevent that from happening and I would like to know precisely what happened.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to explain why a community school project in Lusk which commenced in 2011 with phase 1 completed in 2013 and phase 2 to have been completed in 2014 remains unbuilt with planning permission only granted in 2016.  A tenderer still has not been appointed.  We were told that a tenderer would be appointed by July and that may be the case.  However, this means with an 18-month build that this facility for Lusk, with a population of more than 10,000, will not be ready for occupation until September 2019.  The local children started their education in the secondary school in 2013 in anticipation of continuing their education to the end in this facility.  This is important in the context of keeping the community of Lusk together.</p></speech>

I attended the launch of the submission and while I should not be shocked, I was.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is an amazing organisation, which has helped many people in need through the Famine, the War of Independence, Civil War, two world wars and several economic recessions.  It has been on the go since 1844 when its founder, Frederic Ozanam, stated:</p><blockquote>The question which is agitating the world today is a social one.  It is a struggle between those who have nothing and those who have too much.  It is a violent clash of opulence and poverty which is shaking the ground under our feet.</blockquote> <p>I would like to highlight the issues the organisation is facing.  The figures its officers outlined this morning for a country as wealthy as Ireland are absolutely disgraceful.  More than 91,000 households are in need of social housing while more than 2,500 children are homeless.  One in four one-parent families live in constant poverty, which is disastrous.  In Ireland's affluent areas, 90% of young people end up in third level education but, in deprived areas, the participation rate falls to 15%.  How can we say we are giving those children a fair shot at achieving their potential?  I was struck in particular by the comments of one lone parent this morning because I did not think that the reality was as bad as this, and I quote:</p><blockquote>Yesterday I had a litre of milk and a sliced pan to feed my kids.  I had to scrape together change to buy butter so we could actually have toast.  The reasons for this was buying school books on Tuesday.  I don't know how I will cope next year but something has to give.</blockquote> <p>A total of 130,000 people called the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in 2016.  It is not acceptable that people like this woman are barely getting by in a country as a wealthy as Ireland.  It is time for change.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is really important.

I will make the point in a different way, if I might.  It is already interesting to see the measures that have been taken by the incoming Taoiseach as to who he seeks support from.</p> <p>Deputy Leo Varadkar accused the now Senator James Reilly, who was then a Deputy and a Minister, of doing something that looked like a stroke in his constituency.  There was an announcement today that the Garda station in Stepaside will be reopened.  This is from the Minister, Deputy Ross, who apparently came into politics to get rid of stroke politics, wants an independent Judiciary and does not want to have any political interference in the judicial system, yet he is now able to announce, just as the new Cabinet is going to be announced, that he himself has got his Garda station reopened.  The new Administration is supported by Deputy Lowry and also by someone who has got a nice little Garda station open for himself in his own constituency.

Enda Kenny brought a particular energy and positivity to whatever he did.  He had a leadership style that had a huge enthusiasm and optimism.  All of that was tempered with humanity and great personal skill.  He brought those traits to his leadership of the party of which he was transformative.  He also brought the same traits to the leadership of the country where he was transformative in the economic and social spheres and right across a range of areas.  He has left a huge legacy and it was all done with probity.  We should acknowledge today that alongside him was a person who brought enormous capacity, patriotism and great skill to his role and I refer to Michael Noonan.  Great tribute should be paid to Michael Noonan today also.  </p> <p>I shall raise another issue that was very dear to Enda Kenny as Taoiseach and to Michael Noonan.  I call on the parties in the North, as should this House, to restore the Executive in Northern Ireland.  Brexit will be a huge challenge for this country on so many fronts.  This island is being confronted by Brexit and a myriad of issues such as the fluctuation of sterling.  Therefore, it is important that we re-establish the power sharing Executive in Northern Ireland.  I call on the parties in the North to do so and this House should join in my call.  </p></speech>

I sat in the Gallery of the D&aacute;il to listen to him and I was struck by the modesty and simplicity of his speech, which should be acknowledged.  He clearly demonstrated that he is a man with enormous energy who has mastered the craft of politics and how it is done, which is to be admired.  There was a great expectation that his speech would be surrounded by razzmatazz or a circus but it was not. He has done this State an amazing service and we wish him well.  Politics is a tough old business.

It is important that we invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House as soon as possible.  I am reliably informed that there were a number of tweets from the Cabinet today regarding Stepaside Garda station.  I understand there is literature about it circulating in the constituency, so it was clearly primed and ready.  People have received printed literature stating that Stepaside Garda station is being re-opened.  I am delighted about Stepaside Garda station, but many Members here represent and are in communication with community representatives across the country for whom rural and community policing are very important matters.  We must have an explanation of the rationale for this Garda station being re-opened rather than others.  Why not the ones in Dalkey or Kill-O-The-Grange, two other stations that closed at the same time, as well as stations in north Dublin, Cork and other places?  There must be an explanation.  I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality be invited to the House to explain the reason for that decision.</p></speech>

I offer my condolences to the victims' families.  I have spoken about Islamic radicals in this country previously.  I agree with what Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy Niall Collins said during the week, that these people with terrorist views have no right to be in our country.  Recently, a group in Trim was caught laundering money for terrorist groups in foreign countries.  We see in the newspapers that a cleric has said that Islamic radicals in Ireland now number 100 or more.  Basically, they plan to attack to create more division and hatred in our society.  That murderer in England - I could not call him a gentleman - stayed under the radar in this country as a pastry chef.  Could the Leader invite the new Minister to the House to discuss the issue of these people being on our shores?  If they need to be put out of the country, let us put them out.  They should not be here in the first place.</p></speech>

In fact, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was in the House on the last sitting day discussing the sale of AIB shares.  Members who were present wished him the best.  As Vice Chairman of the finance committee, I have encountered the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on a number of occasions in my short time as a Member of the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to pay tribute to him and to Enda Kenny, to recognise the long service they have given to the State and to wish them both all of the best on my own behalf and that of my party colleagues.  Today is also the first sitting day in Seanad &Eacute;ireann since the new leader of Fine Gael was elected on Friday, 2 June.  I would like to wish Leo Varadkar all the best for his own sake, that of his party and indeed, of the country, because it is to everyone's benefit that he does well.</p><p>A number of Senators have already raised the matter of the reopening of Stepaside Garda station.  It should be noted that the Dublin Rathdown constituency, where I live, only has a single operational Garda station.  It is a three-seat constituency with 65,000 houses but there is only one Garda station.  There are approximately 600 Garda stations in the country and 40 D&aacute;il constituencies, giving an average of 15 stations per constituency.  However, Dublin Rathdown, the former Dublin South constituency, has one single Garda station within its borders, albeit that some other Garda stations nearby cover parts of the constituency.  I ask the Leader to obtain and then provide the details to this Chamber of exactly what we will be getting in Stepaside Garda station.  Prior to its closure by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter, there were 34 full-time operational garda&iacute; in Stepaside.  A large extension was built onto Dundrum Garda station and all of the Stepaside garda&iacute; were moved there.  The station in Stepaside is very small and I would like to know exactly what we are getting back.  Will it be a couple of hours per week from one or two garda&iacute;, who will be stamping passport or driving licence applications or will it be a full-time, fully operational Garda station as it was before it was closed?  </p><p>I know I am not supposed to raise more than one issue on the Order of Business but I ask that we would have a debate soon on the issue of school playing fields being sold off to pay debts owed to the State.  In some instances, religious orders have been asked to sell land to pay debts to the State and that land is being lost to schools, which is very unfortunate.  I will raise this matter again.</p></speech>

I also note that today the Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, has been appointed to the Court of Appeal and I wish her and her family well.  Hers has not always been an easy role but she provided good public service.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement of the names of the Seanad Members of the Oireachtas committee that will examine the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  It would be too much to say that I am looking forward to this particular committee and life on it, given the life, death and grim nature of some of the recommendations it will have to consider.  However, I am sure that all members will do their best.  I am surprised, if I heard her correctly, that Senator Bacik seems to be suggesting that a date should be set for a referendum now, in advance of the deliberations of the committee.  Considering the very radical nature of some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and that some of those recommendations seem to have come after zero consideration of the issues upon which the assembly was recommending, I would have thought the Oireachtas committee will have to consider, first of all, the respect it should give to the particular recommendations that came from the assembly.  I would have thought that it is at least theoretically possible that we would come to the conclusion that there should not be a referendum.  To suggest, in advance of the work of the committee, that we should set the date for a referendum seems to me to be bizarre indeed.  </p> <p>The sad story of recent days has, no doubt, prompted some of the comments.  That story shows that trying to protect two lives is always a difficult business.  Whatever the merits of what went on - I do not know the full details and I doubt that anyone else here does - it seems that there was at least an attempt to protect a mother's life.  I am very sorry that nobody who has spoken so far has expressed any concern about the fate of the child that was involved in that story subsequently.  </p> <p>In conclusion, I agree that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is very flawed.  I pointed out the fact that predicating a right to abortion on the grounds of threatened suicide was always unmedical and always wrong.  What we now need to do is re-grasp our idealism and see the 3,265 women, referred to by Senator Bacik, who travelled abroad last year as tragedies but that figure is coming down.  For an equivalent population, Britain would be having 16,000 abortions a year so we need to conclude that the eighth amendment has saved thousands of lives.  That will also have to be part of our deliberations on this committee.</p></speech>

I also wish to pay tribute to my own Limerick colleague, the outgoing Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  The two of them, working together, have done a fantastic job in bringing the country back from the brink and restoring our finances.  I wish them and their families the very best for the future, although they are not retiring just yet.  We will still be seeing them around the House but I wish them both well on what is an emotional day for them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to a recent Road Safety Authority report, most of the 21,000 child seats that were tested were found to be faulty, were not the right size or were not installed properly.  I understand that when the authority tested 224 child seats in the Limerick area, it found that 180 of them were incorrectly fitted.  This is quite a serious position.  I compliment Brian Geary Car Sales in Limerick, which is holding an event next Monday at which people will be able to have their car seats tested and will be shown how to install them in a proper manner.  I encourage others to organise similar events all over the country because car safety is very important.</p></speech>

In his poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, S&eacute;amus Heaney, whom we have commemorated in this Chamber, wrote:</p><blockquote>Behaviour that's admired<br /><br />is the path to power.</blockquote> <p>I think Deputy Enda Kenny was admirable.  I know we might have differed.  Many people in this House and in the Lower House might have differed with him in relation to argument, but his behaviour was to be admired.  As many other Senators have said, he had great energy.  Einstein said that people need just two things: the imagination to believe something is possible and the energy to propel it forward.  The outgoing Taoiseach had both.  He also had a great sense of joy against all the mockery, cynicism, sardonic behaviour and gossip masquerading as facts around the place.  When I was listening to the debate in the D&aacute;il, I heard some people ridiculing and reducing his stewardship.  I wondered whether I should buy them some mirrors to look in because what he did was for the common good.  Many of the people down there have done very little for the common good, but have acted instead in their own self-interest.</p><p>Deputy Enda Kenny's contribution spanned 42 years of public service, which is some legacy.  He had a belief in what he wanted to accomplish and he accomplished it well.  He had huge courage against odds and against major distractions.  He brought his party from its knees by rebuilding it so that it could stand up and be powerful and persuasive once more.  He was sometimes more recognised off the island than on the island, which seems to be a feature of the Irish personality.  I am here because of him.  Many of the new Ministers who were appointed in 2015 are there because of him.  They should remember that over their next term.  I am very grateful to be here.  I am very affirmed by him.  I take this job very seriously.  I am privileged to be in the Seanad.  All we have left is regard and respect for ourselves, and belief and value outside cynicism, mockery and negativity.</p><p>Deputy Enda Kenny never lived in his head.  We spend most of our time living in our heads.  He practised what he believed and his energy never wavered.  I wish him and his family well.  The legacy he has left behind with force and fire is one of passion, belief, value and respect.  May the Gods be with the next Taoiseach that he might leave such a legacy of respect for our nation and our people.  One is no use to anybody unless one has a passion for one's work.  Perhaps some of the Senators around here might listen to the contributions of other Senators, rather than operating as if they were in some kind of back office.</p></speech>

Many of the characteristics and fine qualities he has demonstrated over the years in his leadership of the country and the party have been well described.  The day he was elected as Taoiseach - he was put forward and he assumed that position - was historic and inspirational for me as someone from Mayo and the west of Ireland.  It was historic in the sense that the power base of politics and the media in this country, in terms of what the norm should be, has always been Dublin or some other big urban centre.  The Taoiseach captured the imagination to the extent that we achieved history in that year's general election when four Fine Gael Deputies were elected in a five-seat constituency, something which had never been done before in this State.  I dare say it might be a long time before it happens again.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was inspirational in the sense that we mock and make fun of the notion of "To hell or Connacht".  However, I believe there is some psychological notion that things leave and that there is emigration.  The point is that even though there are so many fine people, including fine people in Dublin who are established here and who have roots in the west and in Mayo, the power does not go there.  I believe he has broken that glass ceiling for those of us from the west of Ireland and allowed us to dream big and achieve.  I believe he is leaving a fantastic legacy.  We have had the benefit of all that positivity as well as the idea of putting the shoulder to the wheel and putting the best foot forward and so on.  I remember at one point, not long after I was elected as a Deputy, we were climbing mountains, going on walks and going on cycles in the middle of winter.  His energy is remarkable.  I also pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p><p>Today, the report of the expert panel on the problem of pyrite in blocks in Mayo and Donegal was published.  I am asking for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to be brought before the House to debate the report and for the Minister for Finance to attend subsequently.  Many households are distressed and looking at their houses in ruination.  Finally, I commend and acknowledge the fact that Senator Coffey was the person who established the group during his time as Minister of State at the Department.</p></speech>

Obviously, they have an impact not only on Ireland, but on Irish society and people North and South of the Border.  It is important that at some future date the Leader makes provision for a strong debate in the House on the outcomes and consequences of that particular election.  This is in the interests of the stability of our country in terms of Brexit and our relationship with our people in Northern Ireland as well.</p> <p>I am sorry to see that two parties which I consider to be of the middle ground in the North of Ireland, namely, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party, no longer have MPs in the House of Commons.  They sacrificed their political futures some years ago in the interests of peace, and we should acknowledge that as representatives in this country.  The SDLP is the party of Hume, Mallon, Durkan and McGrady and, as a representative in this country, I will always hold it in the highest of respect.  I hope to see the day when the SDLP will return representatives again.</p> <p>I also look forward to the day when political parties in the South, including my party, Fine Gael, run for election in the North of Ireland.  It is something we need to debate seriously in this country.  We need to look at putting up representatives there to bring some real politics to Northern Ireland and to represent people when elected in the various representative chambers.  In that sense, I urge the parties of Northern Ireland to get around the table and form the Northern Ireland Executive to bring the representation and government that people so badly need as well as to bring stability to the entire island.</p> <p>I wish to be associated with the tributes being paid to An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, also.  I have been honoured to serve with him since 1999, when I was first elected as a councillor.  Over many years I have had the great honour to serve under him as a councillor, Senator, Deputy and Minister of State.  I wish him the very best in his retirement.  He is a man of the utmost integrity, a man of compassion and a man who has shown extraordinary stamina and vision through difficult times.  I wish him and Fionnuala the very best in their retirement.  I wish the same to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p> <p>There will be a changing of the guard in the coming days.  We will have a new Taoiseach and I wish him well.</p></speech>

There has been a seismic shift in what has happened.  I pay tribute to Alasdair McDonnell, a good friend of mine and of this country, because I canvassed for him.  He made a significant difference in Westminster.  The SDLP have been close to us and, with Mark Durkan and Margaret Ritchie, I believe the party made a major difference.  When I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of Good Friday Agreement they, along with Sinn F&eacute;in MPs, came down to attend the committee meetings on all occasions.  Their voice in Westminster will be very much missed.</p> <p>I also pay tribute to two Ulster Unionist former MPs, Danny Kinahan and Tom Elliott.  The fought their corner but they were very measured.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The results have changed.  The DUP has 10 MPs and is working very closely with the Conservatives.  This may be a good or a bad thing.  We should not judge.</p><p>A nationalist voice from Northern Ireland, which represents the island of Ireland, is missing in Westminster.  Sinn F&eacute;in has seven MPs and I respect their right not to attend Westminster.  We have to fill the void.  Perhaps it can be filled through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</p><p>In my journeys to Westminster, I have noted the all-party group for the Irish in Britain.  It comprises Members from the House of Lords and the House of Commons, mainly Labour Party representatives as well as many Conservative and SNP members.  The group believes in advocating for all that is good for the island of Ireland and the UK.</p><p>Conor McGinn was re-elected. He is from Camlough, in County Armagh, and represents St. Helens North.  He chairs the committee to which I referred.  I urge the next Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadker, to consult widely with the group.  It is a voice that we badly need.  It is a voice of reason and one which brings the two countries together.  It has been an interesting election.  As somebody said, it is a case of needs must and we must work together even more now.</p></speech>

He did an outstanding job as leader of Fine Gael, as a Deputy and as Taoiseach of this country.  He did a number of outstanding things.  When he came into office, he provided leadership and made sure that the entire Cabinet and Government were motivated to deliver.  Putting in place the right ground rules for the creation of jobs was a priority.  As a result, over 200,000 people are now back at work compared to 2012.  That has benefits, in that there is more income for the State which means more services can be provided.</p> <p>Deputy Kenny gave two outstanding speeches as Taoiseach.  One concerned the Cloyne diocese report, which sent a clear message to the church.  The second was his more recent speech in Washington, in the presence of President Trump.  It sent a clear message to the United States and around the world.  It was a very important speech.</p> <p>The contribution he has made will stand to this country for a long time to come.  The groundwork has been done.  We still face major challenges.  We know those challenges can be dealt with.  If we work together we can meet those challenges.</p> <p>I refer to the comments of Senator Norris and others on Northern Ireland and the need for a nationalist voice in Westminster which is not there.  It is not so long ago that the Sinn F&eacute;in Party objected to this country joining the European Union.  It changed its mind on that and now has no problem in participating in the European Union.  In vies of this there is no reason why it cannot represent the people who voted for it in the Westminster elections.</p></speech>

I found him extremely cordial and professional in my dealings with him as Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach and a Deputy.  When I was in the D&aacute;il I always found him very courteous and a gentleman to deal with.  Whatever about political differences, he deserves some time in the sunset with his wife, Fionnuala, and his family.  I wish him the very best.</p> <p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is a very affable, quiet-spoken gentleman from Limerick, has, like the Taoiseach, served the nation for many years, with many personal and political ups and downs.  I would also like to wish him the very best in his retirement as a Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1988"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I expect both the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the outgoing Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to spend less pressurised years in the other House.</p><p>With those few words of gratitude and respect, I ask the Leader of the House to respond to the Order of Business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-06-13a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017061300002#AA00200"><p>I thank the 24 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business, the vast majority of whom paid tribute to our outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  Together with the Cathaoirleach and all the Members of House, I extend, on my own behalf, on that of the Fine Gael Party and on that of the House, our every good wishes to An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to his wife, Fionnuala, and to his family, Naoise, Ferdia and Aoibhinn, on their historic contribution to public service in our country.  When history is written and the analysis of the past six years and decade are looked back on, the name of Enda Kenny will stand brightly, with him being regarded as a man of honesty, integrity, humility, compassion and empathy and a man who did our country Trojan service.</p> <p>The Taoiseach spoke today in the D&aacute;il about politics being work worth doing, and he certainly did that.  He will be recognised, as has been said here today, as being perhaps one of the best taoisigh we ever had.  I say that not in the sense of hyperbole or drama but he took over as Taoiseach at a time of crisis in our country.  He was the man who held the Government and our country together and who helped, with our people, to bring it to recovery.  That is an important tribute to the man who, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell quite eloquently said, has been a man of imagination and of huge energy.  Whether it was at 7.30 or 3.30 in the morning, he was still going, working on behalf of all of us.</p> <p>The manner in which he represented our country across the world, whether it was at European Council meetings, in the White House or on trade missions to many parts of the world, was such that he was that ambassador who represented our country with pride and with distinction.  Many of us on St. Patrick's Day looked on him with pride for the way in which he spoke about immigration and the way in which he said all of us must be looked at as people.</p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell spoke about Einstein and imagination.  Enda Kenny was often criticised for being a man of no vision, but he had one great vision, that of the importance of employment, of work, of people having a job and of Ireland being the best small country in the world in which to do business.  I am very proud to stand here as Leader of the House and pay tribute to him and thank him not only for his service as a Member of the Lower House but for having given 42 of years of his life to public service.  Equally, when we talk about patriotism, we talk about people who have vision, and history will be very kind to Enda Kenny.</p> <p>Senator Leyden, in his very humorous remarks, paid tribute to Fionnuala.  It is important that we thank her today not for being a member of Fianna F&aacute;il but for having the vision and the temerity to fall in love with Enda Kenny and to join him in matrimony to see the other side - the positivity of being a member of Fine Gael.  The Senator is right in saying she was and is a wonderful women, and her family made a huge sacrifice for this country.</p></speech>

He was a member of every Fine Gael-led Government since 1982.  He said yesterday that he enjoyed most of all being Minister for Finance.  As many of us know, he is a man held in huge affection, a man in whose company we enjoy being and who has had a strong sense of what it means to be a Minister, to be in government and where he wanted our country to go.  I thank him also.</p> <p>I pay tribute also to the Attorney General, as Senator Mullen rightly referenced.  From my dealings with the outgoing Attorney General, I found her to be a woman of courtesy, professionalism, warmth and absolute integrity.  Whenever I spoke to her or met her, I always left her with a great sense of joy and of being appreciated.  She had an interest in everything we were doing in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank her and her family for her service as Attorney General.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senators Ardagh, Ruane, Bacik, Mullen and Reilly raised the very sad case of the young woman who was sectioned as part of the report published.  It highlights the importance of the work of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  It is important that we acknowledge the creation of that committee and allow it to do its work in a manner that is sensitive and respectful without recourse to adversarialism but that can examine the issue, as many people want to see happen, and come up with a solution that we will present to the Government.  It is heartbreaking to read the reports in newspapers yesterday and today of the way this young woman, a citizen of our country, was treated and incarcerated.  As Senator Mullen said, it is important to allow the committee do its work.  It is premature to suggest that dates for a referendum and so on should be proposed because the committee must do its work.  Equally, the investigation into what happened called for by the Senators should be carried out by the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Health because there are protocols outlined in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and it is important that they are fulfilled.</p><p>It is important that we get answers to what happened in this case, but it is important also that the issue that will come before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks is dealt with in a sensitive, caring and respectful manner.  Regardless of people's viewpoints, we, as Members of this House, on behalf of the people who elect us, must deal with the matter and, ultimately, either put it to the people or not.  That is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people to decide.  I hope that the Members will reflect upon the report of the Citizens' Assembly and read the papers given to them.  Regardless of whether they agree with the outcome, a piece of work was done which was important and should be valued.</p><p>Senators Norris, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Coffey, Feighan and Colm Burke made reference to the election that took place in the North and across the United Kingdom last week.  I congratulate the MPs from all parts of the United Kingdom and the North of our country on their election.  I pay tribute to them, their families, teams and parties - and Independents in some cases - for the role they played in the election of the new MPs.</p><p>I pay tribute also to the MPs in the North of our country who lost their seats.  I express my disappointment at the loss of three fine Nationalist MPs, Margaret Ritchie, Alasdair McDonnell and Mark Durkan, who were exemplary representatives of the people and who carried out their work on behalf of the citizens of the North.  The outcome of the election is one we all respect.  The people have the final say.  It is they who decide who represents them, but it is a source of concern that there is no Nationalist MP sitting in Westminster when a minority Government is in place which may be kept in power by members of the Democratic Unionist Party.  At a time when we are dealing with Brexit and do not have a power-sharing Executive in the North, it is a concern that there is not that articulate Nationalist voice in Westminster.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile may shrug his shoulders at what I am saying, but I say it as a proud Republican and Nationalist.  Abstentionism from Westminster is one thing, but Senator Feighan is correct.  There is a wider forum where we must all be the voice of Irish Nationalism across the water in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

Craughwell referred to the men of Jadotville.  I join him in welcoming the announcement made by the outgoing Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, on the awarding of a medal.  I thank him and Senators P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Diarmuid Wilson and, most especially, Gabrielle McFadden for their role in ensuring this is a good day, one of celebration for the families of the men of Jadotville, the soldiers who fought in the battle.  The mission to Congo, the first on which the United Nations sent Irish troops, will always be remembered, but it is important that Ireland finally remove the little black mark and congratulate all those who took part in the campaign.  I again thank the outgoing Taoiseach and the Minister of State.</p><p>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell also referred to the Sale of Alcohol Bill.  As he knows, I am not yet a member of the Cabinet and do not expect to be tomorrow either.  I understand the amendment associated with the Good Friday Bill was passed by the Cabinet today and that it is a matter of timing.  I gave a commitment as Leader of the House to have it passed before the summer recess.  Whoever is Leader next week can certainly honour that commitment.  It is certainly my intention to do so, if I am still Leader.  If not, I hope the new Leader will do so.</p><p>Senator Paddy Burke referred to section 309 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which contains a loophole in dealing with poaching.  Committee Stage of the legislation was taken in March.  There are issues arising and the Department is considering them.  The Bill will be before the House next week.  I am not sure if it dovetails with the other Bill, but I am sure the Senator can raise the matters he wishes to raise when discussing it.</p><p>Senator Michael McDowell spoke with sadness about the demise of the outgoing Taoiseach and a lack of sadness, or perhaps gaiety, about impending Seanad reform.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that the issue of Seanad reform is still very much on the agenda.  I believe Senator Michael McDowell's name was mentioned in dispatches in different guises before the outgoing Taoiseach left and I am not sure whether it is in the ether now.  The other point is that the programme for Government is not put before the people, as the Senator knows quite well.  There are differing viewpoints on the issue, but I am sure the horse that is Seanad reform will be galloping along the track in the coming weeks.  Whatever jockey is on board and regardless of whether the Senator is weighed down or a lightweight, I am sure he will be able to make the case for Seanad reform.</p></speech>

We all accept, of course, that there is still a lot of work to be done.</p> <p>Senators Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Victor Boyhan and Gerry Horkan referred to Stepaside Garda station.  I am certainly not going to rain on their parade, but Senator Neale Richmond is the public representative closest to the station.  It is a matter for the Cabinet and I will be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss it.  Like the other recommendation made by the Cathaoirleach, perhaps it might be more appropriate to raise the issue as a Commencement matter.  We welcome the opening of any Garda station, but it is important that Garda stations not be seen as amounting to policing and that there be community policing, with garda&iacute; active on the ground as part of a people-centred model.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of tweets from Cabinet.

It is important that we congratulate all who stood for election but where Senator Norris is coming from concerns the importance of being able to campaign.  What Jeremy Corbyn did quite successfully was take his message to the people.  It proves that if someone shies away from debate or engagement, people look upon it as a sign of reluctance or of their being taken for granted.  The political campaign across the water is one we can all learn from again.  I am not quite sure whether we will have an early election but I can tell the House one thing.  The leader of Fine Gael and incoming Taoiseach is a far better candidate than Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May and I would be very happy to stand with him and run under his banner any time.</p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of immigration and the threat of terrorism in our country.  I do not want to become engaged in a disagreement with Members of the House but our language around immigration and those who come to our country is important.  It is important that if people are in breach of our immigration law, they should be deported.  We do not want any truck with terrorism or violence in our country but it is also important that we are seen as a harbour and place of welcome for people who need to come here for a place of refuge.  </p> <p>I fully agree with Senator Horkan regarding the very important issue he raised, namely, the sale of lands, particularly school playing fields, to pay debts owed to the State.  We need to be very vigilant about this issue and I commend the Senator for raising that matter today in the House because it is one that we must not allow to continue at one level because these lands can be used to help and benefit young people and communities.  To sell them off for whatever reason is understandable on one level but, equally, we need to keep an eye on the value to the community and the good they bring to people.  </p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of child seats.  The figure of 21,000 tests with the majority of seats being faulty is staggering in an era when more and more people are on the roads and where people are being penalised and receiving penalty points for a variety of reasons.  We all welcome that and have a very strict application of our drink driving rules, which we welcome.  It is important that people do not err and take chances regarding child seats.  We will get the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss this issue.</p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the very important issue of pyrite blocks and commended the former Minister of State, Senator Coffey, for his work in that regard.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will come to the House to discuss that issue.  </p> <p>I think I have covered the majority of contributions other than the congratulations to the former Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General.  I propose the adjournment of the House this evening at the conclusion of business until next Tuesday given that the new Taoiseach will be elected at noon tomorrow while there are issues regarding the availability of Ministers on Thursday and a question mark around junior Ministers.

Before we commence, I would like to remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to discussion on the amendment.  Also, on Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1, in the name of Senator Fintan Warfield and his party colleagues, is out of order.  It proposes to require Tusla to provide a written reason when "it does not consult with any of the relevant non guardians" in respect of a pre-placement consultation procedure.  The amendment is a resubmit of a Committee Stage amendment.  However, the amendment was not discussed in the course of the Committee Stage debate.  It must therefore be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 129, as it does not arise out of committee proceedings.</p> <p>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Lynn Ruane.  It arises out of committee proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, 13, 17, 18 and 24 are related, and may be discussed together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>I call Senator Ruane.  She will need someone to second her amendment.</p></speech>

These amendments all relate to the post-adoption supports available to both parents and adopted children.  Currently, informal arrangements are often in place between new adoptive parents and former birth parents, recognising that this is in the best interest of the child regarding contact.  These arrangements do not have any legal status or security.  The amendments provide an avenue for many adopted children to know more of their identity and origins and, if possible, to have information about their birth families.  Having an appropriate contact plan in place would also allow for changes in circumstances where a parent was previously not able to maintain appropriate contact, but whose circumstances have since changed.  The current system is that the security and rights of the adoptive parents trump the rights and responsibilities of the birth parents.  However, most importantly, it is in the best interests of the child to have rights to relationship.</p> <p>These amendments seek to allow some complexity in the types of positive relationships a child may have without compromising security.  We must move past a drive towards a very simple narrative of the family unit, which has led to some very poor practices in the past.  The central core of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 13, 14 and 24 requires the Adoption Authority of Ireland to publish best-practice guidelines around post-adoption voluntary contact plans.  This is in recognition by the Adoption Authority and the State that the practice of making contact plans exists, and an attempt should be made by the State to provide clear guidelines and direction to relevant supports.  It leaves it to the Adoption Authority, with its expertise, to draw up what it considers best practice.  The guidelines do not compel those involved in drawing up contact plans to adhere strictly to the guidelines.  Rather, it provides for efficiency for those involved in drawing up such contact plans.  Given the aims of these amendments, I think it is only necessary that the recognition of voluntary contact plans should be fed into decisions made by the Adoption Authority and the High Court with regard to orders for adoption.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 provide that the Adoption Authority and the courts will consider the existence of or potential for any contact plan.</p></speech>
