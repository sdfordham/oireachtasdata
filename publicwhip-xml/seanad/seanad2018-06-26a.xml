    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister and acknowledge his presence.  I ask that his Department develop a long-term strategy to ensure the sustainability and resilience of the agricultural sector during and after periods of extreme weather.  It has been both an unfortunate and amazing year if one takes into consideration what has occurred in the past eight or nine months.  We started off with Storm Ophelia.  We then had nearly 2 m of snow in my part of the world in March and April and it has now been four weeks since we had rain.  This is part of the pattern of climate we are seeing.</p> <p>Most Oireachtas committees have a major focus on climate change and the drastic changes it is bringing for all sectors of society.  It will continue to have a major effect on the agricultural sector, for obvious reasons.  We are dependent on what the weather will bring in many ways, whether it is the storms and snow that arrived in the early part of the year or the drought we have experienced for the past three and a half or four weeks.</p> <p>In many ways, we need to revisit our strategies.  I am calling for a long-term strategy to be put in place to ensure the agricultural sector will be more sustainable and robust when it comes to dealing with these dramatic weather changes.  For that to happen, a major body of work must be done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This will involve many stakeholders, including Teagasc, to ensure appropriate strategies are implemented.  We do not want a repeat of the two fodder crises we have experienced in the past five years when we had to purchase fodder abroad.  I have no problem securing fodder abroad but these crises have a major impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector.</p> <p>In many ways, we need to build a new ethos for how agriculture, the agricultural community and industry can deal with major environmental changes, which will continue in the years and decades to come.  The body of work I am asking for should include education for farmers to ensure they have more stocks and training for agricultural advisers to ensure they treat spring as an important time of year.  In the event of a drought, discussion groups should meet every 14 days to respond to the climate changes that are taking place.</p> <p>In making this suggestion, I do not claim to have all the answers.  I hope the Minister has some answers.  In many ways, this is about a changing ethos and ensuring the agricultural industry moves and changes with the changing environment to remain sustainable and robust in the face of dramatic weather events such as those of recent years.  I hope the Minister will start this process.  We are dealing with a very short-term issue at the moment and the issue of fodder will also need to be addressed because problems will arise again in the coming months and years.  In my part of the world, winter fodder is now being used as feed, which could unfortunately have consequences in the coming winter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#C00100"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the words of welcome and Senator Lombard also for raising this matter.</p> <p>As was the case for many other sectors, agriculture has been affected to varying degrees by a series of weather-related events in recent years.  Some of these were localised in extent such as the flash-flooding experience on the Inishowen Peninsula in August of last year.  Other events such at the severe flooding of the winter of 2015-16 was regionally focussed, in this case the west and midlands.  The winter and spring just past on the other hand were characterised by a prolonged and persistent period of poor weather, in the first instance affecting mainly the west and north west of the country.  Following the snow of Storm Emma in March, the situation, particularly as to the availability to fodder, spread to all parts of the country.  </p> <p>Extreme weather events can therefore be anticipated to occur at greater frequency and the agricultural sector is most vulnerable to the effects of these events, which are partially inspired by climate change.  My Department is now preparing sectoral climate change plans for the agricultural, forestry and seafood sectors, in line with the national adaptation framework, published earlier this year.  A key priority of these plans will be to provide guidance on adaptation planning at farm level to build resilience in the farm sector.  It is the building of this resilience that is at the core of my Department's focus in addressing the challenge of climate change.</p> <p>As occurrences of such events increased in recent years, the response of my Department to each severe weather challenge has been informed by the specific needs of the particular situation and delivered in a timely fashion within state-aid rules that specifically apply to the sector.  For example, in response to pressures on fodder supplies, felt initially in the west and north west, caused by a long wet winter and spring, I introduced the national fodder transport support measure in January 2018.  As a further support I introduced a fodder import support measure in the first week of April in response to the need for additional sources of fodder from abroad and also to complement the more locally-based fodder transport support measure.  These two interventions, working together effectively, addressed issues around fodder availability in the country due to the most recent weather event.</p> <p>I fully share the view that the agricultural sector must be enabled to sustain itself and build up resilience in the shorter term in the face of external weather challenges.  It was for this specific purpose that last May, last month, I requested Teagasc to convene a stakeholder group representative of industry, banks, agricultural media, farming bodies, etc., to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer concerning replenishing fodder stocks that have been used up.  The first meeting was held on 11 May with further regular meetings planned throughout the summer.  The message to farmers to harvest sufficient fodder, including a buffer amount, is continuously being amplified across the sector through Teagasc advisers, private advisers, FAS advisers, media, co-ops and banks.  I am very strongly committed to the work of this group and linked in by telephone with its most recent meeting which took place yesterday morning, to receive a first-hand update on progress so far and to urge no let up in activity until all issues around fodder security for next winter are fully addressed. </p> <p>A key information tool in this respect is a survey of the current level of fodder conservation on different farming systems in different regions.  This information will help shape the direction and content of the next stage of work by the group.  Today I am launching the first of two such Teagasc fodder surveys at Beef 2018, in the Grange research facility.  </p> <p>Sustainability and resilience are not only about fodder but encompass the entire farming activity.  In this respect the group is also focusing on best practices in matching livestock numbers with available fodder.  Financial budgeting is a key part of fodder budgeting and indeed overall sustainability of the farming system and must be a routine aspect of all farming enterprises. </p> <p>While outside agencies can provide some support to farming communities in exceptional circumstances, farmers themselves must take appropriate actions to ensure their own resilience and sustainability into the future.  Some actions are within the capacity of farmers themselves such as those being addressed by the Teagasc-led group, but others require the availability of specific tools to manage more complex threats, including risks posed by weather events.  I have asked my officials to examine options both under the CAP 2020 proposals, but also under existing programmes, that might provide an appropriate risk management option for farmers in light of these increasingly regular weather-related events.</p></speech>

I welcome that he is launching today in Grange the beef survey regarding fodder supplies, which is a very positive step.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously, the dairy industry would need something similar to be launched and I am sure the Minister will announce that in due course.  Those are the key issues.  We need to balance our increasing livestock numbers with an increased volume of fodder, and have a buffer in place.  These are very positive steps.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#D00200"><p>I again thank Senator Lombard for raising this issue.  As will be seen at events like that at Grange today, the farmers who are engaged in this process will obviously take the messages on board.  The problem is farmers who are more difficult to reach, who are perhaps age profile challenged or in enterprises where the returns may not be as good.  A key part of my message to this working group is to make sure that, through their networks, whether it is the farm organisations, the co-op structure, Teagasc or the private advisory service, we need to be specifically focused on those farmers who are harder to reach in order to make sure they are part of the message.  They can also be part of the solution.  There is a lower stocking density on some of these holdings so there may be capacity for better fodder conservation measures.</p> <p>We have all the stakeholders around the table and this is comprehensive.  Sustainability is critical to our international image; it is also a key part of Food Wise 2025 and is one of the five pillars within it.  We will be maintaining this initiative for as long as necessary so we can ensure that sustainability is an ingrained part of the operation of any individual farm, be it dairy, tillage, beef or otherwise, as that is very important.</p></speech>

I assume she is taking this on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I know she cannot comment on specific cases, which is a given.  However, I would like her to clarify, as best she can, what people should do when they find themselves in a situation such as the one I am about to outline.</p> <p>A constituent of mine had his application for naturalisation rejected in April of this year.  His application, which he made in October 2016, was refused as a result of a motoring offence conviction.  In the letter of rejection sent to him, it was stated, and this is the important part, "The onus is on each applicant to disclose in their application all appropriate information and evidence to help demonstrate that he or she satisfies the conditions for a certificate of naturalisation, including being of good character."  This individual applied for naturalisation on 27 October 2016.  His motoring conviction occurred on 23 March 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, he could not have notified the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, of his conviction at the time of application, as it did not exist.  How can the INIS expect a person to inform it of a conviction that has not yet happened?</p><p>This person, having lived in Cavan town for many years, was hoping to purchase a home and settle down with his family permanently.  Naturally, he was awaiting the outcome of his application prior to purchasing a home.  It has taken more than a year and a half for him to get this decision on his application.  As the Minister of State can imagine, he is most disappointed.</p><p>I do not want to make light of any conviction, no matter how minor it may be.  This individual is known to me personally.  He is a responsible and valued doctor in Cavan town, a man of integrity and, most certainly, good character.  I am only too happy to provide references in that respect if necessary.  I understand that he has submitted another application, in which he has outlined his motoring conviction and that he paid the &euro;300 fine that accompanied it without delay.  Will the Minister of State advise me and any person who finds himself or herself in this situation as to the next steps?  Currently, there is no appeal process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#E00200"><p>I have taken notes on the person's position.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.</p> <p>I cannot comment on individual cases.  However, I am happy to set out the position generally in respect of the processing of applications for citizenship.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, sets out the law governing Irish citizenship and distinguishes between the entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth and descent and the acquisition of Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process.  Should a non-national apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation, the applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements, for example, residency and good character.  The Minister has absolute discretion and may dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances.</p> <p>It should be noted that it is incumbent on any applicant to disclose the fact and circumstances of any ongoing matter that the Minister should be made aware of in the context of a naturalisation application.  Moreover, applicants are advised that reports are obtained from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies relating to applications for naturalisation, and that any failure to disclose any matter at any stage of the process will adversely affect the application.  The guidelines for the application form advise that, should adverse information come to light in the processing of that application, it will be taken into consideration.  In the particular section of the application dealing with background, this notification is repeated, stressing that applicants should disclose information even if they do not consider it material to the application.</p> <p>It is a matter reserved exclusively for the Minister to determine what factors are to be taken into account in assessing whether an applicant for naturalisation is of good character.  During the course of the processing of an application, information can come to attention from the various background checks that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen could be taken into consideration in the decision-making process.  The Minister is not obliged to give advance notice of this information of which the applicant was already aware.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Decisions on naturalisation are taken having considered all of the available information.  It is expected that applicants will comply fully with that process.  It would not be appropriate to discuss the details of an individual's applications on the floor of this House and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has asked me to inform Senator Wilson that his officials will speak with him on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1418" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the response.  However, it does not rectify the situation regarding the rejection of an application on the basis that the individual had not included in the application information regarding convictions.  The offence had not been committed at the time the application was submitted.  It did not occur until some months after and the court case did not take place for some time after the event.  To reject an application on the basis that a person did not provide information at the time of application is unjust, in my opinion.</p> <p>I welcome that the Minister's officials are willing to speak with me on the matter because I have been in communication with the Department and the Minister on this matter for a number of months and, to date, I had not received any response.  That said, there should be an opportunity within the application process to allow individuals to notify the Department of issues arising, minor or major, subsequent to the submission of an application.  I look forward to meeting the Minister's officials and to hopefully progressing the naturalisation application of this respected doctor and member of the community in Cavan.</p></speech>

The Minister is under no obligation to grant a certificate of naturalisation.  As already stated, the onus is on the applicant to disclose in his or her application all appropriate information and evidence to demonstrate that he or she satisfies the conditions for a certificate of naturalisation, including character.  It is incumbent on all applicants to reveal any information pertinent to the application, particularly where a case of dangerous driving is pending and a conviction for careless driving arises subsequently, prior to a decision on the application being made by the Minister.  There is no appeals process under the legislation.  However, applicants should be aware that they may reapply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time.  When considering making such reapplication, the applicant should have due regard to the reasons for refusal given in the first instance and ensure that all relevant information is provided to the Minister for his consideration.   All applications are examined individually and assessed on their own merits.  The decision was arrived at following an individualised assessment of the application, having taken into consideration all relevant matters and information.  This is particularly the case in this instance, where the adverse consideration is one of which the applicant was already aware.</p> <p>As I said, the Minister's officials are willing to meet the Senator on this issue.</p></speech>

They will be looking for accommodation for the end of August and the beginning of September once they get their results.  The problem is that there is an increasing number of students and a decreasing amount of accommodation.  In addition, the cost of the accommodation available is increasing far above the rate allowed within pressure zones.  I will give a specific example of that shortly.</p><p>The Government's national student accommodation strategy of July 2017 showed there was excess demand for purpose built student accommodation of over 23,000.  That will increase to over 25,000 by July 2019.  The figures in that report outline what the problem is and how it is increasing.  I met some student leaders in Galway last week.  They said that in the middle of their examinations in May the cost of official student accommodation in the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, was increased by 18%.  That confused me because Galway city is a rent pressure zone, which does not allow rent increases of more than 4% for accommodation.  However, I was told that this does not apply to student accommodation.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.  Am I wrong in the assumption that it should apply everywhere?  This will lead to students commuting long distances to get over this problem, sleeping on the couches of friends and mental health issues.</p><p>I am seeking information on the developments at all universities and third level institutions.  Is much extra student accommodation planned?  Is much being built at present?  If more student accommodation became available it would alleviate pressure on private rented accommodation for the general public.  Would the solution be to give some incentives or grants to provide student accommodation on the campuses of our universities or colleges?  That would in turn provide an income stream, help the overall development of those third level institutions and, perhaps, take some pressure off the Government to provide extra funding.  I am merely passing on the concerns that were raised with me and I hope the Minister can reply to some of the questions I raised.</p></speech>

To answer the Senator's question, student accommodation is being built.  At the end of May last, 2,990 student bed spaces had been completed since the launch of the Rebuilding Ireland report.  Nationally, there are 7,070 student bed spaces actively being built, and 2,354 will be available in the coming academic year and over 2,800 will be available in the following year.  The potential pipeline of accommodation is also encouraging.  Some 7,017 bed spaces have been granted planning permission.  Therefore, we should meet, if not exceed, the Rebuilding Ireland target of 7,000 purpose built bed spaces by the end of 2019 and 21,000 bed spaces by the end of 2024.</p> <p>By increasing the available supply of student accommodation we can alleviate some of the pressure on the private rental market, which will in turn help to decrease price.  In tandem with the Housing Finance Agency work has been carried out to assist in the provision of finance for higher education institutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Work has been carried out to assist in the provision of finance for higher education institutions.  The Housing Finance Agency has implemented a streamlined application process to assist such institutions to access finance for the construction of purpose-built student accommodation.  Provisions have also been made which allow applications for new, purpose-built student accommodation developments to move through the planning process at a faster pace.  </p><p>Alongside these initiatives, the Union of Students of Ireland and the Departments are working through the interdepartmental working group on student accommodation to promote and facilitate the provision of digs accommodation as an alternative to both purpose-built student accommodation and the general rental market for students.  The 2018 campaign was launched on 25 June and will seek to increase the number of homeowners offering accommodation to students during academic term time. </p><p>The recent rent increases in privately run, purpose-built student accommodation are a significant cause for concern.  I have met my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, to discuss this issue and we continue to work together to ensure that students are accommodated in the current housing market.  Officials from the Departments of Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government are working in close co-operation to identify a solution that will provide the longevity sought from any intervention.  This is a complex issue which may well necessitate legislation that is robust and does not give rise to unintended consequences.  As such, it is necessary to ensure that any potential solution is robust enough to withstand scrutiny from many different perspectives.</p></speech>

They experience more stress when trying to find accommodation so anything that lightens their load is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister comes to the Seanad on an ongoing basis and that is very much appreciated.</p> <p>I commend and thank the teaching profession for their hard work and dedication on behalf of our children.  We are very fortunate to have so many hard working and dedicated teachers.  Today I am raising the current role of the school principal.  In primary schools, the school principal is the manager or the captain of the ship.  He or she is the leader of the school.  Currently primary school principals are reaching out to the Department in respect of their ongoing workload and are seeking to have the allocation of release time increased in order to lessen the crippling workload they are undertaking and give them time to concentrate on their teaching responsibilities.</p> <p>As the Minister knows, 56% of school principals teach a class of children full time.  In addition to their responsibility to teach in the classroom, they have the responsibility of running the school, which includes administration, staff, curriculum, pupils, pupils with special needs, the board of management, the parents and building and maintenance of the school.  The teaching principal really is a multi-tasker.</p> <p>The situation has got to a point where it is no longer sustainable.  Teaching principals are at crisis point.  They are requesting the Minister to address this issue.  A few miles over the Border from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan teaching principals enjoy time out from the classroom one to two days a week to do administration work.  They can plan to have a regular substitute teacher in place to allow for continuity for the benefit of the children in the classroom.  That facility has been in operation north of the Border for the past ten years.  Clearly I am here to plead with the Minister to look at the plight of school principals and the workload they currently have to undertake.  It is unsustainable and in many cases it is affecting their mental well-being.  It is at crisis point.  Something needs to be done.  I ask the Minister to review the current situation so that the role of school principals and their workload can be looked at with a view to finding workable solutions.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with him that one of the most important things we can invest in is the quality of leadership in our schools.  If one looks at what influences a child's success in school, one is the teacher he or she experiences and second is the quality of the leadership of the school.  I am very keen to invest in upskilling and upgrading leadership.  I have done a number of things already.  In the past two budgets, I made provision for 3,000 additional posts of responsibility in our schools, both at primary and post-primary.  At post-primary, 475 deputy principal positions were created.  At primary and post-primary, 1,300 assistant principal posts were sanctioned.  The other very significant improvement is the new circular on management that has been negotiated with the trade unions and now circulated.  It provides for a much more flexible distributed system of management in our schools and allows for more flexible allocating of responsibilities and a more open system for identifying and reporting on what is done under that and the possibility for changing those responsibilities.  That is a real breakthrough in the way we allocate posts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the Senator's particular concern relates to small schools that have teaching principals.  As my reply outlines, I made an arrangement this year to increase the number of days off that such principals have.  The number of days off in each of the three size categories was increased by two days, three days and four days, respectively.  As the reply sets out, I have added extra days so those who used to get 15, 20 or 25 days off now get 17, 23 or 29 days off, respectively.  This reflects the need to provide more leadership resources and capacity.</p><p>I am very keen to see more initiative devolved down to local level.  The new model of resource teaching allocation, which we discussed in this House last week, puts much more trust in the local school to allocate how teaching resources are deployed across the range of children with special needs.  It represents a move away from the very inflexible system that has been in place up to now.</p><p>I have agreed to the creation of 50 cluster posts, which will be of benefit to small schools.  This will allow groups of principals to combine their release days as a permanent position.  The holder of that position will be able to fill in across the various schools.  This will ensure principals do not have to contend with the hassle of trying to get substitute teachers on days which they have chosen to take as release days and allow them to plan the allocation of time in a much better way.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that we are making a significant and specifically designed investment in the Centre for School Leadership.  This year, 1,000 of the country's 4,000 principals will have opportunities to avail of coaching or mentoring or to pursue postgraduate study.  We are putting money into enhancing the quantity and quality of leadership time.</p><p>I gather from the text that has been provided that the specific request made by the Senator would cost &euro;12 million if we were to accede to it.  When these things are being put together as part of October's budget, we will have to look at the competing requests that are being made.  As the Senator is probably aware, there are many other requests.  We have debated them in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  We will have to make decisions on where priorities lie.  As we have seen, it will be a fairly tight year for additional resources.</p><p>We will not relent in our interest in investing in the quantity and quality of leadership.  We are investing in the Centre for School Leadership and building clusters to enable schools to come together for substitution and to do things together, for example, in the digital and DEIS spheres.  I know there are many DEIS schools in the Border counties, perhaps not in Monaghan but certainly in Donegal.  We are trying to encourage individual school leaders to show more leadership by working with others to achieve new things.</p><p>We are moving away from the much more rigid input-output way of allocating resources across our school budgeting.  In my view, the conversation focuses far too much on pupil-teacher ratios, capitation grants and appointment rates.  We need to look at what pushes on the experience of children.  I think that is where the kind of good and well thought-out investment in leadership that we are trying to sponsor can make a big difference.</p><p>I thank the Senator for his interest.  I cannot accede to his specific request today, but I will examine it in the context of other things we might be able to do in this whole area.</p></speech>

Some of its content was not to my liking.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that there is an issue.  As he knows, school principals are engaged in an ongoing campaign.  I am aware from my own experience that school principals are leaving their posts to return to mainstream teaching because, as I said in my initial contribution, the workload is affecting their well-being.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that as well.  This issue deserves attention.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that he is not closing the door to consultation with the stakeholders involved.  I hope he will make a genuine attempt to find a resolution or a path forward to address this issue.</p></speech>

I am totally focussed on outcomes.  I wish to pursue measures which lead to children doing better.  The Senator's request is quite substantial.  As I stated, I granted two to four extra days this year.  Senator Gallagher requests an additional seven to 19 days, which would be a significant step up from what we have been able to do.  In considering such provision, we must assess the impact of &euro;12 million being spent in this way compared to the impact it would have on the many other areas for which we receive similarly passionate demands for investment.  The ultimate arbiter must be whether children will do better as a result.  I acknowledge that it is an inexact science and one must make choices but I will consider each proposal with that objective in mind.</p></speech>

In 2017, the HSE recorded a net operating deficit of &euro;140 million, yet last week, which was the anniversary of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadker's, first year in office he made a significant virtue of the fact that he is a master of balancing budgets.  This does not seem to be the case.</p> <p>This matter has a very serious consequences, especially for ordinary people who rely on home help and those in need of mental health services.  There has been a reduction in home help hours and a serious crisis in mental health services, especially in the CAMHS sector.  These services have been left to languish with little or no support.  It is also shocking that the former secretary general, Tony O'Brien, warned the Minister privately that the deficit could reach &euro;800 million for the year, something which was not acted on.  This is horrendous.  The budget deficit increases have been attributed to older people presenting to hospitals.  In a general election manifesto in 2011, the Government ran on a platform of building primary care centres across the country.  In Drimnagh in my constituency, we were promised a primary care centre yet to date no sod has been turned and planning is about to run out.  What is the Minister's plan in regard to this matter?  I call on him to come to the House so that we can ask him how he intends to reverse the deficit and what he intends to do about the roll-out of primary care centres nationally and, more specifically, in Drimnagh.</p></speech>

There was much discussion in the media over the weekend about the Council of Europe and the anti-corruption body known as GRECO, the Group of States against Corruption.  I do not want to pre-empt what I hope will be a lively and engaging debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill next week, but suffice to say it is reported in the press that the Chief Justice, Frank Clarke, and other judges have taken the unusual step of writing to GRECO.  They raised a number of particularly serious issues in respect of the perceived appointment of judges to upper and higher courts.  Could the Leader ascertain from the Minister whether he is committed to publishing the current GRECO report?  If he is, can he make it available in advance of the debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill next week?</p> <p>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new Garda Commissioner designate, the PSNI deputy chief constable, Drew Harris, on his appointment.  It is a very imaginative appointment.  I wish him well.  I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in on what has been a steady hand in terms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The need for an inquiry was agreed at Weston Park in 2001, but the need for truth and disclosure is widely accepted and needs all sides to be supportive of these efforts.  Some of the documentation from the British Government has been quoted.  Its exhaustive previous examinations have laid bare some very uncomfortable truths.  Paid state agents were directly involved in the killing, including the only man ever convicted of involvement in it.  Lord Stevens's conclusions paint a picture of a system of agent running by the RUC special branch and the army.  I want to wish the Finucane family well.  Families should not have to spend decades in courtrooms in order to access the truth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Where is the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017?  When will it come back before us?  While it is not a panacea for the issues surrounding autism and the supports and services that are needed, at least it will go some way to addressing some of the issues through amendments.  It is a matter of deep concern that this Government chooses to propose a rainy day fund when I hear from parents all over my county who cannot get respite, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and all the services that children and adults with autism should be entitled to as of right.  It is disgraceful.  There was a meeting last night and I commend those in Belcarra in Castlebar who organised it.  We cannot think of rainy day funds until the most vulnerable people and families in our State are looked after.  </p><p>People should imagine, while they will leave here in a few weeks' time, and may work in their areas or whatever, what it is like for a carer looking after up to three children with autism to be told he or she cannot have one, two or three days off in the year.  It is not right and it must be fixed.  Carers need respite as well.  They cannot do their job.  They cannot function properly.  They are working 24-7, 365 days a year and they need a break.  They must be prioritised before any rainy day fund.  We saw what was done with the last rainy day fund, the pension reserve fund, that was hived off to the bankers.  It is wrong and it must be re-examined.</p></speech>

I very much welcome anything that will bring that forward.  However, it is a pity, and I said this to the Minister for Justice and Equality, that the Government did not see fit to use the existing legislation, the Private Members' Bill, that we introduced in this House, which received cross-party support and has passed Second and Committee Stages.  The Government could have implemented gender pay gap disclosure measures more speedily through proposing amendments to the Labour Party Bill, which we would have been quite happy to accept and debate in the normal way.</p> <p>My concern is that introducing a new Government Bill will inevitably delay the introduction of these important measures which we so badly need to ensure that we can address the existing gender pay gaps.  Would the Leader please pass the message to the Minister that we are concerned that the proposed Bill will bypass legislative provisions that have already been debated in the Seanad?  If the Government is going to introduce its Bill it should at the very least be started in the Seanad, given that we have already had a good deal of considered debate on this issue.</p> <p>I echo Senator Boyhan's concerns about the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017, which was to go to Committee Stage this week.  I have tabled over 20 amendments for the Labour Party to make to that Bill but I understand it is not going ahead.  Could the Leader let us know whether Committee Stage can proceed at this point, given that we have received reports that the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, has such significant concerns about some key measures proposed in the Bill, in particular that the provisions around the new judicial appointments commission are not in line with European standards and that a more substantial participation is required.  GRECO has urged the Government to reconsider the provisions in order to limit the potential risks of improper influence from the Executive and to ensure that any measures introduced are taken in co-operation with judicial authorities.</p> <p>Given these concerns the Minister should publish the GRECO report and, furthermore, we should be given some indication of how the Government proposes to address these concerns in its amendments which we have not yet seen.  We did debate the Bill on Second Stage last week without knowing its proposed final shape.  It is most unsatisfactory and many of us expressed concerns about that last week.  While we are mindful of the need for reform of judicial appointment measures, this Bill has been, in the words of the Attorney General, a "dog's dinner" to date and the reports about the GRECO report raise serious additional concerns about the new measures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Finally, I join with others in wishing the new Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, well.

It is a difficult task to fulfil.  I know he has come from a difficult area.  I welcome the decision to take someone from outside this jurisdiction to head up An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>I wish to raise an issue relating to the sports capital programme.  I am delighted that &euro;40 million will be allocated but I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House for a discussion on it.  There are many clubs that want to find out when this process will start.  They have also had difficulties with applications in the past.  Why have some clubs and organisations failed when it comes to getting the funding for which they have applied?  I would welcome it if the Minister could come in here and give us a briefing so that all clubs can hear about it so that when they apply for funding, they will have all their ducks in a row.  </p> <p>I wish to comment on a disgraceful decision by the central competitions control committee, CCCC, of the GAA yesterday regarding the Kildare-Mayo football match.  Having watched the draw earlier that morning, the Kildare players were expecting to play the match in Newbridge.  What took place showed a total disregard for both players, management and supporters of Kildare GAA and Mayo GAA, which would have expected the game to take place in Newbridge.  The CCCC has gone against its own rules.  If one sets down rules and regulations, one should at least follow them but this is typical of the GAA hierarchy.  It does not have any regard for the people at grassroots level.  As far as I am concerned, it is Newbridge or nowhere.</p></speech>

It was a lovely ceremony in Dublin Castle.  Indeed, there were two very nice ceremonies in Dublin Castle on Sunday.  The other ceremony related to the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  There were lots of references to JFK and our current Taoiseach but a Fianna F&aacute;il Government was in power between 1957 and 1959 when it all started in 1958 and I think it would be nice if when referring to it, the Government did acknowledge that a Fianna F&aacute;il Government was in power at the time.</p> <p>I want to raise another point relating to policing and justice generally.  I wish the new Garda Commissioner well.  I also acknowledge that 22 years ago today, Veronica Guerin lost her life in the fight against crime and reporting crime.  If she was here today, she would say that there is a lot more work to be done.  I wish the new Garda Commissioner well but I do want to acknowledge that time.  I remember the day very well.  It happened on Booth Road in Clondalkin.  I would like to remember that.  </p> <p>I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality for the comments he made at the weekend about cycling.  He responded to a tweet.  I cycled in here today.  I regularly cycle in here.  I am lucky enough to live close enough that I can do so but it is not all that safe sometimes.  I do support the Minister and others who are saying that it is important that the cycle lanes that are there are available for cyclists and that they are not full of cars parked, lorries delivering or buses pulling in and so on.  The Minister has said he will meet with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is far more interested in judges than he is in transport, to deal with this matter.  The Minister for Justice and Equality seems to be the one who is most interested in cycling infrastructure, far more than the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Perhaps he is the one we should bring in to talk about cycling, road infrastructure and the enforcement of road policing.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could organise that debate.</p></speech>

It concerns the lack of guidelines relating to solar farms.  At a time when we are facing such huge fines from Europe for our carbon emissions, clearly solar farms would be a huge addition to reducing that bill yet we do not have any national guidelines and local authorities are refusing planning permission for these farms on that basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People are having to go to extra expense to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Naughten, with whom this lies more so than the Minister, Deputy Murphy, to come to the House and tell us where he is with his plans.  The other interest I have in this regard is in all those hay sheds around the country that could be covered in photovoltaic units.  An initiative could be put in place for that.</p><p>Another national issue is childhood obesity and the fact that almost one third of our children are either overweight or obese.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promoted an initiative in his own area, Wicklow, of a no-fry zone near schools, something which I fully support.  Local authorities need guidelines on this from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, through the Department of Health but it will be a local authority issue.  The local authorities and developers need guidance.  We currently have a situation where there is a brand new primary school in Skerries with 365 children and there are proposals to build a huge fast food outlet beside it.  The initial proposal was for an all-night drive-through with all sorts of traffic issues but, more recently, that has been dropped.  It is a disproportionate development in a small local shopping centre.  Our children need to be protected from this.  We are possibly going to be the first generation that buries the generation behind us as they develop diabetes and all the complications that go with it.</p><p>I echo what other Senators said about the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill.  I would also like to know where it is.  I have been seeking a meeting about this issue with the Minister for the last three weeks.  I hope to meet with him soon.  This House passed that Bill in its entirety, unopposed, unanimously and there are children and parents with autism who are struggling on a day-to-day basis.  The Bill is by no means a panacea or the end of the beginning.  It is the beginning of the beginning for them, in having a process to put in place a national strategy which will give them the help that they need to reach the potential that they have to make their contribution to our society.  Over the centuries, people with autism have made major breakthroughs and discoveries.</p><p>I wish the new Garda Commissioner well.  He has, as others have put it euphemistically, a serious challenge ahead.</p></speech>

If he cannot come in himself, he can send in the report about community banking which involved, whether it argued for or against it, an argument for the Sparkassen German bank and Kiwibank.  I am a great believer in community banking and not capitulating to the pillar banks.  The latter have people earning &euro;30,000 to &euro;70,000 unable to save &euro;50,000 to get a room to live in, let alone a house.  They are on every campus in Ireland, costing postgraduates fortunes to study, and putting up their interest rates when they qualify.  I could start on the banks and would probably have to have medication because of their behaviour.  There is capitulation to the pillar banks.  I am not afraid of them and do not think we should be afraid of them.  We saw it rejuvenating itself with Mr. Drumm, who was not part of a high street bank but who was certainly part of the actions of the bank that led to many people looking at the USC on top of everything they earn.  I would like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business which I think will be seconded by Senator Wilson.</p> <p>With regard to Committee Stage of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, Senator Bacik is correct and I would like to know what has happened to it.  We were all speaking in generalities last week because we did not know what the Government's amendments were or what our own would be, although I know Senator Bacik had loads and I had plenty myself.  I would like to find out about that.</p> <p>With regard to cycling and cars on footpaths, the Minister needs to look at the fact that we cannot walk on our footpaths because cars are now taking precedence over pedestrians.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are not only half parked, they are entirely parked up on paths.  I would start with the walkers, people who may be disabled or in wheelchairs or the blind, who cannot walk in their own city because of the abuse of cars.  That is my amendment to the Order of Business.  Members should not think I will take "No" for an answer.  I would like the Senators to stay with me on this.  Where is this report?  Why can I not see it?  It was presented at Cabinet and I would like to have a look at it.  If the Minister cannot come in and organise it, I will take a copy of it, read it and make up my mind, but it has to be done.</p></speech>

Last year almost &euro;1 million per day was spent on agency workers such as locum doctors, consultants and, in particular, nurses.  Of the &euro;15 million that was put in to boost the mental health budget, from January to March of this year, &euro;13 million of it was spent on agency staff.  This means there is &euro;2 million left and the first three months of the year are gone, and there is a projection for something like &euro;80 million more for agency staff for the remainder of the year.</p> <p>On top of that, the nursing unions have just put out a report on assaults on HSE staff.  We know fewer staff, chaotic working conditions and the use of agency staff, with the resultant lack of continuity of care, give rise to increasing assaults.  Between 2008 and 2018 there were more than 10,000 serious assaults on staff, 70% of them on nursing staff.  I know these nursing staff.  They have had their eyes gouged out, they have lost testicles and they have lost their own physical, never mind emotional, well-being.  They are languishing at home often in difficult circumstances, including marriage breakdowns, because of the impact chaotic working conditions have on them.</p> <p>I do not know who would want to sign up to working like this.  Recruitment and retention is abysmal.  We need to address the staggering sums of money going to private agencies that are putting in locum staff who have less responsibility than permanent staff.</p></speech>

It was a wonderful gesture to attend the Ulster final and it sets out an agenda that, hopefully, things are changing in Northern Ireland.  That should not go unnoticed, especially given the Taoiseach's visit to east Belfast and the reception he got from the Orange Order and its supporters in east Belfast, and also the reception he got in west Belfast at the opening of F&eacute;ile.  In addition, in recent weeks Prince Charles and Camilla were in Cork, the so-called rebel county.  This island is changing and that is very much to be welcomed.  If somebody makes a gesture, I believe we should be strong enough and brave enough to stand up in this Seanad and welcome it.  That is very important.</p> <p>I would also like to welcome the appointment of PSNI deputy chief constable, Drew Harris, as the new Garda Commissioner.  Again, this is setting a different tone for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My grandfather was among the first members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this House and in politics, we should challenge the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but we are not here to undermine its good name.  I hope that, as politicians, we are balanced in how we talk about members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are the people who have held the line in very difficult times since the foundation of the State.  I wish Drew Harris every success in the future.</p> <p>One aspect I have raised in the House is the Commonwealth Games, which is due to be held in Northern Ireland in 2021, and which could be another achievement of cross-Border co-operation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For example, there could have been cross-Border rowing on Lough Rynn in Leitrim.  Given that the Northern Ireland Assembly has not sat since January 2017  and no financial package has been agreed, Northern Ireland has lost the Commonwealth Games.  That is a major loss.  I hope that all parties can work together to get Stormont up and running.  The sooner that happens, the better it will be, not just for Northern Ireland, but the island of Ireland.</p><p>To reiterate, Ms Arlene Foster turning up at the Ulster final was a major change in mindset in our country.</p></speech>

Brexit is coming down the tunnel like an express train.  Politicians want to be taken seriously, but politics is about compromise, so we need the assembly to be up and running and people to take their seats in the House of Commons to ensure that there is a good deal for the island of Ireland.  Not taking a seat is unacceptable.  We are past the day of denying that mandate.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the issue of a dedicated transport police force and the effects of assaults on public sector workers and public transport.  We are past the day of using private security firms, which have no right to detain people at stations or make arrests.  Train drivers, DART workers and other public sector workers are being assaulted week in, week out.  If we want the general public to feel safe and secure on public transport, there needs to be a dedicated police force on that transport, be it a train going from Cork to Dublin or a DART going from Howth to the city centre.  Many other areas have such forces, for example, London.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House to debate this issue at some stage?  It would be useful.</p></speech>

Her attendance at the Ulster final between her native Fermanagh and Donegal in Clones last Sunday was a significant gesture.  We look forward to seeing her attending future GAA events.</p> <p>I welcome today's announcement by the Government of the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner, a fellow Ulsterman, Mr. Drew Harris.  He is a professional policeman.  His father served as a member of the RUC until his tragic death.  He came up through the Troubles and the RUC as it existed at the time and was there when it was reformed into the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  He will do an excellent job during his five-year term as Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Beginning with Senator Ardagh's points, the Government has significantly increased the health budget by &euro;1.7 billion since 2013.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I find the Senator's remarks amusing given the record of her beloved party leader and Mary Harney in the Department of Health.  They rarely, if ever, balanced the books in that Department.  I recall we had supplementary budgets year-on-year at a time when the country had plenty of money.  I agree with the Senator that it is important that we invest and that we maintain a service that will deliver outcomes for patients.  This is about improving access, building capacity, investing in physical infrastructure and also recruitment, a new general practitioner contract and the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, which will be transformational in reforming our health system.  </p><p>I remind Senator Ardagh that since the Fine Gael Party came into government, in the first instance with the Labour Party and now as a minority Government, 120 primary care centres have been opened, 12 of them this year, with seven more to come.  The Government is investing and reinvesting in our health service, be that in terms of recruitment, physical infrastructure or otherwise, and it will continue its record of investing in our health care system.</p><p>Senators Boyhan, Bacik, Lawlor, Horkan, O'Reilly and Feighan welcomed the appointment today of the new Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris.  I join Members of the House in wishing him well in his appointment.  He comes with a 35-year record of policing service in the North as Deputy Chief Constable of the PSNI.  This is an external appointment from an international selection process at a time when we need to see major reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the culture therein changed.  In tandem with this appointment the Government has committed to investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of recruitment and the provision of new equipment.  I thank the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, for his steady hand in the interim.  This is the third Garda Commissioner since 2004.  I hope Mr. Harris's five-year appointment will be productive.  As Leader of the House, I wish him every success.  </p><p>Senators Boyhan, Bacik and Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the issue of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill in the context of the GRECO report.  The Bill will be returned to the schedule next week.  It was withdrawn this week to allow members to submit amendments.  I will engage further with Senator Bacik on the matter.  I hope the Minister can engage on the Bill with Members on all sides of the House.  </p></speech>

I will communicate the desire of Senators to have sight of the Government amendments.</p> <p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the Pat Finucane case, which is before the UK Supreme Court today.  I wish the Finucane family well in terms of the public inquiry.  They need justice and I hope they will get it.</p> <p>I join Senators Reilly and Conway-Walsh in hoping the Bill sponsored by Senator Reilly, the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017, which is currently with the Department, will come before the House soon.   I share the view of Senator Conway-Walsh that we need continued investment in primary care in tandem with investment in respite care.  Respite care is an important piece of the health budget.  I concur that funding should be made available to families who are carers.  There is a significant deficit in funding for respite care that needs to be filled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Senator Conway-Walsh said, members of families are 24-7 carers for loved ones for 365 days of the year, in many cases in very difficult and trying conditions.  There must be continuing investment in respite care.  However, I disagree with Senator Conway-Walsh on the rainy day fund.  We need such a fund.  Otherwise the high tax Sinn F&eacute;in model of economics will again bankrupt the country.  We saw what happened in the past when there was recklessness in our economy and we cannot return to that.  It is important, however, that as the economy grows stronger we reinvest in people and in the delivery of services and infrastructure for people.</p><p>Senator Bacik also raised the issue of the gender pay gap.  Today the Cabinet approved the legislation compelling companies to deal with the gender pay gap.  I hope to work with the Senator in passing a Bill that will eliminate that deficit and repeal that unacceptable gap.  I am not sure where that Bill will be introduced but I hope it will be in this House because, as the Senator said, we have done a great deal of work on the matter.  The Government is committed to tackling the gender pay gap and we all welcome that Bill and hope it will not be delayed.</p><p>Senator Lawlor raised the sports capital fund and the &euro;40 million that will be announced soon by the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin.  It was a Fine Gael-led Government that reopened the sports capital grant programme.</p></speech>

He is right to recognise those who lost their lives in the service of the State.  We remember the service men and women who died in honour with our Defence Forces when protecting people in many different parts of the world.  I also join him in calling on those who use our cycle lanes to remember that they are for cyclists and should only be for them.  I agree that the comments of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, are positive.</p> <p>Equally, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to the number of people who are parking on footpaths and impeding not just pedestrians but also wheelchair users and elderly people, who experience difficulty.  It is illegal to park on the footpath and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to use its powers.</p></speech>

Senator Reilly raised the lack of guidelines for solar farms.  I will be happy to arrange a debate on that with the Minister.  He rightly spoke about the growing issue we face with obesity given that almost one third of our young people are obese.  It is a startling statistic.  As he said, the knock-on diseases are beginning to come to the fore.  I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell will appreciate that I do not have a magic wand.  I have not been able to get an answer from the Minister's office as to whether he is available this evening but if the Senator will indulge me, I will endeavour to have him come to the House tomorrow or on Thursday.  I have been in communication with the Senator since she first raised the matter in the House last week.  I certainly want to see the report on community banking debated in this House and I gave the Senator a commitment to that effect.  I cannot give a definitive answer with regard to the Minister's availability but if Senator O'Donnell indulges and trusts me, I will endeavour to secure the Minister's presence in the House later this week.  Otherwise, I will have to oppose her proposed amendment to the Order of Business which I do not want to do because the request being made is reasonable.  </p><p>I agree with Senator Devine that the number of assaults on staff working in hospitals is unacceptable.  I worked in a hospital previously and have family members who are nurses and I agree that any attack is one too many.  Senator Devine rightly drew attention to some of the dreadful injuries inflicted on nurses, care assistants and other members of hospital staff.  The safety of all of those who work in our health system is of paramount importance.  The Government is committed to recruiting additional nurses, care assistants and other front-line health service staff.  Staff numbers are growing every year but the important point made by the Senator is that we must ensure that the physical safety of all staff is assured.  The HSE has a duty of care to its staff and a responsibility to guarantee their safety in the workplace.  A national health and safety strategy has been put in place by the HSE but we must continue to highlight this issue.  </p><p>The issue of agency staff in our health system arises regularly in these Houses.  It was raised at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, of which I was once Chairman, and it has been raised by Senator Colm Burke in this House.  The amount of money being spent on agency staff is frightening, especially in the context of the value for money that could be obtained if we invested that money in the retention and recruitment of permanent staff, which would be much better.  We must accept that we will always have some agency staff in our health system but the growth in the numbers of such staff is not acceptable.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to the House to discuss that matter.  </p><p>I join Senators Feighan and Wilson in congratulating Ms Arlene Foster for travelling to the Ulster football final at the weekend, which was a positive gesture.  I heard what Senator Humphreys said but would argue that gestures are important.  It would have been unthinkable 25 years ago for the leader of the DUP to travel to an Ulster football final and to sit with a Cabinet Minister and a Chief Whip to watch the game, so Ms Foster's gesture is positive in that regard.  As Senators Humphreys and Feighan pointed out, it is absolutely imperative that the institutions in Stormont are back up and running as soon as possible.  It is unacceptable that no responsibility is being taken by politicians in the North and that there is no direct rule at Stormont.  It is incumbent upon Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP in particular to re-engage in talks and to re-establish a power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland.  I agree with the point made by Senator Feighan about the Commonwealth Games representing a missed opportunity.  </p><p>Senator Humphreys also argued for a dedicated transport police and the point he made in that regard certainly has merit in the context of last week's report of increases in attacks on both commuters and public transport staff.  The Senator called for a debate on the matter and I am happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House for that.  Senator Wilson seconded the proposed amendment by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  As I have said, I will try to arrange for the Minister to come to the House tomorrow or on Thursday and ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  If not, I will have to oppose it, which I am loath to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-06-26a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018062600002#CC00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the report into Tusla which was carried out at my direction by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  At the outset I wish to thank HIQA for its report, which is frank, clear and helpful.  Through this report it has identified how we can provide better services for our children.  Children are, of course, at the centre of what we do and they will be at the centre of our response.</p> <p>Although HIQA has identified deficits in the child protection services provided by Tusla, it is important to say that the report found children at immediate risk received an appropriate and timely service.  Following the revelation last year that Tusla had sent a notification containing a false allegation of child sexual abuse against Sergeant Maurice McCabe to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I became concerned that there may be more systemic issues which needed to be addressed by the Child and Family Agency.  </p> <p>In regard to Sergeant McCabe, I would like to say that I welcome the restating of Tusla&rsquo;s apology to him.  I know that the events which triggered this statutory investigation were devastating for him and his family.  This investigation did not examine issues pertaining to his case as it is included in the work of the disclosures tribunal.  Not for the first time, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, at a personal cost to himself, has done a service to the State.  </p> <p>I am committed to implementing all the recommendations from this report in full.  Intensive work is already under way in Tusla and in my Department to ensure this happens.  This commitment is shared by the chair, board and CEO of Tusla.  When this is done, I believe Tusla will be better equipped to carry out the child protection functions which are so necessary in our country today.</p> <p>We knew from previous work done by HIQA that issues were identified in inspection reports on foster care and the child welfare and protection services.  I am conscious that considerable public funding has been made available to enable the modernisation and transformation strategy that is under way in Tusla.  I need to ensure that these public funds are having the impact they are intended to have.</p> <p>In response to my direction in March last year to HIQA to carry out a statutory investigation into Tusla&rsquo;s national practices in the handling of referrals of allegations of sexual abuse which involve adults of concern, HIQA has produced a report which clearly captures the progress and problems that were evident at the time the investigation took place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In particular HIQA finds that child sexual abuse referrals, including retrospective allegations, were not always managed in a timely or effective way from the point of referral to the point of closure.  There was a variation in the level of adherence to Tusla policies and procedures and standard business processes for referrals.  There was no nationally agreed arrangement in place to ensure effective and consistent information sharing between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There were gaps in resource planning and critical social work posts remained vacant to varying degrees across the service areas.</p><p>HIQA's point about needing an innovative approach to workforce planning is well made.  We are coming from a position of low numbers of social workers per head of population in all areas, including child protection.  However, the report from HIQA states clearly that, "Tusla has to manage the same workforce challenges faced by other jurisdictions [...] and avoid an organisational mind-set that sees such problems as insurmountable due to factors outside of its control".  This will require a deeper examination of work practices and roles to make sure the teams are working to the greatest effect on children's lives.  Front-line teams need additional support and ongoing training to enable them to use their considerable skills in the most challenging of work and in a very high risk environment.  The recommendations identified specific actions for Tusla to act on directly.  They also identified areas for engagement by my Department with Tusla and HIQA to support these and to look at the overall regulatory environment.</p><p>To move forward, I immediately appointed Dr. Moling Ryan as an independent chair to implement the recommendation on setting up the quality assurance advisory oversight group.  The work of this group will examine the links between the action plan with Tusla's five-year child welfare and protection strategy and its three-year corporate plan.  In addition, my officials will engage with HIQA as to the kind of regulatory framework for child welfare and protection services that would be suitable for the Irish context.  HIQA is our expert in the social services regulatory field and I welcome its involvement.  I had a very productive meeting with the CEO of Tusla this morning.  I will be meeting the board of Tusla shortly to discuss the short and long-term implications of the report's findings and to discuss how to urgently drive the improvements that are needed.</p><p>Turning for a moment to the report itself, it says that it was evident that there had been considerable financial investment by the Government.  HIQA states that there is a clear strategic direction for Tusla and its services.  This direction is not fully incorporated into practices at local level.  In addition, the report is clear that the front-line teams are dedicated to the welfare and protection of children, and engaged positively with the investigation, which I welcome.  This is very much in line with my own experience of meeting with front-line teams throughout the country.</p><p>However, it was still the case that a key finding in the report was that there are systemic risks which require immediate attention and which pose a potential risk of harm to children.  Mr. Fred McBride as chief executive officer, CEO, has acknowledged that improvement is needed and he and his team will deliver on this.  They will have my full support, the support of the board of Tusla, my Department and the Government.  Tusla&rsquo;s appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs - some of the Senators were present and grilled Tusla - provided colleagues with an opportunity to question the senior management of the agency.  It is important that Tusla understands the concerns raised by Senators and Deputies who have read the report but who also have "on the ground" experience about child protection services.  The Oireachtas joint committee provided Tusla with an opportunity to explain from its perspective how cases are managed and how risk is minimised.  </p><p>I know that Tusla is anxious to convey the message that it is not possible to eliminate all risk.  Sexual abuse is a secretive act, there is shame, there is denial and there is concealment.  A reflective learning culture is essential to good practice and early identification of previously unknown risks.  Using experience is also a way to minimise the risks.  Tusla has recently appointed a chief social worker.  Part of the role of the chief social worker is to ensure that learning is shared across the organisation.  This has not been happening to the extent that it should.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has not been happening to the extent it should and HIQA was very clear about it.  I expect this to change and I am assured it will.  Senior social work practitioners will be part of the duty teams.  This should improve early identification of risks at the front door.  </p><p>With regard to retrospective allegations, I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the future role of Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of such cases.  Tusla's role has evolved from case law and needs to be considered further.  In the interim, Tusla's policy and procedures for retrospective allegations have been fully reviewed and will be available in the near future.  </p><p>The overall message is that there is an ongoing modernisation programme.  However, it needs impetus and focus.  This report serves to bring the actions needed into focus and sets a clear path forward.  HIQA's findings are serious.  Its recommendations will not be left on a shelf.  They will be implemented as they are intended to be to provide a more responsive, better and comprehensive service to our Irish children whom we have a responsibility to nurture, protect and respect.</p></speech>

It is a very serious report that makes for very sobering reading.  We have had almost a week to digest it.  I was at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last week when Fred McBride appeared before it.  To be honest, I would have very serious concerns about his leadership.  It is clear that there was a management failure at the top.  In her speech, I think the Minister referred to the fact that front-line workers are very dedicated to the service they are providing.  The Government is funding the service to a reasonable extent but there seems to be a disconnect between the funding, front-line workers and delivery, which is very concerning.</p> <p>The report is very comprehensive.  I appreciate that a report as comprehensive as this one needs adequate time but I was a bit disappointed that it took a year to produce.  However, we have it now.  The failures around the systems and policies that were referenced in the report are very concerning.  There seems to be a lack of urgency around everything in Tusla.  I think we would have cut it some slack when it was in its infancy but four years after its establishment, there should be far more urgency with regard to getting the systems and policies up to speed and ensuring they are correct and working properly.  </p> <p>The lack of staff is one issue but even where there is no lack of staff and where it is adequately staffed, there are problems relating to processes that are in place.  When failings occur, there seems to be a lack of supervision around the failings and a lack of learning from those failings.  The management style does not seem to equate to the organisation being a learning experience, which is very concerning.  </p> <p>Another thing that is of concern is the relationship between the Child and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fact that the two organisations do not seem to be exchanging information adequately.  This occurs at a number of levels.  One issue of serious concerning that I raised at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last week was the fact that joint interviewing did not take place as standard.  I was told that it is taking place, although not to a great extent.  It needs to take place as standard.  Social workers need to be trained as a matter of urgency in that regard.  </p> <p>We must bear in mind that we are talking about vulnerable children.  They should be at the centre of everything we do in this regard.  It is very upsetting to hear that files have been closed inappropriately.  The number of files that are still out there awaiting allocation is staggering.  I would have a lack of faith in the actual numbers we have been given when it says in the report that files have been closed inappropriately.  This is something I would like the Minister to address in her response.</p></speech>
