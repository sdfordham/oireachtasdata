    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this matter.  I greatly appreciate it, as I am aware that she was under some time constraint to get here this morning.</p><p>In October 2012, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, published a document entitled Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  That document, numbering more than 198 pages, set out a mechanism for changing local government across this country.  It was discussed by the various councillor associations and interested bodies and it came into play following the 2014 local elections.</p><p>The document set out how to change local government through full implementation of local government at a local level to maximise representational effectiveness and to improve structures, functions, resources, operational arrangements and governance.  It also aims to enhance the role of the elected member in the areas of economic development and enterprise support.  It sets as a target the devolution of powers from the centre.  It also provided for the abolition of town councils, a provision with which I greatly disagreed.  It provided functions for councillors in the areas of the environment, water, foreshore licensing, local development, food safety and housing, and provided for the setting up of new municipal district areas.  It proposed the amalgamation of various local authorities, such as the two authorities in Waterford - the area of my colleague, Senator Cummins - which became one authority, and the two authorities in Tipperary and Limerick, which also became one authority.</p><p>A year on from the implementation phase of that document, I have found that councillors and councillor associations have raised many issues with me.  Furthermore, anywhere I go, be it to a match or a funeral, a councillor will raise an issue related to the changes that have been implemented.  I ask that Putting People First be reviewed now that its provisions have been in operation for a year.</p><p>I will give a flavour of the issues that have been raised with me.  One issue is that of the general municipal allocation, under which each municipal area gets an allocation of money for spending on projects, in which it has discretion.  It seems the executive, rather than the councillors, is deciding where that allocation is spent.  That is a significant issue, particularly for councillors in Limerick who have contacted me about it and who are very exercised about it.  They say that section 2.1 of Putting People First is purposely being misinterpreted.  That is a very serious matter.</p><p>The use of motions to discuss issues that are outside the realm of the council is becoming a bugbear for councillors.  Issues to do with the other side of the world are being discussed, but it seems the local issues that need to be resolved are not being taken up.  The non-attendance of relevant executive staff at meetings is also an issue.  Of particular concern was the division of Kilkenny city into two electoral areas, and the Minister of State, who comes from that county, will know about the issue.  A number of councillors have contacted me to say that the new division is not working.  It is not feasible.  Instead of bringing local autonomy to people, it is claimed that Putting People First is taking it away from people and taking powers from local councillors and into the executive.</p><p>The review I seek should examine the terms and conditions of employment of councillors <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their ability to carry out their work on the salary they are getting.  It should examine the change in terms of geographical areas.  Electoral areas in Cork and other counties can span a distance of 100 miles.  A councillor is expected to carry out his or her functions under the old system of remuneration.  Another issue is the time councillors are expected to put in and the distance they are expected to travel.</p><p>The road budget allocation system is not being implemented in line with what is provided for in the document.  There is also the issue of pay related social insurance, which I have raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, on several occasions, and on which we are doing some work.</p><p>If a review is carried out - I sincerely hope it will be, and I am getting good vibes about that - it will need to include the input of members of local authorities, their representative associations and the spokespersons on local government in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Such a review would require a clear set of terms of reference and a timescale.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We also need to see the inclusion of practitioners of local government in the review group.  I hope the Minister of State has good news on this and that it can happen.  Putting People First is a broad document, setting out a lot of aims and objectives.  After one year, we need to analyse what has happened, what was good and bad, how we can improve and how councillors can have an opportunity to have an input.  They are the people who elected me, Senator Cummins and many others.  It is our duty to answer to them on issues of concern to them.  </p><p>I tabled this Commencement Matter so that we can liaise and communicate with them.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to announce a review today, if possible, and, if not, that she can indicate when it will happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#B00400"><p>It is certainly a reformed and improved system.  The majority of the policy decisions, first announced in Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government, and subsequently given statutory effect under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, came into effect on 1 June 2014.  Those changes included enhanced roles for local authorities in economic development and local and community development, the dissolution of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford and the establishment of new merged entities in their place, the replacement of town councils, to which the Senator referred, by municipal districts and provision for the reconfiguration of regional structures.</p> <p>There are also new governance arrangements, such as provision for an enhanced policy making role for elected members, new citizen participation measures, CPM, local authority service delivery plans, the re-designation of the position of manager to chief executive, stronger oversight powers for the elected council on the implementation of policy and increased obligations on the executive in relation to the elected council.  Together, the measures I have mentioned present a significant reform agenda and I will mention some of the benefits. </p> <p>At county and city level, while greater efficiency and economies of scale are among the objectives of the local authority amalgamations in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, stronger local government was the main aim.  Over time, benefits will arise following the establishment of single authorities which will be better positioned to achieve the overall goals of leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and communities effectively and accountably.  Mergers have also addressed issues related to boundaries, particularly where urban development has extended beyond the administrative boundary. </p> <p>Moreover, we can expect greater efficiency and more productive use of resources due, for example, to the elimination of duplication and reduced staffing requirements.  At sub-county level, municipal districts now cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance. </p> <p>As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation in county councils.  Under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication in administrative and electoral terms.</p> <p>An important additional benefit of the reconfigured local government system is a more appropriate assignment of functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and district levels over time will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication.  The division of functions between county and district levels has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level without duplication between the county and district jurisdictions.  Following this principle, the pressure of business on the plenary council can be relieved.</p> <p>The reform programme has seen important functions being transferred to local government in the areas of economic and community development.  The basis has also been set down for more far-reaching expansion of the role of local government into the future, as the reform structures, finances, governance and operational arrangements take effect and build greater confidence. </p> <p>While much has been achieved in terms of reform under the action programme and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, it is important to recognise that 1 June 2015 will mark the first full year of the operation of the structural and other changes in the local government system.  We are obviously at an early point in the operation of the new arrangements.  Nonetheless, it is essential to ensure that the new system is being operated effectively and as intended.</p> <p>We have, therefore, initiated an operational review of the new arrangements, which has been undertaken by a broadly based advisory group, together with a local government forum, for engagement with councillors through the Association of Irish Local Government.  As indicated in the response to a matter in the Seanad on 5 March, the reintroduction of the pre-reform configuration of town councils is not under consideration.  The operational review will provide solid evidence for any adjustments that might need to be considered in the operation of the revised structures.</p> <p>We also envisaged this being a continuing feature of engagement between central and local government, in particular to facilitate input by local authority members to the ongoing development and review of policy.  Priority matters under consideration in the short-term include the operation of the municipal district arrangements, particularly the exercise of powers and functions by elected members to ensure that the new system is being operated as intended and that the various components of the new local government system are working effectively; civic aspects such as in relation to the title of mayor; and the work of elected local authority members in the context of the new local government arrangements.</p> <p>As Members will be aware, a further important departure relating to local government is currently underway in the form of the review of local government arrangements in Cork and Galway by independent statutory committees.  These reviews are progressing well and I look forward to the reports in the autumn, which can have a major bearing on the future success of, and progress in, the areas under review.  </p> <p>The Government's intention is that local government will progress to become the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, with improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency, resulting in better value-for-money and improved services for clients.  Local government reform and development is not a once-off event but an ongoing process.  </p> <p>I ask Senator Landy to continue his deliberations, as he is very passionate about local government, to continue to lobby and to be the watchdog for local government in this House.  I thank him for raising this extremely important issue.</p></speech>

I am pleased, in the main, with the response.  Now that we have established a review is going ahead, I ask her to follow up on the terms of reference and the timescale for the outcome of the review as well as the invitation to the spokespersons on local government in both Houses to attend those meetings and to make submissions to the review.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a fairly standard request at any level in a review of this type in order to achieve the maximum from the review and the best outcome.

I am not sure if we are going to need his help in September but no doubt we will be delighted to take it.</p> <p>I ask the Senator and the other Members to continue the engagement.  With regard to the roads issue to which he specifically refers, I ask if he might send me some correspondence.  It is a particular issue that I would like to examine personally.  The same applies to the discretionary spend to which he refers.  The submissions would be extremely important with regard to the time scale of the review.

Just to remind Members before the usual "75% was sold" is thrown back at me, the reason for the retention of the 25% was to protect the strategic interests of the State and Aer Lingus as an independent entity and, in particular, to ensure connectivity for this island nation and control over what happened to our main airline.</p> <p>In the past 12 months, and particularly the past six months, this situation has been choreographed towards a sale.  I will remind people of how I debated the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 in this Chamber with the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, when she started the attack on airport and Aer Lingus's pension scheme.  That was the beginning of this process.  The reason was to find a mechanism to wipe out a &euro;740 million deficit in the pension scheme so as to make the company and the taxpayers' stake in it more attractive.  For &euro;340 million, the Government has effectively sacrificed Aer Lingus and airport pensioners - those who have taken 60% cuts in their pensions and 12-week cuts to their pensions in payments - and the 5,000 current workers who have been placed in an inferior pension scheme against their permission.  This has all been done to facilitate a Labour and Fine Gael sale of the Aer Lingus stake for a grubby &euro;340 million.  Where is Labour in all of this?  What of its seven Deputies who stated a short couple of months ago that they would not under any circumstance support a sale, including Deputies Ryan, Costello and so on?  Where are Labour's principles on this matter?</p> <p>The 25% stake was retained to protect the strategic interests of the State and the airline.  That is a fact.  What the Government is proposing to do is to sell that stake to IAG.  It has received false and non-binding commitments on the retention of the Heathrow slots.  If the 25% stake was retained, we would have influence over those.  Now we will not.  Cork and Shannon appear to have been thrown to the wolves.  Let us not forget about them in all of this.  Consider what has happened in other major airline takeovers.  This will lead to a pooling of services and job losses.  Aer Lingus's sphere of influence will move from Dublin to London.</p> <p>From the word "Go", Fine Gael has been about selling State assets and privatisation.  That does not surprise me.  Fine Gael is not a party of the working person and never has been.  It has always been interested in profit.  What of Labour and the last vestiges of standing up for the working person and the airport as some of its members have pretended to do down the years and as others have done with distinction, including former Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What will he and his brother, Deputy Brendan Ryan, do now in this regard?</p></speech>

Rather than me proposing an amendment on the Order of Business to have the Minister in today, as he will be in the D&aacute;il for most of the day, will the Leader schedule a debate for tomorrow to deal with this issue?  It will give us an opportunity to look at the report laid in the Library this morning.  Why was the Committee on Transport and Communications bypassed?  Why has the Government seen it fit not to give this report to the Committee on Transport and Communications to ask questions of IAG and all other stakeholders?  How come it has gone directly to the D&aacute;il?</p> <p>Will the Leader schedule a debate on this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, preferably for tomorrow?  This will allow us the opportunity to ask several other questions of the Minister.</p></speech>

I hope the Leader will look at it favourably and organise it at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Ireland has been found in violation of the European Social Charter by the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Committee of Social Rights.  It clearly stated the corporal punishment of children should be expressly and comprehensively prohibited in law.  When we look at the defence of reasonable chastisement, many people think it refers to rebuking or reprimanding severely.  However, the dictionary states it includes corporal punishment, beatings and inflicting punishment, such as by whipping.  The fact that anyone would have this defence against children is inexplicable.  Over 100 years ago, one could beat one&rsquo;s wife, dog or one&rsquo;s child.  We have removed this for domestic abuse and animal welfare but this defence is acceptable in cases involving children.  The Council of Europe has repeatedly asked for it to be removed.</p> <p>Up to 28 member states of the Council of Europe have prohibited corporal punishment of children in all settings, including the family home.  Almost one year ago, I forwarded an amendment to the Children First Bill to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I hope it will be accepted before it comes to the Seanad.  I know I have the backing of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and many other children&rsquo;s rights organisations.  If we want to children to be seen as rights holders, we need to remove this defence of reasonable chastisement.  For the past 12 years, the Council of Europe has repeatedly told us to remove this defence.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this matter?  Will he also urge the Minister to bring forward the Children First Bill to the Seanad?  I know it was stalled for 18 months but it has now passed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>We need to bring this into law.  I know it has not been used in the courts but the very fact that it remains on our law books speaks volumes about our perception of children as rights holders.</p></speech>

I would like to be convinced.  It does seem to me that this is political correctness gone wrong.  It is interfering in the home.  There are many impolite, brassy children around.  I think a bit of a slap would not do them the slightest bit of harm.  I agree with Pope on that.  I know it is an unpopular view but that is what I think.  That is the way I was treated and look at me.  I am not psychologically damaged.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I cannot be here tomorrow, but I would like that debate to go ahead as I am sure my views will be articulated by my colleagues on this and the other side of the House.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that something will have to be done for the Aer Lingus pensioners and deferred pensioners.  I suggest that a portion of the proceeds of the sale be used to provide for them.</p> <p>I am not convinced about the reassurance with respect to the 1% golden share.  I confess I have not gone through the detail of the report which was provided to the library, but I will read it.  Any sale of Aer Lingus would have significant implications for my constituents in County Clare.  I would love to know how many of the 600 new jobs committed to by 2020 will be in Shannon.  I welcome the fact that there is a seven-year commitment to retain the Heathrow slots.  I do not know in the long term if any golden share could prevent the sale of slots were there to be a worldwide economic recession in the aviation industry and a company's existence was dependent on restructuring, part of which would involve the sale of slots.  I remain to be convinced of how powerful any 1% or one golden share would be in those circumstances.  Further clarity is needed on that.  The Minister could provide that clarity if he were to come to the House to debate the matter.</p> <p>I believe the commitment to retain existing services for five to seven years can be honoured.  If IAG, a world conglomerate, makes such a commitment in writing on that, surely to God, unless the sky falls in on it, that commitment can be delivered.  </p> <p>In terms of the company's potential future growth, I would like that spelt out in much more detail.  I have heard plenty of comments over the years to the effect that we will explore the possibility and we will enter negotiations with our international aviation partners to explore potential growth, but that does not represent a tangible or real commitment in terms of growth - it only represents potential growth.  The only tangible, real commitment is that IAG will retain the existing winter and summer services in Shannon.  That is a very welcome development, because we have seen a 30% increase in traffic.</p></speech>

Europe's top human rights body today ruled that Ireland's laws on corporal  punishment are in breach of the European Social Charter, whose signatories promise to protect children and young persons against negligence, violence or exploitation.  While legislation which allowed parents to use force against children was repealed almost 15 years ago, the defence of reasonable chastisement still exists in common law for parents or child carers.  In response to the ruling, the Minister for Children, Deputy James Reilly, is expected to pledge later today to explicitly ban the smacking of children in foster or residential care through new regulations.  It is not good enough just to ban that; those in foster homes or anywhere else should not be allowed to physically slap or beat children.  That was the issue with abuse in the Magdalen homes, by the brothers and elsewhere in the past.  They used corporal punishment to attack young children.  This is a great ruling.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I am delighted it has made this ruling.  The Government should follow up as quickly as possible.  There is no justification for such abuse - for slapping a child.  Children should be cherished.  I hope the Government will move quickly in this regard.</p></speech>

It was a great day.  The celebrations in my home town of Dundalk were wide and vast that day.  I would also like to express my condolences to the family of Bill O'Herlihy on their loss.  People referred to the atmosphere in Ireland on Saturday as being similar to that of Italia '90.  Nobody signified, appreciated and brought Italia '90 better to our television screens than Bill O'Herlihy.  I would like to express my sympathy to his family on their loss.</p> <p>I would also like to welcome students from a school in Dundalk to the Visitors Gallery.  I recognise the uniform.  They are very welcome here this afternoon.</p> <p>I call for a debate on the issue of medical cards with Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, at the earliest opportunity.  I have received ongoing representations, but in recent weeks I received representations from two people regarding their applications which gave rise to concern.  One person had been in possession of a medical card for five years, while the other person had had one for more than 15 years, and that person had received no notice of a review.  In one case, the person had had a very significant diagnosis, yet he or she had no notice that a review was to take place.  The medical card office had to be phoned, it was discovered that the forms had never been received, and in the meantime the person's medical card had expired.  In that case, the person was fortunate in that the doctor and pharmacist were still working on the understanding that the person had a medical card, but with six months now having elapsed, the card has expired.  Both of those people who called to me will be left without a medical card.  The lack of communication in the Department is unbelievable and unacceptable, particularly when these people had previously been in possession of a medical card.  They have long-term illnesses that will not go away and their medications and condition are not going to change.  What has happened has inflicted an undue level of stress on these people.  I request a debate on this issue with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in attendance at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

This Government, and the Labour Party especially, opposed that move at the time - they opposed privatisation - yet they can come in today and stand over the selling off of the remaining stake.  By selling off the remaining stake, we are fully privatising Aer Lingus.  We are surrendering our national airline to a foreign company with so-called legal guarantees which have no standing whatsoever.  Again, this Government is asking the Irish people to buy a pig in a poke.  We were asked to do exactly the same with Irish Water by the same Government, and on three occasions they had to come back with their tail between their legs with three different Bills to get the same process through because of the mistakes they made.  I think we are making a monumental mistake by selling off this stake.</p> <p>Aer Lingus is a profitable company.  It is a vital body which maintains connectivity for Ireland internationally.  As a small island nation, for us to be without a national airline, or at least to have no democratic control of that airline, is wrong.  There will be concern about the Heathrow slots, because the CEO of IAG is on record as saying that the airline is desperate for extra slots to serve the very profitable and expanding Asian and South American markets from Heathrow.  That is the reality.  Despite whatever commitments the Government says it has received from IAG, everybody knows they are not worth the paper they are written on.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party know it, and we on this side of the House and the Irish people know it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government has, again, sold off a very profitable State-owned company, which is in our national interest to maintain, own and manage for the people, to a foreign company to do with it what it pleases.

It has happened in other airlines taken over by the same company, so please do not try to pull the wool over people's eyes and pretend this is in the interests of the Irish people and is about creating jobs when the Senators sitting over there know-----</p></speech>

I travel around Europe like most of us, and arriving in new cities, one sees tram systems.  What did we do with the tram system in Dublin?  We pulled it apart about 100 years ago and now we are paying a fortune to put it back together.  I look at Irish shipping, which was mentioned here yesterday, and it is destroyed; it is gone.  I look at Aer Lingus now.  The media is full of stories this morning of conflicts of interest by senior members of the board of Aer Lingus, who were advising the country and the Government.  There seem to be conflicts of interest in the financial institutions that are advising the country and the Government.  It is an extremely serious issue.  To go back to what Senator O'Brien said earlier, we robbed the pensioners, the poor unfortunate pensioners, who gave their lives to build that company.  We took their pensions off them, and we are now going to hand over approximately &euro;560 million to IAG.  We must get real about where we are going in this country.  I know people on the other side of the House feel exactly the same way as I do.  We need a debate in this House on Aer Lingus and we need it tomorrow.  I second Senator O'Brien's call for that.</p> <p>I also want to speak about the issue of humanity in our health service.  I visited a neighbour last night who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.  He told me there are a number of different forms of the disease.

I am sure the Leader will facilitate that.  Like many people, Aer Lingus to me is "Look up, it's Aer Lingus".  I have huge emotional attachment to it.  A very interesting case has been made by the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in the past 24 hours relating to the future of Aer Lingus and the fact that it may not have a future if it does not have an investment of the type that IAG can put into the company.</p> <p>However, I want to be sure that the workers in the company are protected, whether those workers be the former workers, the deferred pensioners, the pensioners or the existing workforce.  Legally binding assurances must be given on outsourcing and compulsory redundancies.  Until SIPTU is happy with what is on the table there, I personally would not be happy.  On the comments that have been made by Senator van Turnhout regarding children and slapping and so forth, there is no need for a debate.  There is no debate to be had.  It is a statement of the obvious.  My question is what we are going to do about implementing the law that is required to ensure that smacking children is outlawed and, indeed, treating them in any way that takes away from their dignity should also be illegal.  </p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on the Commission's country-specific recommendations for Ireland.  In that context, one of the leading recommendations on labour market activation and the number of lone parents, in particular, living in poverty and so forth, related to the lack of child care in Ireland.  In the context of the country-specific recommendations, could the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs come to the House to discuss how Ireland intends to respond to the Commission's recommendations and what measures this country is taking in respect of recommendations that were made last year on the same subjects?</p></speech>

It should probably have happened yesterday, but I support calls for that debate to happen tomorrow.  The justification for many decisions in this country seems to be that it makes good economic sense and a few bob can be made out of it.  That is not a good enough reason for many decisions.</p> <p>I was interested to see a debate that happened this morning, one year on from the implementation of the amalgamation of Limerick county and city councils, and how that has affected people.  It really came to my attention last Monday night, when I attended a public meeting behind in Shanagolden to do with a proposed gasification plant on the site of the old Gortadroma landfill.  That project is of major significance to the area.  It has the potential to have knock-on effects on human health, animal health and the valuation of property and land in the area.  That project was supported at municipal district level by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent Fianna F&aacute;il and no debate whatsoever took place at county council level on such a significant plant.  In fact, the disposal notice, which was signed on Monday, before the communities could have any input into something that will have a massive effect on-----</p></speech>

It was over long ago.  A survey carried out last year and the year before by the ISPCC and the Children's Rights Alliance found that two thirds of the adults surveyed thought it was already banned.  To think smacking a child would be acceptable is like saying assault on an adult would be acceptable.  One does not inculcate respect by the heavy hand of authority, which is the old-fashioned way of doing it, and which went out the door long ago.  I call for a debate on positive parenting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If one does not have positive parenting and parents are not helped in terms of how to help their children, problems will arise.  Parenting classes are included in the child care model.  Tusla is considering the matter currently.  It is important for a child to observe the parent solving problems in a creative way rather than by force.  Might is not right in any society.  If a child does not observe the parent doing it properly, it inculcates unskilled parenting and that can continue from one generation to the next.  It does not encourage learning, independence or other positive skills.  There is a lesson to be learned.  One speaker said there was no need for a debate but I seek a debate to ensure we help parents to help themselves and in turn help children in future years.</p></speech>

It makes one feel better to use "gasification" instead of "incineration".  He referred to the old Gortadroma landfill site to which tyres from all over the world will be imported which we will incinerate.  Goodness knows, the environment will once again be destroyed.  I welcome Nuala and Pat Geoghegan who are in the Visitors Gallery and who are from Askeaton, County Limerick.  The Aughinish plant and Moneypoint are near their farm.  If the EPA allows this new waste management business to go forward the area will surely compete for being the most polluted small area on the planet.  We will become a global player.  We need a debate on the matter, on environmental pollution in this country and on the EPA and on what it is not doing-----</p></speech>

I refer to the stunning reports from the CSO this morning on the growth of tourism alone this year.  Between January and April, the numbers are up by 13.5%.  A total of 1.8 million more visitors have come to this country in the period.  There is an increase in visitor numbers of 20% from North America.  Visitor numbers from Europe have increased by 14.7%.  Visitor numbers from Great Britain alone have increased by nearly 10% and visitor numbers from the rest of the world have increased by 23%.  That is all part of the Government's economic strategy of investing in tourism and it has proven to be an enormous contribution to economic recovery, in particular in rural areas where jobs have been on the increase.  Initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and now Ireland's Ancient East are adding to that, and we expect further growth.  I expect the growth of Aer Lingus and tourism-----</p></speech>

The matter should go before an Oireachtas committee in order that the report which is available to the Government could be examined.  Then we could come back to the Seanad and have a proper debate.

Are we frightened by the prospect that there might be greater competition in the aviation business?  That is what is being said.  I find it very difficult to understand that people who were capable of setting up a national airline and who showed the strength of character and commitment to ourselves as a people in control of our own destiny could after all of that arrive at a situation where we no longer have that tenacity of character.  I suggest that if we are going to debate this issue, which we should debate because people want us to debate it, the first thing that should happen is for the report to go before a committee and that ample time should be given to examine it.

I commend in particular Senator Martin Conway and Senator Denis O'Donovan and the other Members who were involved in it.  There is a farm-related death practically every week.

I ask the Leader to put on the schedule a debate following the publication of the report.</p> <p>I also support Senator Heffernan on the issue he raised relating to Limerick.

I never heard it used in an environmental context previously.  The proposal for Limerick must be investigated.  I spoke this morning in the Commencement debate about the first anniversary of the Putting People First document becoming legislation and then being used at local government level.  This is a case in point of policy not working.  What has happened is that officials are informing councils in certain municipal areas of issues and measures are being rubber-stamped by councillors without a full debate in the council.  This is wrong and we must put a stop to it.  We must open up the issue and have a proper debate.  We must question the EPA on what it is doing.  Currently, we are questioning the EPA on many issues in this House, including the issue Senator Whelan raised concerning Portlaoise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of these days, it will have to appear before us to provide answers.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#M00200"><p>I would be grateful to the Leader if he were to arrange a debate, at the earliest opportunity, to discuss with the Minister for Health the provision of general practitioner services in rural areas.  I have raised previously the rural practice allowance, which is a statutory scheme that has been in place since 1972, having been provided for in the Health Act 1970.  The allowance is paid to general practitioners in rural areas to help them defray the higher costs of running a rural practice.  These costs include the greater number of house calls rural doctors must make to older patients than doctors in urban areas.  As I have noted previously, some general practitioners must act as dispensing agents of medicines in rural areas where pharmacists are not readily available.</p> <p>The rural practice allowance is paid where a general practice is located at least three miles from a town or village with more than 1,500 people.  I do not need to stress the importance of general practitioners in rural areas.  A local medical service is vital to older persons living in relatively isolated areas with limited or no rural transport.  Access to primary care locally helps to reduce the number of people who present at hospital accident and emergency departments.</p> <p>I informed the House recently that it had come to my attention that the Health Service Executive was revising by stealth the terms of the statutory scheme under which the rural practice allowance is paid and systematically withdrawing the payment from general practitioners in rural areas.  I have spoken to doctors in east County Galway and other rural areas about their concerns.  The effect of the withdrawal of the allowance has been to leave some general practitioners in east County Galway and elsewhere in the west without an economic basis for continuing to provide their services.  It is common knowledge that it is proving nearly impossible to attract young doctors to establish general practices in rural areas.</p> <p>Since I last raised this issue, it has been reported in the media that one general practitioner in the west took the HSE to court to compel it to pay the rural practice allowance.  Other doctors have come forward indicating that their rural practice allowance payments have been similarly withdrawn.  This is disgraceful.  If the Government is serious about the provision of medical services in rural areas, it should call a halt to the withdrawal by stealth of allowances for general practitioners.  The HSE is acting in a high-handed and arbitrary manner in the way in which it is administering and restricting a scheme the Oireachtas has laid down in law.  I would be grateful if the House could hear from the Minister for Health on this matter. </p></speech>

Concerns about health and safety issues and staffing levels have been raised for some time.  It has been reported that 36 staff in psychiatric services have been assaulted since January.  Staff want an agreed complement on the wards at all times.  Psychiatric services in UHG have been under constant pressure since the decision was taken last year to reconfigure them and remove 22 beds from the system in Ballinasloe.  What progress has been made on the promised state-of-the-art facility?  The Minister of State and Health Service Executive must honour the commitments they made at the time of the decision on reconfiguration.

The national airline was sold in 2006 when a 74.9% stake in the company was sold under Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  Aer Lingus was privatised at that point, as even the birds in the trees know.

We will certainly try to arrange such a debate with the Minister.</p> <p>While Aer Lingus and the issue of corporal punishment were the main issues raised here this morning, other issues have also been raised.

It is right and fitting that these results are published and that the good news stories within the health services are also highlighted.  </p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about a case of motor neurone disease, which specific item could perhaps be tabled for a Commencement debate.

In respect of the overall topic of environmental pollution, I will certainly try to arrange that the Minister come in for a debate.</p> <p>Senator Coghlan spoke about the growth in tourism in view of the tremendous 13% increase in the first four months of the year.  This can only be good for the economy, and highlights the role of the Government's economic strategy in respect of tourism, which has been very successful.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the question of the sale of the national airline.  The Aer Lingus brand will be retained, and that is a very important part of the deal.  Senator Landy spoke about the public consultation committee, whose report was published and launched yesterday by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I will arrange a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that very important report.  Senator Landy also raised the need for a review of the Putting People First document on local government.  He also proposed tabling the issue for a Commencement debate, and I support him in that request.  The Senator also welcomed the measures that the Government and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, have put in place in respect of gift vouchers.  These are long overdue.</p> <p>Senator Mullen has previously raised the question of GP services in rural Ireland, and rightly so.  He might table a matter for a Commencement debate on this issue.  I have requests in a number of areas concerning the health service, for which I am trying to get the Minister in.  Senator Mullins spoke on industrial action being taken by staff in the psychiatric hospital in Galway; again, perhaps a Commencement debate should be tabled on that issue.</p> <p>Senator Coghlan commented on the Aer Lingus deal, to which I have already alluded, and Senator Kelly spoke about the Private Rented Tenancies Board and the possibility of a need for further legislation to give it more teeth.  This has been raised on several occasions in this House and elsewhere, and I will ask for the Minister to come in to address that matter in early course.</p></speech>

More than 100,000 extra jobs have been created since the start of 2012 when the Government's Action Plan for Jobs was launched.  The latest figures released last week from the Central Statistics Office show that in the first quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate had dropped below 10%, to 9.9%, for the first time since 2008.  In the 12-month period to quarter one of 2015, unemployment decreased by 45,000 and there was an annual net increase in employment of more than 40,000, bringing the total number in employment to 1,930,000.  Most of the increase in employment was in full-time employment, which increased by 52,000, and part-time employment fell by 2.4%.  The long-term unemployment rate fell from 7.3% to 5.9%.  Tax revenue has increased, primarily as a result of the improving economy, while the social welfare bill has fallen in line with falling levels of unemployment.</p> <p>What these figures illustrate is the success of the Government's twin-track approach of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work.  The Action Plan for Jobs is accelerating Ireland's transition to a sustainable jobs-rich economy, while the Pathways to Work programme is ensuring as many people as possible taking up work are doing so from the live register.</p> <p>There are still too many people who are jobless, however, and we are working to build on the success to date and to create full employment within the next three years.  It is important for the thousands of people still looking for work that their aspirations are not endangered by policies that will undermine or even row back on the progress made to date.  Now that the recovery is beginning to be felt, workers quite naturally believe that it should be reflected in their wage packets, and a return to wage bargaining is visible in many sectors of the economy.</p> <p>In this regard, IBEC's recent pay survey found that 57% of companies plan to increase basic pay this year.  According to that survey the median pay increase is set to be 2%.  Other surveys suggest that this figure may well be higher.  So long as pay increases are commensurate with the performance of both the enterprise and the economy, and so long as they do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities or impact on competitiveness, locally or internationally, then such increases can only benefit the economy and strengthen domestic demand.</p> <p>The national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards.  Bearing in mind that social transfers differ from country to country and also taking the cost of living into account, Ireland's rate is the sixth highest among the 22 EU member states that have a national minimum wage.  The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that in mid-2014, just over 4% of all employees were being paid the adult experienced national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour, or the sub-minima rate.  As it stands, under the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the national minimum wage can be adjusted by ministerial order following a recommendation in a national agreement; in the absence of such a recommendation, following an examination and recommendation by the Labour Court on foot of a request by a substantially representative organisation of employees or employers; or unilaterally by the Minister regardless of whether a recommendation under section 12 or 13 has been made.</p> <p>The legislation specifies a number of criteria that must be taken into account.  The ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the last Labour Court recommendation, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount irregularly, with lengthy gaps between increases, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than is more regular and, therefore, smaller and fairly predictable up-ratings.  From an employer and worker perspective, a significant benefit of the new approach is that minimum wage rates will be assessed annually.  Therefore, adjustments in future will be incremental and less disruptive for business than the step-changes used in the past.</p> <p>Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government's agenda, and setting up the Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the statement of Government priorities agreed in July last year.  The commission was launched last February, chaired by Dr Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, and it is currently operating on an interim, non-statutory basis.  It has sought and received submissions which are currently being considered.  I expect its first report by the middle of July.</p> <p>The commission is a nine-member body comprising an independent chair, three members with an understanding of the interests of low-paid workers, three members with an understanding of the interests of employers, in particular, those operating in traditionally low-pay sectors, and two members with relevant academic backgrounds.  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be to examine and make recommendations to the Minister annually on the national minimum wage with a view to securing that the minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to its functions under the Act.  This work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the commission in February of each year.  In addition, in the discharge of its function, the commission will be required to make recommendations that are evidence-based using a suite of agreed data sets or, where required, based on bespoke research undertaken at its own behest.  This approach draws on that adopted in the UK where since 1997 the recommendations of the UK Low Pay Commission have brought about a progressive increase of the minimum wage that has had little detrimental effect on the functioning of the economy or labour market.</p> <p>The commission will be statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.  While not provided for in the general scheme of the Bill, it is intended that it will adopt a consensus-based approach to its reports and recommendations.  Work should always pay but I am also conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair with one that is sustainable and which allows employers to continue to create quality jobs.  In this context, a particular function of the commission will be to ensure any advice or set of recommendations it makes to Government is evidence-based, utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives, and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  Alongside these hard data, the commission will consult real people - workers and employers - who are directly affected by the national minimum wage.  This real lived experience will be vital for the commissioners when deciding on the rate for the minimum wage.  The changes proposed in establishing the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis are essentially taking the politics out of setting the national minimum wage.  This is very much in keeping with the dignity of work agenda I am pursuing and it complements work such as the University of Limerick study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts which is in train.</p> <p>I will outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as meaning the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Section 2 amends the principal Act to provide for insertion of a number of relevant definitions in that Act.  Section 3 provides for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and that the body will be independent in the performance of its functions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Section 4 outlines the duty of the commission and, in this regard, provides that the commission will be required to make such recommendations regarding the national minimum hourly rate of pay as are designed to set a minimum wage that is designed to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable; is both fair and sustainable; where adjustment is appropriate, is adjusted incrementally; and over time is progressively increased, all without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the functions of the commission.  In this context, the commission will be required to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and make a recommendation and a report on the issue by 15 July each year.  This section also sets out the range of economic factors that the commission is required to take into account when making a recommendation, including changes in earnings, currency exchange rates and income distribution in the period since the previous minimum wage order; whether during that period unemployment, employment and productivity have been increasing or decreasing, both generally and in the sectors most affected by the making of an order; international comparisons, particularly with Great Britain and Northern Ireland; the need for job creation; and the likely effect that any proposed order will have on levels of employment and unemployment, the cost of living, and national competitiveness.</p><p>Section 5 also provides that the commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on such matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  In addition, the commission will be required to report every three years on the general operation of the Act.  The commission will be required to consult with employers and employees when preparing reports under section 5.</p><p>Section 6 provides that the Minister will, within three months of receiving a recommendation from the commission, make an order in the terms recommended, make an order in other terms, or decline to make an order.  The Minister will be required to lay a statement before both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out the basis for any rejection or variation of a recommendation.  If the commission fails to make a recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate, the Minister may, having had regard to the economic factors specified in the legislation, make an order in relation to the matter.  </p><p>Section 7 provides that the Minister shall advance to the commission out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such amount or amounts as the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, determine for the purposes of expenditure by the commission in the performance of its functions.  Section 7 also provides that the Minister shall make available to the commission such officers of the Minister and reasonable facilities and services as the Minister, after consultation with the commission, may determine.</p><p>Section 8 provides for a number of technical amendments to the principal Act.  Section 9 provides for the repeal of sections 11, 12 and 13 of the principal Act.  Section 10 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction provisions of the Bill.</p><p>The new Schedule provides that the commission will be a nine-member body, comprising an independent chairman, three members who will have an understanding of the interests of low-paid workers, three members who will have an understanding of the interests of employers, particularly small to medium-sized employers and those operating in traditionally low-pay sectors, and two members who will have relevant knowledge or expertise in relation to economics, labour market economics, statistics or employment law.  The Schedule also provides that the Minister shall, in so far as is practicable, endeavour to ensure that among the members there is an equitable balance between men and women.</p><p>The term of office of its members will be three years.  Members may serve two consecutive terms of office and will be eligible for reappointment after a break.  The Schedule also includes standard provisions dealing with resignation and termination, disqualification, remuneration and other terms and conditions of office, appearance by the chairman before a committee of either House of the Oireachtas, and the regulation of its own procedures by the commission.</p><p>As I have said, throughout the crisis the Government has been committed to maintaining employment rights and protecting the most vulnerable workers.  Where changes have been made or new legislation introduced, it has been to improve employment rights.  On low pay alone, one of the first actions of this Government was to restore the minimum wage to the level it was at before the last Government cut it just before leaving office.</p><p>There is now general agreement that this year will be a good year for the economy, for employment, for those in low-paid jobs and for industrial relations reform.  In the coming days, I am introducing in the D&aacute;il a companion piece of legislation that makes significant reforms to industrial relations machinery in the fields of registered employment agreements and collective bargaining.  We are determined to ensure that the economic recovery continues to strengthen, that employers hire more and more full-time workers and that the low paid in particular will share in the economic recovery.</p><p>That is what this Bill is about - fixing a minimum wage that assists as many low-paid workers as possible without threatening jobs or the economy.  I believe setting up the Low Pay Commission is one of the most important policy initiatives taken by any Government in recent years.  It is evidence of this Government's commitment to making dignity at work a reality.</p><p>In conclusion, during the crisis we remained committed to maintaining employment rights and protecting the most vulnerable.  Our aim in Government now is to continue towards a balanced economic recovery.  That means jobs growth in the regions as well as Dublin.  It means spreading the recovery to all socio-economic groups, because there is no future for this economy and for our society unless we remain committed to these twin objectives - to sustain the recovery and to share the benefits.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I endorse what he says.  The changes he is proposing, such as the establishment of the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis, essentially take the politics out of setting the national minimum wage.  It is very much in keeping with the dignity at work agenda which he is pursuing and complements work such as the study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts by the University of Limerick, a study which has just come out and on which I have already spoken in the House.</p> <p>As an employer I like to see myself as someone who speaks both on behalf of employers and of employees.  I co-founded Lir Chocolates with Connie Doody in 1987 and my sole reason was to create employment.  If I may detract from my skills in this instance, I never had a profit.  We had a very serious crisis in Ireland with unemployment at the time - the economy was black in the 1980s.  In some areas of the country and in this city we had 40% unemployment.  I saw the transformation in a person when they got a job.  I saw their self-confidence grow when they realised they were able for a job.  Their social interaction improved and it was not just about the money.  It was about meeting with other human beings every day and being able to get up out of bed and have somewhere to go every day.</p> <p>I am different from colleagues in that I will not commit myself to saying what the increase in the minimum wage should be.  I do not think the Minister of State referred to this in his speech.  He said Fianna F&aacute;il made a mistake in reducing the minimum wage when it did and that the current Government had put it back up.  However, one cannot do that with companies as they make their financial plans a year in advance so companies have not allowed for an introduction of the minimum wage now.  They have already done their deals with the people to whom they are selling their products.  I am all for an increase in the minimum wage but I am not at all sure what it should be.  I totally believe it has to be increased but it has to be timed for when it suits those people who employ other people.  </p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's introduction of the minimum wage in 2000, which gave all employees a legal entitlement to the wage, was positive and I went to Mary Harney to congratulate her on that achievement as I am convinced there has to be a legal minimum wage.  However, because of the lack of businesspeople in Government we increased it every year.  In 2000, Germany and Ireland were parallel in terms of wages but over the next seven years ours went up so much relative to Germany that we lost our competitiveness.  The reason I speak on behalf of employers as well is that once one decides to increase a minimum wage it has to be done in a planned way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M.

I heard no reference in the Minister of State's speech to this.  I am not criticising him, as he is on the right track and his heart is in the right place, but he must allow for other employees who want an increase in their wages.  This was not mentioned in his speech.</p><p>Although I complimented Ms Mary Harney at the time, the then Government increased the minimum wage every year, so everyone else wanted a wage increase.  One cannot do that to businesses.  I am supportive of a minimum wage, but we must do this in a planned way so that companies can plan their business.  They cannot just do this or that willy-nilly.  This will change their pricing structures.  I spoke to a business person this morning who told me that she would have to increase her prices.  So what?  Increase them if necessary.</p><p>This must be done thoughtfully.  The Minister of State's sentiments are good and he mentioned that this would be assessed every year, but that assessment must be done carefully.  Our economy's ethos must be to provide sustainable jobs.  The dignity of workers is No. 1 in terms of people's self-confidence and reaching their full potential.</p><p>I laud the appointment of Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir as chairperson of the low pay commission.  He is a man of integrity and practical common sense.  However, I would have liked to have seen more business people involved.  There is Mr. Vincent Jennings and the CEO of the Maxol Group, who is quite a big shot and does not quite represent the small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that we are discussing and that are creating employment.  I do not know what employment the Maxol Group has created.  He is president of IBEC and so on, but I would have liked to have seen a group that was more representative of the SMEs that are attempting to grow, increase their sales and, thereby, create employment.  They are at the coalface of job creation.  More jobs are created in new businesses than anywhere else, which the Minister of State knows as well as I do.  I am speaking from the point of view of human dignity.  Having a job is the most important factor for any human being.  Anyone who can get up and go to work everyday will survive the trials and tribulations of life.</p><p>My hero in all of this is Se&aacute;n Lemass.  He had the guts to turn from protectionism and change his mind.  This was because he was a businessman and was not afraid.  Governments introduce policies, carve them in stone and are terrified to change them in case they seem like mistakes.  If one is in business, one must adapt plans as one goes.  It is about changing and not carving any policy in stone.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State, of whom I am a fan.  I will put a couple of further points on the record that can help.</p></speech>

In the UK, employers have been given a reduction in their social security contributions through the recent increases in the apprentice national minimum wage rate.  The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, of which I am a fan, made a number of recommendations on labour cost competitiveness in its 2014 annual report.  It stated that the Irish low pay commission should consider enhancing "labour cost competitiveness through reform of income taxes, changes to the PRSI structure for lower paid workers..."  These are the other ways of increasing the standard of living for low-paid workers.</p></speech>

I am representing Senator Naughton in this debate.  This legislation is welcome.  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, there are three ways in which the minimum wage can be set: following a recommendation in a national agreement under section 12; in the absence of such a recommendation, following an examination and recommendation by the Labour Court on foot of a request by a substantially representative organisation of employees or employers under section 13; or unilaterally by the Minister under section 11 regardless of whether a recommendation under section 12 or 13 has been made.  This methodology was, and is, not a proper mechanism for the adjustment of the national minimum wage.  As the ESRI some time ago concluded, adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, with lengthy gaps between increases as happened in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than regular, smaller and fairly predictable upratings.</p> <p>Given this finding, the proposed legislation and the consequential establishment of the commission is the way forward.  In this way, we can have reasoned analysis of the costs of employment, its trends and the pros and cons of any proposed increase.</p> <p>While I am supportive of the legislation, I wish to raise a few related issues with the Minister of State.  The UN's recent global wage report revealed Ireland's high wage rate in comparison with the rest of the world.  Ireland came fourth behind Australia, Switzerland and Denmark for hourly rates in the manufacturing industry, for instance.  While this might not directly relate to the minimum wage, it is a cause for concern.  We are not as competitive as we might be, which has led to some of our problems.  Senator White referred to how losing our competitiveness posed a major challenge prior to the recession.</p> <p>According to a recent report from the NCC, while the country's cost base had "improved significantly" since 2009, much of the recent change had come from factors outside our control.  It cited the weak euro, record low ECB interest rates and cheap oil prices as driving down business costs across the eurozone.  However, the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report stated that new pressures were emerging, for example, rising property prices and calls for wage increases, that could jeopardise the ability of companies to compete internationally and create jobs.</p> <p>Despite improvements, Ireland remains a high-cost location - the third highest in the EU - for consumer goods and services.  With a net minimum wage of &euro;7.49 after tax, the statutory rate being &euro;8.65, Ireland is the fourth highest in the table of OECD countries behind Australia, Luxembourg and Belgium, whose rates range from &euro;8.44 to &euro;7.58.  In these circumstances, we must be prudent when raising expectations.  Through the public's perseverance and the hard work of business owners, our economy is on the up.  We cannot jeopardise that with the "something for everyone" economic policies favoured by previous Governments.  All evidence suggests that any immediate sharp jump in the minimum wage would be counterproductive.  Careful consideration and small, regular increases are required so as to maintain competitiveness and ensure that employers know what to expect and are able to plan accordingly.</p> <p>I am not against an increase in the minimum wage, as it is warranted.  However, it cannot be an increase in large percentage terms, as that would effectively make employing our young people in particular prohibitively expensive.  The Government has proposed a way forward, namely, an expert body that will conduct a review of the employment situation, consider the positives and negatives and make rational proposals.  This legislation needs to be implemented by a Government that is fiscally responsible and will not bow to every pressure group, concede to demands and contribute to wrecking the economy.</p> <p>I should put on the record the fact that I am an employer.  I am concerned that SMEs have taken extra hits over and above what everyone else has endured in recent years.  Speaking as an employer, family income supports and supplements may need to be examined as part of the minimum wage concept and how we support families.  I know people working in factories who are in receipt of substantial incomes and people working in the public service who are in receipt of family income supplement, FIS.  This is how the Government can help with the minimum wage situation.  We need to take a balanced approach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tony Mulcahy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2358"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2358&amp;amp;pid=TonyMulcahy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Above all, we have to ensure that working individuals and families are given a fair and decent wage for the work they do.  It must be a wage they can survive on, because they have been faced with a lot of extra costs over the past couple of years.</p><p>In general, I welcome the initiative and I will support the legislation.  However, let us have a good and comprehensive look at it.  While Senator White may go on a little, as an employer, I feel that what she says makes a lot of sense.  We had a company that fell over in 2011; we had one or two employees then, and we now have seven.  At the end of the day, we cannot get an increase for the product we sell at the far end, so we have to be very careful.  At &euro;8.65, a &euro;1 increase is effectively a 10% increase in the wage base.  If companies were to face that kind of cost without having supports coming from the other side, a lot of companies could be very easily tipped over the cliff.</p></speech>

I give a cautious welcome to this Bill, although I have some concerns and reservations about it and about the establishment of the commission itself, which I will articulate.  Obviously, however, any measure that will hopefully put money into the pockets of low-paid workers is something I would wholeheartedly support.</p> <p>We heard from the first speakers about the plight of businesses.  I fully accept that we have to be conscious of the impact of any decisions we take on businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.  While I am not an employer, some people in my family are, and I know the pressures that many small and medium-sized businesses are under.  In fact, I know many small entrepreneurs who themselves work for less than the minimum wage simply to keep the door open.  That is the reality.  Obviously, we have to be conscious of where business is at.  However, I have listened very closely to many of the employer organisations over recent months on this issue, and they have been critical of anybody who has called for an increase in the minimum wage.  They do not seem to be in favour of any increase in wages, except for middle and higher income earners.  When it comes to low-paid workers, they do not seem to want to face up to the reality at all.  For me, that is a problem.</p> <p>The prevalence of low-paid, insecure work is a serious societal problem that is hindering economic growth and exacerbating inequality.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in the OECD and of under-employment in the 28 members of the eurozone.  The number of people in part-time work has increased by 13% since 2007, and the increasing use of zero-hour and low-hour contracts by employers, particularly in the areas of health, retail and the services sectors, has become a real problem.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the legislation underpinning the work of the Low Pay Commission as presented renders it not fit for purpose.  It appears that the Labour Party has learned none of the lessons of its sister organisation in Britain, which supports important reforms of the Low Pay Commission in Britain.  I ask the Minister of State to take a serious look at that.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in which I am the rapporteur for a report on low pay, which, by the way, goes beyond the minimum wage.  Some 5% of workers in this State are on the minimum wage, but 20% of all workers in this State are on low pay, according to reports from EUROSTAT, the OECD, the CSO, TASC and many others.  That is one in five workers.  The Low Pay Commission, or the low pay and minimum wage commission, which is what it is, only looks at the minimum wage and does not deal with low pay in its entirety.</p></speech>

This is precisely the problem.  The party's election manifesto from 2011 states that wage competitiveness should not be confused with a low wage agenda, yet this is the very agenda it is now pursuing in government.  The Minister of State tells us that he can take no action on zero-hour contracts until he has gathered sufficient evidence of their existence.  The truth is that the Government could and should have used the CSO to collect the data as part of the quarterly national household survey, which is what is now done in Britain.  That is what could have been done, and the Government would then have had the data, rather than saying it does not have it.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, has said: &ldquo;The Low Pay Commission represents the next step in the Government prioritising work and fairness as the economic recovery takes hold."  We heard some of that from the Minister of State today as well.  Yet the work of the commission is limited to the national minimum wage, which affects just under 5% of workers.  We know the prevalence of low-paid work is much higher than that.  The establishment of the national minimum wage commission is a political decision in that the Bill itself provides that the Minister can accept, reject or vary the recommendations of the commission.</p> <p>The Government's use of State-sponsored bodies as a mechanism by which it can wash its hands of responsibility for policy and political decisions is completely disingenuous and fools no one.  I very much hope the Low Pay Commission does not become the HSE of low pay.  We have seen over and over again that Ministers for Health from today and previous days have washed their hands of responsibility.  Any criticisms or questions about health service delivery were referred to the HSE.  Only last week, we tabled questions in regard to how much it will cost for the State to become a living wage employer, but the Government was not in a position to provide that data.  What did it say in the parliamentary response?  It said it was now a matter for the Low Pay Commission.  Already we can see the passing of the buck in this regard, and we are going to see more.  It will be said that we cannot do anything about low pay, and we cannot do this that or the other, because that is a matter for the Low Pay Commission.  That is taking politics out of it.  It means the Government is not taking the decisions that should be taken.  In reality, all of the data and evidence is there - I have mentioned the EUROSTAT report, the OECD report, the CSO report and the TASC report on economic inequality in this State.  What has been lacking is the political will from this Government to do anything to support low-paid workers.  Here it is, at the 11th hour, in its last year in government, establishing the Low Pay Commission, in reality to give the Labour Party cover going into an election in that it can say it has done something or is doing something for low pay.  It is not going to save one Labour neck in the next election - that is for sure - but hopefully it might do something in regard to the national minium wage, which is essentially what it is confined to.</p> <p>I have a lot more to say about the Bill itself.  Unfortunately, we do not have the same time to scrutinise Bills here in the Seanad as Members do in the D&aacute;il.  However, we will have Committee Stage, during which my party will be tabling several amendments to the Bill.  We will try to make the Low Pay Commission a commission that can genuinely deal with low pay in its entirety and actually learn the lessons of other models and other commissions which are working more effectively because they have changed the nature of their work in order that they can examine not just the minimum wage but also low pay in its entirety.</p> <p>I give the Bill a cautious welcome, despite the fact that I have reservations.  I accept that it is a step in the right direction.  However, I also have genuine concerns, which I will articulate on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The Low Pay Commission will prioritise work and fairness as the economy improves.  Employment is rising rapidly and unemployment is falling.  As the Minister of State pointed out, more than 100,000 jobs have been created since the crisis, which is 3,300 jobs every month, and unemployment is now below 10%, at 9.9%.  Long-term unemployment is also falling and is down to 9%.</p> <p>Having a job is the best protector against poverty, but key to that are fair wages and conditions.  The Low Pay Commission represents an excellent example of how we can achieve both.  We have done a lot to get job seekers back to employment, education and training.  It is important that we now get our people to work and get them work that pays fairly.</p> <p>The State supports many families on low pay through the family income supplement, on which we spend &euro;280 million a year supporting 50,000 families.  We also have the back to work family dividend, which is a new initiative by the Labour Party whereby the child dependent allowance of approximately &euro;30 per child can now be made payable to somebody who takes up work for the first time.  With a family of three, that amounts to &euro;7,000 per year for that family.</p> <p>However, social welfare is not the answer to our problems, and we must aim higher.  If we are interested in long-term solutions, it is crucial that we start looking at why there are jobs that simply do not pay enough to cover the basic cost of living, as it is essential that working families can stay ahead of the basic cost of living.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Kelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is essential that working families can stay ahead of basic cost of living expenses.  Let us remember that we increased the minimum wage when we were in government.

I certainly believe that it will work.</p></speech>

I am happy to see the Bill come before the House.</p> <p>Income poverty is a term I had never heard until after the financial collapse.  We live in a country where people who are working still cannot cover their costs.  Will the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 be able to address that?  I fear it will not.  When we discuss fair wages and conditions, we hear Members speak about their concerns for employers.  I hope they will forgive me if I show little concern for employers, particularly those employers who cut the hours of their workers as they rise up the incremental scale in order to ensure that the net amount paid to the worker does not change.  I totally agree that some small businesses have struggled to meet the salaries of their staff, but it is not true to say that all employers suffered that.</p> <p>The issue of income poverty will not be dealt with by this Bill, which is a matter of concern.  There is a section that talks about progressive increases.  These progressive increases cannot be associated with some form of reduction in working hours.  The zero-hour contract still exists and something must be done about it.  I appreciate that it will not be dealt with in this Bill.</p> <p>I am concerned about section 10C(3)(e), which refers to job creation and levels of employment and unemployment.  This provides a gateway for the commission or the Minister to seek to reduce the minimum wage because the level of unemployment is rising or the numbers at work are falling, as the case may be, or in order to generate jobs.  I reject Senator White's suggestion that if people at the bottom of the scale get a euro, everybody else will want a euro.  If there is a proper incremental scale, then everybody knows that when he or she is entitled to the increment it will be paid.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the issue of PRSI must be dealt with.  I do not believe the Bill we are discussing can deal with the issue.  I have great sympathy for the self-employed whose businesses are going to the wall for one reason or another but who find they do not qualify for any benefit, having paid massive sums into the PRSI fund.  That is an issue that we will have to consider.  We also have to consider the dreaded class K PRSI rate, which is nothing but a tax.  Who would buy insurance if they were not to receive any benefit from it?  It is a nonsense and it must be dealt with.  </p> <p>I am delighted to see that the trade union movement is represented on the board.  I am also delighted to see that we have immigrants represented on the board, but I would love if we picked some poor unfortunate who is on the scratcher and is living on social welfare, or is at the bottom of the scale in one of the retail outlets, and put them on the board.  They would bring the true story of what it is like to live on the scratcher or on the minimum wage.  The trade union movement will do a good job.  The economists will be ethically neutral, but I would have some concern that employers will not practise ethical neutrality.</p> <p>I congratulate the Minister of State on the introduction of the Bill, but I do not want to see the Government trying to sell it as some form of revolution in looking after the low-paid in this country.  It will not solve that problem.  I will table amendments to the Bill.</p></speech>

His commitment to lower paid workers is acknowledged.  We of course welcome the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  In a recent submission, we recommended increasing the national minimum wage by 55% to bring it up to &euro;9.20 per hour, representing an increase of more than &euro;1,000 per annum.  The reduction in the minimum wage at a time of severe national and international crisis was obviously a mistake in retrospect, and not only because of the impact it had on those who were relying on the minimum wage, for whom an extra euro per hour would have been a life saver.  Of course we acknowledge that was a mistake, but hindsight is wonderful.  However, it was the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that introduced legislation back in 2000 and that, in its period of office, progressively increased the national minimum wage six times between 2000 and 2007, from &euro;5.58 to &euro;8.65 per hour.  Our credibility in this area should not be questioned because of one decision taken at a time of major national emergency.</p> <p>We have made several recommendations in our submission, including a recommendation that the rise in the national minimum wage should be greater than inflation since 2007.  Our suggested increase has been carefully balanced against any adverse effect on national employment and competitiveness.  We believe the priority is to focus on the pay and job security of those who are in low-paid employment.  Priority must be given to supporting those on low and middle incomes who are finding it hard to meet their weekly financial commitments.  We believe there is no unanimity in Government on this.  Although, as I stated at the outset, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, and his colleagues in the Labour Party cannot be faulted on their commitment to the increase in the hourly rate, I am not sure that their opposite numbers in the Fine Gael Party share the same enthusiasm.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, have warned of the risks if the rate is increased, while the T&aacute;naiste has talked about the introduction of a living wage.  The Minister of State is on record as saying he favours increasing the minimum wage.  </p> <p>I take the point made by Senator Craughwell that, looking at the composition of the board of the Low Pay Commission, it seems to follow the pattern of appointments to commissions whereby the board members come from the worlds of academia, business and trade unions, which is right and proper in its own way because they all bring a certain level of expertise to the table.  However, in the context of the Low Pay Commission, which is considering those who are most vulnerable in our workforce, it would seem that the inclusion of a person to represent those who have gone through the rigours of the economic crisis for the past six or seven years would be appropriate - for example, an employer who had to lay people off and had to struggle on a daily basis to make his or her business work, who now may not have that business and may be doing something else.  Entrepreneurs tend to bounce back.  In America the mark of success is how many bankruptcies one has had, whereas in Ireland, until recent years, bankruptcy was seen as a sign of failure and bankrupt people were written off.  How many instances have there been of people who have bounced back?  May I suggest that, if the occasion arises, we consider appointing to the board a person who has worked at the coalface?</p> <p>Those who have been appointed to the Low Pay Commission include the chief executive officer of the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, a director from HR &amp;amp; Business Solutions, and the chief executive of the Maxol Group, who is also the president of IBEC.  I do not see somebody who might be able to bring a particular expertise on the specific area of low pay.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate that during the deliberations on the submissions, account will be taken of those who have gone through the most difficult period of our nation's economic history. </p> <p>We welcome the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  I, too, hope the Low Pay Commission will take cognisance of the modalities and operational procedures of other low pay commissions, particularly the commission established in 1997 by our near neighbour, which has introduced reforms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Government takes that into account.</p></speech>

Setting up the statutory Low Pay Commission is, as Senator White said, designed to take much of the politics out of the setting of the minimum wage.  I was very pleased with the high calibre of people appointed to the commission on an interim basis.  The commission was launched on 26 February and currently operates on an interim, non-statutory basis.  The enactment of the Bill will underpin its first recommendation of a new minimum wage by the middle of July.  </p> <p>I wish to address the concerns of Senator Mooney and others.  We decided, quite correctly, to engage the services of the Public Appointments Service to hold an open and transparent competition for members of the commission.  We can say with great certainty that the members who have been selected and have gone through that process have a lot of experience-----</p></speech>

People in trade unions and civil society have spent their entire working lives and, in some cases in voluntary capacities, representing the interests of working people.  In many cases, they represented the interests of working people at the margins and those working in sectors of the economy associated with low pay.  I can assure the House that not only will the commission sit behind desks, assiduously analysing detailed economic and statistical data, but it will also be obliged to engage on a face-to-face level with employers and people working in low paid sectors of the economy across the country to understand the lived experience of managing a business in a low paid sector of the economy and those associated with sectors of the economy that may be synonymous with low pay or difficult sectors.  It will engage at that level with people who are working, merely to exist on very low wages in those sectors.  It is important that it also considers the lived experience, and not just hard statistical data.  I have asked it to do so and it is clear from its <i>modus operandi</i>that is what it will do and what it has been doing over the past few weeks since the establishment of the commission on an interim basis.</p><p>The establishment of the commission is a very important Government commitment and is part of our dignity at work agenda.  I thank Senator White for her comments.  We are at one on that.  As I said, it complements the work being undertaken in a number of other areas, including the study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts, and I expect that report to be completed in the third quarter and delivered to me.  I look forward to considering its findings because in many ways it will be seen as a companion piece to this Bill.  </p><p>Where the evidence points to adjustments being required in legislation and regulations to enhance the protections already in place in employment law, we will bring those recommendations forward for consideration by the Government.  We will take action.  We always have to be aware of the need to balance fair pay with sustainable pay.  </p><p>I appreciate the concerns expressed by Members.  The Low Pay Commission is designed in such a way so as to make sure that we approach this entire project on an objective and evidence-based basis and try to balance the needs of SMEs that want to create quality jobs with the need to make sure that work always pays.  That is something that we can achieve and which has been achieved elsewhere, and I am confident that we can do that.</p><p>What we will not do is preside over an economic recovery which involves a ruthless race to the bottom.  We will not engage in a situation where anybody is expected to sacrifice the hard-won economic and social rights that have been achieved by each and every party represented in this House since the foundation of the State.  I make no apologies for saying that, as economic recovery takes hold and unemployment continues to fall, we expect to see the benefits of that recovery impacting on the lives of everyone across the country, regardless of the jobs people have or their aspirations.  </p><p>We want to see better working conditions for people and improved pay, particularly for low-paid workers.  The Low Pay Commission can assist in providing the institutional framework to ensure that happens.  The reality is that we are all winners, and society in general wins, when we move people out of poverty by providing decent jobs.  Of course, industry cannot prosper without consumers who are in a position to buy the products that industry produces and they have to be willing and able to pay for the goods and services that our business community provides.  </p><p>I want to put on the record of the House something I have said publicly time and again.  I want to see the national minimum wage increased progressively, where the economic circumstances and the demands of job creation and social conditions and requirements converge.  As I have said throughout the crisis, the Government has been committed to maintaining employment rights and protecting the most vulnerable of workers.  Where changes have been made they have been positive.  In fact, we are one of the few democracies across the developed world which, during and after the great recession, took the opportunity to enhance employment rights, legislation and regulation.  That is quite unique and stands to us as a society and State.</p><p>We re-established the joint labour committee system.  I am now in the process of bringing forward legislation in a matter of days to introduce enhanced collective bargaining rights in this country and re-establish a constitutionally robust registered employment agreement system which, as we all know, is of particular interest to workers in certain sectors of the economy and companies that are quite topical.  </p><p>We have clearly demonstrated our commitment to the well-being of lower paid workers, in terms of the suite of additional legislative protections we have or intend to introduce.  Having returned the economy to sustainable economic growth through the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, we want to make sure that the economic recovery is felt by everyone in our society.  It is clear that the Government is succeeding in turning around the economy and improving the lives of citizens.  I mentioned earlier that for the first time since 2008, unemployment is now less than 10%, at about 9.9%.  It will fall further and I expect and hope to see that we could get the level of unemployment down to about 9% or lower by the end of this year.  That would be a great credit to industry in the economy, society in general and some of the initiatives we have taken as a Government to make sure that we have a strong, sustainable and progressive economy.  </p><p>I will turn to issues raised by Members.  I thank Senator White for her well-informed remarks.  She comes at this from the perspective of a business owner and somebody who is concerned about the situation in which low-paid workers often find themselves.  I welcome her remarks.  </p><p>I take on board the remarks of Senator Mulcahy on how we need to be responsible in terms of any adjustments that may be made to the national minimum wage and be acutely aware of the needs of business and its ability to create good, decent, quality and sustainable jobs.  This is, fundamentally, what the Low Pay Commission is about, namely, having a balanced, evidence-based approach.  </p><p>Senator Cullinane made some remarks, many of which I do not intend to address in his absence.  However, I appreciate the concerns he raised about the SME sector.  SME owners are often, as I know from my previous experience, the last people to get paid in any organisation, if they get paid at all.  We need to be very conscious of that.  The number of part-time workers in the country is reducing quite radically, which might be a picture the Senator and his party are not prepared to accept because it does not necessarily fit in with his particular narrative of how our economy operates and progresses, and how we are constantly adding good full-time jobs to the economy.  </p><p>I will not take any lectures from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party about this Government's approach to the low-paid.  Many trade union officials who are based in the Republic of Ireland, but have a mandate for Northern Ireland as well, have said in recent weeks that Northern Ireland is a low-pay economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->No action whatsoever has been taken by Senator Cullinane's party in recent times to protect or further the interests of the low paid.  That compares very poorly with the record of this Government and many people in this House and in the other House in terms of their actual and real commitment to improving the lives of people who are merely existing on low pay.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Party has done nothing whatsoever in Northern Ireland to protect the interests of the low paid, other than make cynical statements, and used them as cheap electoral fodder.  In fact, the issue of low pay is quite pronounced in Northern Ireland and we have seen no action whatsoever from that Administration which has the Sinn F&eacute;in Party at its centre.  I take Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s words and those of his party with a very large pinch of salt.</p><p>Senator Craughwell contributed to the Bill.  There is an ambition in the Bill to adjust the national minimum wage incrementally upwards over time, but it is correct that it needs to be grounded in economic reality, and taking into account the challenge we have in terms of creating jobs and ensuring that we remain competitive, among other factors.  I am not someone who believes competitiveness is what it is all about.  I object to those who use competitiveness as the primary reason not to increase wages.  There is a very strong basis for those of us who believe that wages should be increased to continue to say it and to back it up with evidence in the future as we return to more normal economic activity and as the economic recovery beds down.</p><p>I have taken issue, and will continue to do so, with statements made by some representatives of business organisations who appear to be against the concept of a national minimum wage in the first place.  That is not representative of all such organisations.  People are entitled to their opinion.  I recall a conversation I had recently with a senior figure in the Confederation of British Industry who told me that when the Low Pay Commission was established in the late 1990s in the UK, the view of some of his member organisations was that the sky would fall down, that it would be terrible and competitiveness would be adversely affected.  In fact, one now finds that the business representative and the trade union representatives on the Low Pay Commission are extremely proprietorial about their membership of the commission and defend their independence from Government vehemently.  They have seen the benefits in terms of economic planning and business planning of frequent adjustments to the national minimum wage.  Such an approach allows businesses to plan properly and also allows the State to plan.  What we have is a situation where we will enshrine in law a date each year by which the Low Pay Commission will have to return its recommendation to the Minister of the day.  We specify 15 July and that will ensure the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection prepare their Estimates in advance of the budget that any adjustments made are done in such a way that they do not conflict with either the social welfare system or the tax system.</p><p>Senator Craughwell outlined his concern that the change might not impact in too positive a way in terms of people who are living in poverty and are surviving.  He stated that it is not a revolution.  It is not, but where we get strong, sustainable change is by reforming our institutions in this democracy.  That is what we are doing.  That is why I have said, time and again, that this is one of the most important initiatives taken by any Government in recent years.  The Government is serious about trying to address the systemic issues concerning low pay in this country, including intergenerational issues with low pay and poverty.  The best way to address the issue is by bringing the social partners and experts together to work with the Government to try to address all of the very complex issues involved in low pay.</p><p>It is wrong of Senator Cullinane to continue to trot out the nonsense that the Low Pay Commission is simply about revising, adjusting or examining the national minimum wage each year.  It is about much more than that.  We set up the Low Pay Commission on an interim basis in February and it takes time to address issues concerning a recommendation for the national minimum wage.  The organisation is in its infancy at the moment.  We are now setting it up on a statutory basis.  To a large extent, that is what this Bill is about.  It is certainly about much more than the national minimum wage.  We will ask the Low Pay Commission to do other work in the future to address areas about which we are all concerned and to advise the Government in an expert and evidence-based way about the best approaches to take right across the Government to ensure that work always pays, that people have dignity at work and that those in work do not rely on continual State support from the taxpayer.  Anybody who works hard for a living is entitled to a decent week&rsquo;s pay for a decent week&rsquo;s work.  I welcome the contributions from colleagues in the Seanad.  I look forward to their contributions at further stages of the legislative process.  The Bill is very legislation that can have a transformational impact on people who are currently living on low pay.  It will be an important institutional reform for vulnerable workers in society.</p></speech>

The provision of disability services is not just for the Department of Health.  Under the Disability Act, there is an onus on all Departments and public bodies to provide the same services to all citizens, including those with a disability.  This is a fundamental pillar of the national disability strategy.</p> <p>In 2015, funding of almost &euro;1.5 billion will be provided for health and personal social services.  To illustrate the range and complexity of services and supports which this entails, residential services will be provided by almost 60 agencies to around 9,000 people with disabilities at more than 1,200 locations, ranging from large congregated settings to community group homes to supported independent living.  Day services will be provided to around 22,000 people at 850 different locations by 80 organisations.  Approximately 1,400 young people who are due to leave school and rehabilitative training programmes in 2015 will receive new placements.  Respite residential support totalling 190,000 overnights will be provided.  The target for provision of personal assistance or home supports in 2015 is 3.9 million hours.  A variety of other services is also provided under the disability services programme, including respite, early childhood-family support, community based medical, nursing and therapy services, rehabilitative training, aids and appliances.</p> <p>Our focus in 2015 is to bring about reforms that will positively impact on the way in which people with disabilities are supported to live the lives of their choice.  This process of reform is being guided by the value for money and policy review of disability services, or the VFM as I will refer to it from hereon in.  The title is off putting and I was not responsible for it but the purpose of the VFM review is to transform our disability services and make them fit for purpose.  This transformation will entail migration from a group-based and often segregated approach towards a model of person-centred and individually chosen community-based supports.  This approach will be underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.  Supporting people with disabilities to live a fully inclusive life is fundamental to this transformation programme.</p> <p>I wish to outline how disability services are supporting people from childhood onwards.  The HSE's national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people, zero to 18 years, aims to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school the child attends or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Implementation of the progressing disability services programme is taking place on a phased basis in consultation with stakeholders, including service users and their families.  It is a key priority for the executive's social care directorate in 2015.  Some &euro;4 million was specifically allocated in 2014 to drive the programme forward, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4 million has been allocated from 1 May this year to assist in implementing the programme in 2015, at a full year cost of &euro;6 million.  At 30 April 2015, 47 of the 2014 posts have been filled and a further 20 to 22 are at the stage of "post accepted" and the recruitment process is ongoing for the remaining ten to 12 posts.  I am pleased to report that there has been a significant investment of additional resources into the health sector's primary care services in the past few years.  Additional funding of &euro;20 million was allocated in 2013 to strengthen the services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care posts.  I am confident that the additional resources being invested in primary and disability services will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services to all children with disabilities, including those who may currently be on waiting lists to access therapy inputs.</p> <p>This brings me to the matter of health funded supports for young people after they leave school.  Every year, young people finish their second level education and progress to the next stage in their lives.  For most, the hope is that they will progress directly to further education, vocational training or employment.  However, young people who have more complex support needs will initially rely on life-skills training or day supports provided by the HSE.  After completing a life-skills training programme many young people in this cohort will in time also progress to mainstream training and employment, with personal social supports provided by the HSE where required, while others will continue to require more intensive day supports.  This year the HSE has allocated an additional &euro;6 million at a full year cost of &euro;12 million to provide training places and day services for this group.  The provision of services to more than 1,000 young people and almost 500 life-skills graduates has in recent years posed a challenge to the HSE. Last year, thanks to a more streamlined approach by the HSE, almost 1,400 young people with disabilities who finished school or life-skills training received placements which fully met their needs.  This is a remarkable achievement by all involved and a considerable improvement on the position in previous years.  The HSE is building on last year's efforts and I am pleased to say that the HSE has informed me that it is on schedule to meet the day support needs of all young people with disabilities who are due to leave school or graduate from a life-skills programme in the coming weeks.  Young people and their families will be notified by the end of June at the latest of the placement that will be available to them from September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> One of the most significant projects being progressed by the HSE this year is the implementation of the person-centred approach to day services outlined in New Directions - Report on the National Working Group for the Review of HSE funded Adult Day Services.  Service providers are actively engaged in delivering services with a more person-centred focus, person-centred planning is widely implemented, and a considerable quantum of service delivery is now community based.</p><p>There are now many excellent examples of progress in services in a more individualised and person-centred way.  I have been very encouraged over the past two or three years to see the number of organisations and service users around the country that are immersing themselves wholeheartedly in the transformation programme.  Many organisations are actively engaged in demonstration projects and are taking practical steps to support people with disabilities in the community and to explore new and innovative ways to do so.  Organisations are also co-operating to share their experiences and provide mutual support.  An example of this is the Next Steps Project which is a network of shared learning and support that has been set up by the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies which provides services to people with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>I am very pleased to tell Senators that the Next Steps Project received an international Zero Project innovative practices award earlier this year at the UN Headquarters in Vienna.  Tomorrow, the federation will award all self-advocates and participating organisations with a certificate from the Zero Project at a special event.  This will mark the hard work of each person who has participated in the project and each organisation that is working towards supporting people in living lives of their choosing.  I want to take this opportunity to commend the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the project participants on this remarkable achievement.</p><p>An important element of supporting people with a disability to live in the community is housing.  In July 2012, the national implementation framework was launched to support the Government's National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability 2011-2016 in continuation of the successful collaborative approach employed between the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>The implementation framework reflects the recommendations of the Government's mental health policy, A Vision for Change, and its disability policy entitled, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion, in regard to the phased movement, over seven years, of almost 5,000 people with intellectual, physical and mental health disabilities from institutions to community living.  Time to Move on from Congregated Settings, which was published in 2011, proposes a new model of support in the community, is moving people from congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy.  The report identifies that around 4,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, which is a figure based on the 2008 census, live in congregated settings that are defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  At the end of 2014, this number had reduced to around 3,000.  The HSE is planning for the transitioning of a further 150 people from congregated settings in 2015.  I am aware that this poses significant challenges to many stakeholders, including clients, families, disability service providers, the HSE, various Departments and statutory bodies, and representative organisations.  I am also aware that it will require a need for a major change programme.  However, I have asked the HSE to ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings will be based on each individual's person-centred plan.</p><p>This Government is very committed to the protection and safety of our most vulnerable citizens.  It placed regulation and inspection of residential disability centres on a statutory footing in November 2013.  Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  Our aim must always be to ensure that people with a disability maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.  They and their families trust us to care for them with kindness and compassion.</p><p>Compliance with HIQA standards for disability residential centres is a requirement under the service level arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers.  Over 66% of designated centres for people with a disability were inspected by HIQA by the end of the quarter one of 2015, including inspections targeted by allegations of mistreatment.  The lessons learned from them are continuing to improve the quality of services.  Clients and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities for people with a disability.</p><p>I am aware that HIQA has reported evidence of good practice, in the delivery of many residential services, to people with disabilities where the support and care needs of residents have been prioritised and there is a strong focus on the needs of service providers.  I am also aware that the Department of Health has requested the HSE to develop action plans to address cases where HIQA has raised serious concerns regarding the level of care that people with a disability are receiving in a number of disability centres, including safeguarding the human rights of residents.</p><p>HIQA's findings can make for difficult reading.  However, they serve as evidence that the regulatory process works effectively and in the interests of protecting vulnerable people in the care of the State.  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  Much work remains to be carried out to ensure that all facilities comply with the disability residential standards.  While this is challenging for the HSE we must remember that the objective is to safeguard vulnerable people.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to put on record the Government's position on services for people with disabilities.  There is an onus on us all to use the substantial resources committed to disability services throughout the public sector more effectively and efficiently.  We must also achieve better outcomes for this funding and bring about a real and substantial improvement in the lives of people with disabilities.  This is a central tenet of the national disability strategy and a high priority for the Government, one to which I remain firmly committed.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Members for giving me this opportunity.</p></speech>

I am glad to see the Minister of State here again today.  She is certainly a regular visitor to the Seanad.</p> <p>We recognise, as I am sure everyone does, the fact that 18.5% of the population has some level of disability.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always, and one can say the same for most parties, demonstrated a strong commitment to provide support and services to ensure that people with a disability, either physical or intellectual, fulfil all opportunities that arise.  Disability is not just about the health services.  The Minister of State spoke about housing which involves the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Disability is a social justice priority for us and certainly for me.  Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that the strategy must be sustained and implemented.</p> <p>I support HIQA completely.  It does fantastic work but the way it, the Department of Health and the HSE seemed to have a bit of a go at each other in regard to the Portlaoise case was worrying.  I have a very close family member who works in the intellectual disability services and obviously supports HIQA and wants to provide the best possible service.  However, it is the case that staff in the services find the onset of a HIQA inspection extremely stressful.  That should not be the case, although I do not know what HIQA can do to change that.  Rushing around in the weeks leading up to a HIQA inspection to ensure everything is in order creates a worse environment.  Although there are some exceptions, in general, everything is in order and people do a very good job but I suppose HIQA is trying to ensure that is the case.  Perhaps being apprehensive beforehand is the nature of inspections, whether school or HIQA inspections.  Could HIQA hold briefing sessions with staff members, through the unions, which people could attend to get more information about the process?  It would reduce the strain and reassure the vast majority of staff that their work is good in that they show respect and care for the dignity of the people they look after, which is the most important thing.  One must remember one is dealing with a fellow and equal human being and that person, regardless of his or her disability, deserves absolute dignity and respect in the service.  If one remembers that, then one will not go far wrong and that is something about which I would be keen to ensure.</p> <p>Recently, I came across an issue, namely, the anonymity of HIQA reports on intellectual disability services and I do not know what the policy justification is for that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That anonymity means one cannot discover the identity of any particular facility that is inspected.  I understand this is a policy decision which might have to do with the privacy and dignity of residents.  At least two facilities in my area were closed during the year.  I know their names and where they are located, but their closure was not publicised.  It would be useful to have information on which services are being closed.  In the two cases to which I referred, they were very small units in a particular local authority housing estate.  They were closed either before or after a HIQA inspection and we would like to know the reasons for that, what failings were identified and if there are similar failings in other facilities that have not been subject to the prospect of HIQA inspection.</p><p>The Minister of State may recall that I raised a matter on the Commencement debate some time ago concerning the HSE's absolutely appalling treatment of an individual.  This person's GP had diagnosed him as having an intellectual disability but the HSE denied this was the case.  There is sometimes a need to ease up on the bureaucracy and take a slightly more caring approach.  We found in this case that the HSE staff member who was dealing directly with the individual was extremely caring and helpful, even perhaps too much so.  That member of staff went beyond the call of duty, which might not be the best thing to do in a professional context.  However, these things happen and, certainly in that case, everything was done out of concern for the individual in question.</p><p>There are problems with intellectual disability services, and waiting lists remain too high for a range of services.  There is a substantial level of unmet need in respect of several types of supports.  The Health Research Board has pointed to the growing waiting list for personal assistant and home help hours and indicated that there are more than 1,000 people with disabilities waiting to access physiotherapy, nearly 700 awaiting occupational therapy services, and 366 on a list for speech and language therapy.  The same difficulties are arising for people without disabilities, of course, but such delays are particularly difficult for those with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, because they may not be able to communicate their frustration and may require family advocates to act on their behalf.</p><p>People with disabilities are continuing to bear the brunt of the significant deficit in service provision, particularly when it comes to community services and supporting individuals to remain in their own community.  There must be an objective of supporting people to live independently where possible, free from discrimination and able to enjoy the fundamental rights set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In order to achieve this objective, the Government must ensure no further undue hardship is imposed on people with disabilities through the reduction of service provision in communities.</p><p>The &Aacute;ras Attracta scandal brought home to every person in this country the vulnerability of people with intellectual disabilities.  It must lead to a sea change in how we treat people and the culture that prevails in those facilities which take care of them.  In this instance, it seems there were fundamental breaches of codes, regulations, standards and human rights.  Indeed, the CEO of HIQA, Mr. Phelim Quinn, said it involved fundamental breaches of the human rights and dignity of individuals.  We must never view people with intellectual disabilities as objects but rather as fellow human beings who, although they require care, have the same capacity to love and give as anybody else.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the move away from congregated care settings, which is welcome.  There is an urgent need to implement the recommendations of the report to which she referred in order to ensure such facilities are closed and people are placed in more dignified settings.  The best situation is where there is a small number of residents, the facility is like a home rather than an institution and the care that is provided is person-centred.</p><p>My final point is slightly off topic, although still related to disability services.  Preschool special needs assistants are provided by the HSE in County Meath to children with special needs, many of whom have intellectual disabilities.  Despite being assured there would be no reduction in this service, parents have now been told there is to be a 25% cut in the hours provided.  We understand there is no major increase in the number of children coming through the ranks for next year.  What seems to have happened is that the HSE has decided the budget will be the same as it was last year but it will not allow any overrun.  That is apparently where the cut is coming in, the concern being to adhere to budgets.  In practice, however, it means a reduction from 6.5 hours to 4.5 hours for the children concerned.  That is absolutely appalling and I plead with the Minister of State to address it.</p></speech>

This is a very serious issue and the reduction in the service has only come to light in the past week.  The way the HSE has dealt with the parents concerned is dreadful.  These are very vulnerable families who badly need this care in order to ensure their children can attend preschool.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#Y00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for her commitment and dedication in this area.  It is worth reiterating the figures she outlined in her statement.  People often talk about taxation, but it is important to consider the purposes for which taxation moneys are used.  As the Minister of State indicated, &euro;1.5 billion is being spent in this area in 2015.  This will enable the provision of a very valuable service right across the board, involving 9,000 residential services, more than 22,000 people availing of day services and 190,000 overnight respite stays.  Some 3.9 million hours of personal assistant home support are being provided.  We tend to focus in these discussions on the areas in which something has gone wrong, which is only natural, but we should also focus on the dedication and commitment of the people working in this area.  They are extremely committed, dedicated and hard working and they provide an excellent service.  It is important, too, to recognise the work parents do in supporting the services that are provided, whether by raising additional funding or in other ways.  In Cork, for instance, the Cope Foundation provides assistance to more than 1,200 people and is supported in its work by the parents who depend upon that service.</p> <p>An area that is not under the Minister of State's remit but about which I have serious concern is the lack of co-operation with local authorities in the delivery of services.  In fairness, health service staff are very committed and working very hard, as are organisations like the Cope Foundation and local community nurses.  However, the lack of connection between the HSE and local authorities is an ongoing issue, particularly in Cork city and county.  I have been aware of what is happening in Cork for some time but was shocked in recent days to see a comparison between the situation in Cork city and in Louth.  If a local authority tenant in Cork city wishes to undertake adaptation work, he or she will be waiting for six and a half to seven years.  In Louth, on the other hand, such a tenant will receive approval within three months, as I understand it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is something radically wrong in that.  I am aware it does come under the Minister of State's remit but what it does come under her remit is the co-ordination of services.  In her opening statement she said:<blockquote><br /><br />The provision of disability services is not just for the Department of Health.  Under the Disability Act, there is an onus on all Departments and public bodies to provide the same services to all citizens, including those with a disability.  This is a fundamental pillar of the national disability strategy.</blockquote>That is not happening in the area I am talking about, for two families in particular.  I am aware of 35 to 40 cases also on the books which have been waiting for six and a half years.  The children in the two families have intellectual and physical disabilities.  The families are providing full support to these children but a State service is not provided in terms of housing.  They are living in local authorities houses which are not adapted.  Something must be done in this area.  I have referred the two cases to the Ombudsman because these people are not getting the supports they deserve.<br/><br/>I wish to raise the role of access officers in local authorities.  The Disability Act provides that an access officer should be in place in each local authority area.  However, there appears to be a misunderstanding in local authorities on this issue.  I have been in contact with a number of local authorities as regards the role of the access officer.  There is a huge variation on how the role of the access officer is interpreted.  In one local authority I was informed that the only role of the access officer is in regard to access to public buildings.  I have information outlining the workload of the access officer in the past 12 months and it clearly relates to local authority buildings whereas other local authorities are fully implementing what was intended by the Disability Act for the role of the access officers.  I have spoken to the National Disability Authority which has agreed to write to each local authority on this matter.  While we have appointed people to the role we appear to have a lack of understanding on what is their role.  The role is not only about access to public buildings, it is also about access to services for people with disabilities and access to local authority housing to ensure the necessary work required to cater those with a disability is carried out so that they have adequate facilities within that local authority house.  There is a serious issue here.<br/><br/>The other issue that concerns me is people with disabilities and local authorities.  In fairness to the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, gave a detailed reply here on the issue I had raised.  In some local authorities, one person is not in charge of dealing with local authority tenants who have a disability and one has to go from housing to finance to architects and engineers.  Recently, I spent an hour on the telephone dealing with one case, going from one department to another but not getting any clear answer about who was responsible.  I have raised the issue with the local authority in the past two weeks.  I want one person in each local authority to take charge of each of these files so that when families telephone the local authority, they can get an answer about how their file is being progressed.  In many cases, families have thrown in the towel.  Given that it took me an hour to find out where the file was, what is it like for people who have a disability or whose children have a disability and they are trying to access the services?  The Minister of State is doing a very good job in her Department as is the HSE but there is that lack of co-ordination.  I spoke to the COPE Foundation in Cork which is involved with these families.  Every time it telephones the local authority, the attitude is that this is just another number on the list waiting for money from Dublin, whereas all the other local authorities with whom I have discussed the issue, do not appear to have the same problem.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure this matter is dealt with in a constructive and co-ordinated way in order that no family has to wait six and a half to seven years to get work done.  I ask that this happens following the debate here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#Z00200"><p>As always the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is very welcome to the House.  The area of intellectual disability is not one in which I confess to have specific expertise.  In preparation for the debate I have done some reading and have spoken to individuals and groups.  I came across a very interesting contribution by Joe Wolfe to <i>Frontline , </i>the Irish voice of intellectual disability on health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities.  I found much of what I read disturbing.  For example, in general, people with intellectual disabilities are more likely to have poor health than their non-disabled peers and people with an intellectual disability are more likely to die from causes that could potentially be ameliorated by good quality health care.  There is a multitude of factors at play in the overall health inequality which is recognised internationally and, no doubt, exists in Ireland.  There is difficulty in accessing appropriate health services, difficulty in accessing inadequate or non-existent health screening.  Research shows that access to timely and appropriate health checks is effective in picking up previously undetected conditions such as cancer, heart disease and dementia.  There are communication difficulties and reduced health literacy and there is a lack of awareness of, and inadequate education and training in, attitudes towards intellectual disabilities among some mainstream health care professionals.</p><p>I am particularly alarmed at the outcome of the UK 2013 Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities, following the deaths of six people with intellectual disabilities while in the care of the NHS.  The CIPOLD report, which studied all known deaths of 247 people with learning disabilities in a population area of 1.7 million people in south west England, found that men with an intellectual disability died on average 13 years younger than men without an intellectual disability and women with a intellectual disability died on average, 20 years younger than those without an intellectual disability.  Significantly, the study found that the most common reasons for these deaths were delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment and problems with identifying needs and non-provision of appropriate care in response to changing needs.  Record keeping was also found to be more deficient for the group of people with intellectual disabilities, particularly in regard to fluid intake, nutrition, weight and seizures.  Worryingly, the report concluded that 17% of those with intellectual disabilities studied were under weight compared to 2% of the general population.  I fear that the situation would differ little in Ireland if the subject received the same level of scrutiny.  We should act as if the findings were our own findings.</p><p>Some 8,098 people with intellectual disabilities lived in residential services in Ireland in 2012, not to mention the many people in day services and almost 20,000 living at home with parents, siblings, relatives or foster parents who require extensive support in regard to their health and well-being. </p><p>We need to be proactive rather than reactive.  For example, we need to educate people with intellectual disabilities, where possible, on how to access health services and on the importance of health and well-being.  We need to develop health education, health promotion and wellness programmes.  We need to ensure that all people with intellectual disability receive an annual health check and health screening.  We need to ensure that older people have access to regular eye sight tests.  The Growing Older with an Intellectual Disability in Ireland study by McCarron <i>et al </i>found that people with an intellectual disability are twice as likely to have significant visual problems and at a much younger age than the general population.  However, people with an intellectual disability and, in particular, those with a severe to profound level of intellectual disability, are far less likely to have their eye sight tested.  </p><p><i></i>We need to create an up to date hospital passport that can help health care professionals understand the communication and health care needs of people going into hospital or accessing other health care services.  These should be updated every six months.  There is a need to increase the focus on nutrition and healthy diet, as the UK  study has shown.</p><p>The Minister of State raised the issue of congregated settings.  I agree that too many adults with intellectual disabilities remain accommodated in large institutional congregated settings.  The Time to Move on from Congregated Settings report, published in 2011, gave a seven-year timeframe for the closure of these settings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am concerned about the current rate of transition of persons from congregated settings.  I was told the figure was 100 a year but the Minister of State has told us it is 150, which I welcome.  By my calculations, it will not take seven years but rather it will be 2050 before the last person moves.  People with disabilities have a right not to be forced to live in unsuitable accommodation and they need to have a greater choice of where they live and with whom.  </p><p>I would like to address the issue of children with intellectual disabilities.  In their case, the services most commonly availed of are speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychology.  In September 2014, Inclusion Ireland published The Case of Speech and Language Therapy, which noted the lack of functioning national therapy services and how access to therapy depends on where a child lives in Ireland.  We have seen more of that recently.  The provision of 200 therapist posts in the past two budgets was very welcome but thousands of children with intellectual disabilities are waiting years for access to therapy services, which impedes their full development.  </p><p>Last Thursday, 21 May, the Laois Offaly Families for Autism published a report, The Current State of HSE Autism Services in Laois Offaly, which highlighted poorly planned, disjointed and limited provision of therapy services in the area.  This group protested outside the offices of the disability services in Tullamore to voice its concerns over the quality of services being provided to children with autism.  The report it produced is based on direct experiences of families in the area and details the full extend of the neglect of children by disability services.  I would recommend that the Minister of State reads it.  I would love to believe the problems only exist in the Laois-Offaly area, but I have heard, anecdotally, the same from around the country.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the report.  We could do more.  I welcome our focused debate on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#AA00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  She is very welcome and is a regular visitor.  I would also like to thank the Leader, Senator Cummins, because this is a debate for which I have asked for several months.  I am delighted that we have the opportunity to discuss this.  There are many areas that need to be addressed when we speak about services for people with intellectual disabilities, many of whom were mentioned by my colleagues.  Every time we have a debate, something else comes up.  I would like to use the time we have to stress the importance of providing proper and adequate supports for people with an intellectual disability.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Government's current funding of &euro;1.5 billion to the disability services programme, through the HSE's national service plan for 2015.  I welcome the money allocated.  My colleague read out a list of the numbers of people who benefit from it, but when one considers the numbers and the amount of funding, one finds we still have a long way to go.  I recognise that the Minister of State listens and puts in the effort, but we need to keep pushing on this issue.</p> <p>According to the last census in 2011, more than 500,000 people had a disability, including physical and intellectual.  More than 57,000 people suffered from an intellectual disability and difficulties with learning, remembering or concentrating were experienced by a further 137,000 people.  Some 96,000 people had a psychological or emotional condition.  All of those people come under the category of needing extra supports.  </p> <p>I refer to residential respite support.  There were 190,000 overnights, which is great, but one when considers how many people are trying to access it, it is a drop in the ocean.  I do not mean that disrespectfully but rather that we need to keep pushing the issue.  I would like to address the issue of respite care for people with intellectual disabilities in my area, and I will not apologise for it.  It was one of the reasons I asked for this debate.  I thank the Minister of State for accepting my invitation to come to Dundalk last week and for taking the time to visit various centres for people with disabilities in the area.  She met and spent a lot of time with people, service providers and service users - a term I hate.  She listened to them very intently.  </p> <p>One of the places we visited was the Maria Goretti respite centre in Lordship.  The Minister of State was very impressed, as she was with all of the places she visited.  The centre is very impressive.  The facilities and the work of the staff and the board which run it are excellent.  The respite centre caters for children aged under 18 with an intellectual disability and is a model for respite centres throughout the country.  However, as was explained to the Minister of State, before the centre opened last year there was no respite centre for children under 18 years of age in the Louth area, and only a tiny number of children received respite care from our neighbours in Meath.  Those who were under the care of St. John of God had access to some care.</p> <p>I welcome the direction in which we are going.  It will not matter where a child lives or to what school he or she goes; he or she will be able to access care.  It is a problem I have come up against.  The respite centre I mentioned is only up and running thanks to the dedication, financial support and forward vision of one family in the area.  They deserve credit for their work in the community as do the HSE, which funded the centre, and RehabCare, which manages it.  </p> <p>There are reports on progress in facilities, but the proof of the success is when one hears from the people directly involved.  The Minister of State heard from parents during her visit last week how vital respite services are to get a night's sleep, give time to other members of a family or simply have time, as one mother said, to have a cup of tea in peace.  At the moment, the respite service is not being used to its full capacity.  I again ask that priority in funding be allocated when budget funding is being discussed for centres like the Maria Goretti centre in Lordship so that they can be used to their full potential.  It is too good a service not to be in place and I would love to see it rolled out all over the country.</p> <p>That brings me to the subject of adult respite.  Again, I am speaking based on my experiences.  I am the secretary of Dundalk Parents and Friends of the Intellectually Disabled.  The other night I wrote up notes from a recent meeting and came across minutes from a meeting held in 1994 - the previous secretary held fantastic minutes.  The minutes recorded an urgent need for a respite house for adults in County Louth.  When I read the minutes from our last meeting in 2015, I found not a whole lot had changed in Louth.  </p> <p>Recently, as I made the Minister of State aware, the local St. John of God respite centre closed its doors for five weeks to provide upskilling and training.  One of my colleagues mentioned HIQA inspections and preparation for them.  Rumours abounded about whether it had been in.  For whatever reason, the decision to close the centre was made very suddenly and parents and family members were devastated.  I was inundated with questions.  The closure affected only 58 people, but they were decimated by the news.  Rumours circulated about whether it would reopen.  </p> <p>I have received confirmation that it will reopen next week, but I am very disappointed that the CEO of St. John of God in the country declined to meet me about the matter on several occasions.  When I contacted the local HSE office, it made no comment on the matter.  It is not good enough.  If the HSE funds services, we need to have transparency, to know what is happening and whether services can decide suddenly to close for five weeks with nobody taking responsibility.  When we ask questions and issues are brought to its attention, we deserve answers.</p> <p>We are now approaching summer and children will be out of care for some months.  Summer camps for special needs children are a vital part of their summer.  It is something that needs to be addressed to ensure that all children can have access to them.  Summer provision depends on a diagnosis.  Summer camps are not very expensive to run and are beneficial for children.  Some children will sit for three months with nothing to do.  </p> <p>I refer to psychological services, an issue which I have raised before.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Moran:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2388"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2388&amp;amp;pid=MaryMoran&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People with an intellectual disability are seriously lacking this service.  I have constantly brought up the lack of a psychiatrist for children in my own area of County Louth.  The situation is replicated all over the country.  I recently had a meeting with HSE officials to discuss the filling of the position, and they say they have got to the second round, they can offer the post but they just cannot get the person.  Is it a salary issue, as has been reported?  Why can we not bring people in?  As a teacher, I had pupils who did psychology, psychiatry and occupational therapy and are now working abroad.  Why can we not hold onto them?  Let us get them back by making the package more enticing.  It has to be remembered that people with an intellectual disability have a rate of mental illness that is approximately five times higher than among the general population. </p><p>We have mentioned speech and language services for children as well as occupational therapy, and these services are seriously lacking.  Can we do something to help? Can we take a cross-departmental look at some areas?  I am doing a study at the moment of the role of special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools.  I am not saying they could in any way replace occupational therapists, but could they be doing something that would help?</p></speech>

I would like to talk for a moment about confidence.  The danger is that people lose confidence.  Although I would not say it can be regained easily, it is possible to do so.  I had 75 employees in my company when I stepped down who were intellectually disabled.  We did not use that term; the term "otherwise enabled" is better.  I remember talking to one woman whose son had been working with us for a year collecting the trolleys in to the supermarket.  She said she thought he was worthy and capable of far more.  We brought him into the shop, he was given responsibility and duties, and he blossomed and grew.  We can talk ourselves into believing that somebody who is intellectually disabled is not capable of doing anything, yet this young man came in and became quite a success story.  Those who worked with him in that department grew with him as well.  They and his customers felt pride in him.  It is often possible to have a win-win situation.</p> <p>One other young man was a trolley host, as we called the role.  I watched him at the entrance to the supermarket and, as he got the trolley ready for the first customer coming through, he said, "Oh, there is a cabbage leaf in it."  He took the cabbage leaf out and said to the customer, "I want to make sure you have a clean trolley."  What did he do with the cabbage leaf?  He put it in the next trolley, and so the next customer came and the same thing happened again.  I asked him what he was doing and he said they really appreciated him, but that if he just gave them a clean trolley they would not have appreciated it.  He was using a different sort of intelligence, one that was really working.  I undertook his job for a few minutes and did the same thing.  I am told he would use a cabbage leaf on a Monday, a Tayto crisp packet on a Tuesday, something else on a Wednesday and so on.  Customers knew that this young man was doing something for them.  Although one could well say he was gulling the customer to a certain extent, it was those little stories that worked.  I mention this because it shows that those who work with people with a disability feel pride, as do the customers.</p> <p>One of the big jobs we have is to convince people that it is possible to do something different.  Another position I was fortunate to have for a few years was president of the Irish Association of Supported Employment, IASE.  They organise a job shadowing day every year and people come to Leinster House.  The Taoiseach usually makes a bit of an occasion for them.  A lot of good work is being done by people in supported employment, as they are backing up things that would not otherwise have taken place.  The participants explore the world of work by shadowing someone as they go about their normal working routine.  The IASE points out that the day is an opportunity for employers to promote and encourage an inclusive workplace, and that it can allow employees to demonstrate their commitment to equal employment opportunities.  An organisation called Kanchi, which used to be known as the Aisling Foundation, gives awards to employers who have found a way to lift people from that area in the past.</p> <p>While I am not speaking directly about the tasks the Minister of State has, which she is accomplishing very well, we all have to convince the general public, parents and employers that people with a disability have really got a different ability.  If we can only trace and track that ability we can have a huge success.  It was great to hear what the Minister of State is doing.  There is a lot more to be done and I know it will be done.  With the Minister of State at the helm, the encouragement and enthusiasm is there and it can succeed.  Let us make sure that, rather than talking people down, we talk them up and give them the confidence.</p></speech>

To be fair, she gets out to see services in operation on the ground.  I have no doubt she spent the whole day in Dundalk, as that is how she operates.  She wants to engage with people and get an understanding, which is one way of ensuring that the job is done and people's needs are reflected.</p> <p>The Minister of State took over at a very difficult time.  Although billions were spent on disability in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the money was completely wasted on exorbitant salaries for chief executives of the various NGOs that were providing support services.  One executive was on the bones of &euro;500,000, as we all know, although we will not mention any names.  While that case hit the headlines, there were numerous other people on significant six-figure sums.  One organisation had a chief executive in every county, which was bizarre and totally unacceptable.  To be fair to the Minister of State's predecessor, John Moloney, for whom I have huge respect, he tried to deal with it by setting up the value for money audit.  That overlapped with Deputy Lynch's period in office and made significant recommendations.  While it was not a direct recommendation, the People with Disabilities in Ireland, PWDI, organisation came out of this process.  I have mentioned this organisation in the Seanad and it nominated me as a candidate for the House.  However, 98% of the &euro;1.5 million that PWDI was getting was going on salaries and expenses and doing very little to assist people with disabilities.  That was the backdrop when the downturn in the economy came.</p> <p>The respite care grant should never have been cut, irrespective of the situation in which we found ourselves.</p></speech>

As I only have a few minutes, I cannot cover all of the aspects in as much detail as I would like, but I wish to discuss respite care.  The one thing that the State can do is give families dignity and quality of life.  From personal experience and having spoken to many people, the families of people who happen to have intellectual disabilities of varying degrees treasure respite care because it gives them quality time and the opportunity to recharge their batteries and provide better care to their family members.  The Government has improved respite care but, as my colleague stated, it is only a drop in the ocean.  We must focus.</p> <p>We could all discuss the various services that are provided in our counties.  In my county of Clare, those who provide respite support include RehabCare and the Brothers of Charity.  There are 42 steps in the process of teaching a service user how to make a cup of tea, for example, including health and safety, taking down the cup, putting in the tea bag and boiling the kettle.  The 42 steps must be done properly so that the person can have the independence of making a cup of tea.  This is a level of detail that money cannot buy.  People provide this service.</p> <p>Senator Byrne made a very good point.  The Health Information and Quality Authority should not frighten the whatever out of people when it calls to carry out inspections.  People should be made to feel like HIQA is a friend or advocate that supports and assists them.  They should not be afraid and stressed out when HIQA arrives.</p> <p>There is a major amount of work to be done.  In six months' time, perhaps the Minister of State will update the House.  Large bodies move slowly and incrementally, but with the right dedication and given the volunteers and staff in the services and the commitment in society, much can be achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#CC00900"><p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  She has been here a great deal in recent months dealing with a range of issues relating to mental health services and people with intellectual and physical disabilities.  She should be commended on taking them seriously.  It is a credit to her.  If we had more Ministers who spent as much time debating these issues in the Chamber, it would be good for the Seanad.</p> <p>Yesterday, I raised a Commencement motion on a somewhat related issue, that being, children with physical and intellectual disabilities.  We discussed children waiting for assessments and diagnoses.  I forwarded an e-mail to the Minister of State yesterday, but a few more came through today.  In fact, an e-mail came through just two minutes ago from the parent of a young child with autism but who has not been diagnosed yet.  It is the opinion of their general practitioner, GP, that the child has autism, but he has been on a waiting list since last August.  The family cannot access proper services until a diagnosis has been made.  I will forward the details to the Minister of State.  These problems are distressing for families, who want assessments and diagnoses to happen as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State gave a positive indication about resources yesterday, but I wanted to remind her of this issue.</p> <p>Our vision must be of a society in which all citizens, including those with disabling conditions, can take a full part in all aspects of independent life, including the workplace, relying as far as possible on mainstream services to help them to reach their full potential but with the support of other services where necessary.  We must not forget that 565,000 people reported having various forms of disability in the last census.  Disability is, therefore, a societal issue affecting people of all ages and their families directly and indirectly.  Some of the key trends spanning the 1996-2013 reports have been identified in recent national intellectual disability database, NIDD, reports.  Increasing numbers of people are living full-time in community group homes as opposed to residential homes.  We must move the focus from congregated settings to the community and from smaller settings to full integration.  In 2013, some 98.7% of those registered on the NIDD were in receipt of services, 29.2% were in full-time residential services and 67% lived at home.  There has been positive changes in recent times.  The Minister of State has been a driver in that regard.  I support her, but she would accept that we have much work left to do and must continue on this path.</p> <p>The number of people with intellectual disabilities who are in psychiatric hospitals is reducing.  This is welcome, but that anyone with an intellectual disability is in such a facility is an indictment of the planning that was done by several Governments over many years.  There has been an increased focused on residential supports, which allow people to live at home.  As we know, however, home help hours have been cut and home adaptation grants are increasingly difficult to acquire.  A Senator mentioned this matter.  It is an issue that breaks my heart.  A family might approach one of us because a house needs to be adapted.  I am unsure as to whether other local authorities differ, but when people apply for the grant in Waterford city and county, they are classed as priority 1, 2 or 3.  If they are not classed as priority 1, they have no chance of getting anything done.</p></speech>

If it is classed as priority 2 or 3, though, it will never be done.  Even applications classed as priority 1 do not get done and must wait on lists.  The money is not there.  People blame local authorities, but the latter depend on grants from central government.  This issue needs to be examined.</p> <p>An increasing number of children are in mainstream schools, but if there are inadequate numbers of resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, this stops being a policy that is beneficial to all.  Early intervention is important.  I mentioned a facility on Lady Lane in Waterford city called the Sacred Heart Centre.  It provides fantastic supports to people with a range of complex needs from mild to severe physical and intellectual disabilities.  I visited it a number of weeks ago.  It was uplifting to see the children receive the support that they required, but the building was in a poor state.  The centre does not have the necessary equipment.  It is a joint venture between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE.  Although the staff provide a great service, a state-of-the-art, LauraLynn-type facility is required in Waterford to give these children the supports that they need.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work that the Minister of State has done, but more needs to be done.  Ahead of the next election, I hope that all parties can commit to doing more to support children and adults with disabilities of whatever description.  We should not use this issue as a political football.  Surely, we should all be united on it.  That more money needs to be given to these services is one of the few areas on which we can all agree, as these people need it.</p></speech>

She has a passion for this issue and is working hard.  I welcome the Government's commitment to providing services for people with disabilities.  In particular, I welcome the &euro;1.5 billion and the movement of people out of congregated settings.  However, we are not here to pat ourselves on the back.  We are here to highlight deficiencies in the system and how things could be done better.</p> <p>My next point is not the Minister of State's remit, but it relates to people with disabilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I raise it because it is in my area of expertise which is social welfare and the difficulties people have accessing funding.  The amount of work people have to do to access payments from social welfare for people with disabilities, in particular the domiciliary care allowance, is incredible.  I have often sent in appeals before it is awarded.  Only yesterday a doctor told a person in my area that the disability allowance has become political.  He said the letters the medic writes no longer suffice in the Department of Social Protection.  It wants more and more information.  People are worn out trying to access these allowances.  They are not applying for the fun of it but because they have, or someone else in the house has, a disability.  Likewise regarding the carer&rsquo;s allowance, it is getting harder to satisfy the medics in the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>People should be aware that employers can avail of the wage subsidy scheme if they employ people with disabilities.  Many are not aware of that and maybe should be made aware of it.  It may be our fault that we do not make people aware of it.  The employability services are on offer to people with disabilities to help them find jobs.  All these services should be highlighted.</p><p>I am very disappointed that the Department of Health did not provide any funding for the Scheme to Support National Organisations, SSNO.  It is a disgrace.  One can argue all one likes that it is in a community setting but it should have something to do with the Department of Health.  The Minister of State said it has nothing to do with the Department but that is not true.  This funding is for organisations providing services and support to people with disabilities to live in their own communities, have social inclusion and live the same as everybody else.  I believe the Department of Health has an obligation to it.  I am delighted that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, provided funding for people with disabilities in health organisations.  I do not understand it but the Minister of State can give her answer on that point.</p><p>Many people have only 20 minutes&rsquo; home help.  That is absolutely worthless.  People like to talk.  Home help has turned into personal care, which is fine.  When we were under financial pressure I could understand the move to that, but there are many people with a disability who really need the bed made or the floor swept or a bit of hoovering done.  We have moved away from that and we need to get back to it.</p><p>Reconfiguration is a lovely word and sounds great but I would like to know how well it works.  People are being assessed based on their school address.  I cannot understand why.  There is an appeals system which I have gone through with people and some appeals have been successful.  Before I came in here today I wanted to know why a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome had to wait nine months to be called up after being taken in by Kerry Intervention and Disability Services, KIDS.  I had to make five calls and each one I rang referred me on and on.</p></speech>

She was not called to be assessed for speech and language or occupational therapy.  She got a call for a playgroup.  Following a telephone call from me she was called up.  Nobody in the HSE is answerable for anything.  I had to make five phone calls and eventually got a voicemail telling me to refer to communications.  It is not good enough.  As public representatives we are entitled to make representations on behalf of our people and we expect answers from the HSE.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, should absolutely insist that the HSE respond to people.  If, as a public representative, I cannot get a reply or others cannot get a reply, how does the ordinary man on the street hope to get an answer from anyone?  Like my colleagues, I could go on forever but there are time constraints.  There will be another day to fight this.</p></speech>

If there is one message from today&rsquo;s debate it is that the HSE has to pull up its socks and ensure that it responds, not alone to public representatives but to the public.  There is a charter for caring.</p> <p>All Departments are responsible for disability services.  I spent many years on South Dublin County Council and every department in the place had a part to play.  When the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, was in the House to discuss child care, I said a certain percentage of each budget should go into child care and the same for disability.  It crosses all sectors in every community.  We should use design for all but we have not arrived at that point.  It should be the case that no building would ever be put anywhere without being totally accessible.  It is much easier to plan right than to plan wrong and try to fix it.  Design for all should be a mantra.  The architects talk about it all the time.</p></speech>

Every building should be considered under the concept of design for all.  I saw on television a fellow who got onto a train but could not get off because there was no one to help him.</p> <p>Early intervention is vital for help in preschools, many of which cannot take special needs children because the intervention and the support staff are not there.  That is a problem for the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Health.  In my own school I had a policy of ensuring a special place was reserved for at least one or two special needs children.  I did my Master's degree in multiple intelligences.  I listened to Senator Quinn talk about the cabbage leaf and the trolley.  That is a prime example of multiple intelligence in use.  The earlier one gets the intelligence that is primed for the child to use at a particular time, the better the child will get on.  I had the privilege of having the first student with Down&rsquo;s syndrome to take up the leaving certificate applied course.  Early intervention is vital not only for the children in preschool education every day, but particularly for children with special needs.  The Minister of State should chat to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that children with special needs get the help and the support staff they need in preschool.</p> <p>I welcome the value for money audit.  Salaries is the wrong place for 98% of the money to go.  When I was on the South Dublin County Council I ensured there was braille on every door, to make it easier for people to get around the place.  A Minicom was put in for deaf people.  Textphone is now available which thankfully works.  In respect of the EU recommendation that everybody have 3% staff, which is not mandatory, in South Dublin County Council we ensured that at least six people with special needs would be taken on.  I would like to see a programme in here to take on people with special needs every year, up to a certain quota.  I do not like quotas in everything, not even for women in politics, but we have to have them because they work well now.  We have to have quotas for people with disabilities.  Will the Minister of State consider that in the programme?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Spina bifida is on the increase in Ireland and we know how debilitating it is.  It results from a lack of folic acid.  As with everything, prevention is better than cure.  We should take every opportunity to highlight it.</p><p>I refer to the standards of care and inspection in homes.  This is a subject close to the heart of the Minister of State and she has worked on it since she came to the Department.</p><p>Senator Moloney referred to the allocation of 20 minutes per home help visit.  They might as well be told to stay at home.  Money has to be spent on travel expenses, petrol and salaries so it is a waste of money to put them into the house.  As Senator Moloney said, it takes a home help five minutes to take off his or her coat and another five minutes to put it on and there is not much time left.  I ask the Minister of State is examine this situation.  Value for money means value for work.  The home helps are fantastic and the best group of people.  They should be supported but putting such time constraints on them is not right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#EE00200"><p>I hope to deal with the subjects raised in order although I am very bad at taking notes.  In reply to Senator Byrne, I was the person who insisted that HIQA undertake the inspections of residential settings.  I must admit I have no problem in putting my hand up and taking responsibility for things and that is how I have lived my life and it has probably served me well thus far.  The regulations in place are not fit for purpose.  They will ensure that all the doors will close, that all the hooks will be on the walls and there will be three different colour bins.  However, in reality, would the Senator's house pass that test because mine would not?  I am serious.  Would it pass that test?  If we are serious about saying that these places are where people live, then surely we should have different regulations.  I admit that and we are looking at the situation.  We had to allow the regulations to be in place for a time and they have been very useful.  I have always said that if I had a loved one in a residential setting of whatever type - whether for older people or for people with disabilities or for young people with chronic illness - I would say, "God bless HIQA" because it is the body that will ensure that people get the type of respect they deserve.  I do not think the Senator and I disagree on that point.  I hope that not all HIQA's inspection visits are announced - I am a great believer in the unannounced visit - but I am not a great believer in the big stick visit.  The majority of people in this world set out to do a very good job.  I acknowledge that a small number of people lose empathy and may have been too long in a particular position and may not be as empathetic and compassionate as they should be.  However, we got that wrong and we have to change it but that is a small thing to change.</p> <p>When I come to this House I do not play political football because I do not think it serves any purpose, but I often wonder what we could do if we had more money.  We must all agree that we are starting from a very low base and this is unfortunate.  That is the past and there is no point in dwelling on the past as we should be looking to the future because I do not believe that people with disabilities at whatever age and with whatever disability will thank us for that.</p> <p>In reply to Senator van Turnhout, I do not believe that we have to look to England for research findings.  We are leaders in the world in respect of TILDA II and we are the only people doing it.  I am not surprised by the conditions which the Senator named but it is interesting that we never look at the positive aspects.  TILDA II tells us that people with intellectual disabilities, in particular, that people with Down's syndrome, do not have high blood pressure.  I was astonished at that fact.  It would seem that they do not have stressful lives.  They are very quick to get over the immediate issue.  However, people with Down's syndrome can develop different forms of dementia at an early stage.  It is common across the board unless they are living within the family circle.  They can have childlike taste in food such as liking McDonald's and fast food and their diet can be bad as a result.  I do not think we need to look at other countries because we are aware of the issues and we know how to deal with them.</p> <p>In reply to Senator Burke, thankfully, reconfiguration is one of the few areas for which I am not responsible.  However, I take his concerns on board and I will pass them on.  Senator Moran referred to the psychological services available.  All I can say is that we are starting from a very low base.  I came from a very long and protracted meeting this morning which dealt with the interconnection between primary care and disability services.  Bringing those two services together will give us a bigger bang for our buck.  Senator Moran also referred to respite care.  The cut to the respite grant had nothing to do with me because I do not administer it.</p></speech>

I have enough responsibilities as it is and enough to be blamed for, without taking that on.</p> <p>Senator Moran referred to SNAs, special needs assistants.  It is actually an issue for the trade unions and for the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a serious issue for the unions and it is my view that SNAs can do far more, whether helping with speech and language and occupational therapy.  They want to help because they like the people they care for.</p> <p>Senator Quinn and I could be reading from the same hymn book.  It is true that we are too paternalistic at times towards people with disabilities and we do not see the possibilities for them as opposed to their limitations.  It is incredible what can be achieved if we only imagine what is possible.  I agree entirely with Senator Quinn on this point.  I refer to Senator Quinn's story about the young man removing the cabbage leaf.  He obviously learned that from Senator Quinn because that is a marketing ploy.  The Cabinet has approved a new employment strategy for people with disabilities.  The previous strategy was somewhat limited because it did not take into account people who may have greater challenges.  Senator Quinn and I are on the same page in this regard.</p> <p>Senator Cullinane  spoke about the fact that children in school do not have enough sports activities.  We have more SNAs than ever.  I am not certain we are deploying them well but we have more than ever because the need is greater than ever.  Senator Byrne and others raised the issue that very young children with a disability cannot avail of the free preschool year.  This is being worked on.  Thankfully, it is not my responsibility but that of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  The Secretaries General of those Departments are considering a unified national policy.</p></speech>

I know that Springboard is an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, but the Department of Social Protection was also involved.  Recently, I spoke to a former employee of the Department of Social Protection, who told me that Springboard was one of the best jobs initiatives ever introduced.</p><p>Springboard+, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is fully funded through the National Training Fund.  Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system.  It is one of a number of special initiatives designed to support people in returning to employment and build the supply of skilled graduates for vacancies that arise across key sectors of the economy.  Courses approved for funding focus on areas such as ICT, high-end manufacturing, international financial services, skills to trade internationally and entrepreneurial or business start-up skills.  Work placements of three to six months are offered on almost all of the courses.  The courses are highly flexible, and participants can continue with their courses throughout the summer months, when most courses close down.  In addition, if one gets a job during one's course, one can continue with the course.  </p><p>The profile of Springboard participants from 2011 to 2015 shows that the programme has been very successful in reaching its target cohorts.  In 2014-2015, 63% of participants were aged between 25 and 39 years, and 61% had been out of work for more than a year, an increase on the 2011 figure of 58%.  Data shows that participants who were long-term unemployed at the start of the course find it harder to secure employment, but now 46% of the group achieve employment or self-employment within six months of completing a Springboard course.  Further, a survey of all graduates in 2011 to 2014 has indicated that within two years of completing a Springboard course as many as 60% are employed or self-employed, and 74% of Springboard participants from these years are no longer on the live register.  I would also note that self-employment is a significant feature of Springboard, with 740 people, or 15% of respondents to surveys carried out between 2011 and 2014, being self-employed.</p><p>A major provider of Springboard courses is the institutes of technology.  I have spoken to people who are closely associated with the provision of Springboard courses in Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT.  In 2013-2014 there were 125 enrolments, and in 2014-2015 there were 55 enrolments.  DkIT has now successfully achieved funding for 11 courses under the Government's Springboard 2015 initiative.  Recently, at the launch of the national Springboard initiative in Dublin, the Minister for Education and Skills announced funding of &euro;1.2 million and 242 places for DkIT.  She said: &quot;Now in its fifth year Springboard is playing a crucial role in rapidly responding to emerging skills needs in high-growth areas and in supporting people back into employment.&quot;  I wish to note that the institutes of technology play a key role in the delivery of Springboard, so the courses are admirably matched to local needs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The courses at DkIT that will run from September 2015 are in the areas of digital marketing, hospitality operations, construction engineering, medical device software, digital animation, games design, agribusiness, and food supply chain operations.  None of those courses was available when I was at school.  This provision illustrates how the world is changing in terms of employment and how Springboard and the education providers are keeping up with those changes.  In addition, DkIT will offer a higher diploma in computing as part of the ICT skills initiative.  This aims to provide a career route into the IT sector for graduates whose primary degree is in a discipline other than computing.  Members might wonder why I have spent so long talking about DkIT.  I have used it merely as an example; all the institutes of technology are providing similar courses suited to local needs.<br/><br/>Under Springboard, participants can avail of free part-time courses leading to qualifications that are in demand among employers.  Those currently in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection will retain their benefits and will not be liable for third level fees.  Prospective students can contact the lifelong learning centre for advice and information and can apply online for courses through <i>www.springboardscourses.ie</i>.  The target cohort in 2015 comprises jobseekers who already hold a national framework of qualifications, NFQ, award at level 5 or a FETAC award at NFQ level 6 or equivalent and have a previous history of employment in construction, manufacturing or other sectors of the economy where employment may not recover to pre-recession levels, jobseekers with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ levels 6 to 9 and who may require additional upskilling or reskilling to re-enter employment, and previously self-employed people at all qualification levels.<br/><br/>I urge the Minister of State to evaluate the potential for Springboard to be extended to low-paid workers to support upward mobility in the workforce and the concept of lifelong education and training.  He is doing a very good job in overseeing the establishment of the education and training boards.  Perhaps consideration might be given to involving them in any extension of the eligibility criteria for the Springboard programme.  I have great pleasure in commending this motion to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I seem to have been looking through the same statistics as Senator Jim D'Arcy and will try to avoid repetition.  Springboard Plus, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is fully funded through the national training fund.  It complements the core State-funded education and training system and is one of a number or special initiatives designed to support people back into employment and build the supply of skilled graduates for vacancies arising across key sectors of the economy.</p> <p>A fourth phase of Springboard Plus is being rolled out, providing for 9,000 places at level 6, higher certificate, to level 9, masters degree, on the national framework of qualifications.  Courses will be run on both a part-time and full-time or accelerated basis in 42 public and private higher education providers throughout the country.  Like Senator D'Arcy, I compliment Dundalk Institute of Technology on its programme.</p> <p>Springboard Plus is included in the Action Plan for Jobs and is one of the Skills To Work programmes.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a central pillar of our strategy for economic recovery and includes actions to be taken across government.  It was conceived against the backdrop of the domestic jobs crisis and challenging economic conditions.  It has involved putting in place a comprehensive framework of actions and reforms right across the public sector and in partnership with industry to create a new, sustainable economy based on exports, innovation and enterprise.  It includes a commitment to seeing full employment of 2.1 million by the end of 2018.</p> <p>The initiative is being rolled out to the regions through the Action Plan for Jobs regional initiative to ensure communities throughout the country benefit from the recovery.  The objective of this new initiative is to strengthen and develop job creation in the regions by encouraging local authorities, regional bodies, higher education institutions, other public bodies, the private sector and communities to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their area.</p> <p>Skills to Work brings together the key Government initiatives introduced since 2011 to support jobseekers to access the training and work experience they need and encourage businesses to employ people currently on the live register.  The five programmes that come under the Skills to Work initiative are Springboard, MOMENTUM, Skillnets, JobBridge and JobsPlus.  Springboard provides free upskilling in higher education in areas of identified skills need.  The initiative's primary target group is unemployed people with a previous history of employment.  To date, some &euro;85 million has been allocated to Springboard from Exchequer funding, providing for more than 21,000 places.</p> <p>All courses approved for funding under Springboard are selected by an independent panel with industry and educational expertise following a competitive tendering process.  In particular, courses with a proven track record in getting people back into employment are recommended for funding.  Courses approved for funding focus on areas such as ICT, high-end manufacturing, international financial services, skills to trade internationally, and entrepreneurial and business start-up skills.  Work placements of three to six months will be offered on almost all of the courses.  A further &euro;27.4 million will be allocated to Springboard Plus this year, providing for 9,000 places on 285 courses in 42 colleges throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Brennan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2360"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2360&amp;amp;pid=TerryBrennan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To be eligible for a place on a Springboard course a person must be unemployed, actively seeking employment, and be in receipt of one of the range of qualifying social protection payments, or be signing for credits or be previously self-employed.  It is worth noting that there is no requirement to be in receipt of a payment for a particular period of time prior to the commencement of the programme.</p><p>The profile of Springboard participants from 2011 to 2015 shows that the programme has been very successful in reaching its target.  A total of 63% of participants were aged between 25 and 39 and 61% had been out of work for more than a year, an increase from 58% in 2011.  Participants are mostly men but year on year there is an upward trend in women participants.  There were 74% men and 26% women in 2011 and it was 64% men and 36% women in 2014.  Data show that while participants who were long-term unemployed at the start of their course find it more difficult to get employment, 45% of this group now achieve employment or self-employment within six months of completing a Springboard course.  That is truly remarkable and an indication of the success of the programme.</p><p>A survey of all graduates between 2011 and 2014 indicates that within two years of completing a Springboard course, 60% are employed or self-employed, and 74% of Springboard participants from those years are no longer on the live register.</p></speech>

One could not really argue with anything in this evening's motion because, to be fair, the Springboard programme has been a good one and has facilitated participation among young people to gain educational advantage which leads to job opportunities.  No argument could be made on the merits or otherwise of Springboard.  It is an excellent programme that has been working.  Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy indicated that there are 242 places in Dundalk IT and there are other ITs throughout the country.  It is great that it is spread around the country.</p> <p>Youth unemployment is not just a major issue in this country, it is also an issue across Europe.  This week the Nevin Economic Research Institute highlighted the need to address youth unemployment in this country.  It referred in particular to the JobBridge programme and the abuse of it.  The programme, which pays &euro;50 on top of the dole, is being abused by employers.  It is not a means to an end for many individuals who are on the programme because they are dumped off it without any job security.  Dr. Tom Healy from the Nevin institute suggested the Government&rsquo;s policy on youth unemployment was more about trying to bring about corrective action rather than prevention of youth unemployment and a long-term strategy.  While there is a stopgap approach in place, the Government&rsquo;s public policy is not a preventative one nor is it strategic in a long-term sense.  I agree with some of what Dr. Healy had to say.  The Government has taken positive steps to address the issue.</p> <p>Currently, a total of 21,000 students are participating in the Springboard programme, which is to be welcomed.  The difficulty with the programme as a Government labour activation policy is that not enough emphasis is being placed on further education and training, apprenticeship schemes and the facilitation of individuals who might not wish to proceed to third and fourth levels.  We must examine the issue from a public policy point of view.  Young people are leaving school early and they deserve a chance as well.  Perhaps we could consider the opportunities available to young people in a country such as Germany, for example.  The German economy has been developed and transformed generation after generation through apprenticeship programmes.  Before F&Aacute;S was renamed, even though the country was going down the tubes and building work was gone, it was offering plastering courses.  SOLAS is the new agency and it is more progressive but we must devise a 20-year strategy in terms of the future of the country and where we want people to play a role.</p> <p>A total of 1.9 million people were in employment up to the end of 2014 and it is slightly more than that now.  A total of 110,000 people were working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 236,000 worked in industry and manufacturing, and 106,000 worked in construction.  It dipped to approximately 99,000 in 2012, but it is still a big industry.  Approximately 450,000 people work in those three sectors and then approximately 1.4 million work in services, including the public sector, the Civil Service, finance, insurance, real estate and other sectors.  While much of the focus in Springboard is on the 1.4 million, approximately 500,000 work in what are traditionally jobs that could be obtained through apprenticeship programmes and through further education and training.  There is a need to develop that area.  I welcome the decrease in unemployment.</p> <p>Approximately one in five people aged between 18 years and 25 years, which is approximately 20%, totalling approximately 110,000 young people, cannot find a job at the moment.  We must be able to give them an opportunity.  While the State cannot intervene and provide jobs, public policy must focus on the provision of opportunities for those people.  The decision to withdraw career guidance teachers in second level schools was a very negative policy decision by the Minister for Education and Skills because at a time when the economy is improving and young people in second level education want to consider the opportunities available to them, they do not have the necessary career guidance.  That is a retrograde step.</p> <p>There are many other points I could make.  In general, Springboard is good but more needs to be done.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reach out.  We must put the politics to one side while we consider the approach to take as a country.  We have large-scale youth unemployment and we must create opportunities for those who are unemployed in order that they can get a job.  JobBridge is not working.  It is being exploited left, right and centre and it is wrong that young people are exploited in that way.  I know many young people who have taken part in the JobBridge programme.  They were promised a job and got an extra &euro;50 a week but there was nothing at the end of the process.  They are now on social welfare.</p> <p>Unemployment benefit is approximately 33% of the total budget of the Department of Social Protection.  Approximately &euro;20.5 billion is spent on social welfare.  Employment initiatives account for approximately &euro;6.5 billion of that.  By reducing the expenditure in that area the Minister will help the country, but the only way to do it is by getting people into work.  Young people are the future of the country and they need a chance.  They need a leg up and public policy will help them to achieve that.</p></speech>

As has been said, it is an excellent motion.  It shows that Springboard is working.  It is one of the big successes of this Government.  Since it was launched in 2011, as has been said, more than 21,000 people have participated in Springboard courses, with an allocation of &euro;85 million.  Others have referred to the eligibility requirements for the programme, including that candidates must be unemployed, actively seeking employment, in receipt of one of the qualifying social protection payments, previously employed or signing on for credits.  A total of 812 courses have been offered by 42 institutions, and there is no doubt as to the benefit this has had for so many students on these courses, who have been provided with the opportunity to upskill and retrain in areas of identified skills need.  Springboard Plus is now going even further.  All courses approved for funding under this programme are selected by an independent panel with industry and educational expertise following a competitive tendering process.  In particular, courses with a proven track record in getting people back into employment are recommended for funding.  I welcome the recent announcement that almost a further &euro;27.5 million will be allocated to Springboard Plus in 2015, and this will provide for 9,000 places on 285 courses in 42 colleges throughout the country.  To date, two trend analysis evaluations on Springboard have been completed, with the third due next month.  Trends emerging show that 98% of people would recommend Springboard courses to a family member or friend.  One knows something is working when people recommend it to those closest to them.</p> <p>The programme has also been very successful in reaching its target cohorts.  Some 63% of participants are between the ages of 25 and 39, which is a critical stage in the world of work, and in 2014, 61% had been out of work for more than a year.  I am delighted to see that, year-on-year, there is also an upward trend in female participants, from 26% in 2011 to 36% in 2014.  I was recently speaking to a lady who qualified as a teacher many years ago, got married and gave up teaching to rear her children.  She devoted the last 20 years to raising her children, and when she went back to look for a job teaching, she found her qualifications were not up to date.  She was finding it very difficult to get something, so she availed of the Springboard course, went off in a completely different direction, and is now hoping to specialise in an area of ICT, which she had never imagined before.  As she said, it had a positive effect not only on her life but also on her children, because for the first time she was going back out into the world of work, and her children also had to gain independence.</p> <p>I am sure reference has been made to our local college in Dundalk, Dundalk Institute of Technology, which has been awarded 11 Springboard courses this year.  There are 550 places on courses ranging from level 6 through to level 9.  We are all in agreement - those of us from County Louth, anyway - on how excellent DkIT has proven itself to be.  It offers a range of courses, from a level 6 certificate in building information modelling up to a level 9 MSc in computing and medical device software.  There is a diploma in composing for games and a certificate in 3D for games.  DKIT is going exactly where we need to be going in areas that need to be targeted.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred earlier to colleges offering courses in plastering during the downturn in the economy, which is self-evidently ridiculous.</p> <p>This is brilliant for people who have a level of education and who are going in a different direction, but I totally agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill that much more needs to be done for people who have left school early, at 16, and who may not be able to access courses.  I am talking even more specifically about people with an intellectual disability.  I spoke to someone today who said that some people who want to leave school early are coming from special schools at the age of 16 or 17 and they cannot access the HSE-funded programmes in the National Learning Network until they are 18.  They are caught in that dilemma, and we all know that if a person gets into the habit of being unemployed or not pursuing something, it is much harder to get back into the swing of it.  I agree that is something we need to look at, and maybe we should not only have such high levels, but also level 4 or 5. </p> <p>I commend the Fine Gael Senators on their introduction of this motion and I thank the Minister of State for attending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#JJ00200"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I know his enthusiasm and his heart are in this programme.  I have been involved since the beginning, and I have been chairman of the selection committee for the past five years.  One sees such satisfaction in people who have changed course, probably having had a degree in architecture, quantity surveying or something like that, who suddenly found there was no job for them.  They might have taken up an ICT course or even a cookery course or something like that.  It is such a success to see their sense of achievement.  The selection committee I have chaired for the last five years is made up of experts in various areas, who are able to select the different courses we should undertake.</p> <p>Many employers just cannot find sufficient skills at that high level.  I have a word of caution for Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill: let us not make the Springboard course too wide.  If we need to get apprentices in other areas, let us do something else.  The fact that &euro;100 million has been spent in the last few years and another &euro;27 million is being spent this year is a reminder of how valuable the programme is.  This year it will provide free part-time courses for up to 9,000 job-seekers.  The results are clear.  Over 74% of all Springboard participants from 2011 to 2014 are no longer on the live register.  That is a great achievement.  As the motion mentions, the initiative must get a great deal of credit for drastically reducing our unemployment rate.  It is very important.  We are all aware of the number of foreign investors who come to Ireland, usually in ICT, and say they cannot get locals to work in that area, while they also need other skills.  Therefore, the selection of courses that enable those skills to be acquired is important.</p> <p>I was shown around the Google headquarters last year.  The chief executive showed me one particular man.  They did not seem to have any managers in Google - they walk around on their own - and there is plenty of food, soft drinks, and everything else.  He had his earphones on and a microphone.  The chief executive told me the man was from eastern Stuttgart, because Google knows that if it wants to sell something to someone in eastern Stuttgart, it does not want to go in with a Munich accent.  It is a bit like someone trying to sell something in Dundalk with a Kerry accent.  I am sure that is the wrong way around, but whatever it is - maybe in Donegal with a Kerry accent.</p></speech>

We are so weak on that in Ireland.  Last year, when a company - I think it was Hewlett-Packard - said it was taking on a number of people and stated that they would need a modern language other than English, one of the reporters at the time said that meant no Irish need apply, because we are so bad at modern languages.  One of the things we are attempting to do in Springboard is to encourage the use of modern languages on that basis.  One of the pieces missing in the jigsaw of matching people to employers is the correct data.  That is, when students graduate in this country, we do not systematically collect, analyse and distribute information on what they end up doing, be it employment or further education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have to do more on that so when they graduate, we can find out how they got on and how we can improve things.  The technical term for this is collecting the employment outcomes of students.  If we did so, we would be able to better match students with the needs of employers.  That is crucial data and many EU countries recognise this fact.  For instance, Italy and the Netherlands already collect that data.  This information is critical for policy-makers and higher institutions because it helps them to detect which courses and fields of study are in high demand among employers.  </p><p>There is another area on which we can move.  Students of the ICT skills conversion course have to wait nine months before they qualify.  Something can be done about that.  I am not quite sure what the technical reason for doing that is, but I would like the Minister of State to consider the matter and determine whether we can achieve something on that basis.  It is a shame that somebody who wants to do a course finds that he or she is not able to do so for nine months.  I am sure there is a simple answer and the problem can be solved.  </p><p>I welcome the motion.  It is great to draw attention to Springboard.  It is a major success and can be a bigger success in the years ahead, which will happen with the enthusiasm of the Government, the Minister of State and the very bright team of people in the HEA which has put its heart and soul, effort and enthusiasm into the programme.  Long may it continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#KK00200"><p>County Louth is well served, with three speakers having spoken on the motion.  Dundalk IT is obviously doing wonderful work where Springboard is concerned.  I recently read in a local newspaper a headline suggesting that the Government was massaging the live register figures because there was a 300% increase in people on Government schemes.  The information came from a press release from an opposition Deputy.  The 300% increase was an increase from about 80 to 250 or 260 people, while the live register had reduced by over 2,000 people.  That shows one how headlines cannot tell the true story at times.</p> <p>As has been mentioned, there has been some exploitation of workers through the JobBridge scheme, which has been addressed, but I do not think anybody can say the same about Springboard and Springboard Plus, which have proved to be a resounding success.  As my colleague, Senator Brennan, mentioned, a survey of all graduates between 2011 and 2014 indicated that within two years of completing a Springboard course, 60% were employed or self-employed and 74% of Springboard participants from these years were no longer on the live register.  Those figures are very positive.  </p> <p>Self-employment is a significant feature of Springboard, with 740, or 15%, of the respondents surveyed between 2011 and 2014 reporting being in self-employment.  The quality of employment is also trending upwards, with 86% of those employed being in full-time jobs.  That nails a lie, namely, that there are no jobs being created as a result of Government schemes.  Springboard and Springboard Plus provide full-time jobs.  More than half of those who withdrew from the courses early, some 24% of participants, went on to take up employment.  The feedback on Springboard from participants is excellent, with 98% of the 2014 graduates willing to recommend Springboard to others wishing to reskill for employment.  </p> <p>Some 73% of graduates felt, six weeks after course completion, that their career prospects were better.  That is what these schemes are all about, especially Springboard and Springboard Plus.  They give confidence back to people who have lost it because of unemployment.</p> <p>There are many other programmes under the Action Plan for Jobs being pressed by the Government.  The ICT skills conversion programme was introduced in 2012 as part of the joint Government and industry ICT action plan as a means to address the concerns of industry about continuing difficulties in sourcing ICT graduates with the requisite skills in Ireland, not only to fill existing vacancies but also to support the expansion of their activities and potential employment opportunities.  </p> <p>A second ICT action plan for 2014 to 2018, launched in 2014, recommended that further rounds of ICT skills conversion programmes should be rolled out, something Senator Quinn has addressed on several occasions during the Order of Business.  People involved in businesses have said we must address the skills shortage which industry is witnessing in the country.  Senator Quinn also alluded to the question of modern languages, which is another area where we need to upgrade skills and have people in place when jobs come on board.  </p> <p>The ICT skills conversion programme is open to all applicants, regardless of their social welfare status, who have the capacity and underlying aptitude, as well as an honours degrees in a cognitive discipline, to undergo an intensive programme of study and work experience to acquire honours degree level at ICT programming skills.  The programmes which are selected for funding following a competitive call for proposals are designed and delivered in partnership with industry.  Partnership is key because these schemes must be designed in partnership with the industry which requires the skills and include an accredited work placement of three to six months' duration.  </p> <p>In terms of the back to education allowance, a person in receipt of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance for at least nine of the previous 12 months may qualify to retain his or her income support while participating in an ICT skills conversion course.  Eligible participants will transfer to a bespoke version of the back to education allowance.  Many necessary schemes have been introduced and will give people confidence.</p> <p>I am fed up listening to people say that all of the schemes are the same and are only a mechanism to take people off the live register.  They should speak to the people involved in Springboard and Springboard Plus.  The results and data are there for everybody to see.  People need more and more skills and we need to upskill our workforce to fill the jobs that have been and will be created.  People laughed when the Government suggested that we would create 100,000 net jobs over five years.  That has been achieved over four years but there is a long way to go.</p></speech>

I very much support Springboard.  Some people might be shocked that I am supporting something.  It is apt that I speak in support of it after Senator Cummins.  Any scheme that opens up higher education is very much welcomed by me and my party.  The reskilling across Ireland of workers who lost their jobs during the economic crisis is a priority for all of us.  The nature of the crisis was that it affected certain industries, areas and age groups more than others.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kathryn Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Those of us from rural areas know all too well the effect the recession has had on employment in our communities, counties and constituencies.  As much as there is a need to reskill workers for new emerging industries, there also needs to be greater effort in attracting companies in these emerging industries to areas outside Dublin.  While it might seem parochial, efforts should start to be made in attracting these industries to the Border region, as well as in the midlands and the west.</p><p>In many instances, unemployment can hit workers in perfectly functioning and profitable companies.  In Cavan and Monaghan, we recently had the closure of the Bose plant.  The workers were skilled and the factory was profitable but the decision was taken by the heads of the company to move the operations to another country.  In instances such as this, outreaches should be made to bring similar industries back into an area compatible with the workers&rsquo; skills.</p><p>Third level institutions must be commended on their support for and delivering on the Springboard scheme, as well as other activation schemes in which they play a role.  This shows the intrinsic value of these institutions.  It also highlights how these institutions are often underutilised and their potential in implementing these programmes.</p><p>There is a need for third level institutions to be opened up to more of our citizens in whatever way possible.  I am delighted with the continuing upward trend in female participation in third level institutions.  However, more needs to be done for women re-entering the workforce, be it through Springboard or other measures.  More also needs to be done for women already in the workforce.  Up to 50% of women over the age of 15 are currently in the labour force and make up 46% of all those in employment.  In terms of labour market participation, however, women are more likely to work on a part-time basis and almost 70% of all part-time workers are women.</p><p>Springboard could be improved in areas such as eligibility.  Affordable child care should be prioritised as this would help women enter into employment, as well as helping them move from part-time to full-time employment.  One issue with which I am concerned is the type of employment being created across all sectors.  We want to see decent work created and a living wage paid to workers.  One of the most devastating impacts of the economic and social crisis is the prevalence of low pay while salaries at the upper echelons of the labour market have soared.  We must ensure this economic inequality does not permeate the economy too much.  The prevalence of precarious work is a worrying trend.</p><p>More could be done for labour activation.  We need to seriously look at what works and does not.  For that reason, I urge the Government to prioritise direct funding to schemes such as Springboard.  We are all unanimous in supporting this and the work it has done.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to JobBridge, concerns which we share.  There have been criticisms of how it has been used, perhaps even abused, and how some young people have even been exploited on it.  My colleague, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, recommended we get rid of JobBridge and put forward an alternative scheme.  Schemes such as Springboard and JobsPlus are working very well.  More funding needs to be put into such schemes rather than into those such as JobBridge.</p><p>I commend the Government on introducing schemes such as Springboard and JobsPlus which are work-related and of great benefit to people who take them up, involving real jobs, real pay and terms and conditions.  They help a generation of people whose skills may have been redundant to upskill and allow them become jobs-ready.  As many Members have mentioned, there are employers who want these skills.  If we are giving them the skills, it is a win-win situation.</p></speech>

With my colleague Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, we absolutely applaud the concept of the Springboard programme.  While the Leader is correct that people will always be critical of government, no matter what their hue and colour is, I am not going to be critical about any scheme that will create jobs for people in the most vulnerable part of our society, namely, those coming out of college or those who are concerned about where their future lies.  The 21,000 students participating in the scheme are a credit to it.</p> <p>However, I want to start at the other end.  I hope the Government might be more focused on the further education rather than the higher education area.  I cannot help but think about the vocational sector.  The original reasons that the vocational schools system started back in the 1930s was to provide skills for what was then a predominantly agricultural economy.  At local level, as we all know, particularly the teachers among us, sadly in some cases, the vocational education option was for the second or third child on the farm or the child not seen to be academically bright.  Ironically, the vocational education system has served and still serves this country exceptionally well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#LL00400"><p>Since 1930, it has provided the backbone of our economy in that it created and provided skills across the whole wide range of human endeavour that was needed by the economy and which is perhaps needed even more so now.  It is somewhat ironic that the original motivation behind further education provision has been neglected.  I am sure Senator Craughwell will have something to say about this, having been himself involved in that area.</p> <p>I am disappointed, therefore, that in last year&rsquo;s budget, the then Minister for Education and Skills reduced funding for the post-leaving certificate, PLC, sector.  He provided for a two point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for PLC schools, saving &euro;4 million but with a loss of 200 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the PLC sector.  The allocations to VECs, vocational education committees, were cut by &euro;13 million.  Capitation rates to PLC colleges and VTOS, vocational training opportunities scheme, were also cut by 2%.  As part of the social welfare budget, it was announced that from January 2013, the &euro;300 cost of education allowance payable to back to education allowance participants would be discontinued for new and existing participants.  As a result of these changes, the number of vocational schools offering PLC programmes dropped.  This decrease was also reflected in a drop of some 1,521 students taking such programmes in 2013-2014, bringing their numbers down to 34,003.</p> <p>Accordingly, it is not beyond the bounds of comprehension that Members on this side of the House call on the Minister to do more to support and enhance the further education sector and, maybe, attempt to reverse the cuts imposed on the sector in recent years now there is an upturn in the economy.  I am sure the Minister of State does not need to be reminded that when Tony Blair became UK Prime Minister in 1997, he was asked what his three priorities were.  His answer was education, education and education.  I know the Government, through these programmes, is very conscious of the importance of education.</p> <p>In the context of where the focus is now, perhaps we should look at those not academically gifted or who are not suitable or comfortable in an academic environment.  One of my sons is doing very well, relatively speaking.  However, he never liked the academic side of school.  He used to say he wanted to be doing something.  The written side of school work was not something with which he felt comfortable.  It was inevitable that he ended up taking a degree course in audio-video production.  He is now in America on a graduate visa programme.  Fingers crossed, he will get something there that will enhance skills.  In the context of this debate, it brought home to me that there is a significant cohort of young people for whom higher education is not the best option.  While the focus seems to be on this sector, all the evidence suggests employers do not all see it in that light too.  For example, the dominance of an exclusive focus on higher education has had important implications for young people, particularly for those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A surprising number of employers express impatience that graduates "do not know how things work and it takes a year or two to get them job ready".  Despite the numbers of graduates seeking jobs, employers are instructing recruitment agents to look for people "with the right skills to get the job done".</p><p>There is a great deal more I would like to say but my time is up.  When I was obliged to go to London as a young man to find work, I eventually ended up in the employment agency business.  I worked for an Irish company called the Emerald Staff Agency, sadly no longer with us, which had several branches across London.  I was only 20 or 21 at the time and I remember dealing with young Irish emigrants who were just off the boat, with a leaving certificate in one hand and an expectation in the other.  They had been told that if they got their leaving certificate, they would be guaranteed a job for life.  This was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when second level participation was not as high as it is now.  I had to ready some of these people for interview by explaining that their academic qualification was not enough.  There had to be a certain extra dimension to how they would get the job done.  I have found time and again that there is a gap in the Irish education sector in this regard.</p><p>The cohort of long-term unemployed was stubbornly large even before the recession.  Will the Minister of State consider whether there is a need to refocus and rebalance the Springboard programme, not in any way to take away from its success but rather to expand it a little by putting resources into further education, which includes PLC and FETAC courses, instead of focusing solely on the higher education sector?</p></speech>

I thank Senators Jim D'Arcy and Terry Brennan for bringing this motion to the House and the Leader for accommodating the debate.  Senator D'Arcy has demonstrated once again his great commitment to further education.</p> <p>On the day I was elected to this House, I thought how strange it was to have joined the Army as a 16 year old and now to be a Member of the Oireachtas.  Further education brought me to where I am today.  While talking with my children at the weekend about what I had done since leaving school, I worked out that I have had ten changes of career.  It is not bad going and I might have another one yet.  Who knows?</p></speech>

I am somewhat concerned at having to be so complimentary to the Government, but it is indeed an excellent programme.  The Leader is right that those who scoff at these schemes should tell us what alternatives they would offer.  I do not accept the notion that the purpose of the scheme is to massage the unemployment figures or anything else.</p> <p>Senator Feargal Quinn referred to language skills.  I was in Finland the week before last as part of a delegation and, in the course of my visit, was shown around a primary school by a 12 year old boy.  Half way up the stairs he said to me: "I'm terribly sorry, Senator.  Could you tell me how Ireland is getting on with the crisis?"  When I asked him what crisis he meant, he said he was referring to our economic crisis.  I assured him we are doing fine now and he said he was a bit concerned because his country is entering its own economic crisis.  I complimented his English and asked whether he also spoke Swedish, it being a dual-language school.  He said he did as well as Russian and German, although his German was not too good.  This was a 12 year old.  We must do more to improve the take-up of language learning.</p> <p>There is a need for joined-up thinking if we are to tackle these issues.  One of the finest schools of catering this country has ever had, which is located in Killybegs, is to be closed and moved back into Letterkenny IT.  This move could well see its reputation going down the toilet.  A cash consideration drove that decision and it is simply not good enough.  The Irish Hotels Federation would be capable of supplying students to that school all winter long and placing them in work during the summer.</p> <p>There is an overemphasis on outputs when discussing education issues, which is worrying.  Having spent the past 20 years of my life in the further education sector, I am aware of the view among those working in it that SOLAS is not there to assist them but to kill them.  That is the vibe one gets and it is a bad one.  At a recent meeting of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, there was a discussion about apprenticeships and the submissions made by various organisations on that subject.  The further education sector was responsible for only 14% of the submissions made to SOLAS.  I have seen at first hand the level of innovation in the sector and I do not accept it was only capable of producing 14% of the submissions.  Some 33,000 or 34,000 students are in further education.</p></speech>

Will he clarify his point regarding SOLAS?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-27a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015052700002#MM00600"><p>It is my understanding that SOLAS put out a request for proposals regarding apprenticeships.  Of all the submissions that came in, the further education sectors accounted for just 14%.  The third level sector made up the majority and the private sector also submitted a significant number.  I spoke to principals at the meeting to which I referred who told me they were never consulted on the matter.  There is something terribly wrong if SOLAS is looking for ideas but neglecting to consult the people at the coalface.  The Minister of State and I might discuss this issue at another time.  My time will be up if I do not move on.</p> <p>During my trip to Finland, I visited a further education college outside Helsinki which has 11,000 students, 900 teachers and a budget of &euro;71.9 million per annum.  That is further education as we all would like to see it.  While I realise we cannot afford that level of investment, it is what we should be aspiring to.  In my final speech as president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, I spoke about how further education in Ireland must change.  It needs to shake off the shackles of second level education and become a sector in its own right.  It must deliver longer hours and more weeks of learning per year.  If that means changing contracts of employment, then it must be done.  I am sure the unions will be willing to negotiate.</p> <p>Teacher registration has professionalised the further education sector through the Teaching Council but also restricted its ability to develop programmes.  I am talking here about high-tech programmes.  My final job in D&uacute;n Laoghaire VEC, as it was then, was to develop a course in cloud computing in association with VMware, the intention being that I would deliver the course myself.  Unfortunately, the course died when I was elected president of the TUI.  Nobody would take it up because continuing professional development was required.  We have to fund the teachers in further education.  Springboard is great if one has a third level qualification.  If one does not, something better is needed.  We need to create a space where the further education colleges can employ experts in the industry to come in and deliver modules rather than have the shackles of the Teaching Council preventing them from developing.</p> <p>Courses in further education cannot all be short ten-week courses, but there is a place for that type of training within the further education and ETB sector.  I went to Limerick Senior College when I was 35 and came out four years later with a degree in economics through the London School of Economics.  That is what we need to be doing.  Online learning is all well and good.  In fact, I pioneered online learning in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in 1996.  While it is great, it is no longer the answer.  We need blended learning, which requires weekend classes where students can go in and meet their teacher face to face.</p> <p>When I became president of the TUI, I wrote to all of the education partners, including the Department, school managers, my fellow trade unionists and so on, proposing that we all go into a room for a day, leave our respective hats outside and between us come up with a model for our ideal education system.  That suggestion received a very flat response right across the sector, including from some of my trade union colleagues.  The Minister of State is brave enough to take a similar initiative.  Will he throw open a conference and invite all the relevant parties to participate?  I certainly am prepared to leave my trade union flags outside.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleagues, Senators Jim D'Arcy and Terry Brennan, on proposing and seconding the motion before the House.  This is a very good news story.  It is delivering in a big way and making a huge contribution to reducing unemployment levels, which have come down from 15.1% to 9.9%.  As we saw in the figures published by the CSO in the last 24 hours, the number of unemployed people fell by 45,000 in the 12 months to the end of quarter 1, bringing the annual net increase in employment to over 40,000 and indicating that we have 1.93 million people at work.</p> <p>Back in 2011, when the country was on its knees, the Government rightly acknowledged that our talented workforce was not going to find work in construction, manufacturing and retail, which were experiencing real difficulty.  It provided 6,000 places, which were announced by the then Minister, to upskill and reskill people in order to address the skills shortages in certain areas.  We must all acknowledge the fine job that was done by the Higher Education Authority in managing the scheme and, indeed, the 42 educational institutions that have offered a wide range of courses.  We judge these things by results.  The fact that more than 21,000 people participated in 812 courses in those 42 institutions I mentioned is certainly an indication that there was an appetite for this course.  It was easy to access, and the fact that it was provided without any fees was certainly a major plus.</p> <p>A very interesting statistic is that more than 54% of people who graduated from the courses are earning over &euro;25,000 per annum today, and 11% are earning over &euro;43,000.  Around 40% of those who participated in courses were in employment within six weeks and there was a significant level of self-employment, as has already been noted.  I find that element particularly pleasing.  We want to encourage entrepreneurship and to encourage people to consider providing employment for themselves and, hopefully, creating an additional job or two.  The Action Plan for Jobs, which is an all-of-government response to the crisis, is placing an emphasis on all aspects of our economy.  Hopefully we will continue to see progress being made and we will hit the target of full employment by 2018.</p> <p>The feedback from people who have participated in the Springboard programme is excellent.  Some 98% of the 2014 graduates were willing to recommend Springboard to others who wished to reskill for employment, and 73% of graduates felt their career prospects were much better six weeks after the course's completion.</p> <p>My colleagues referred to a number of issues.  I particularly want to refer to the points made by Senator Quinn on the need for us, as a country, to invest more in and place much more emphasis on foreign languages.  We all know many of the job opportunities in the future will be in China, other parts of Asia and parts of the developing world.  We need to spend much more of our resources on equipping our young people to seek those opportunities in other countries but also, as jobs are located here from some of those foreign countries, we need to have the skills to fill the opportunities that arise.</p> <p>I agree very much with Senator Mooney in regard to the many young people in this country who are non-academic and have lower skills levels and lower educational attainment.  I believe we need to focus on those people.  In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and up to 2000, in my own town there were three major manufacturing companies that provided a lot of, if one likes, low-level manufacturing jobs for young people who had left school, some with disabilities, who could be trained on the job.  They made a real and meaningful contribution to the workforce and, indeed, played a major role in society.  Today, unfortunately, those opportunities are not there.  Many young people are falling through the cracks and are not getting an opportunity to participate fully in the workforce.  We need to invest more heavily in further education for these people and also to devise an opportunity to give them a chance to gain the work experience that will enable them to obtain employment in an appropriate setting.</p> <p>I wish the Minister of State well in everything he is doing.  I hope the recently announced Springboard Plus programme will achieve its goals and that we will be back here in the near future hoping to build on its successes as we go forward.</p></speech>

I want to thank Senator Jim D'Arcy and other colleagues for putting forward this motion, which gives us a great opportunity to discuss the success of Springboard and the whole initiative in that regard.  It is also an opportunity to contribute to the debate and to acknowledge all the great work that was done by many people around this initiative.</p> <p>Springboard is one of the best initiatives I have come across.  When in opposition, I often spoke about trying to get good value for money, and if we can solve two problems with one initiative it is a great idea.  In this case, we are doing that.  We are getting people who are unemployed back into work - a new career or a new start - but we are also filling a skills gap.  Industry and business do not have the skills they need, and they need a quick conversion course, such as Springboard's ICT conversion course, to provide those skills.  Therefore, we are solving two problems with the same money, which is what we should try to do across as many Departments as possible.</p> <p>It is a great initiative and one I cannot compliment enough.  I was delighted to be part of the recent launch and to have been part of the team working on that.  The HEA does great work, with Tom Boland and Mary-Liz Trant leading the charge for Springboard, along with Senator Feargal Quinn and his team of experts, who are judging this and choosing the successful people to provide the Springboard courses each year.  They have done great work in recent years and I want to compliment them on that.  It is a very sound programme.  Senators Craughwell and Cummins are right that anyone who tries to detract from this is wrong or misinformed and needs to be corrected.</p> <p>The whole agenda of further education and training needs to be talked up a lot more, as people can sometimes turn their backs on it.  Senator Mooney is right in saying that people did turn their backs on it during the boom times, when it was put to one side and forgotten about.  It is a question of the blend.  We will only solve our skills shortage with a blend of further education and training, as well as higher education.  This must come at the right time and it will suit different people in different places.  It is wrong to say that further education and training is only for those who are not academically suited.  Further education and training is suited to anybody, no matter what their academic skills are.  For me, further education and training is a great way to develop a career.  If people want to add higher education they can do that, and go up to any level they want.  It is not only for those who are not academically suited.  That is the problem.  Most of us start our comments with that line, but we need to make sure that is not the way it happens.  Very often, a start on a PLC course is the best way to prepare a person to go on to higher education, get them ready for university and enable them to cope with all the demands there.  A start on a PLC course can equip people to become very academically minded and ready to take on any course, including a degree course at any university.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what we need to understand.  It is a question of the mindset and conversation about this.  We are spending almost a billion on further education and training, FET.  Although Senators may not realise it, we have a massive spend.  We do not sell it enough or explain what it actually stands for, where it is or where we want to go with it.  I would disagree with the Senator's report of people's thoughts on SOLAS.  I think SOLAS is one of the best authorities we have set up and it is only warming up.  There is a great team of people there who are very in tune with what is needed.  They have their strategy plans and their five-year plans and lots of consultation; they are on the ball and are ready for this.  It will mean changes in many cases with education and training boards, ETBs, that might not always like it.  As the driving authority behind FET, SOLAS is right and I am happy with its work.  I would dispute anyone who says they have doubts around it.  </p><p>I asked the Senator to repeat what he said about the number of ETBs that applied to be part of these new apprenticeships.  There is something wrong there; it is a wrong statement.  It was not a secret that there was a public call-out for anybody to submit a proposal through the new apprenticeship council.  There is new, independent apprenticeship council to design and take proposals for all the new types of apprenticeship.  Its work is facilitated by SOLAS.</p><p>We really want to change our apprenticeship agenda.  For too long we have had a limited number of apprenticeships - fewer than 30 in the areas of construction, mechanical and engineering.  That is not good enough.  We are looking to Germany and Austria, where there is a choice of 300 or 400.  While I cannot see us having that number - I do not think we would need it - there is no reason we could not have up to 100 types of apprenticeship route.</p><p>Over half of the 86 proposals that came in were industry led, as they should be.  Apprenticeships have to be employer led or they will not work, although they should be facilitated by ETBs, institutes of technology and everybody else.  The ETBs should develop and provide the courses.  I refute the comment that they were not encouraged.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, took great time to pick the right people and, as far as possible, every sector is represented on the apprenticeship council.</p></speech>

It is wrong to say they were not asked.  The ETBs are on the apprenticeship council and Martin O'Brien does a great job there.  I spoke about the apprenticeship council's call for proposals at every speech I gave, and I gave a lot speeches in the eight months since I took up this job.  It was definitely no secret and if people in the industry did not know there was a call, there is something wrong.</p></speech>

If those in the industry and the sector are on top of their jobs, they should know about it.  It would certainly not be the fault of SOLAS.</p> <p>The motion is about trying to expand Springboard to cater for other areas.  Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned the issue of low-paid workers and this is a perfect opportunity to look at that through the new skills strategy and the reform.  The motive of the Government parties for the past four or five years was to tackle unemployment.  We came in with unemployment at 15% and heading for 20% - that is what everyone said and no one disputed those figures.  Our aim had to be to get unemployment back down and give long and short-term unemployed people an opportunity to get back into a job.  A big part of that was upskilling and re-skilling people and that is what Springboard was there for.  It was targeted generally at those who were unemployed.  One does not have to be unemployed to do an ICT conversion course.</p> <p>There is still a long way to go, as 10% unemployment is still far too high and there are loads of people out there who want a job.  Now, however, we need to focus on upskilling people who are in employment, such as low-paid workers and others who need to keep their job in a company, for whom upskilling or retraining by getting involved in FET is the only way to have a safe career.  Everyone has to be constantly upskilling now and moving with the times, no matter who or what they are.  That is the agenda.</p> <p>I would agree with the motive of the motion.  The idea is right and if we have Springboard or some other initiative, that is where we are going.  I will come back to the success of Springboard.  As regards the jobs end of it, we have had the Action Plan for Jobs process.  Although people laughed and saw red and so on, most people now accept that it worked.  It focused the minds of every Government Department, every Government agency and many beyond that.  It is up to all of us to try and turn around the jobs crisis.</p> <p>The target set out in the Action Plan for Jobs was to create 100,000 jobs by 2016.  I was concerned the target was high - it had to be ambitious but I was worried the Government would be accused of not achieving it.  Although most people did not think it was possible, the figure of 100,000 was reached a couple of weeks ago in the private sector.  All of us have helped through our strategies, documents and reports.  The Government's job was to create the environment, not to create the jobs.  The private sector has created over 100,000 net new jobs on top of job losses.  We have had over 30,000 people leaving the public sector and many job losses in that period.  We are now back at a little over 1.9 million people at work and our target is 2.1 million people.  We will only achieve that if we are able to upskill workers and get those who are unemployed back into a job.</p> <p>We also need to bring people home, an issue close to Senator Mooney's heart.  We will not achieve our target if we do not attract at least 100,000 people back home to take up jobs.  While those targets are for 2018, we want to go further by 2020.  To get to full employment - where everyone who wants a job has one - by 2018, we will need lots of new skills developed as many new jobs will come on stream.  There are not enough people in the domestic market to fill all those jobs.</p> <p>There are options here and the achievement of the 100,000 target proves that full employment by 2018 is possible.  I am working with all the companies, organisations and Departments in the sector and have no doubt it will be achieved.  We aim to fill as many as possible of those jobs from the domestic market.  That brings us back to the success of Springboard and other initiatives.  When I got this job from the Taoiseach, the message was very clear that we cannot have a situation in which there are thousands of jobs created that cannot be filled by people from the domestic market.  That means people who are living here and coming through our education system; it does not matter what nationality they are.  There is a major skills gap which we are trying to fill through ICT courses, Springboard, Momentum, Pathways to Work and all the other initiatives, by bringing people close to a job, into a job or into work placements with companies.</p> <p>There has been a lot of reform in all our agencies.  The ETBs, which were previously the VECs, have gone from 33 to 16 in number.  It was a difficult time for everybody with all the change over the past two or three years - SOLAS is only here since 2013.  The ETBs have only just finished going through their change and there are still staffing issues to be sorted out.  I thank everyone involved in that reform, which has put us in the position to be able to take on the skills gap and close it.</p> <p>All our educational partners - the ETBs, ITs, PLC providers and higher education institutions - have become more industry focused and outward focused.  We need to engage with industry to know what its needs are and provide the necessary skills.  While education is not just about taking up a job, that is a major part of it.  We must talk to employers regularly and link with them.  Many of Senators have mentioned that the Springboard courses are designed in conjunction with employers, as are many of our other programmes.  That is where we have to be and we now have the reforms to do it and to drive on.  We should let SOLAS do its work as the authority behind this.  We should listen to and engage with employers at every point along the way.  There is no point in turning out graduates in the wrong area as they are just going to go abroad.  That is not going to serve us.  While we are making progress, there is work to do.</p> <p>A couple of other comments were made and I will go through them as best I can if I have time.  Senator Quinn referred to the issue of qualifying criteria for the ICT conversion courses.  People do not have to be on social welfare to qualify.  To be able to retain social welfare in the form of a back to education allowance, a person has to be able to show they have been on the live register for nine of the previous 12 months.  I am assuming that is the criteria to which the Senator is referring and it is something we should look at.  I do not like these cut-offs where someone does not qualify because they are a week or a month short.  To be clear, it is possible to qualify for one of those courses without being on social welfare. </p> <p>One of the good aspects of Springboard is that it is open to self-employed people whose company went wrong for whatever reason.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They can now participate on a Springboard course, be retrained, acquire a new skill and start a new career.  People have had great success from participating in that initiative.  The self-employed often feel left out and that the country has neglected them.  In some cases they may be right and in other cases they might not, but the Springboard initiative is open to everybody.  One need not be in receipt of a social welfare payment to participate in it, but one has to sign on for credits.  In the past one had to be in receipt of a social welfare payment before one could qualify for it, but now it is sufficient for people to be signing on for credits.  Therefore, some progress has been made.</p><p>Senator Quinn, Senator Craughwell and others mentioned the shortage of foreign language skills.  That issue has been brought to my attention by quite a number of companies.  We all know about that and have plenty of evidence on it because we are constantly checking the data and analysing what is needed.  A new modern language strategy is being designed and worked on by the Department of Education and Skills to cater for all levels of education right throughout the system to examine how we can tackle this issue.  We will not be able to fill all the jobs that have a language demand because in some cases the companies require native-level proficiency in speaking a language, and people who are not from the country whose language is required might never be able to achieve that standard.  Learning foreign languages does not sit easy with Irish people, but we have to change that mindset.  I remember discussing this with the Higher Education Authority a number of years ago at a committee and asking why we were not providing options for students to study foreign languages, but it turned out that the options are provided and students are not selecting them.  The universities and institutes of technology have courses with a foreign language component but students are not selecting those courses because they are avoiding the requirement to study a foreign language.  We have to get the message into the heads of students and their parents that if a student takes up a foreign language he or she is likely to have a better, stronger or more secure career because there is a demand for people with language skills.  However, students are not doing that and we have to work on it.  I understand this issue must be tackled at primary level into secondary and on to third level.</p><p>Similarly, in the area of information technology, an IT deficiency cannot be solved at third level; IT must be a feature of primary and secondary level.  Hopefully, we can reflect the change that is needed in the business strategy that will be coming out.  There is no doubt that we must tackle that issue.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of new Irish or non-Irish people are living and working in this country.  Some of them are in low-paid jobs and some are in well-paid jobs, but they have language skills that we need at the higher end.  We must be prepared to work with those people and try to reskill or convert them over and let them fill the jobs for which there is a language skill demand.  Their jobs would then be freed up for others to take up and start off in.  There is that category.  We will not solve the language problem with our new strategy in the next two or three years - it will take a long-term solution - but we need short-term solutions to fill those jobs.  People living in this country are well fit to take them up.  There is an onus on all of us to get our heads around that and put an effort into joining the dots.  Hopefully, we can do that.</p><p>Deputy Maurice Cummins spoke about the massaging of figures and asked if the figures were real in terms of the jobs.  I dealt with that point.  Springboard is a great initiative.  I want to be clear on this.  People often question whether the 100,000-plus net new jobs that have been created are real jobs and well-paid jobs.  They are real, well-paid jobs and the majority of them are full-time.  More than half of them have been created through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland - these jobs are generally regarded as well-paid jobs, and they are full-time.  It is often said that we are taking people off the live register with activation schemes, but we are not.  To give members a rough idea of the figures, during the so-called boom years, approximately 75,000 people were on labour activation schemes, and the figure now is approximately 80,000.  It is not that 100,000 people have been put on activation schemes - that is not the case.  There was always a need for activation schemes and there always will be a need for them.  There is always an onus on us to constantly tweak them and make them better and bring people closer to a job, and that is what we must work on.</p><p>That brings me on to the JobBridge scheme, of which some contributors were critical, and the scheme that was mentioned by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Kathryn Reilly, who quoted the Nevin Institute's report.  I have read that report and I spoke to those who were involving in writing it.  They admit that the scheme was brought in in a hurry.  It was not ever going to be perfect, but it served quite well at the time.  They say it needs to be reformed and changed.  Nobody is against that.  The Department of Social Protection has agreed to examine it to see if it can be tweaked or improved.  It can be open to abuse in some cases.  An impression has been given that everyone is abusing it, but that is not the case.  JobBridge is an amazing initiative.  The idea for developing it came through our committee, and Members may recall that we recommended an examination of the internships used abroad.  We developed JobBridge to give people a chance to get close to working and to get into a job.  Most employers will say it is not sufficient for a person to have completed college and have a slip of paper certifying that; they also need to have job experience.  People are getting that now through JobBridge.  It is wrong to say it has been abused right, left and centre.  It has been abused by some, who are being dealt with when caught - and rightly so - but the majority do not abuse it and they do quite well out of it.  More than 60% of people get a job from it eventually or end up in employment.  That is extremely high compared to labour activation measures internationally.  I would defend it while acknowledging that we can always improve it by tweaking it, which we will do.  It should not be claimed that everybody is abusing it, because that would be wrong and would be unfair to all those who have done quite well out of what is quite a good scheme.</p><p>I want to make sure I cover all the issues that have been raised.  I dealt with the skills gap.  The issue of apprenticeships was raised.  To update members, we are moving to a new type of apprenticeship.  The apprenticeship councils were set up.  Members might pass on this information to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, who has left the Chamber.  Eighty-six submissions have been received, and these are being analysed and worked on by the apprenticeship council with the assistance of SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills.  They will bring forward their recommendations to myself and Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in mid- to late June, and we will then make a decision on which of them can be rolled out quickly.  I would hope that we will have some new apprenticeships on offer this autumn and winter, and certainly in 2016 there will be a roll-out.  With some luck, most of the 86 submissions may be taken into account, although probably not all of them because quite a number of them are in certain areas, but we will work on that and add to that.  The rolling out of apprenticeships is taking place.  We should discuss apprenticeships further, because it is a very good way to go.  I note that Senator Leyden is nodding at me.  The ESB is leading the way in this regard, having announced another 300 new apprenticeships.  I was at the launch of that announcement a few months ago.  Eircom and other companies are doing the same.  I will call on more State bodies to take on apprenticeships.  This is the way we will proceed.  The blend of vocational training and higher education is the perfect way for individuals to develop a skill and a career, and it is important to work with industry to create jobs by closing the gap they have in filling jobs.</p><p>There was talk of job losses in Monaghan and so on.  I believe we can certainly find a solution to those job losses, because people are highly skilled and trained.  We will work with industry to try to get the qualifications of those in employment accredited and upgraded.  Many people with great qualifications have been working in companies for 20 or 30 years, but those qualifications are not written down as such.  We have to work with them to get that done as well.</p><p>The national talent drive is part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  It involves filling gaps locally.  In the short term we will work with companies where they have to bring in skills from abroad.  We will change the permit system to allow for that in the short term, on condition that those people who come in are part of the retraining and upskilling initiative, and we will work to make sure the skills are provided in the domestic market as well.</p><p>There is a good deal of public consultation taking place though all the elements of our strategy. The issue of post leaving certificate courses, PLCs, was raised.  I do not believe we cut the number of the PLC places last year, but I may stand corrected on the figures; I think the figures were the same.  It is wrong to say they were cut, and they certainly should not be.</p></speech>

I agree with the value of career guidance, but we did not cut the funding for it.  One of the first aspects of SOLAS's work this year is a review of PLC places to determine whether we are getting value for money, which I believe we are, whether we need more places and whether we can add to the number.  A major review of the provision of PLC places is under way this year.  The findings of that might involve the reallocation of places around the country, in that some areas may need more places and other areas may not be availing of all the places they have.  I have three letters on my desk this week from bodies seeking extra PLC places.  In certain areas the offering of PLC places may not be taken up.  That will be investigated.  The PLC sector is a very important part of the education strategy.  I want to be clear in stating that the numbers were not cut this year.</p> <p>I have continued on this for too long, and I might return to other comments that were made.  The general consensus is that people would agree that Springboard is doing great work.  We want to build on that and to develop similar new initiatives.  We have much to go on with in this area.  It is a very important area and I will be fighting for more resources and money for it.  We have brought the apprenticeship issue to Cabinet and they were all every enthusiastic about it.  I said, "If that is the case, write the cheque and put the money behind it."  Pressure will be put on to have increased spending in this sector.  I think the Members would agree with that and that this is the way to do it.  We  have a major issue with jobs coming on stream and we have people who are still unemployed in certain areas, and we have to close that gap and bring them together.  I look forward to working with the Members on this and coming back to them on it.  I might have missed some of the questions that were raised, but I will certainly come back at a later stage and I can also meet people individually.</p></speech>

To address Senator Craughwell's point, Oscar Wilde said that he could not help liking anyone who liked him.  I thank the Senator for his generous remarks and will reciprocate by saying that he is extremely interested in education and training boards, ETBs, and further education and training, as is every Member present.  For example, Senator Mooney has made good contributions on this matter.</p> <p>As a member of the Council of Europe, I contributed to a report by Dr. Piotr Wach, another member, on raising the status of vocational education and training.  I will circulate it to Members, including the Minister of State.  In the German model, there is a 50:50 split between further education and degree-level education, which arose because of its guild system.  This model seems to be working.  With the Minister of State as the pilot, we are increasing the status and value of further education and training.  It is the way forward.  The people training in further education and training centres will be the millionaires and entrepreneurs who employ degree holders in the years to come.  We must continue supporting and enhancing this sector.</p> <p>Mr. Martin O'Brien from Monaghan was mentioned.  What a man.  All of the ETBs' CEOs and members are working so hard that the future is bright.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will agree, all of the Senators present have been generous in their comments on Springboard and have resisted the temptation to kick us in the shins.  That is because, first, they are fair people and, second, it is a good programme.  The Minister of State has, in principle, supported my suggestion of considering ways of extending the concept of Springboard to the low-paid so as to provide increased mobility in the jobs market and, in an aspirational society, not to close doors on anyone.  This is the great value of our new system.  One can do an apprenticeship and still be on the ladder to gaining a PhD.</p> <p>I was captivated by the Minister of State's response, enthusiasm, expertise, detailed knowledge and passion for increasing every worker's self-esteem.</p></speech>
