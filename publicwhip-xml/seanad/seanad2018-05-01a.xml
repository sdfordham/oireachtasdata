People with disabilities do not have confidence that the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be ratified.  I can see no reason why it could not be ratified now.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, came to the House for statements on the ratification of the convention on 21 March 2018, he gave two reasons.  He accepted that it was in the roadmap in 2015 that the optional protocol would be ratified when the convention was ratified but stated his current focus had to be the ratification of the convention in the first instance.  During that debate, however, he said that the instrument of deposition had been lodged with the UN on 20 March.  In effect, the convention was ratified.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland's instrument ratification has been lodged with the UN and, therefore, the ratification was completed in March.  We have moved from ratification to implementation.  The reason for not ratifying the protocol does not stand.  The Minister's second reason was "the need for substantive cultural change" and he went on to say, "Work is continuing on the final reforms needed for Ireland's compliance with the convention's requirements".  Every provision in the convention relates to compliance and becoming compliant and not to complied with everything before the convention is ratified.</p><p>The optional protocol is an instrument that gives people with disabilities the right to complain to the UN disabilities committee when they have exhausted all the normal complaints procedures within their state.  Article 3 provides that the committee will confidentially write to the state party and give it six months to respond.  There is a long, drawn-out period before anything gets to that stage.</p><p>The deprivation of liberty Bill and disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2016 are to be passed before the end of the year.  I would like the Minister of State to confirm that commitment.  Given it is intended to have both Bills enacted by the end of the year and the State has a disability inclusion strategy of which he is proud, that gives a defence to the State if issues are raised.  He can say he is on the journey, which is what the convention is about.  Why not ratify the optional protocol now?  Are the Minister of State and the Government up for it to be ratified now?  Are they in the space to say, "Let us do this"?  Do his officials want to have it ratified?  The Minister of State could quickly and easily, with no cost or downside to the State, ratify the optional protocol now, which would give people confidence, given the ratification of the convention has dragged on for years, that the Government is stepping up and getting in front of this issue.  That would be what the Minster of State described as "a critical cultural change".  He should lead from the front.  Let us get this done and say to people that Ireland is proud of its progress to date and is comfortable with being held to account internationally.  Nobody gets it right every time when we go in front of a jury but the Minister of State should be comfortable going there.  That would be huge.</p><p>I have five questions.  Will the Minister of State agree to ratify the protocol now?  What reasons does he have for not ratifying the convention?  Ireland must lodge its first report on 19 April 2020.  By what date will the optional protocol be ratified if that is not done now?  Will it be the day after the report is lodged?  Will he confirm that the deprivation of liberty Bill and the disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2016 will be enacted this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important topic.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the issue of Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol to the UN convention.  I always lead on this issue.  The Independent Alliance did not hang around to ratify it whereas many of the political parties whose members are jumping up and down and having a go at me ignored it for ten years.  Some of them were Ministers during that time and, therefore, I will not take lectures from them.</p> <p>The ratification of the convention was a key commitment in the programme for Government and it has been one of my highest priorities since becoming Minister of State.  I am pleased to have delivered on that commitment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was privileged to represent the Government at the United Nations headquarters on 19 April - the day the convention came into force for Ireland.  That was an historic day and most of the disability leaders and organisations I met in New York over those two days were very impressed with Ireland's role and also with Ireland's services being well ahead of many other countries that had ratified some years previously.</p><p>Ratification followed a delay of many years and took much hard work.  I am grateful to the committed family members, carers, public representatives and activists who worked tirelessly to campaign for ratification.  Both the convention and the optional protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which require substantive cultural change.  Fundamental to that are the concepts of freedom, autonomy and independence, recognising the right of people with disabilities to make decisions for themselves, rather than have decisions made for them.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that I have recently received the report from the task force on personalised budgets and will shortly be bringing a memo to Cabinet on the matter.</p><p>I will respond to some of the points made by the Senator.  I intend to have all the legislation in place as quickly as possible.  I intend to continue the public consultation with all the disability groups and the senior citizens' groups.  As the Senator knows there are currently 92 signatories to the optional protocol, whereas 176 states have ratified the convention.  A clear timescale has been drawn up to address the remaining implementation issues in line with the principles of progressive realisation of services which operates in respect of compliance with the convention.  Priority drafting has been approved for the disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and a stand-alone Bill to deal with the deprivation of liberty.  Some &euro;3 million has been allocated in 2018 for the establishment of the decision-support service.  A lot of work is going on all the time and I take a step-by-step approach to the issue.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the convention will be one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.  In the early implementation phase, it is essential that resources are focused on the enhancement of services and not diverted into additional areas such as servicing the optional protocol before we are fully ready.  That is the key thing.  I will opt in when I am ready.  That is the best thing to do.  That is an example of best practice and other countries have done that.</p><p>For this reason, I see a phased approach as the most practical and realistic way of moving ahead.  While the optional protocol is not being ratified at this time, it will be ratified as soon as possible when I am satisfied that certain things are in place.  At the latest this will follow completion of Ireland&rsquo;s first reporting cycle which should be within two to three years.  This will provide us with an opportunity to identify any remaining actions needed for the highest possible level of compliance with the convention.</p><p>The Senator can take it that I will be opting in when I am ready and when things are in place.  That is the approach the Government will take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#D00200"><p>I asked the Minister of State four questions.  One was if he would do it now; obviously the answer to that is "No".  In his reply the Minister of State said he would opt in when he was ready.  He also stated that he would do so when he is "satisfied that certain things are in place".  What are these certain things?  He has not told us what they are.  He has also said that it would be within two to three years.  We will report by 19 April 2020.  Will it be 21 April 2020 or will it be a year or more later?  What things is he still awaiting to be in place?</p> <p>Over 90 states ratified the optional protocol at the same time as they ratified the convention.  At the start of his contribution, the Minister of State said he would not be lectured from other parties about what they committed to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why does it bother him what other states have or have not done?  There is no real reason that we cannot do this.  I am pleading with the Minister of State.  This can be ratified now.  If somebody started a complaint today, it would be years before he or she could take it anywhere, and the State then gets six months when it brings it there.  The Minister of State should give people a break and let people see he is on their side.</p></speech>

If the Senator wants to see a recent report on what I have delivered in government, I will send him a copy tomorrow morning.  The Senator referred to what has been put in place.  The decision support service is one thing I feel very strongly about.  We have already appointed the director but we have not got the right person yet for manager, and it has taken longer than I had anticipated.  There are real issues out there.</p> <p>In regard to ratification, I am not ready to ratify the protocol now and I gave the Senator a direct answer - "No" - and outlined practical reasons for that.  While I accept a commitment was given in the programme for Government to ratify the optional protocol at the same time as the convention, my recent focus has been on ratifying the convention as a first step.</p></speech>

The Government is working hard to address all these issues.  Those are the reasons.</p> <p>An analysis of jurisprudence under the optional protocol indicates that 14 complaints have been heard since 2010, with nine upheld.  The average time for complaints to be adjudicated is between two and three years, and I accept that point.  Cases have included issues we are aware of, including deprivation of liberty, participation of deaf persons in jury duty, accessibility issues, work and employment, reasonable accommodation, medical treatment and prison conditions.</p> <p>Becoming party to the convention holds us to international account in regard to our commitments to improve services and the lives of persons with disabilities.  I am pleased that Ireland has finally submitted to that degree of accountability.  I can assure the Senator I will continue to work to ensure that it is maintained and further augmented by the optional protocol following consideration of Ireland's first report.</p></speech>

In this era of Brexit, my call to explore the potential benefits of rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations continues to provoke an interesting response.  Many of us here are democratic Irish nationalists and proud Europeans but we live in a time when our future relationships with Britain will be shaped by Brexit.  That is why I believe it is very important that we seek to develop and nurture new relationships.</p> <p>The stark reality of Brexit is already biting at fundamental levels.  Here is just one example.  Until recently an average of 26 daily meetings took place between Irish and UK officials.  Those regular meetings between British and Irish diplomats and politicians at a European level were instrumental in fostering good relations and understanding between the two islands.  In my personal opinion, I believe Ireland and the UK's joint entry into the EEC 45 years ago paved the way for the Anglo-Irish and Good Friday agreements, both of which have delivered peace and a shared future to our two islands.</p> <p>In terms of the relationship building, I do not think it is a coincidence that Ireland has recently applied for observer status to join the Francophonie, a club of French-speaking states with 57 members which is a Commonwealth-style organisation.  As a way of fostering links with French-speaking countries, it is a move which is strategic and welcome.  I have consistently encouraged debates on the merits of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations.  Indeed, I believe that, by doing so, the Republic of Ireland could pioneer the way for new relationships with Commonwealth countries, which include the UK, and with the EU itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Republic already has strong links with Commonwealth countries in terms of aid, trade, politics, education, common legal systems, the diaspora and sport.  Notably, 70% of the people born on the island of Ireland residing overseas live in Commonwealth countries.  It is estimated that more than 20 million people of Irish origin live within Commonwealth countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  With a combined population of 2.3 billion, the Commonwealth comprises 53 countries, 31 of which are republics like us.</p><p>In foreign aid support, the Commonwealth has helped to lift many countries out of poverty and it counts among its member states not just developing nations, but also many high-tech countries such as India and South Africa.</p><p>For those who are not familiar with the Commonwealth, it is a goodwill organisation that performs a positive global role.  It is not the British Commonwealth of old, but the modern Commonwealth of Nations, to which it was renamed in 1949 to accommodate republics such as ours.  It is also important to say that the UK is just one of 53 member states and accounts for less than 3% of the population.  Suffice it to say that, while Britain is still an important member of the Commonwealth, it is no longer the boss.  Furthermore, the Queen is a titular head who carries no power.  She is just a symbol of free association within Commonwealth countries, the majority of which are republics, with five having monarchs of royal households not associated with the UK's.</p><p>Let us be clear.  I am a realist, so I know that the debate about Commonwealth membership for the Republic of Ireland will involve many issues, complexities and sensitivities.  However, I have a firm conviction that, if we put our old prejudices to one side when we consider the merits of rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations, we will find much value in what I am proposing.</p><p>The most important reason I have called for a debate on rejoining the Commonwealth is that, if we truly desire a united Ireland, one Ireland or a shared island, we must show our unionist friends that we are not afraid to take this leap of faith.  We could look forward to our two islands co-operating North-South and east-west on many new fronts, with sport being just one example.  Can we not envisage the possibility of seeing an island of Ireland team in, for example, hockey and many other sports competing in future Commonwealth games?  Can we not dare to dream that such possibilities could help to pave the way for an all-island soccer team competing in future World Cup competitions and European championships?  This is worthy of serious consideration.</p></speech>

He is also passionate about preparing for all of the eventualities of Brexit and ensuring that we continue to work with the UK and have the closest possible relationship with it.</p> <p>We have strong international relations across the globe - bilaterally with individual countries through our diplomatic networks and multilaterally through our membership of various international organisations, for example, the UN, where we have relationships with a broad spectrum of countries, many of which are members of the Commonwealth.  Last year, the Taoiseach announced a doubling of our global footprint.  Work has begun on the initial phase of this expansion of Ireland's diplomatic network with new embassies in Santiago in Chile, Bogot&aacute; in Colombia, Amman in Jordan and Wellington in New Zealand, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Canada, and Mumbai, India, opening this year.  Further expansion will be considered by the Government and take into account Ireland's political, trading, cultural and other strategic interests and priorities.</p> <p>The UK's decision to leave the EU is regrettable and has serious implications for Ireland.  Indeed, Brexit is not good for anyone.  However, we must maintain a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with the UK.  We are fully committed to developing and enhancing that relationship over the coming years no matter what the outcome.  In the context of the UK's exit from the European Union, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the EU.</p> <p>While the UK and Ireland share a turbulent past, our relationship in recent times has been close.  For example, a number of successful high-level visits have had a positive impact on our relationship, most notably the state visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011 and the reciprocal state visit by President Higgins to the UK in 2014.  More recently, the President travelled to Dumfries House in Scotland at the invitation of the Prince of Wales.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most recently, President Higgins travelled to Dumfries House in Scotland at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, following the visit of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of  Cornwall to Ireland last year, their third visit in as many years.  Relations are good and strong and of course we want to keep them that way.  </p><p>Numerous channels will continue to exist for Irish-British engagement and both Governments continue to make extensive and effective use of these.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional co-operation on an east-west basis including through the British-Irish Council, BIC.  In addition, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.  These structures have, for the most part, shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.  In addition, we will also explore other avenues to maintain the &ldquo;habit of co-operation&rdquo; that currently exists where Ministers regularly meet their counterparts and work together in Brussels.  This deeper working relationship should allow for co-operation across a broad range of issues of shared interest many of which the Senator has raised with us today.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree that the doubling of our global footprint and work with the expansion of Ireland's diplomatic network is very welcome.  We are now at a place where we can make a change as leaders for good throughout the world.  Joining the Francophonie and Commonwealth of Nations and many other organisations will be of benefit.  I am also delighted we are fully committed to developing and enhancing our relationship with the UK over the coming years and to developing the closest possible relationship between the UK and the EU.  The visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011 and the subsequent state visit by President Higgins to the UK in 2014 was a groundbreaking change in culture in our two islands.  We need a lot more of that.  Numerous channels will be open to us in that regard but we cannot do too much through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which is meeting in Sligo in a month's time, and the various cross-border institutions, North-South and east-west.  We must ensure that our parliaments and parliamentarians across these two islands work even more closely together in the absence of the UK from the EU.  </p> <p>We had &euro;1 billion of trade every week with the UK.  For centuries, our countries have had a relationship,, albeit not with the levels of trust it should have had.  We took our relationship for granted and despite 200,000 jobs on both sides of these islands and centuries of trade, it is ironic that the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce was only set up in 2011 after the Queen's visit to Ireland.  We need more of such initiatives to break down those barriers of mistrust and allow us to work together North-South and east-west.</p></speech>

We must ensure that our relations stay strong.  We have had a turbulent past but in recent years - in particular through our common membership of the European Union - the United Kingdom has been our closest neighbour, friend and ally in many different areas.  We must ensure that is not affected because of Brexit but that our relations stay strong.</p> <p>While the Government is not considering rejoining the Commonwealth at present, the Embassy of Ireland in London will remain our biggest bilateral embassy globally.  The focus on expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint is key to our foreign policy at present.  Many of the countries and areas under consideration in this regard are members of the Commonwealth and we believe we can develop and enhance our bilateral relationships with them in this manner.  The focus on our relationship with the United Kingdom will continue to be a priority for us, particularly through these difficult negotiations on Brexit.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p></speech>

The context is that Mungret is now a highly built-up residential area, unlike other locations in the country.  A public meeting was held by the group Limerick Against Pollution in the South Court Hotel last Friday night at 7.30 p.m.  More than 300 people across all age groups attended.  It was a very representative group.  These are decent, ordinary people who are worried about the implications of the licence which Irish Cement is seeking in order to convert the Mungret plant from running on fossil fuels to alternative fuels.  This involves, in layman's terms, the burning of tyres.  It will effectively use an existing kiln, which is over 35 years old and which is currently being fired by fossil fuels, to burn tyres.</p><p>I want to raise a couple of points.  Irish Cement is looking at burning 90,000 tonnes per annum.  There is a move away from fossil fuels as a result of carbon credits and so on, however the question is whether what is being proposed is safer or less safe.  There has been very little engagement from Irish Cement.  I personally made contact with it to encourage it to attend the public meeting last Friday night.  It declined.  There has been some engagement, but not enough.  From speaking to residents in the area and, more recently, calling to their homes and meeting them, I know that there is a distinct lack of trust among the public in the area as regards what is happening with the Irish Cement plant.  There is an issue with what residents regard as blow-outs, although Irish Cement say they are not blow-outs.  However, from speaking to people, they are.  There are concerns about the way in which the plant is designed.  People's cars are regularly covered with lime and so forth.  There is a worry.  There are three new schools in the area.  There are many young families and an awful lot of houses which have been built very near the Irish Cement plant.</p><p>How does the Minister intend to regulate these heavy industries in light of environmental concerns?  In respect of the Irish Cement plant more particularly, the council has granted planning permission for the physical storage structure.  However, the operation of the alternative fuels incinerator is licensed by the EPA.  The application is currently before the EPA.  It is due to issue a draft response on 16 May.  That may change.  I encourage people in the area to make submissions.  The question I really want answered is how is it intended to regulate in this area?  </p><p>I brought this issue up previously and the Minister agreed to put extra air monitoring locations into operation, one of which was to be in Mungret.  There is a need for many more.  The outputs from that particular location for the last three months of last year were analysed and the analysis showed spikes.  People need assurance that this area will be properly regulated.  There is a strong need for the EPA to license activities before applications for physical structures are made to the council.  The council should not be able to grant permission if it has any environmental concerns.  The Minister of State might deal with the general point but also comment on the specific licence application Irish Cement has before the EPA.  People in the area have grave concerns that what is being proposed will be more harmful to health.  This is about public health and ensuring that Government policy promotes public health.   We must avoid a situation in which seeking to reduce the use of fossil fuels results in unintended consequences from the burning of alternative fuels.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, who is unavailable.</p> <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the independent statutory body responsible for protecting the environment in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The agency performs a wide range of statutory functions in fulfilment of its mandate.  These include the agency having a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment.  The agency is responsible for issuing industrial emission directive licences, integrated pollution and control, IPC, licences, waste licences, wastewater discharge authorisations, genetically modified organisms authorisations and radiological protection licences.<br/><br/>The EPA is responsible for the licence and enforcement of large industrial plants listed in the first schedule of the EPA Act 1992, as amended.  The Irish Cement site in Mungret falls into this category and is covered by the industrial emissions directive, Directive 2010/75/EU.  This directive specifies the emission limit values that apply on the basis of the best available techniques.  Conditions implementing the directive&rsquo;s requirements are written into the industrial emissions licences granted by the EPA.  Details of current licensed facilities and applications for new and revised licences are available on the agency&rsquo;s website.<br/><br/>I believe it would be useful for me to outline briefly the application process in place for applications for industrial emissions licences, to emphasise the rigour of the process, and the wide scope for public participation in the decision making processes in each case.  Before an application is even made, applicants are required to publish a notice in a local newspaper and to erect a site notice of their intentions.  Then, on making the actual application, the applicant must pay the required fee and provide all the necessary documentation to the agency.  Within eight weeks of the application, the agency is required to publish how it proposes to determine an application.  This stage allows any person or body to make an objection within 28 days, and any such person or body is furthermore entitled to request an oral hearing.  Only then, having considered the application and all objection submissions received, is a final decision on the licence application made by the agency.  This decision is published on the agency&rsquo;s website and any person may then apply to the High Court and seek a judicial review of the validity of the decision.<br/><br/>When operable, such facilities are then subject to ongoing monitoring by the agency.  The agency also encourages public participation in its ongoing regulatory and enforcement activities by welcoming reports from the public of any negative environmental impacts arising from facilities that it licenses, including odours, noise or water pollution.  The Mungret facility is currently the subject of a licence review.  This process allows the public to view documents for this application or to make a submission to the EPA.  The EPA licence reference number for Irish Cement site located in Mungret, Limerick is No. P0030-05, should anyone wish to raise concerns.  The EPA operates in a fully transparent and open manner and publishes comprehensive details about its activities.  Further information is available to the public on <i>www.epa.ie</i>.  The Minister is precluded under legislation from interfering in the agency&rsquo;s licensing decision making process.  The Minister believes that the agency has a sufficient range of powers under the existing legislative code to adequately regulate and monitor such facilities in order to protect the environment and human health, ensure that key standards are met and enable the public, particularly local communities, to input should any issues relating to the day-to-day operation of any facility emerge.</p></speech>

I believe that is not being done by the EPA, certainly not in terms of the Irish Cement site in Limerick.  An emissions monitoring service has only recently been installed in the Mungret area.  That should have been in a long time ago.</p> <p>I want to quickly address three elements.  First, I ask that Irish Cement now engage properly with the residents living in the area on this licence.  It is the minimum they require and should be in the form of a public meeting to address people's concerns and deal with the lack of trust the public in the greater Mungret, Dooradoyle and Raheen area have in what is happening in Irish Cement.  Second, I ask that the Minister of State looks at the laws for the operation of the facility.  The EPA should come before the council looking for permission.  Third, will the Minister of State give a commitment that the level of resources provided to monitor what is happening regarding emissions from heavy industries like the Irish Cement site in Mungret will be enhanced, because as of now it is inadequate?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is about public health and the concerns of people living in the Mungret, Dooradoyle and Raheen areas for themselves and their children.  We cannot have houses built virtually right up alongside the Mungret Irish Cement plant.  People are worried about their health.  It is the least they deserve.  I also encourage those in the area who have concerns to make submissions to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  It is critically important that the EPA grants an oral hearing to the residents and the Limerick Against Pollution group when it makes its draft decision.  These are reasonable people.</p></speech>

I understand the concerns that he has.  He will accept that it is difficult for me to comment on an individual licence application lest I be accused of interfering in the EPA's independent licensing process.  We have to take that on board.</p> <p>I would also point out that while overall compliance with EPA licences is good, the EPA's office of environmental enforcement introduced a new methodology in 2015 for risk-ranking national priority sites, which takes account of enforcement performance giving a timely, dynamic and accurate picture of what regulatory responses should be directed.</p> <p>Targeting actions in the right places is also of critical importance to the EPA in addressing the problems in an effective and efficient manner.  It is placing a particular focus on any licensed industrial waste and wastewater facilities creating a nuisance for adjacent communities.  EPA prosecutions are particularly focused on priority sites.  In 2016, the EPA conducted over 1,500 site visits at licensed facilities and 17 prosecutions were pursued.  Anyone with concerns in respect of the operations of the Mungret facility should raise them directly with the agency.  As the Senator said, people have the opportunity to make submissions as the Senator has done, and to request an oral hearing at which these issues can be aired in public.  I would hope that all parties would engage in processes as required and that the concerns of people in the locality will be taken on board in any decision made by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></speech>

I want to talk to the Minister about the implementation of the report of the working group on the development and sustainable plan for the Mayo campus of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  I will not beat about the bush.  The report recommended that the permanent head of centre be appointed.  I know the post was advertised in September.  Why was it re-advertised in February?  After the short-listing, why was the recruitment process stopped and referred to the governing body?  Why was a decision made to postpone the interview process?  I understand it was referred to the risk unit, where the review took place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Was the review completed?  What were the results of the review?  Can the Minister of State assure me and others that the correct procedures were followed?</p><p>The governing body sub-committee had its first meeting in March, yet I believe there was no consultation with staff members or the programme boards around that.  I am concerned about that.  I am aware that &euro;40,000 was allocated for the promotion but I am concerned about the lack of consultation.  Who decided how that money should be spent?</p><p>I am very concerned that none of the structural repairs have been carried out.  The building required urgent repairs.  The independent external facilitator has not yet been appointed.  I was happy, like many other supporters of the Mayo campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, when the Minister of State and the Government agreed to facilitate the report of the working group.  That group's work is undermined while its recommendations are not implemented.  The recruitment process also concerns me.  Perhaps the Minister of State could speak about some of the points I have raised.</p></speech>

The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, has also been in touch with me in the past day or two.  I have a comprehensive reply but if there are aspects I have not covered at the end, I will make a note and get back to the Senator on them.  I visited Castlebar and saw the work that needs to be done.  I agree that it should be done as quickly as possible.</p> <p>I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the future sustainability of the Castlebar campus of GMIT.  This is the reason the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, established the working group in March 2017 to develop a plan that would safeguard the future of the Castlebar campus.  I also confirm that the Department and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, are focused on ensuring that the recommendations of the working group are implemented as soon as possible and with appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>The GMIT working group was chaired by the HEA and comprised representatives from GMIT, the Department, Mayo County Council and other local stakeholders.  It also comprised representation from the staff and students on the Castlebar campus.  The report of the working group was published in December 2017.  It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo campus.  It also provides a strategic and comprehensive plan to address the financial and sustainability issues which have been experienced by the GMIT Mayo campus in recent years.</p> <p>The working group recommendations are primarily for GMIT to implement.  However, there are recommendations that relate to the Department.  The Department has responded to these as a matter of priority.  To this end, the Department has provided ring-fenced funding of &euro;750,000 for the Castlebar campus for each of the next five years while the plan is being implemented.  Capital funding is also being provided for the replacement of the roof of the GMIT campus, which is currently in need of repair.  The Department and the HEA are working with GMIT to ensure that the other recommendations are being progressed.  One of the significant recommendations was the re-establishment of a sub-committee of the governing body of OMIT to oversee the management and development of the Mayo campus.  This will give campus issues more focus from a governance perspective but will also facilitate the involvement of regional stakeholders within this structure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The group is scheduled to meet again this month.</p><p>Another key recommendation is the appointment of a dedicated permanent head of campus at vice president level.  I understand that the appointment process for this role is under way.  The appointment of an independent external facilitator to oversee the transition to new structural and operational arrangements is another significant recommendation.  The facilitator will play an important role in supporting the implementation of a number of the other working group recommendations.  The facilitator will also contribute to rebuilding relationships where this is necessary.  In that regard, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, wrote to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, in March, requesting that progress be made on the appointment.  The terms of reference for this position are being developed by GMIT in consultation with the HEA.  The HEA will continue to monitor progress made by GMIT in implementing all of the working group's recommendations.  The HEA will report to the Department in the event that progress is not being made in particular areas.</p><p>There has been a significant investment in this process by all relevant stakeholders.  It is in everyone's interest that the recommendations in the review are implemented as soon as possible, and in consultation with those stakeholders.  I would like to thank Senator Conway-Walsh for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter. </p></speech>

Something wrong has happened here.  I ask the Minister of State to investigate, and not to go on what is being presented to her.  She should look behind some of the detail.  The Mayo campus is absolutely integral to the education system in Mayo, particularly because of the cost of accommodation in many of the other towns.  It is hugely important for both adult education and for those trying to access courses.  There is a wonderful staff there.  There are wonderful education opportunities, but we need to implement this report.  It needs to be implemented immediately.  We need to see action, not words.  We need to see that money being spent on the roof and the structural repairs immediately.</p></speech>

I welcome both to the 25th Seanad.  I wish my former colleagues Denis Landy and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh well in their new endeavours.</p> <p>I would like to mention the CervicalCheck scandal.  I commend Vicky Phelan and her family on their bravery in shining a light on this and on following through with their case against the State and the screening company in the High Court.  It is no mean feat taking on the State and large companies backed by resources and insurance funds, especially when liability is contested from the outset and up until the very end.  Listening to Vicky Phelan on the radio, I was amazed at her strength and composure.  She has done the women of Ireland a huge service.  For that, I am very thankful.  I can only imagine the anger she and her family feel owing to her treatment and the failure of the State, via the CervicalCheck programme, to disclose adequately her test results to her on time.  Had it disclosed her results to her when they were available to the programme, her clinical outcome would have been very different.</p> <p>The cervical cancer screening programme was first implemented in the summer of 2008 by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  It was a major step in the provision of health care, particularly women's health care.  It is a screening service that has saved hundreds of lives to date.  At the time the programme was implemented, there were almost 2,000 people waiting to be screened in the country.  We have also learned that the national screening service was responsible for choosing the service providers.  At the time, an American provider was awarded the tender.  Since then, and as confirmed today by An Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in the D&aacute;il, Irish and American service providers are now used to provide the screening service.  However, Vicky Phelan's case in the High Court and the request of her to sign a non-disclosure clause was, in my opinion and that of the women of Ireland, shameful.  What is more shameful is that the State, including the Minister and Department of Health, have adopted a hands-off Bart Simpson-type approach to its knowledge of the court case.  The Government, from my understanding, states that the National Claims Agency did not discuss this matter with the Department officials or the Minister, or both.  I find this very hard to believe.</p> <p>Yesterday, the HSE confirmed that 17 women whose test results were viewed as part of an audit of the service have, sadly, died.  We have learned that, of the 208 whose results were scrutinised, only 46 were informed about the history of their smear test.  This non-disclosure by the State and medics working for the State is unconscionable.  Why would their results not be disclosed to them?  The Government has breached the trust of the women of Ireland.  This mismanagement has justifiably frightened the women of Ireland who have put their trust in the CervicalCheck programme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Confidence in this programme is gone.  We need to get to the bottom of all the facts about the CervicalCheck programme, including when exactly the Minister and his officials were aware of this particular and other such cases.  We learned today that a memo was produced.  Was this the first time the Minister was made aware of this case?  Why is there secrecy and a failure to disclose test results on a systemic basis?  We need an independent inquiry to be established without delay to get to the bottom of the facts.  We also need to ensure all the actors involved in this matter are able to contribute to such an inquiry, even if those actors happen to retire before it is established.</p><p>As a woman and a Senator, I urge the women of Ireland to make sure they get their smear tests as it is the best way, along with a cervical vaccine, to prevent cervical cancer.  With this controversy under way, I urge women to ensure their tests are up to date and not to delay in getting screened.  Cancer screening saves lives.  We need to improve these programmes, not abandon them.  Will the Minister attend the House to have a debate on this matter?</p><p>Today is World Asthma Day.  Many of us who suffer from it know there is a heightened alert regarding pollen and hay fever.  If someone feels they have the symptoms of asthma, I urge them to attend their GP for a diagnosis.  Many people have asthma without knowing it and it can be fatal if unchecked.</p></speech>

I wish them the very best in their work in the Seanad and it is great to have them among us.</p> <p>I join Senator Ardagh in reflecting on the issue of the day, namely, the scandal around cervical cancer checks.  I express my admiration and respect for Ms Vicky Phelan and her family.</p> <p>Listening to the incoming head of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on the radio this morning, I did not feel confidence.  Instead, I felt there was a tension and a guardedness which was regrettable.  I do not feel confident that the higher echelons of our health service have been dealing with matters as they ought.  I believe there is a long way to go with learnings.  Senator Ardagh just referenced the issue of disclosure.  Why were there non-disclosures with regard to settlements with the State?  Why was there non-disclosure by senior medics to patients of information which was relevant to their situations?</p> <p>It is common case that nothing we say should ever discourage women going for a smear test or, indeed, people going for any kind of cancer screening.  That goes without saying, yet it always has to be said.  Whatever criticisms or hard findings there may be to make, whatever hard statements are made or whatever consequences there are for people high up in the health service, people must know it is always in their interests to go for screening and, in this case, smear tests.  People are entitled to ask why certain decisions were made.  They are also entitled to ask whether HIQA is capable of delivering the answers.  The uncomfortable question at the heart of all this is if it was about money.  Despite people being in a position to know and warn about farming out certain services to the United States, was a financial consideration in mind?  What do we think about that, if that was the case?  If it is the case that the decision was made to use services abroad instead of services here, has that run down our ability as a country in the near term to provide a higher quality service?</p> <p>There is too much at stake for people to speculate wildly about the facts.  We can only ask questions at this point but ask them we must.  I hope there will be no hedging but a straightforward frankness, respectful of people's dignity.  If the answers have implications for people in high places, so be it.</p></speech>

This has huge implications for thousands of people with asthma.  A small number of people pass away each year because of the effects of asthma but the great majority can live.  What is important for them is that we protect the quality of our air both internally and externally.  </p><p>It is important this morning to mention our two new Senators, Senators Lawlor and Marshall.  In terms of agriculture, that brings me to the two letters - AI - but we will say no more about that.  On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, I am very happy to welcome both Senators to the House.  They are on the agricultural panel.  The only thing I would say to them about an issue close to my heart is that agriculture, agrifood and all those issues are also part of rural Ireland and rural development.  Looking over the farm gate into the farm is one activity.  Looking from the other side out into the rural community is the other side of it.  Certainly in the Republic of Ireland, there are more people with disabilities in rural Ireland than there are farm families so there are issues about social exclusion.  There are many elderly farmers who are often single men who face issues like loneliness and mental health difficulties.  There are issues around agriculture that are not purely agricultural.  It is important to keep those in the story as it unfolds.  </p><p>I note the Seanad motion before us today that seeks to alter Standing Order 74 to some extent.  This is something in which I was involved to make sure that three Oireachtas committees could meet regarding a shared interest in people with disabilities.  Whatever about new politics, it is important that we find reformed ways of working.  I was surprised to find that there was no way without this device that more than two Oireachtas committees could meet to discuss a subject.  With regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, joined-up efforts of a range of committees and Departments will be increasingly required.</p></speech>

I propose that the Order of Business be amended to facilitate the Minister coming to the Chamber.  We will then address the main issue of the cervical smear test scandal.</p></speech>

I commend Vicky Phelan on the wonderful service she has done the State and her courage.  It really alarmed me yesterday when the Minister said that this is a communications error.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  It is not a communications error.  It is a systemic cover up, nothing else, so let us get that straight from the beginning.  I could not see how any woman across this country could have confidence in the head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and I ask him to reflect on his position, the decisions he has made and the distress they have caused people, including women.  With regard to the 208 women affected, I have no doubt numerous women are yet to come forward.</p> <p>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group in the Seanad, I extend a warm welcome to the two new Senators taking their seats for the first time today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a proud day for the families of Senators Ian Marshall and Anthony Lawlor, whom I welcome to the Gallery.  I look forward to working with both Senators in the time ahead.  Our opinions will diverge on some subjects but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Much has been made of the election of Senator Marshall and the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in made the decision to support him.  Some even questioned if he is a real unionist, which made me wonder what constitutes a real unionist or a real Irish republican.  Perhaps those who pose such questions should reflect on what they need to do to create an environment of mutual respect and equality in which we are all free to be whoever we are and to create a society in which no human being is less equal and in which other individuals or communities do not have to be put down in order that we might elevate ourselves.</p><p>The journey that began with the collective overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement has some way to go.  There have been disappointments and frustrations on the pathway to agreement's full implementation, most recently when the DUP was unable to close the deal agreed to get the institutions back up and running.  However, we must not let these setbacks stop us on the journey to lasting peace and reconciliation.  No problem is insurmountable.  We have had to overcome problems in the past and we will do so again.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants the institutions back up and running and I welcome the unionist perspective that Senator Marshall will bring to the House.  After all, we only learn from those with a perspective that deviates from our own.  We agree on many important issues, most glaringly on the potential negative impact of Brexit, North and South.</p></speech>

We both know that agriculture, North and South, will be the most challenged sector during and after the Brexit process.  Threats of customs checks and tariffs, combined with a cut in the CAP budget, mean it is vital that we all work together.  The perfect storm that has been created by the combination of Brexit and CAP reform next year means we do not have the luxury of sitting back on our Irish republican or unionist laurels.  Those who question why Sinn F&eacute;in supported a unionist candidate in the Seanad election need to wake up and get with the programme.  Our vision is for an inclusive Ireland and a new and united Ireland in which it is okay to be British, Irish, both or neither.  That is the Ireland we want to build for the future.</p></speech>

It is appalling that many other women may have been affected and that  162, 17 of whom have since died, were not notified of the audit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is also appalling that we have had such a drip feed of information on the issue of miscommunication, which is coming out so slowly.  It appears the Minister is not fully apprised of exactly what was going on.<br/><br/>We need answers and the women of Ireland need answers.  In particular we need to know how many women should have concerns.  Thousands of women are ringing the helpline.  As of this morning more than 6,000 women had already contacted the helpline.  We need to know if the resources will be put in place to address the concerns of the many thousands of women who have gone through CervicalCheck.  We also need to ensure that women continue to attend for screening because many women have routine appointments for screening already scheduled.<br/><br/>I note that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has stated that it is essential women continue to have smear tests when called and that screening remains the best way to detect cervical cancer.  It notes that the combination of HPV vaccination and a well-resourced national screening programme is the best way to reduce the incidence.  Of course, it should not be forgotten that we have seen a 7% decrease in cervical cancer per year in each year of the programme.  I think all of us know women and families who have been affected by cervical cancer, and we recognise this is a deadly killer.  It is vital that we ensure we have a robust screening programme and a robust vaccination programme.  The Minister and the head of the HSE need to move very swiftly to allay people's concerns.<br/><br/>As my party's health spokesperson in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Kelly, has pointed out, we, along with everybody else, support a review.  The key question is over the appropriate body to undertake a review.  Does HIQA have sufficient statutory powers to enable the sort of investigation to be carried out that we desperately require?  Should HIQA be further resourced or should the matter now be put into a commission of investigation or, indeed, a tribunal?  The first priority, before we descend into political discussion or questioning on it, is to ensure women's health is protected.<br/><br/>On a happier note, I welcome today's introduction of the sugar tax, which has also been welcomed by the Irish Heart Foundation.  I know colleagues, notably Senator Noone, have been campaigning for many years on the issue.  I very much welcome that introduction.<br/><br/>I commend yesterday's launch by President Higgins of a new four-volume series, <i>The Cambridge History of Ireland</i>.  I note our colleague, Professor Jane Ohlmeyer, along with her colleagues James Kelly, Brendan Smith and Thomas Bartlett are the editors of the four-volume series.  It is very important.  I note that the President took the opportunity to remark on the importance of history as part of the secondary school curriculum.  It should not be in any way downgraded or reduced in importance because it is so vital for all of our citizens to understand our history.</p></speech>

I first call Senator Marshall.  He can tell us how he did it so well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1439" speakername="Ian Marshall" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#T00300"><p>I wish to take a few moments to address the Chamber.  It is an honour and privilege to have been elected to serve in the 25th Seanad.  I extend my thanks to the Taoiseach for his invitation to allow my name to go forward as a candidate for this seat and for that vision.  I express my gratitude to all the Deputies and Senators across all the parties who backed me and my campaign, to Queen's University for giving me its unconditional support in this venture, and to my wife and family without whose support none of this could have happened.</p> <p>I also thank the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association for its nomination.  I will endeavour to represent its interests and ambitions in Seanad debates and discussions.  I will work tirelessly and use my knowledge and expertise to ensure that the agrifood industry is represented and its opinions articulated within this building.</p> <p>I have been overwhelmed with the support, and the trust and faith Members have placed in me.  I will not let them down.  I am humbled to be considered worthy enough to sit in this seat, to take this responsibility and to serve in this House as an Independent Senator.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to pay thanks to all those who helped me secure this seat in Leinster House and those in the wider community across Ireland - North and South - and to those individuals in Brussels without whom this would not have been possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ian Marshall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a truly historic day, both for this House and for myself.  As the first Northern unionist elected to the Seanad to represent the views and opinions of the people of Northern Ireland and to give their perspective, this position carries with it significant responsibility and many challenges, but presents countless opportunities for all concerned.  The time is right and public opinion supports this across Northern Ireland and across the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>Born in 1865, William Butler Yeats was one of the most famous pillars of Irish and British literature and one of the first Senators in this House in the first Seanad in 1922, serving two terms until 1928.  Yeats was acutely aware of the importance of taking action when the time was right when he made the following statement: "Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking."  I firmly believe that the time to strike the iron is now.  I will strive to add to discussion and debate and to offer a different perspective.  Most importantly, I will listen and I will learn, I will offer my opinion and I will respectfully challenge the discussion.  My biggest strength is my passion for my work and the industry and the country I represent, and my biggest weakness is my passion for my work and the industry and the country I represent.</p><p>Northern Ireland and its relationship with Ireland has changed and is evolving, evidenced notably more than 20 years ago with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  This momentous event in history was celebrated at Queen's University a couple of weeks ago and many of those involved were present at the university, including the T&aacute;naiste, who told the assembled that the Good Friday Agreement is as relevant now as it was then, something which I firmly believe.  Thanks to strong leadership in 1998, vision and an appetite to deliver, my children and all the children across Northern Ireland are growing up in a peaceful, progressive, shared society, cognisant of cultures working together for tomorrow.</p><p>Many wise words were spoken at Queen's by the assembled dignitaries that day.  Bertie Ahern spoke, as did Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell, to name a few.  However, the most touching sentiment actually came from an Armagh man who has lived in a village three miles from myself for as long as I can remember.  Seamus Mallon was one of the key negotiators of the Good Friday Agreement and was highly respected in political circles.  His words that day were so profound that I felt I should visit him after the 20th anniversary event to ask permission to share his words with the Chamber today.  He talked of identity in Northern Ireland, whether British or Irish, and the continual struggle of those laying claim to the title or label placed upon the Six Counties.  Making reference to competing cultural claims on the land, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they call it, as long as it has one name: home.&rdquo;  It was a truly Heaney-esque quotation and he was correct, because for all of us, irrespective of our culture, it is home.  To quote another Member of these Houses, whether one considers oneself Irish or British, both or neither, one should feel comfortable in Northern Ireland.</p><p>I had not planned to speak on Brexit as my thoughts are well documented, except to say that, very often in life, you do not know what you have got until it is gone.  Europe is not perfect and it has flaws, but to quote one of the panel members in Belfast two weeks ago, leaving is a profound mistake.</p></speech>

They cannot be ignored and their fears and concerns must be addressed and their questions answered.</p><p>In closing, I would like to quote a verse that my sister shared with me yesterday.  John F. Kennedy claimed that he walked around every day with this poem by Domingo Ortega tucked into his wallet.  Domingo Ortega was a farmer's son who became a bullfighter.  The poem deals with all the critics who stand on the sidelines.  It goes:</p><blockquote>Bullfight critics ranked in rows<br /><br />Crowd the enormous plaza full;<br /><br />But only one is there who knows<br /><br />And he is the man who fights the bull.</blockquote></speech>

It is an honour for me to be here today.  I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for nominating me in the first instance and for their support.  I also received great cross-party support.  I thank all of those who not only supported me but who gave of their time during the campaign to listen to what I had to say and who respected what I said.  The great thing about the Seanad and the D&aacute;il is that, regardless of whatever controversy or fight takes place in the Chambers, we are all equal once off the playing field and everyone treats one another with respect.  That is commendable.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Marshall on his speech, which was poignant and reflective of where we, as a society, are in Ireland and on his significant achievement in gaining cross-party support in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</p> <p>It is a poignant day for me, as my late mother stood in this Chamber and spoke on a number of occasions.  She was only here for a short time but she was more of a national politician than I have ever been.  She served as president of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, and should have graced the D&aacute;il at some stage in her career.  Unfortunately, it did not work out that way for her.</p> <p>I thank my family and my partner for giving me their support.  This was a quick decision, but I rang and consulted them.  Wherever possible, they will help me whenever I need them.</p> <p>I will not be a silent Member of the Seanad.  I will take an active part in debates.  I was vociferous in the D&aacute;il on occasion and I have spoken out on a number of issues since losing my seat.  I will be strong and vociferous on matters, so the Leas-Chathaoirleach will have difficulty in trying to control this new Senator.</p></speech>

This is an historic day for both and I wish them all the best for the rest of the term.</p> <p>I join other Senators who raised the plight of Ms Vicky Phelan and discussed how brave she has been.  As the House knows, Vicky comes from Limerick.  I compliment her and her family on the strength and power shown in interviews.  Were it not for her, many of us would not be calling on the Leader to arrange for a debate on the importance and future of CervicalCheck and to find out what went wrong.  The Minister has been encouraging people, but particularly women, to proceed with the various checkups that are available.  I support Senators' calls for the Minister to be invited to the House to debate the CervicalCheck situation.</p> <p>I attended the inaugural apprenticeship awards ceremony last night with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  The competition was sponsored by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and the ESB.  I congratulate the hospitality section of the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and the Limerick College of Further Education, which jointly submitted a culinary skills entry.  It was wonderful for them to reach the last seven.</p></speech>

We often have a few battles here but overall, everyone gets on extremely well.</p> <p>I echo what has been said regarding this disturbing information dripping from the HSE in the past few days.  Thousands of women across Ireland have been on tenterhooks in case their telephone will ring to inform them that they are among those women who are walking around with something that could kill them.  The HSE put them in this position when it was revealed that it had not been able to contact all those affected.  The cervical screening programme is extremely important.  Early intervention, this type of screening and initiatives like the HPV vaccine are vital in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland.  Everyone now has devastating doubts.  There has been a breach of trust yet again.  Yet again, the women of Ireland are not being looked after and there are questions to be answered here.  I heard the briefing from the HSE yesterday and was sickened to learn that women still are being contacted today.  Those women and their families must be in hell right now.  Some women still cannot be located because no one can tally their records.  This is beyond belief and it appears as though we may not have the whole truth.  Women have died.</p> <p>The chairperson of the HSE serious incident management team stated that 162 out of 208 women affected by the screening were not told that a review had been conducted by CervicalCheck or of the outcome.  As a matter of urgency, the HSE must be held accountable.  As far as I have seen, the HSE is like the wild west: anything goes and there are no laws, which is unacceptable.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, must rush in to provide independent scrutiny in this regard.  It must be efficient and fast and an outcome is needed because women are suffering.  There must be a reason for someone to make a mistake and there needs to be a better system for concerns to be raised and heard.  First and foremost, women must be told as soon as anything like this happens.  I believe the Minister needs to come in and address this issue.</p></speech>

They are more than welcome.  I am sure we will hear from them and do battle over the coming months.  The one thing I would say to them is, "Enjoy it."</p> <p>We have heard many Members today speak of Vicky Phelan.  There are few words that can describe what must have gone through that woman's head.  However, there are questions that have to be asked.   I am afraid it is all too easy to drag Ministers before different Houses and have them flogged over something that happened.  Senior people in the HSE, in the State's defence, took decisions and took the most vicious and aggressive approach to this woman.  They have now been beaten into a corner where they are talking about finding some sort of solution for the other women.  We must remember sitting in here that there are over 100 women who do not know.  Bringing a Minister into any House in order to have a go for the sake of it is wrong.  I am not saying that he should not come in and answer questions.</p> <p>I would like to see the senior people that made decisions.  Decisions are made by the administrative side before a Minister is ever contacted.  I would like to see what decisions they made, when they made them and from where they took their advice.  I would like to know what legal person gave the advice to take this absolutely aggressive approach against a woman who was facing death.  That is the question we want to ask.  We do not want politicisation of this issue.  We want to get to the bottom line.  We do not want some long, goddamn inquiry.  We want answers now.</p> <p>The Minister does not get off the hook either.  I spoke to some women today who rang the helpline who naturally are beside themselves with worry.  One of the statements that has been repeated over and over again is that any woman who wants a repeat test can have it straightaway.  I spoke to a number of women today who asked when they could book their test and the answer they got was, "The Government has made that statement but we know nothing about it."<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Let us not go out of our way to flog a Minister.  There are certainly questions and the Minister has responsibility.  That is the nature of politics, one takes political responsibility, but there are also administrative people involved.  I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that the head of the HSE needs to consider his position as do several other people, including individuals in the State Claims Agency and so on.  It is outrageous bloody behaviour.</p></speech>

I wish them well in their tenure in this House and look forward to engaging with them in that regard.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to address an issue with which hundreds of rural primary schools around the country are struggling.  These are small schools located in rural areas.  Many of their buildings are old buildings, which have usually been upgraded.  Perhaps they might have an extension or something similar.  In many cases, there are narrow and dangerous roads leading to these schools.  Many of those schools were built at a time when the only traffic going to school was on foot.  The students walked to school.  That is the reality.  There is a lot more traffic on the roads now and many of these schools struggle to provide proper traffic management and parking.  A case in point is a school in my area at Barr na Ca&oacute;ige near Swinford.</p></speech>

It is a case which would be repeated in many schools I know of.  The school is on a narrow country road which has got busier because it leads to Ireland West Airport Knock.  It is a two-teacher school.  The only option for the staff is to park on the road.  The only option for parents dropping off kids is to do so at the roadside.  Cars are whizzing by on what is a substandard and inadequate road in any event.  The Department will not assist the school in the provision of parking or traffic management and the local authority does not want to help either.  In my view, road safety and traffic management should be the concern of both the local authority, in this case Mayo County Council, and the Department of Education and Skills.  The reality is that if these students were fortunate enough to be getting a new school, the Department of Education and Skills would require traffic management and provision for children to get in and out of transport - cars or buses - safely.  These schools cannot afford that because they are small.  There needs to be co-operation.</p></speech>

I am breaking the secrecy of the ballot in saying that I voted number one for both of them.  It is really a lovely feeling to have two winners on the same day.  They are both very talented people.  Of course, we already know of the Lawlor family with its great tradition of hospitality in County Kildare.  I would like to speak particularly about Senator Marshall because I think he made a very important point.  There have been unionist voices here before and I remember them with great affection and admiration.  They included Gordon Wilson, John Robb and people like that.  They added a great deal, but they were Taoiseach's nominees.  This is the first time that a unionist from Northern Ireland has been elected to this Seanad.  This is a wonderful and historic day.</p> <p>The next issue I wish to raise is the very obnoxious habit some people have developed of putting these vast photographs of aborted foetuses up against the walls of Leinster House.  It does not bother me.  I remember during a previous referendum campaign a woman came up to me, stuck a photograph under my nose and asked what I thought of it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I said "I think it is perfectly charming madam, I presume it is a family photograph".</p><p>I mention the intrusion of these sort of people.

Full implementation of this would lead to a great widening of the number of clinicians involved and really attack the terrible waiting lists she said.  However, and this is the conflict, Dr. Paul Moran, a liaison psychiatrist who plays a central role in treating people in the Dublin clinic says that these guidelines "as they apply to assessment and treatment recommendations are not part of our model of care, are clinically unsafe, and unsuitable for use".  Professor Donal O'Shea says that these guidelines are "very lax... their application would lead to a significant regret rate" and this statement completely contradicts Deputy Catherine Byrne's assertion.  He goes on to say, and this is my final comment: "We don't intend to run the service in line with WPATH guidelines."  Who is telling the truth here?  Is it the Minister of State who is politically in charge or will it be at the whim of clinicians?  We really need to clarify this.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.</p></speech>

I hope with the agreement of the House we can all share in the expression of that condemnation.  The Cathaoirleach should convey the message that we are insulted, that we do not tolerate that kind of expression and that we will face it down.

I wish them both well.  It is clear that they will be making an enormous contribution.  I had a wonderful day yesterday when I attended the civic forum on Brexit in Dundalk.  It was a very heartening occasion.  It was wonderful that at the outset, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and all of our party leaders were there making excellent presentations.  Many young people made presentations of high quality and there was genuine civic engagement.  The most important thing about the day was that Michel Barnier was present.  Yet again, on at least three occasions in response to three different questions and various curve-balls, he unequivocally stated European solidarity with Ireland.  That should be acknowledged and applauded in this House.  We should be very proud of our Government, diplomatic service and permanent Civil Service in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Since the beginning of the Brexit issue, they have achieved a European awareness of our situation.  There is a European consciousness of it and support in virtually every European capital.  I had the privilege of attending the Council of Europe last week with colleagues from this House, including Senator Hopkins, who is on my right.  I met delegates from every country and raised the Brexit issue with them informally and, in one or two instances, formally.  In all cases, they had an extraordinary awareness of our problem and support for it.  The Irish Government, our permanent Civil Service and our diplomats abroad should take a bow.  This matter is so important to me because the people in my community, along the Border in Cavan-Monaghan, stand to experience economic and social devastation and potentially a breakdown of all societal norms if we do not avoid a hard border.  I offer the House's appreciation of Michel Barnier's stance and ask our Leader to endorse it and to give us an assurance that it will be continued.</p></speech>

People go to the health service to seek support, compassion, help and reassurance.  Unfortunately, none of that has been provided.  Women in Ireland cannot feel reassured by recent events and nor, indeed, can men.  The most recent scandal and the highlighting of it over the weekend has brought into stark light the fact that the State has to drag people screaming to the courts where they seek vindication.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Any reading of the State Claims Agency, which is the insurance group for the State, shows that follows through.

I particularly welcome Senator Marshall; it is good to hear another Northern accent in the Chamber.  He is from the Orchard County, and I have no doubt that his appointment will give confidence to members of the unionist community in terms of the bone fides of this State on a large number of issues, particularly Brexit.  I wish both the Senators well in their new roles.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of Government Departments and agencies and their use of 1890 numbers for citizens to contact them in relation to queries they might have.  It is not common knowledge that if one is ringing a Government Department on an 1890 number, it is not a cheap call.  If one rings from Three mobile or Vodafone and happens to be on the line to a Government Department for up to 30 minutes, it will cost between &euro;9 and &euro;13.50.  This is an issue we must grasp.  I am confident that certain elements of Government are aware of this because when the local property tax number was advertised, the Department was aware of the problem and changed the criteria to accommodate it.  Revenue Online is an example of where people are provided with an 1890 number and believe that they are speaking to someone on the other end for the price of a local call.  We need to be aware of that issue, and the message needs to be brought back to Government that we should desist from using such numbers and find a number that will not cost much for those who take time to ring.</p></speech>

A statement was issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists today which we should welcome.  We need to deal with this in a very careful manner.  We have to acknowledge Vicky Phelan and her family for bringing this to the fore and highlighting the difficulties she has gone through and what she has to face into in the future.  It is wrong that it had to go down that road.  It is also wrong that information which patients should have had access to was not provided to them.  As someone who is in the legal profession, it is appalling to think that a senior person at a senior level in any organisation should deny extremely important information to people.

They were members of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  There was only one independent candidate.  It was an important day.  I always welcome elections and competition.  I think it is a good thing.  It was a very difficult choice.  I think it is a particularly important victory for both Senators as only TDs and Senators voted for them.  It is a great honour.  I particularly want to welcome Senator Ian Marshall.  I am delighted that he has joined the independent group and the independent bench.  I acknowledge the role of the Taoiseach and Commissioner Phil Hogan in sourcing and identifying this very able and capable man, and I look forward to contributing further to this debate tomorrow.</p></speech>

He follows in the footsteps of his mother, Senator Patsy Lawlor.  I also want to welcome Senator Ian Marshall.  On 14 February this year, I spoke in the Seanad Chamber to call for one of the vacant Seanad seats to be filled by a unionist voice from Northern Ireland.  I am delighted that my fellow county man is here.  The Feighans all come from Cullyhanna in Armagh, only 13 miles from Markethill.  We come from different traditions, but we are united in one thing - peace and friendship on the island of Ireland, and indeed between our two islands.</p> <p>Last night I gave an answer to Lord Kilclooney, who is a colleague of mine in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  He is formidable and robust.  I asked him to withdraw the racist remarks.  I believe this is a pattern, but it does not reflect the honourable members of the House of Lords, many of whom come from an Irish tradition, and many of whom have a keen understanding of Brexit, but also huge compassion and generosity towards the island of Ireland. </p></speech>

I am delighted to see my good friend Senator Anthony Lawlor here.  When Senator Lawlor was in the other House, he spoke and worked for people from under-privileged backgrounds in Africa and other countries.  What he did in the other House emulated what we like to think we do here, and what we do here on a regular basis, namely, speak on behalf of the most vulnerable people in society.  I know that Senator Anthony Lawlor will continue that work now that he is back in the Houses of the Oireachtas, where he can and will wield an influence and continue to do the work he has done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have got to know Senator Ian Marshall over the past number of weeks.

I listened to their maiden speeches online and I was very impressed by them both.  I had not made the connection between Senator Lawlor and his illustrious mother, who came into the Seanad on the same path as a cousin of mine, Kit Ahern, who was also president of the ICA.  She finished up in the D&aacute;il subsequent to being a Senator.  I congratulate Senator Marshall on his success, on accepting the nomination to contest, then canvassing and being elected and, most important, coming down here and taking his seat.  It is groundbreaking for us.</p> <p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh was very forthcoming on the rationale for Sinn F&eacute;in's vote in one of the papers but not so forthcoming as regards the second paper, on which Sinn F&eacute;in supported Fine Gael in the ongoing love that dares not speak its name.  I repeat my call to Sinn F&eacute;in to take a leaf out of Senator Marshall's book by taking their seats in Westminster, at a time when Ireland needs a nationalist, pro-Europe, anti-Brexit voice.  A number of people are sitting on their backsides instead of going over there and working for the people who elected them.</p></speech>

What has happened is incredible.  We cannot underestimate the fear that women all over this country and their families have been living with since the weekend, and which will continue into the future.  The State Claims Agency is a Government agency with an embedded culture of dismissiveness.  It is autocratic and its only intent is to demean women by putting the blame on them.  A total of 17 people have died following the audit.</p> <p>As Senator Conway asked, what is it about this country that, for generations since the formation of the State, it has been women who have been targeted, neglected and dismissed from society by patriarchical attitudes.  When the HSE formed a panel yesterday, it had to apologise for the fact that every single member of the panel was male.  Women's voices need to be on every patient policy group and steering group because we cannot trust the HSE or the Government.</p></speech>

During the Committee Stage debate we had on the Bill it was decided to remove section 3.  That was the last debate we had on the Bill.</p><p>I will outline what section 3 would have done to the people who are responsible for deaths of women in this country because of the cervical cancer debacle, which is effectively killing people.  It introduced an offence of grossly negligent management causing death.  Section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) refers to persons who &quot;knew or ought to reasonably have known of a substantial risk of death or serious personal harm&quot; and section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) refers to where people, &quot;failed to take reasonable efforts to eliminate that risk&quot;.  What would that have carried as a sentence if we had passed it in this House in 2016?  It was 12 years in jail.</p></speech>

I welcome them to the House.  I pay tribute to them on their historic victory and wish them every success in their tenure in this House.  I welcome the new Senators and commend them.  Today is a very special day for them and their families, one they should cherish and look back on but they should also look forward.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, their achievement is one we all look forward to hearing about as both Senators managed to top the poll.</p> <p>They bring to this Chamber and the Houses of the Oireachtas their own personal, individual experiences, characteristics and skills, not weaknesses as Senator Marshall said, but positivity.  His opening speech is to be admired, as was Senator Lawlor's, who remembered and reflected on his mother Patsy and how proud she would be today that he is here.</p> <p>I welcome Lisa and Sarah who are in the Public Gallery and thank them for giving us their Dad and husband for whatever length of time he will be in this House.  They have made sacrifices and they will make more sacrifices, but it is great that they are here to join in Senator Marshall's great day.</p> <p>I join with Senator Ardagh in remembering Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Landy and thank them for their civic duty.  Today is a very proud day for all of us in this House.  As Senator Marshall said, it is the first time a member of the unionist community has been elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is a day on which we can all celebrate and rejoice.</p> <p>I also thank the former Senator, our colleague and friend, Senator Jim D'Arcy, for his stewardship and minding Ian during the course of the campaign.  I remind Senator Conway-Walsh, that as Senator Feighan said, the Fine Gael Party is the united Ireland party.</p></speech>

As Leader of the House and leader of the Fine Gael group, I join all Members in condemning the treatment of all the women involved.  This should not be happening in an Irish society that is supposed to cherish all equally.  There are 70 women who have died and 160 are waiting for answers.  As some Members of the House said, the latter are living in fear and petrification.  Senator Conway-Walsh should note I intend to have the Minister come to the House.  Unfortunately, he is in the D&aacute;il Chamber today.  I hope to have him here either tomorrow or Thursday.  I will have him in at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is critical that all of us, particularly the affected women and their families, receive the full facts and all the information.  It beggars belief that the Minister for Health did not have all the information and was not given it by the people we charge with the administration of the health service of our country.  It is time people were held to account.  Let us do so when we have all the facts and the full facts, and not just some of the facts.</p><p>All of us in this House are angry, dismayed and sorry, and we are sickened and appalled by the treatment of Vicky Phelan and the women involved.  I commend Vicky Phelan on her bravery and courage.  There should be no withholding of information from patients, their doctors or a Minister.  No longer can we accept it.  It should not be accepted.  Senator Conway and others are right that there are those who must be held to account who have to be held to account.  It is time that we, as a society, held to account those charged with the administration of our health system.  I will await the full facts.  I speak as a Chairman of a committee that engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny regarding open disclosure and medical indemnity.  Senator Burke was a very strong part of that committee.  We must get the full facts, whether it is through HIQA or a statutory inquiry.  I do not mind once we get all the information and the facts for those involved.</p><p>The Minister said the re-checks will be free.  I heard Senator Craughwell's remarks on that in terms of the telephone number.  I do believe what is advocated will be done by the Minister.  It is a matter of giving out the information.  As the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il regarding open disclosure, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring forward legislation to provide for open disclosure and to make it mandatory.</p><p>It is also worth noting that we had an all-party committee dealing with the issue of open disclosure that opted to propose the voluntary route first and the mandatory route second.  That is what the Government is following and it is in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach asked the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, to examine the early settlement of similar cases to avoid, as many Members have mentioned, lengthy, unnecessary, costly legal cases and actions.  It is important that we see that action followed through.  The duty of candour is contained in the Medical Council guidelines, which must be followed.</p><p>It is important that we establish all the facts.  The statutory inquiry or investigation is not being ruled out.  What the Government will do next will be based on getting the full information and all the facts.  We must restore confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme.  It is important that we state today that the screening programme saves lives, as Senator Burke and others have said.  The HPV vaccine does prevent the loss of life.  It is worth noting that our cancer care has improved.</p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' statement.  I ask him and all Members to read it because it is about urging women to have smear tests and calling for a thorough investigation.  It is important to remember that screening for cervical cancer is an important, cost-effective public health initiative but, more important, it saves lives. </p><p>I will have the Minister come to the House as soon as possible.  As I said, that is my intent.  I hope Senator Conway-Walsh will accept my bona fides on that as she knows I have always endeavoured to have the Minister attend as fast as I can.</p><p>Senator Dolan raised the issue of World Asthma Day.  It is an important day.  Four hundred and fifty thousand people in the country have some type of asthma.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is one in every ten people, and 21% of children are affected.  I commend the Asthma Society of Ireland on its role.<br/><br/>Senator Bacik referred to the sugar tax.  I commend Senator Noone and the Irish Heart Foundation on their work in this regard.  I hope Healthy Ireland will be the umbrella under which we can reduce the risk of obesity.  I commend all at Trinity College, as Senator Bacik said, for <i>The Cambridge History of Ireland</i>.  I note the words of an t-Uachtar&aacute;n, who has taken up Senator Conway's Private Members' motion about having history as a core subject on the curriculum.  It is important that we commend that.<br/><br/>Senator Byrne referred to apprenticeships.  We will have a debate on that issue in due course.<br/><br/>Senator Mulherin referred to education and the plight of old schools.  She specifically referred to Barr na Ca&oacute;ige.  I agree with the Leas-Chathaoirleach that raising this as a Commencement matter would, perhaps, be a more expeditious route in the context of obtaining a response.  However, there is a need for local authorities, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and schools to work together.<br/><br/>Senator Norris raised the issue of the posters being put up during the current referendum campaign.  I reiterate what I said last week, namely, that I hope the Referendum Commission will have a role to play in the way in which posters are, first, being placed outside maternity hospitals, which is despicable and which we should all condemn-----</p></speech>

This matter highlights the need for an electoral commission to tackle such misinformation.</p> <p>Senator Norris also raised the transgender issue.  I do not have clarity for him on that matter but I will endeavour to obtain it.  I beg his indulgence in that regard.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to Lord Kilclooney, as did Senators O'Reilly and Feighan.  I thank Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile for his email to the Cathaoirleach and to me.  I concur with the comments of all three Senators and condemn Lord Kilclooney for his remarks.  They were racist and inappropriate.  Like other members of the unionist community, he should engage in the debate in a real way in order that we can protect the island of Ireland, North and South - green, white and orange - and work together to minimise the damage of Brexit.  Lord Kilclooney's contribution was not helpful and he should apologise for it.  All of us should stand united in condemning his remarks.  The important point is that the comments of our new colleague, Senator Marshall, are those which we should reflect upon rather than the ill-timed remarks of Lord Kilclooney.</p></speech>

I would be happy to have a debate on the matter in the House.</p> <p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the by-election and the love fest.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party was trying to get Sinn F&eacute;in votes too but it fell short in that regard.  As Senator Conway-Walsh would say, "Why would they anyway, given the hostility of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to them?"  It is important to recognise that today is Senator Marshall's and Senator Lawlor's day.</p> <p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.  I apologise to the T&aacute;naiste for the delay.

As Senators will have seen, we had a very productive time yesterday in Dundalk with the Taoiseach and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, at the fourth plenary meeting of the all-island civic dialogue.  I will say a little more about that later.  Before doing so, however, I wish to address two distinct but complementary tracks of the Government's work: first, the state of play in the Article 50 negotiations; and, second, the intensive work being undertaken to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Ireland and to get businesses and citizens as Brexit-ready as they can be.</p> <p>I will deal first to the negotiations.  The European Council in March was another significant milestone in the withdrawal process.  EU leaders took stock of the progress made by EU and UK negotiators on drafting a legally-binding withdrawal agreement to give effect to the principles and commitments agreed by the two sides last December.  They also adopted guidelines setting out the EU's approach to the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  As regards the withdrawal issues, EU leaders welcomed the agreement reached by negotiators on parts of the withdrawal agreement, including on citizens' rights, the financial settlement and the transition.  However, they also underlined that work remained outstanding, including on Irish-specific issues.  As the House is aware, the unique issues relating to Ireland are addressed in the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement.  Some progress was made on this draft protocol during the negotiations that immediately preceded the European Council in March.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Agreement was reached on some articles of the draft text, including the common travel area and other areas of North-South co-operation, as well as areas linked to the Good Friday Agreement.  This is recorded in a colour-coded version of the draft withdrawal agreement published by the Commission task force on 19 March.  The sections agreed by the two negotiating teams are marked in green, the sections agreed in principle are marked in yellow and the sections not yet agreed are marked in white.  It is very clear now in the withdrawal document, which essentially will become a withdrawal treaty, what is agreed, what is agreed in principle but needs to be finalised in the wording, and the areas where there is no agreement and which require more negotiation.<br/><br/>Importantly, the UK agreed in March that a backstop solution for the Border will form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement.  The two negotiating teams agreed that this legally operable backstop will be in line with paragraph 49 of the joint progress report agreed last December and that this backstop will apply &quot;unless and until&quot; another solution is agreed.<br/><br/>The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU text will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the Border.  For some, that progress was lost.  We hear a debate now on whether we can accommodate the so-called Irish Border backstop in the withdrawal treaty, but that commitment has already been made and does not need to be made again.  The question the negotiators are now grappling with is how to do that.  How do we agree a text that both sides can support in the withdrawal agreement?  As Michel Barnier said yesterday, there will be no withdrawal agreement without a text relating to the Irish Border backstop that is legally operable.  I will discuss this further presently.<br/><br/>The Prime Minister, Mrs. May, confirmed these assurances in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March, which was part of a packaged deal at the time.  This was in addition to reiterating the UK&rsquo;s commitment to agreements reached last December on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and sustaining the gains of the peace process.  This also includes the overarching guarantee of avoiding a hard border.  We have been clear at every stage that the backstop is only that, a fallback or insurance mechanism.  In fact, David Davis referred to it as a spare parachute.  While it is our preference to resolve issues relating to the Border through a comprehensive future relationship between the EU and the UK, it is crucial that we have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments already made on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The reason we want to have the backstop is to provide the reassurance that things cannot get worse than this, and then we go on to negotiate, we hope, something better that suits everybody.<br/><br/>The draft protocol and other outstanding withdrawal issues have been the subject of detailed negotiations between the EU and the UK since the March European Council, with the aim of closing the gaps that remain.  These negotiations are ongoing and it is the European Council&rsquo;s stated intention to return to the remaining withdrawal issues, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and to the framework for the future relationship at its next meeting in June.  Some have suggested that setting targets for June is an artificial deadline, but it is not.  June is specifically mentioned in the guideline document for the task force, in other words, its negotiating mandate, so we can assess progress as we move towards where we need to get to by the end of October next.  The EU has also made it clear that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.<br/><br/>In the last six weeks, I have met and discussed Brexit with my counterparts from Sweden, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Netherlands and Portugal, all of whom expressed their commitment to this principle and their continuing solidarity with Ireland.  This support has always been forthcoming at every stage from Michel Barnier and his team, as we saw again yesterday.  Ahead of that engagement, Mr. Barnier had set out his view, shared by the Irish Government, that we will need to see substantial progress on the Irish issues before the June European Council.  This is a message that I have set out in very clear terms in recent engagements with British Government representatives too, along with my expectation for a significant increase in the pace of progress over the coming rounds of negotiations.  Our teams in Dublin and Brussels are working daily with the task force led by Michel Barnier.  We saw the fruits of that collaborative work in December and in March and I am confident it will drive us towards the end we need to reach both in June and, more importantly, in October.  I am very grateful for the diligence and commitment the EU task force has shown in understanding the complexity and vulnerabilities of the Irish situation linked to Brexit.<br/><br/>As regards the EU&rsquo;s approach to the framework for the future EU-UK relationship, the Government has always been clear that we want the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK.  I welcome that this perspective is clearly reflected in the guidelines.  It is envisaged that this future partnership will not only cover trade and economic co-operation, but will also encompass other areas such as the fight against terrorism and international crime, co-operation on environment and sustainability issues as well as security, defence, foreign policy and development aid.<br/><br/>With regard to the economic relationship, the European Council has confirmed its readiness to start work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement.  While a free trade agreement is not Ireland&rsquo;s preferred end goal in the negotiations, we recognise that the European Council has to take into account the repeatedly stated positions of the UK, including its wish to leave the Single Market and customs union, which set limits on the depth of the future partnership.  We want something much closer than a free trade agreement, if possible.  It is not loo late for the UK to revisit its red lines on these options; indeed, we are hopeful that such a re-examination may yet take place.  This is especially important because it is clear that being outside the customs union and the Single Market will inevitably lead to frictions in trade and will have negative economic consequences, in particular for the UK.<br/><br/>The EU guidelines are absolutely clear that the integrity and proper functioning of the Single Market must be upheld.  The Government fully shares this view.  A non-member of the Union, which does not live up to the obligations of membership, cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits.  In this context, it is important to note that the guidelines are also clear that, should the UK positions evolve, the EU will be prepared to reconsider its offer.  This is vitally important from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective.  I must also stress that the agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is, after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.  This is why a <i>status quo</i>transitional arrangement is so important, to give people time to adjust and to give politicians the time to negotiate a new relationship.  For this reason we welcome that there has been conditional agreement between the EU and the UK on a transition period.  Such an arrangement is essential for providing certainty to businesses and citizens, and for minimising unnecessary disruption.<br/><br/>In terms of the future relationship, the guidelines propose that a free trade agreement would cover all sectors and include zero tariffs on goods, and that it would also address trade in services.  The proposed maintenance of reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources contained in the guidelines is also very welcome.  The Government will continue to be firm in arguing that any agreement must protect key sectors of the Irish economy given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK.<br/><br/>In parallel with our engagement with the negotiating process, the Government is also acting to ensure that Ireland is Brexit ready.  Dedicated measures were announced in budget 2018, including a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses and a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector.  This is in addition to supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The fund of &euro;116 billion announced in Project 2040 for capital investment over the next decade will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects which can accelerate economic growth and mitigate the impact of Brexit.</p><p>In my Department there has been a strong focus on extending our diplomatic reach with a view to helping Irish companies as they seek new markets in a post-Brexit world.  Increased funds will allow for the opening of six new diplomatic missions over the year ahead as part of the first phase of expanding our global footprint.</p><p>At home and abroad, our Government's enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit, making them more competitive, assessing opportunities for increased market exposure and upskilling teams.  My Department is also leading an all-of-Government approach to contingency and scenario planning, including intensive work on a no-deal or worst-case scenario Brexit.  Of course, work on a disorderly Brexit scenario is carried out very much in the spirit of "hoping for the best but planning for the worst".  It is also the case that this work provides a baseline scenario for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in respect of transition arrangements and the future relationship.  This work is already well advanced and takes account of the extensive planning and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.  It also takes account of the work being undertaken at EU level by the Commission's new preparedness unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors all the time.</p><p>The Government's engagement with stakeholders is significant in informing our approach to Brexit and taking advice and taking the temperature from different sectors all the time.  My colleagues in government and I are in daily contact with individual companies as well as representative groups, whose valuable insights, analysis and expertise are critical to informing our approach to the EU-UK negotiations as well as our wider domestic response.  It was encouraging this week to see the publication of a new IBEC report which confirms a dramatic increase in the number of companies now putting together Brexit plans or Brexit response plans.  Over 20% of the companies polled already have a contingency plan in place, and 53% of the companies polled either had a plan in place or were in the process of preparing one.  I think that if the same poll were to be carried out six months ago, the percentage of companies that were Brexit-ready or preparing to be so probably would have been in single figures.</p><p>The importance of this engagement with stakeholders was highlighted again just yesterday in Dundalk, where the perspectives of young people, civil society and the business community on a post-Brexit Ireland were debated and discussed in detail.  Michel Barnier also had excellent engagement with a number of stakeholders, demonstrating once again the willingness of the EU to listen to the concerns of stakeholders here in Ireland.</p><p>We regret that Brexit is happening.  We think it is a bad idea and a bad development for the European Union, a bad development for Britain and a bad development for Ireland.  However, we must deal with the realities that unfold and respond and prepare accordingly.  I assure the House that my Government colleagues and I will continue to work with both our EU and domestic partners, and indeed our friends in the UK, in the coming months to secure the best possible outcome for Ireland.  In this respect, I welcome the continued support and engagement demonstrated by all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>Finally, since it is my first time in the Seanad since two new Members have joined, may I say how delighted I am to see Senator Anthony Lawlor back in the Houses of the Oireachtas?  I know him well and I am delighted he has been successful in being elected to the Seanad.  I think he will serve this House very well.  I also welcome in particular Senator Ian Marshall to the House.  In the context of the debate we are having today, I am sure he will bring a perspective and an understanding that we need to hear in the context of the solutions we find to Brexit.  Many unionists in Northern Ireland whom I have met have real fears and concerns about proposed solutions to solve significant problems linked to Brexit, particularly in respect of the Irish Border issue.  I think Senator Marshall's contribution will enhance not only this debate, but also many of the other debates we will have linked to Northern Ireland and relations on this island and between Britain and Ireland, which I intend to develop in a positive way during my time in this Ministry.  I thank the Acting Chairman and I look forward to hearing the Senators' contributions.</p></speech>

I, too, welcome to the House Senator Ian Marshall, an important voice on Brexit.  Arguing for the best deal for one's own community is the responsibility of all public representatives.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have argued that Northern Ireland should get a special deal or a special status, a foot in both camps, which would mean it would have the best of both worlds.  It is hard to understand why some members of the unionist community and those who represent them do not want the best of both worlds for their own community in order that they are able to access the best of the EU while remaining in the UK.</p> <p>Be that as it may, the facts are hard to come by when it comes to Brexit.  Take, for example, the facts, as we were led to believe, in respect of the Irish Border and the number of Border crossings.  The European Border and Coast Guard Agency said there are 275 Border crossings between the North and the South of Ireland.  Recently, the UK Government and the Irish Government agreed that there are only 203 Border crossings between the North-----</p></speech>

Five are in dispute.  However, this is just a small example of the fact that it is hard to get the facts.  We have a border agency stating there are 275 crossings and the Irish and British Governments stating there are actually 208.  This is just one problem, and there are a myriad of others.</p> <p>The Minister has just referred to a poll stating that 20% of people or companies have a plan, or 63% have a plan or are preparing a plan.  According to a survey done by AIB, just 6% of SMEs in the Republic have a formal plan for Brexit, but nothing-----</p></speech>

It speaks volumes that the Government is offering a grant to companies to draw up a plan.  One hundred companies have drawn down the grant to draw up a plan, which shows that the figure of 6% is probably more accurate than the figure of 63%.  If someone rings up a company and asks whether it is planning or preparing a plan, it would want to say it is preparing a plan.  However, it does not sound as if they are preparing many plans when only 100 companies have drawn down the grant from Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister outlined in principle and in total what is agreed and matters that are yet to be agreed.  Regarding the Border, are we still in the green area or are we marked in yellow or white, as per the colour coding of the draft withdrawal agreement?  Regarding the backsliding, there is a concern about language.  I would love to know which EU official came up with the phrase "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed".  We had all understood that until citizenship rights, the divorce payment and the issue of the Irish Border were agreed, nothing else could move forward.  Now everything has moved forward, everything is rolled in together and "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed".</p> <p>My concern about this is that when it comes towards the end of the negotiations and our issue of the Border and the North is piled on top of all the other issues, the pressure will come on late at night to get the deal across the line and there will be a fudge.  The last time there was a fudge on the Irish Border, it finished in a disgraced Boundary Commission in 1926 and in a complete debacle.  At the same time there was a debate and a Treaty negotiation ongoing for weeks and weeks and, under high pressure, the issue of the Irish Border was kicked to a commission and was due to be resolved at some future date but never got resolved.  That is one of our key concerns.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are also looking for citizenship rights.  We know the citizenship rights of UK citizens around Europe and EU citizens in the United Kingdom.  What about the special rights of citizens in Northern Ireland, of both traditions, who are entitled to be EU citizens by virtue of the Good Friday Agreement?  On this side of the House, we have spoken about employing a Nordic Council-style model in the future relationship between these islands.  That, of course, is already provided for in part by the Good Friday Agreement, namely, in strand three mechanisms involving the British and Irish Governments.  It could involve formalising, in a more structured way, the British-Irish Council and its meetings so it would yield tangible results and have considerably more powers than at present.<br/><br/>We must ensure a relaxing of state aid rules in light of the fact that the Republic will be the region of the island most affected by Brexit.  The backsliding on the backstop by the British Government must be addressed.  Our delegation to the House of Commons and the House of Lords was led by Senator Neale Richmond.  One of the most startling documents we read in advance of the meeting concerns the House of Commons analysis of possible solutions for the Irish border.  Mentioned are the &quot;Boris border&quot;, the Canada-USA border and other solutions.  Despite this, as I am sure the Minister is well aware, the House of Commons document contains no technological solutions other than theoretical ones, currently available anywhere in the world, that will keep the border open in circumstances other than those in which Northern Ireland remains in the customs union or Single Market.  The frightening reality is that most British politicians do not understand that.  They do not realise it or do not want to.  I do not know how one can engage with them to a point where they actually do realise it and acknowledge the reality of what is involved in order to keep the border open in the way it is today, with its 203 crossings, 208 crossings or 275 crossings.  I do not know how the EU border agency is going to take the fact that we have reduced the number of border crossings but the reality is that the British Government does not know what it wants.  If one does not know what one wants, one does not know one's destination or how to get there. <br/><br/>While the transition arrangement is helpful, I have concerns.  We are now in circumstances in which, ironically, the <i>status quo</i>in terms of the make-up of the current British Government is the best we could have at this time because the alternatives after an election, when Mrs. Theresa May gone, would be either a Brexiteer in charge of the Tory Party or Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, who is purging his own party, the Labour Party, of anybody who has any EU sympathies whatsoever.  This would bring Mr. Corbyn to his goal, which is the nationalisation of everything in Britain.  Once one is outside the European Union, one can do all those things but how he is going to pay for it, I do not know.  We are actually dealing with the best British Government we could possibly have because the alternatives will be worse.  The <i>status quo</i>will not remain for much longer, however.  We are concerned on this side of the House over the backsliding by the British Government.  I refer to its disagreeing with what it signed up to and we are anxious to have the arrangement formalised.  If it is not, there can be no deal whatsoever.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.</p> <p>Unfortunately, time is running out and everybody is acutely aware that the clock is running.  The huge chunk of time everyone felt we had is disappearing rapidly.  The industry I come from and represent has studied and examined all the possible outcomes and solutions and the findings clearly indicate the agrifood industry will be disadvantaged or be in an undoubtedly worse position than if the United Kingdom remained in the European Union.  There is some concern over the misunderstanding of some of the terms, one being "free trade agreement applies", the implication being that it does what it says on the tin.  Actually, a free trade agreement is not that straightforward.  It is a matter of inefficiencies and costs to businesses.  There are huge concerns over an arrangement such as a free trade agreement.</p> <p>Traditional arrangements and agreements are fine in the interim but very often prolong the uncertainty.  Uncertainty is not good for businesses or industry and it results in an inability to plan for the future and invest, resulting in stagnation.  That is a significant concern.  As much as I am reassured that a Brexit-ready Ireland is a reality, I am seriously concerned that only 20% of businesses have engaged in or been proactive in considering their future outside the European Union.  I am a glass-half-full person but it still means that 80% of businesses have not considered this.  That is a concern.</p> <p>I have concerns over the optics of the discussions and their current position.  The reality is that a message is being peddled by the popular press, both on the mainland and in Northern Ireland, that the position in Dublin and of the Irish Government is to fight against the United Kingdom and to try to be disruptive and create blockages and reasons deals cannot be struck.  I would like the public to hear the truth that the Irish Government and European Union are working to try to solve problems.  I do not believe Brexit should happen.  I have strong opinions on that.  I firmly believe that the message needs to be sent out that Ireland is working with the European Union and the United Kingdom to try to deliver some solutions.</p> <p>Reference was made to the Border.  A point was made that British politicians do not really understand the implications and significance of a border for businesses on both sides, across northern and southern Ireland.  In all the discussions on the Border, everybody keeps referring to all the problems, and we go around in circles doing so.  If we know the problems, we need to determine the solutions.  I do not believe the solutions exist.  We need to be open and transparent and man up to the fact that, at the minute, technology cannot deliver solutions for the Border.</p></speech>

I refer to markets for industry, business, manufacturing, construction and so on.  The reality is that these opportunities exist now.  Why do we not capitalise on and maximise those opportunities now while we are still part of a big trading bloc?  I see no reason the British Government or the Northern Ireland Executive would even consider life outside the European Union.</p> <p>In times of global insecurity, taking into account the United States, Russia, China and Syria, serious concerns arise over the United Kingdom leaving Europe and becoming very exposed.  Strength and unity, involving Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, are imperative.  Even though the clock is running down, there is an opportunity to go back to the people in the United Kingdom and let them decide.  Ultimately, it is the people who will be affected.</p></speech>

I join others in welcoming Senator Ian Marshall and I thank him very much for his very considered contribution and the work he was doing outside this House prior to his election.  I welcome Senator Anthony Lawlor on his return to the Oireachtas, where he will make so many contributions in his area of expertise, agriculture, and in other areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is much that I would like to say but it is hard to sum up all the contributions I would like to make in eight minutes when it comes to Brexit.  The first thing I have to say, however, is that Brexit is bad.  There is absolutely no such thing as a good Brexit.  Regardless of what is decided in October and regardless of what receives the assent of the European Parliament and the European Council and comes into force after the transition period, there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland or a good Brexit for the wider European Union and there is certainly no such thing as a good Brexit for the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.  Putting all that aside, I commend the T&aacute;naiste and his vast team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and throughout Government on the stellar work that has been carried out since the fateful decision of the British people to leave the EU to prepare Ireland and to work through the political and diplomatic process.  </p><p>There are a few people who keep referring to Ireland and Europe and to Ireland and EU and who say that the EU is doing this or that on behalf of Ireland.  It is very important that we recognise that, in this matter, we are Europe.  Michel Barnier is not there to act as an honest broker, rather he is there to negotiate on behalf of this jurisdiction.  Ireland is Europe.  Our negotiator is Michel Barnier and the UK's negotiator is David Davis.  Going by Mr. Barnier's statements yesterday in Dundalk, he is completely in line with everything the Irish Government has been saying over the past two years.  That is no small achievement.  If one looks at the 680 meetings which have been held at diplomatic and political level since 2016 between the Irish Government and all its counterparts in the remaining member states as well as officials of the EU institutions, it is a credit to the effort.  The fact that Ireland has maintained itself as one of the top three priority issues for negotiation is quite remarkable.  The internal preparedness which the T&aacute;naiste has laid down is significant.  It is very important that when we look at those preparations we look at what is happening now and at what will happen in due course.  It was the iar-Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who proposed the transition period to give business and society those 16 months until December 2020 and the end of the multi-annual framework to adjust and prepare for the finality of Brexit when we know what that will look like.  </p><p>All that said, I am very worried about the tendency to knock everything.  I expect that from the arch-Brexiteers in the UK who are living in an absolute fantasy land and who believe that the empire will rule supreme, that they can just leave, that they can punish little old Ireland ,and that Europeans and their German car companies will be queueing up to beg them to stay.  I expect that from them and I expect it from the hard-line unionists, including those who resort to racist slurs as we saw yesterday, and those who are actually delighted by the prospect of a hard border and direct rule from Westminster, where they have a strong influence.  I expect that, but I am starting to get very worried about some of the domestic knockers who now see Brexit as an opportunity to attack the Government and score petty political points.  We have seen that over recent months.</p><p>We have seen certain people, including Border representatives, from certain parties call for that hard border and say that we need those checks for migration from the North.  We have seen certain party leaders say that it is time we started negotiating directly with London.  That is one of the most idiotic suggestions I have heard.  Why would we give up the negotiating stance we gain from being part of the world's largest economic trading bloc comprising 480 million people in favour of a direct Dublin-London negotiation?  Going down that route makes absolutely no sense in the short term and in the long term it would absolutely erode the serious solidarity which this Irish Government has built up in European circles.  It makes no sense.  We look at what has been done and what has been achieved domestically.  It is very important to say what is being achieved here and now rather than resorting to reports in November, which are quite simply ancient history when it comes to the Brexit negotiations.  </p><p>I know there are other comments which will come through.  Some have said that we need to use this as the catalyst or opportunity to go for a united Ireland.  The constitutional issue on this island has been agreed for the next generation and any premature move towards a Border poll or towards a united Ireland forced without consent would be a very dangerous path down to take.  We have to be wary of our constraints and our responsibilities within the European Union when we talk about things like special status for regions and islands.  Let us be aware of what we are; .we are part of the European Union, the most successful peace project in the history of mankind and something that has been wholly positive for Ireland in our short history since accession.  We joined the EEC in 1977 wholly reliant on the United Kingdom, which accounted for 60% of our external exports.  We stand here now faced with a very difficult decision, but the percentage of our external exports which go to the United Kingdom is down to 12% to 13%.  That is an achievement of our membership of that European project.  We are staying within that European project.  It is the right decision, it is a forceful decision and it is about time some people realised that if one tries to play petty politics with Brexit, all one is doing is damaging the Ireland's case, the European Union's case and the people they represent in this House.</p></speech>

I thank him so much for his input today.  I also thank the T&aacute;naiste for his continued engagement with Seanad &Eacute;ireann regarding Brexit, and particularly its impact on the North of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  We had a very positive debate marking the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement last month and in challenging times it is reassuring to know that everybody in this House appreciates just how important that agreement is and how we need to do everything in our power to protect it.</p> <p>Brexit is posing huge challenges in that regard but it is important to give credit where credit is due and to recognise the leadership and real commitment the T&aacute;naiste has shown on this issue.  I was in Washington last week and, speaking with civil society leaders and members of the Irish community in the US, it really struck me just how much positive feedback and strong appreciation there was on how the T&aacute;naiste, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Taoiseach are handling Brexit.  It is important to mention that today.  Everyone can see the amount of time and energy being put into it and the effort being made to mitigate against its worst effects.  We do have strong debates and disagreements in this House but, on this particular issue, the T&aacute;naiste really does have a broad level of support within the Oireachtas for the work he is doing.  Party political disagreements just should not come into it and he needs to know he has our full backing in the negotiations.  With March 2019 fast approaching, we must ensure that Ireland is prepared and united on this and I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in the hard months to come. </p> <p>In that sense I do not want to preach to the converted.  We have outlined in detail just how important it is that we avoid a hard border, that we protect the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, and that we ensure people&rsquo;s jobs and livelihoods are not lost to a hard Brexit.  The T&aacute;naiste know how vital these issues are already and they were outlined in detail by the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union last year, a committee of which I am proud to be a member.  On that issue, I also want to pay tribute to Senator Neale Richmond who did a great job on the report.  </p> <p>Our report launched last July was comprehensive and offered more than 100 potential solutions cutting across a huge number of areas.  One of my key priorities for that report was ensuring that the focus was not solely economic.  That is really what I want to emphasise today.  Brexit can have a hugely negative impact on trade and investment and that has rightly been a key concern for the Government, but it cannot be the only one.  We have to ensure that citizens' rights and protections are not seen as merely fourth or fifth in a hierarchy of issues but are treated as equally as important as trade.  On human rights, for example, Brexit is putting huge pressure on the Good Friday Agreement and the equality protections that are such an important part of it.  When the agreement was signed 20 years ago, it saw the European Convention on Human Rights incorporated into domestic law in the North.  It is worth noting just how important this was in terms of prohibiting discrimination on multiple grounds, including "sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status".  These are not just words on paper but concrete legal protections that can slowly but surely change people&rsquo;s lives.</p> <p>Similarly, in 2010, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights came into force and built on this further, offering improved protections on workers' rights, employment conditions, protections against unjust dismissal, access to healthcare, housing and social support, environmental standards, non-discrimination, gender equality and disability.  However, Theresa May&rsquo;s Conservative Party seems intent on repealing the Human Rights Act which underpins these protections.  There was a fantastic legal report produced by a team of London-based lawyers which outlines the threat this poses for human rights in the North.  The report states: "Brexit, on the current proposals of the UK Government, will weaken the protection of fundamental rights across the UK for both UK citizens and EU citizens."  This is a huge concern and we must be absolutely clear in Dublin, London and Brussels that we cannot see any reduction of human rights standards in the North of Ireland.  We must ensure that the protections currently available are upheld, that they are legally enforceable, and that they are equivalent to those enjoyed by those living South of the Border.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This important equivalence is the bedrock of peace.  Brexit is not just about economics.  It is about the basic conditions of life and the rights afforded to everyone living on this island, North and South.</p><p>Another matter that has been forgotten in much of the coverage so far is the importance of continued cross-Border co-operation on environmental protection.  It seems possible that the UK may no longer be bound by key EU environmental directives after Brexit.  There is a real uncertainty over the impact that could have.  I have admired the work of my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on this issue.  It has been made clear that environmental issues transcend borders.  There is a considerable overlap on issues like biodiversity, waterways and air quality.  It we are serious about protecting our natural environment and climate, we need a co-ordinated, consistent approach across the whole island.  Ireland is a single bio-geographic unit and Brexit will not change that simple, material fact.</p><p>I note that the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, has stated that the UK wants to remain a "leading actor" on climate change, but in this area in particular, actions speak louder than words.  We need to ensure that this means no slipping in standards.  I thank the Environmental Pillar for its great work in briefing the Seanad Brexit committee on this matter.</p><p>More attention needs to be paid to the role that EU funding has played in the North and the importance of maintaining it after March 2019.  During our committee hearings, we heard from many different groups and communities.  It was clear that many opportunities were being jeopardised by Brexit, particularly for young people.  Students from Northern Ireland are concerned that they could be excluded from EU programmes like ERASMUS or that they could be asked to pay tuition fees of up to &euro;20,000 to attend college in Ireland.  They fear that they may not be eligible for SUSI grants, which are important for accessing education and making university possible for families on lower incomes.  These may be minor details in the grand scheme of the negotiations but they are very important and can change people's lives.  Similarly, we heard that researchers in Ireland had been awarded &euro;386 million in EU funding as part of Horizon 2020, but there is major uncertainty about whether that scientific research will be jeopardised.</p><p>A matter that is extremely close to my heart is the provision of well-funded mental health services and community supports, especially in the North where such services are sorely needed.  The EU-funded PEACE programme has provided more than &euro;2.2 billion for cross-Border projects related to post-conflict recovery.  This includes assisting victims and survivors, providing conflict resolution workshops, trauma counselling, dealing with post-conflict substance abuse and addressing barriers, both physical and non-physical, to acknowledging and dealing with past trauma fully.  This sort of trauma carries a significant emotional weight.  Unless it is properly addressed, it can do untold damage to families and communities.  Despite the formal end to the conflict in the North, a substantial proportion of the adult population still suffers the adverse mental health effects of chronic trauma exposure.  If Brexit means reduced EU funding, then public expenditure cuts could see the closure of vital services.  We simply cannot allow that to happen.  I want the British and Irish Governments to show a strong commitment on this and make firm promises that funding for individuals, families and communities will be maintained no matter what happens in March 2019.</p><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste again for his work and commitment on this matter and I urge him to keep the issues of human rights, environmental protection and mental health services at the forefront of his mind during the negotiations in the coming months.</p></speech>

Those implications will permeate negatively through all aspects of our lives in Ireland.

I hope that we will have that debate on another day.</p> <p>I wish to focus on citizens' rights in a post-Brexit scenario.  I will raise a number of questions as well as a number of points in that regard.  Where is annexe 1, the list of rights that the protocol stated would be produced?  Will that list be signed off before the June Council meeting?  I recognise that the T&aacute;naiste and the EU have stated that they are in the midst of a negotiation but rights are a fundamental issue.  People from the agricultural and business communities are concerned about what Brexit and any re-emergence of a border would have on their lives, but there are also fears about how people will access justice, their rights as workers, the European courts and their rights as Irish and EU citizens trapped against their will in a post-Brexit North.</p> <p>In asking my questions, the T&aacute;naiste will appreciate that my consistent position has not been to be combative or confrontational with him, but to ask them from a sincere and deep-rooted place, given the conversations and engagements that I have been having with people.  To be fair to him, the T&aacute;naiste has also had such engagements.  Civic nationalism has certainly mobilised around the rights issue and has called on him and the Taoiseach to ensure that our rights as Irish citizens are fully protected as we move forward and that they do not become a high-wire act or 11th hour issue in the negotiations.  They must be well resolved, well assured and well set in legal and political contexts before we move closer to the 11th hour.  I also note and welcome the response from people within civic unionism who are keen to have that engagement with their nationalist counterparts and the Irish Government.</p> <p>The Taoiseach stated that never again would an Irish Government abandon citizens North of the Border.  With respect, it is time to put that assertion into action.  I would be keen to hear from the T&aacute;naiste where we stand in terms of annexe 1 and the list of rights, which we were told would be produced.  When will it be produced?</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste might not remember it, as he is a busy man, in which case I will give him a by-ball.  At the same Good Friday Agreement committee meeting five months ago, I put to him a suggestion - he said he was open to it and would engage with his officials - about a dedicated citizenship hub, namely, a facility or outlet for citizens in the North to have a direct interface with the Irish Government and engage with it on rights issues, agricultural issues or, as Senator Black referenced, the rights and entitlements of students under various programmes.  One of the main questions I am asked by pupils when I visit schools with my colleague, Ms Martina Anderson, MEP, is whether they will be able to attend Trinity or study Irish at NUI Galway.  There is uncertainty about these matters.  I can answer up to a point but, given his exchanges and engagements in the North, the T&aacute;naiste appreciates the need for a dedicated resource that is open to citizens in order that a conduit through which to engage with the Irish Government and EU structures, the protection of rights and the ability to avail of information are afforded to us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Mar fhocal scoir, I will finish by raising the issue of annexe 1.

Perhaps the Acting Chairman might indicate to me.</p> <p>At the outset, I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his attendance and for his continuing commitment to getting this process right.  If it is difficult to make these points in eight minutes, it is more difficult in three but I will try.  At the civic engagement yesterday, I was chatting to somebody about how the vast majority of the population of Europe now do not remember the Second World War, its horrors and all that went with it.  That is a huge part of our difficulty.  They do not see the need for this ongoing European peace project.  That is particularly the case in the UK, though there are elements of it right across Europe.  That is a tragedy, but it is a tragedy caused by a lack of memory.  God knows it is difficult to get over that, but it is a problem.</p> <p>I am happy that the common travel area is sorted and we have received a commitment on the backstop.  I will read one sentence from paragraph 49 of the December agreement.  It states, "In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement."  That is a very unambiguous commitment.  Similarly, Prime Minister Theresa May in March 2018 stated that the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 must be protected in all its parts.  Those commitments have been achieved.  That is a huge achievement on the part of our diplomatic service, our permanent Civil Service and the Government.  Two Governments, the last one and the current one, can take a bow for that.  It is an enormous achievement, which I would love to discuss further.</p> <p>I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that the obvious preference is to achieve a comprehensive agreement that prevents the backstop, that is, one that removes the need for it.  That is what we all want to achieve.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the customs union in that regard, and the need to ensure there are no customs barriers on the Border.  I agree fully.  I am sure that as a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he will have no difficulty with the view that we also need an agreement on alignment of standards.  We need to prevent a situation where substandard food or improperly produced beef could come into our islands and could use that as a way of getting into the EU.  It is important that we have an alignment of standards, as well as no customs duties.  </p> <p>In deference to the Acting Chairman's ambition to accommodate all the speakers, I will conclude by saying to the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the people of the Border area in Cavan and Monaghan that this is life-and-death stuff.  The whole society depends on this.  We want him to hold the line right up to the end.  There must be no flinching on the hard Border, and if it comes to it, no matter what it takes, we want him to hold the line. </p></speech>

I know he is under time pressure.  It is rather unfortunate for such an important issue to be squeezed into such a short time.  I know it is a special day for Senators Lawlor and Marshall, and I can appreciate that.  I will not go over any of the previous items that have been mentioned by other speakers because of the amount of time available to me.  I will ask a couple of questions of the T&aacute;naiste.  He said something I suppose we have all said when speaking about Brexit, that we have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  That is the phrase the T&aacute;naiste used.  With that in mind, what is the attitude of the EU if it were to be a hard Brexit, if the negotiations were to break down or if there could be no agreement?  What plans have the EU put in place for Ireland?  While Mr. Barnier and everybody who speaks are 100% on the Irish side and see the disaster a hard Brexit would be, what actions or contingency plans are being prepared on the European side in case it does happen?  As the T&aacute;naiste said, we have to plan for the worst, though we all hope for the best.  If that were to happen, for the sake of the Irish economy and Irish society we would need to secure exemptions from state aid rules to support sectors which will be worst hit such as the agrifood sector, which is close to my own heart and is the area where I have the most interest and knowledge.</p> <p>Such exemptions are part of every accession treaty, and I think they should also be part of the UK exit treaty.  Behind the scenes, is the EU planning with Ireland for a worst-case scenario, and if not, why not?  We have to plan for such an outcome.  I know the T&aacute;naiste is in the midst of negotiations, and it is important in most negotiations to hold one's cards close to one's chest in order that one's position is not public knowledge.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government need to get out the message of the potential effects of a hard Brexit and of this not working out in the fashion we might all like.  When one talks to people on the street on a daily basis as I do, one sees that there is an unbelievable number of people in every walk of life, including business, education, the medical sector or any profession, who say it still will not happen.  They believe the British will back down at the 11th hour.  I know and the T&aacute;naiste knows that is probably not going to happen.  People out there are in denial because they cannot see a solution.  They say that the British are looking at the problem in a similar fashion; they cannot see a solution, so they will roll back at the 11th hour.  We need to dispel that attitude among the people.  </p></speech>

The job they are doing is exceptional.  They are representing this country well and anywhere we travel we hear of the work they have done.  However, it is not the members of the Government that bother me.  It is those on the other side of the water that bother me.  It is the UK.  There seems to be a total lack of any coherent plan.  I know I should not use the b-word, but I do not believe that a border will imposed by the European Union <i>per se</i>.  However, I do not believe that the British are prepared to establish some way of managing traffic to and fro on the Northern side.  This will eventually force us into a situation where a border exists, whether we like it or not.  That is my fear.  I know we do not like to talk about that, but it is my fear.</p><p>The problem is that we do not have the resources to manage any sort of border.  We have a barracks in Donegal, a barracks in Dundalk and nothing in between.  There are 208 crossings and 490 km of road.  We do not want to go back to blasting unapproved roads.  I hope, as my colleague has just said, that there are contingency plans in place and that we are thinking about the unthinkable.  One of the things we might do is look at Mullingar barracks, and perhaps close its gates and have it ready in case it is needed.  That would be one of the things I would suggest, but I can see the Minister smiling.  I know why he is smiling but that is all right.  </p></speech>

I am sure we will be talking about Brexit in this House again.  I know there is a lot of interest in it, and indeed in other issues linked to Northern Ireland and our relationships on this island.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course there is an impatience for certainty in these negotiations.  Often, when people speak about Brexit in this House or in the D&aacute;il, there is a sense that no solution is possible because we do not have a solution now.  This is arguably the most complex negotiation Ireland has been involved in in my lifetime when we consider the political circumstances we find ourselves in.  We are trying to negotiate our closest neighbour leaving the European Union, along with part of our island.  Britain will leave 750 international agreements the moment it leaves the European Union.  This involves unwinding 46 years of membership and everything that has been built up, layer by layer, by virtue of EU membership.  It involves trying to manage a situation where 38,000 Irish companies trade directly with Britain every single month.  Some 200,000 people work for those 38,000 companies, which represents 10% of our workforce.  There is a relationship worth &euro;65 billion in terms of trade, which is &euro;1.3 billion every single week.  That is a large amount of money for 5 million people.  Of course, factored into that is a commitment and determination to protect the Good Friday Agreement, put in place as a foundation for peace in Northern Ireland 20 years ago, which itself was a very complicated but hugely important framework for peace and reconciliation which allowed neighbours to live together in the absence of conflict and friction on this island.  We have to protect that through all of these negotiations.  </p><p>There is a different and somewhat confused political situation in Westminster, after a referendum on EU membership which resulted in a vote which was almost 50-50.  Of course, a majority in Northern Ireland voted not to leave the European Union, as was the case in Scotland, yet both of those places are leaving the EU because they are part of the broader United Kingdom.  We have one party in Northern Ireland which is part of a confidence and supply agreement with the British Government, allowing it to pass legislation.  We have an absence of devolved government in Northern Ireland during all of this, and we are trying to put that back together too.  We are facing multiple challenges at the same time.  We are trying to maintain relationships throughout all of this.</p><p>Ireland is determined to stay in the European Union as an active supporter of the project, and as part of a Single Market that has been so good for the Irish economy, while at the same time ensuring that our relationship with Britain remains closer than ever post-Brexit.  There are more Irish-born people living in Britain than there are people living in Connaught, in case anyone is unclear about how interwoven this relationship is.  </p><p>All of that complexity is part of what Ireland brings to this negotiation.  Britain also has many other things to deal with besides the Irish issues.  We have focused on building a solidarity on the Irish issues, and we should not forget the progress we have made.  Ireland is at the centre of these negotiations.  A relatively small EU member state is now probably more influential in these negotiations than any other member state in the European Union.  Our relationship with Michel Barnier and his task force, which is negotiating on behalf of 27 countries, is very special.  I am sure Mr. Barnier would not mind my saying that.  We literally work with that team on a daily basis to try to figure out these issues.  </p><p>I do not see this as Ireland versus Britain.  We need to work with the United Kingdom to try to find a way forward to ensure that at the end of this process, we maintain the closest possible relationship with it that we can.  Britain is going to be outside the EU, but will still be tied to Europe as a confidant in the future.  That is the objective, and we have already succeeded in getting many of our specific Irish issues across the line.  The preservation of the common travel area will allow students from Northern Ireland to come to Trinity and other universities in the future.  There is much consensus that the Erasmus programme has to be maintained.  We have consensus that PEACE funding has to be maintained into the future.  We have a clear political commitment that there will be no border infrastructure of any kind and no related checks or controls.  We also have an agreement that a backstop insurance mechanism will be put in place as a fall-back position if we cannot negotiate something better.  I want to be clear; we do not want any border down the Irish Sea, in the same way that we do not want any border on the island of Ireland.  It is not in Ireland's interest for that to happen.  However, the current negotiating position of the British Government makes many of those things more difficult than they need to be.  There is an acceptance that the next move on the Border issue is Britain's to make.  </p><p>The progress of the negotiations will be assessed towards the end of June.  I am optimistic and confident that we can find a way forward.  While we will continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario - much of the contingency planning has been done - I believe we will make progress on citizens' rights issues.  I also believe that we will see a list emerging in annexe 1; I am glad to say that there is goodwill in the effort to make that work from both sides.  We can also find a way forward on the Border issue, but it will require a change of approach from the British negotiating team, and I hope that we see that soon.  </p></speech>

At the moment I have listed Senators Leyden, Craughwell, Buttimer, Dolan and &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I call the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#OO00300"><p>I might be a little over the eight minutes.  I might ask for leniency.  I very much welcome the opportunity the Senators have given me to speak about our Defence Forces and the actions that the Government is taking to develop the Defence Forces as outlined in the White Paper on Defence 2015.</p><p>Defence is a very serious matter and there is a strong danger that overstating the issues facing the Defence Forces will ultimately damage the Defence Forces.  In today&rsquo;s information age, an individual with a smartphone can reach a wide audience and the material that is being disseminated does not undergo quality assurance.  I want to deal with facts and I look forward to engaging with Senators on that basis this evening.</p><p>At the outset I want to again restate my admiration for the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  They provide important and vital supports both at home and overseas.  In early March we all witnessed one aspect of this work when the Defence Forces contributed to our national efforts in responding to Storm Emma.  When deployed overseas the Defence Forces represent the very best of this country.  They serve with pride and distinction, continuing to enhance an impressive reputation that has been earned over 60 years of continual contributions to international peacekeeping.  Today Ireland has over 600 members of the Defence Forces serving in ten different missions, including our ship in the Mediterranean.  I want to thank those individuals and recognise their families, for it is not just those who serve overseas that make sacrifices, their deployment also impacts on their partners, children, families, friends, parents and all family members.</p><p>I have always acknowledged the challenges that face the Defence Forces and I have taken a wide range of measures to begin to address these.  The steps that have been taken include initiatives on pay, recruitment, increased opportunities to serve overseas, reviewing contracts and reviewing the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The fact is that the Government continues to demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are equipped and well trained to the best international standards to meet operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p><p>The budget allocation for 2018 delivered an additional &euro;25 million.  An additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure has been provided out to 2021.  One of my priorities as Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence is to ensure that our Defence Forces continue to have access to modern equipment and technologies.  The acquisition of new equipment and equipment upgrades for the Defence Forces is considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability deployment and equipment priorities planning processes.  Significant investment in equipment is taking place in the coming years in this context.</p><p>The ongoing capital investment in the Defence Forces is providing the maintenance and development of key capabilities.  I visited the General Dynamics Europe Land Systems, Mowag, facility in Switzerland recently where we have a programme under way for the maintenance and upgrade of our current fleet of armoured personnel carriers, APCs.  I also visited the Pilatus facility where we have placed a contract for three new PC-12 aircraft.  In terms of capabilities, these new aircraft will be specially equipped with intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, ISTAR, tasks and will represent a significant enhancement of existing capabilities.  Planning has also commenced recently for the replacement of two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  A fourth new ship for the Naval Service, to be named <i>L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw</i>, will be delivered later this year, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million.  There is very significant work under way and the Government remains committed to continuing our significant investment in the Defence Forces to meet existing and emerging challenges in the defence and security environment both domestically and overseas.</p><p>I want to address human resources, HR.  Human resources are the key component of capability.  We face HR challenges, similar to other areas of the public service, in recruitment and retention of certain personnel.  The Defence Forces climate survey was commissioned on foot of a recommendation contained in the third and most recent report of the independent monitoring group.  The comments arising from the survey cover a wide range of issues on human resource management including, among others: pay and conditions, particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces; vacancies; recruitment; retention; promotion systems; performance management; leadership; culture; morale; stress; and work-life balance.</p><p>The opinions expressed highlight a number of challenges for the Defence Forces in human resource management across the areas of leadership, communications, organisational culture and the working environment.  While work to progress many of the issues was already under way or planned as part of the implementation of the White Paper on Defence, I have directed that certain projects be brought forward and that work commence on these immediately.  I am also acutely aware that many of the issues raised challenge assumptions regarding existing approaches, some of which were previously agreed following a detailed consultation.  This is a challenge for both management and staff and I am very much aware that there has been ongoing work across a range of HR issues.</p><p>It is worth noting that although pay is just one of the issues raised in the climate survey, it is the one which has received the most attention.  It must also be noted that the climate survey pre-dated acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, of the Lansdowne Road agreement and the pay increases that ensued.  Similar to other areas within the public service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, was reduced during the financial crisis.  The reduction in pay was on a graduated basis with increased rates of deductions for those on higher earnings.  This action was one of the measures necessary to be taken to stabilise the financial situation which faced the country at the beginning of this decade.  Memories cannot be so short that people have forgotten the crisis that we were in at that time.  It must also be remembered that a number of cuts to certain allowances were agreed by the representative associations as part of the pay deals.  Accordingly, their unwinding is encompassed within this process.  The success of Government policies is apparent in the improvements within the economy which has provided the opportunity to begin the unwinding of the public  service pay cuts imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, otherwise known as FEMPI legislation.</p><p>The Defence Forces pay is increasing in line with recent public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighed in favour of those on lower pay.  Members of the Defence Forces received increases in pay in 2017 under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In addition, in a deal agreed with PDFORRA, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid.  By the end of the agreement, the pay scales of all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, earning up to &euro;70,000 will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of cuts to allowances will also be considered in the context of the agreement.  An increase of 1% on annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>There is a persistent narrative which suggests that those in the Defence Forces are the lowest paid members of the public sector.  In an organisation like the Defence Forces where the organisational design is that just over 48% of the establishment is comprised of privates, there is a requirement to ensure that any statistics cited, such as average pay, are contextualised.  I suggest that it is more appropriate to consider the pay on offer for each job, having regard to what is on offer elsewhere for positions requiring similar skills and qualifications.  The Defence Forces offer competitive starting salaries and excellent career opportunities for any young person thinking about joining.  Following the series of pay increases in the past 12 months, a young three-star private on completion of training starts on &euro;27,527, inclusive of military service allowance.  This is an increase of &euro;5,700, 25%, on the starting pay scale in the last 12 months.  This starting pay compares very favourably with other entry level pay rates across the public service.  A newly commissioned officer starts on a salary, inclusive of military service allowance, in excess of &euro;35,000 per annum following 15 months training.  If officers are already graduates, they start on a salary in excess of &euro;40,000 per annum, inclusive of military service allowance.  These rates compare favourably with the average graduate salary across all sectors.  In general service promotion ranks, for Defence Forces personnel paying class A PRSI, the starting pay for a corporal, including military service allowance, is almost &euro;39,000 per annum.  The first point on the pay scale for a sergeant, including military service allowance, is just under &euro;42,000 per annum.  For officers who are promoted and who pay class A PRSI, including military service allowance, the first points on their pay scales are as follows: captain, &euro;51,033; commandant, &euro;63,644; lieutenant colonel, &euro;76,060; and colonel, &euro;86,579.</p><p>These figures represent basic pay, including military service allowance.  Members of the Defence Forces also benefit from additional pay rates and allowances.  These include technical pay, which, depending on the job of the individual member, ranges from &euro;420 to &euro;7,000 extra annually.  In March, 3,680 members of the Defence Forces - approximately 40% of serving personnel - were in receipt of technical pay.  Members of the Defence Forces also receive a range of duty allowances depending on their assigned taskings.</p><p>In the past two years, we have increased the opportunities for serving personnel to serve overseas.  The average overseas payment received by general service personnel was just over &euro;8,000 and the average paid to officers was almost  &euro;10,300.  These are significant and deserved tax-free payments that are made to personnel who serve Ireland with pride and distinction.</p><p>Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.  This is not new and the Permanent Defence Force has always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service.  Some 2,832 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force in the last five years, from 2013 to 2017, inclusive.  This figure looks stark and paints a bleak picture if it is taken out of context and considered in isolation from the long-term trends.  The selective use of short-term statistics can lead to confusion and misunderstanding.  This short-term information does not show that the numbers departing the Permanent Defence Force in recent years are, with some exceptions, broadly consistent with the long-term trend.  An analysis of data dating back a number of years shows very similar numbers.  For example, in the five years 2008 to 2012, a total of 2,935 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force.  Some 2,889 left in the five-year period from 2003 to 2007.  Within these figures, on average approximately 22% of general service recruits do not complete their induction training.</p><p>In order to balance personnel turnover, there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level.  During 2017, 751 personnel were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force.  It is anticipated that approximately 800 personnel, including general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers, will be recruited to the Permanent Defence Force in 2018.</p><p>The success of Government policies is clearly evident in the economy, which is continuing to grow strongly, providing far more job opportunities than we have seen in recent years.  Nonetheless, a career in the Defence Forces is still a very attractive proposition.  It is pleasing that the number of applications to join the Defence Forces exceeds the numbers that were applying prior to the economic crash when there were similar employment opportunities.  However, I am also aware that the number finally inducted relative to the number of applicants is lower than in the past and this must be considered.</p><p>I have previously outlined particular challenges in certain specialist posts, such as those relating to pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are competing private sector and commercial semi-State sector job opportunities.  The extensive professional training that such specialists receive within the Defence Forces makes them very attractive within these sectors.  This is not a unique challenge for the Defence Forces, it is also faced by military forces elsewhere.  The issue of specialist vacancies throughout the Permanent Defence Force is being addressed by means of a range of recruitment methods that include direct entry competitions for specialist positions.  The scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  Civil and military management have been directed to develop proposals to facilitate former Permanent Defence Forces personnel with appropriate skill sets to re-enter the Defence Forces.</p><p>The Public Service Pay Commission was a central component of the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  It established an agreed process for looking at public sector pay taking cognisance of the needs of all sub-sectors.  In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence raised recruitment and retention issues as part of the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.  In a further acknowledgement of these issues, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with examining these challenges in the defence sector in more detail.  The Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has prioritised the health sector and Defence Forces so that issues relating to recruitment, retention and specialist pay will be considered by the pay commission.  It has commenced its work and has asked the Department of Defence to provide it with hard data and detailed information.  It is important that the commission is given the opportunity to do its work and I have already outlined the pitfalls of misinterpreting data.  For this reason, I do not wish to engage in lengthy debate regarding what the statistics do or do not show.  That is for the Public Service Pay Commission to consider and I do not wish to pre-empt its work.  The Department of Defence is continuing to work in close collaboration with military management with the aim of jointly preparing the material requested.  The military authorities have produced a paper which is being considered by my Department having regard to the hard data and information requested by the Public Service Pay Commission.  It is proving more difficult than anticipated to source the information requested, particularly in the context of specialist personnel but it is important that the full range of data is submitted.  The Department has forwarded an initial tranche of information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will forward the remaining data and information in the coming weeks when it becomes available.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Public Service Pay Commission is due to complete its exercise in the second half of 2018.

A number of initiatives have been instigated, including the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These measures address a range of issues and are aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to undertake the roles assigned by Government and remain a career of choice for anyone who wants to work in a challenging and varied environment which provides opportunities for lifelong learning and self-development.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#QQ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  His speech was very comprehensive and will be read by the representative bodies.  Like three other Senators, I have been nominated to the House since 2002 by PDFORRA and RACO, which are part of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, ICPSA, the organisation that nominates seven Senators.  It is a matter for the nominated Senators to get elected, of course.  Senator Craughwell is also nominated by ICPSA as are Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Robbie Gallagher.  We take that position very seriously.  Those organisations give us the responsibility to work with them as representatives in Oireachtas.  PDFORRA and RACO are not unions but representative bodies.  I know the Minister of State has been very attentive in attending all the functions, dinner and events and that he respects their input into the work he is doing.  They have the interests of their personnel in sight, naturally, and so has the Minister of State with overall responsibility for the Defence Forces.</p> <p>Irish people rightly take great pride in our Defence Forces and the contribution made by the Permanent Defence Force, the Reserve Defence Force and by Civil Defence.  We all agree that the single greatest asset the Defence Forces have is their personnel, yet the Defence Forces are facing huge difficulty in retaining and recruiting sufficient personnel, as was mentioned by the Minister of State.  The Defence Forces are now seriously below strength and it is time to significantly rebuild.  The decline over recent years has left the force with just 9,057 personnel, some 443 below the current agreed strength.  Two huge recruitment campaigns in 2016 and 2017 have resulted in no overall increase.  Retention is a major problem with exit from the Defence Forces by all ranks running on average at almost 60 a month.</p> <p>Ireland needs to recommit to its Defence Forces and its defence capability.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that we should look to increase our Defence Forces to 10,500 in coming years but we also believe that it just as important to retain what we have.  There is a recruitment drive under way at present which I hope will be successful.  I would certainly encourage young men and women to join the Defence Forces.  It is a very exciting role and a tremendous contribution to the State.  Their work abroad in the Mediterranean and on overseas peace missions is recognised throughout the world.  The training of our Defence Forces is second to none in the world.  We have an enormous reputation as peace makers and peace maintainers in different regions of the world.  We are very proud of that work.</p> <p>PDFORRA and RACO, which represents the officers, do an excellent job in representing their personnel.  One of the more remarkable claims from the October 2017 PDFORRA conference was that the soldiers, sailors and air crews lost a combined 146,000 days annual leave in the past five years.  This happened primarily because reduced numbers in the Defence Forces meant they had to plug gaps.  PDFORRA estimates that this saved the Department of Defence anything between &euro;17 million and &euro;22 million.  The PDFORRA general secretary, Gerry Guinan, said shortages in personnel mean bomb disposal officers are working an average of 76 hours a week, while NCOs are doing 56 hours a week and drivers anything up to 60 hours per week.  They want to see the immediate implementation of the EU working time directive for members of the Defence Forces.  PDFORRA points out that as far back as 2013, the Government was aware that the EU working time directive applies to members of the Defence Forces, yet here we are in 2017 with still no word on the implementation of this legislation in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The members of the Defence Forces need and deserve clarity.  Furthermore, the Department of Defence is failing to provide for the provision of the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 to serving personnel.  Outgoing PDFORRA president, Mark Scally, said that it was clearly intended for this legislation to benefit members of the Defence Forces like everybody else.  One therefore has to ask why that legislation is not being brought forward.</p> <p>PDFORRA is now campaigning for the restoration of the Saturday and Sunday premium rates.  I know the Minister of State is well disposed towards their claim although he has to negotiate with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  PDFORRA is very anxious to resolve the matter and restore the allowance.  I hope it will be possible to have that implemented.</p> <p>In respect of the Air Corps, we are aware of the number of pilots who are being recruited by the private sector.  That is why the Minister of State and the Government will have to look at the whole pay rate structure for our pilots.  We have very well trained and effective pilots and the State spends quite an amount of money in their recruitment and training.  They are sought after by every airline in the world.  Safety is a major factor.  I have experienced how they work.  When I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I was in their company in the Government jet on trade missions.  Their care and attention to duty was second to none.  Ryanair, Aer Lingus and all the other airlines are anxious to recruit those excellent men and women.  In the circumstances, special consideration is required of the Minister of State to retain them.</p> <p>I commend our Naval Service and the work it is doing in the Mediterranean.  It has saved a great number of lives in the last few years.  I give absolute credit to its members.  I commend the Minister of State on his work.  He is accessible to the representative bodies and I am very pleased about that.  I know he is being very attentive to his duties and is taking them very seriously.  I have a lot more that I could say but I only have eight minutes.  I thank PDFORRA and RACO for their friendship over the years to me as a representative in the Seanad who is nominated by them through the ICPSA.  I have always respected that nomination.  It is my duty and responsibility to highlight the issues as my colleagues have done in this House.  It is a tremendous responsibility and asset for them to be in a position to have four Senators elected to his House.  It gives them a voice and they certainly use it very respectfully and keep us well briefed.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, the first official review of the 2015 White Paper on Defence is due to commence in July.  Even though the ten-year White Paper is only into its third year, the world is certainly a very changed place.  Brexit, the uncertainty of a hard border, increased international terrorism, cyber-security, transnational organised crime and mass migration are all new challenges that the Defence Forces are facing.  I have the utmost faith in the Minister of State's commitment and the capabilities of both the Department of Defence and military management to identify, map out and respond to the emerging situation and these challenges.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What concerns me and many other stakeholders is the internal threat to the capability and stability of the Defence Forces due to a developing crisis in personnel retention.  There is an article in the national newspapers on this problem nearly every day now and while I have congratulated the Minister of State on a very successful recruitment campaign last year, this campaign is being systematically undermined by what can only be described as a crisis in retaining those who have been recently recruited and in providing satisfactory contracts of employment for enlisted personnel, as well as career paths, pay and conditions of employment for those who already serve.  Some 84% of those serving in the Defence Forces earn 13.8% less than the national average.  Getting &euro;20 for 24 hours' duty is not true compensation.<br/><br/>I agree with the White Paper that &quot;continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces; providing young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments.&quot;  The White Paper provides for rolling manpower planning but it does not appear to be working.  An article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>points out that in 2016 alone, a total of 62 officers and 441 enlisted personnel left the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps voluntarily.  Last October I raised the issue of new recruits leaving the forces to take up jobs in Tesco and warned that this crisis was coming down the line.  I believe the Minister of State told us that 712 joined.  Of that group, 576 left while in training and a further 31 cadets.  It blows me away that cadets would actually walk out of the Defence Forces.  It is not the Minister of State's fault; there are issues there.<br/><br/>Across the Defence Forces, a total of 2,496 recruits started training between 2013 and 2017.  To date, 641 of them have left.  In the same period a total of 2,831 personnel left, which represents 29.8% of the entire Defence Forces.  Some 76% of those retiring were premature voluntary retirements with 34% having served five years or less.  I understand that in 2019, a significant number of NCOs will be leaving the forces and we know that they are the lifeblood of any unit.  The NCOs are the culture-forming members of any unit.  Officers come and go; the NCOs remain on.  This seems to have passed over the heads of the policy makers.<br/><br/>This brain and manpower drain is now at a level that could not have been envisaged by the White Paper, which makes scant reference to the issue of retention, which is conspicuous by its absence.  This again points to a failure by the policy makers.  Does the Department have retention policy in place and if so can the details of it be released?<br/><br/>As the Minister of State said, 9,500 established PDF personnel provides for the full staffing of each unit within the Defence Forces organisational structures.  We know that strength at station is the key figure.  In recent weeks we have seen how that has impacted on the Second Brigade and in particular on the 27th Infantry Battalion where three captains and two lieutenants are running an entire battalion.  They have been augmented recently by one commandant.  This is an outrageous breakdown in command and control.  It is an operational issue and the Minister of State cannot be out there dealing with operational matters.<br/><br/>The current exodus is playing havoc with this.  Several times last year the strength of the Defence Forces dipped below 9,000.  We hear of personnel being redeployed to areas far from their homes, personnel acting up for long durations, and in some cases a complete breakdown of command and control.<br/><br/>There will be accidents.  Already there have been three near misses with 0.5 calibre heavy machine guns.  If such an accident takes place and if lives are lost, where will the indemnity lie?  Who will be liable?  Will it go all the way up to the Department or will it stop at the senior officer in charge?  It is simply not workable to have a captain in charge of a battalion.<br/><br/>The jury is out on the two-brigade structure but is will be difficult to assess and review it with the current crisis in retention.  The ripple effect of the retention crisis is enormous.  For a start there is the cost of &euro;4 million for replacing the officers who have left and &euro;11 million in replacing the enlisted personnel.  That is &euro;15 million down the drain thus far.<br/><br/>As I have said, many are leaving in training.  There is the loss of institutional and organisational knowledge, loss of motivation and morale as outlined in the University of Limerick climate survey.  What is most worrying is that personnel from all ranks and specialties are leaving.  Much is made of the fact that those leaving are the highly skilled technical personnel such as pilots, ordnance engineers, marine engineers, aeronautical engineers and other specialists.  However, that only accounts for 30% of those who have left.  The other 70% is made up of general service enlisted men and women.<br/><br/>Last year the Naval Service received well-deserved national and international recognition for its humanitarian missions in the Mediterranean yet at home it is a service in crisis.  Recently P52, <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>, put to sea with just four able seamen on board.  It is reckless that an asset worth over &euro;50 million is sent to sea understaffed.  What happens if a fire takes place on board?  Are crew there to take care of these things?  I do not think so.  If they are called into an operational situation, are they capable of handling it?  I do not believe they are.  What is happening with respect to drug interdiction controls and patrolling human trafficking, for which the Naval Service is responsible? <br/><br/>Since 2011 the Air Corps has lost 50 pilots.  Pilots are being offered jobs paying up to &euro;200,000 in the private sector.  Another issue is the lack of qualified CASA pilots.  I wonder whether any CASA aircraft take off any more.  Again this is not an issue for the Minister of State but for the operational people.  I ask him to see if he can get the matter addressed.  <br/><br/>I know that the Defence Forces have a number of recommendations, not least of which would be a separate pay review body for those who serve in uniform.  As the one-size-fits-all of the national pay rounds does not fit the uniformed services, we should look at that.<br/><br/>Focusing on the low paid is one thing but raising the pay of the lower paid and leaving the ranks above without an increase in pay, closes the gap between lower ranks and the next up the line.  The people up the ranks are getting tired and are deciding to leave.  I received a text today from a woman whose husband was aged 50.  She has three young children.  He is finishing because he has to on an age basis, but he has nowhere to go and nothing to do.<br/><br/>The Minister of State is about to review the White Paper and reconsider the reorganisation that took place in 2012.  I wish him luck with it.  If I can be of any help on it, I will try.</p></speech>

I will not take eight minutes because the Minister of State has set out very comprehensively the work the Defence Forces have done and that they need to carry out in the coming years.</p> <p>There is a challenge on investment.  On the good side we have a flow into the economy, which means we can invest in this vital service.  The Army, Naval Service and Air Corps provide vital security to the country.  They also provide fantastic support in a peacekeeping role.  As the Minister of State said, more than 600 people are currently on ten different missions throughout the world.  A number of years ago I was in one of the areas in which they worked in very difficult conditions on the Sudanese border.  It is not an easy job for any member of the Defence Forces, whether they are in a role as commander or as an ordinary member of the Defence Forces there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a major challenge to go to another jurisdiction to deal with volatile situations which can change overnight.  It is interesting that the one thing about Irish troops, and likewise the Naval Service, is that they have a really good reputation no matter where they go.  I remember being in the European Parliament when a member of the British Army came in and made a presentation to a committee advising in respect of the operation which was under way in Chad at the time.  He said that the Irish Army had achieved more in six months than the French Army had in 30 years.  That was because of the way in which our Army approaches situations.  It is not about pointing guns and telling people what to do.  It is about going in and asking people what the Army can do for them and how it can help them.  That is exactly what it did in its role.  In every country it has gone into in its peacekeeping role it has been about working with the community.  I suppose that comes from our own ethos in this country of trying to help others who do not have the expertise or skills to complete a task.  The members of the Defence Forces have that expertise and are prepared to use it for the benefit of others.  That says an awful lot about the dedication and commitment of all ranks in the Defence Forces down through the years.</p><p>Yes, there are major challenges in the Defence Forces now.  There is no question or doubt about that.  It is like in every State organisation when the economy is improving.  Looking at today's unemployment figures, one should remember that we have come from 15.9% unemployment down to less than 6% today.  We are practically at full employment.  We will now have challenges in retaining people in their respective roles both in the Civil Service and in areas such as the Army and the Naval Service.  Another reason people in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are being sought is that they have the training, that they are extremely well disciplined and that, when they are employed, they deliver the service they are employed to deliver.  It is one of the advantages of going through a period of time in an organisation in which there are very strict command structures and a very strict way in which units are managed.  That gives people an advantage no matter what job they go into in the future.  We must also respond to those challenges.  It is not something which can be done overnight.  It is a case of constantly reviewing the situation.  The Minister of State already gave an outline in respect of the White Paper.  We need to constantly review and update the kinds of jobs and security we can provide to people working in the Defence Forces.  </p><p>There is no question or doubt that as full employment is reached there will a challenge in retaining people.  In Cork, for instance, the Naval Service has had huge challenges in retaining people because there is a number of companies just up the road from Haulbowline that are able to offer jobs to members of the Defence Forces, including members of the Naval Services, at pay rates which challenge people who love the work they are in but who must support themselves and their young families.  We have to be careful to ensure that we can respond to that challenge.  </p><p>A lot of progress, however, has been made in recent years.  Yes, there were cutbacks at the time of the downturn in the economy and there were challenges in respect of not being able to provide the quality of accommodation and backup support required by the Defence Forces during those times, but that has now changed.  In fairness to the Minister of State, my understanding is that there is more than &euro;541 million to be invested between 2018 and 2021.  That is a huge sum of money which was not previously available.  It is important that we spend that money wisely to the advantage of this country, but also to the advantage of the people working in all areas of the Defence Forces, whether as privates, sergeants, corporals or commanding officers.  It is important that we respond accordingly to their requirements and the challenges they face.  Again I thank the Minister of State.  It is important that the investment programme continues.  If possible, additional funding should be put into the Defence Forces to maintain it and to make sure it is ready to face the challenges of the next 20 to 25 years.</p></speech>

I am very proud of my own late father's lifelong service in the Defence Forces.  He joined in 1940.  His brother-in-law, S&eacute;amus Connolly, received his commission from Douglas Hyde.  I am glad to say he is still to the good and I am looking forward to welcoming him here to the Houses in the coming weeks.  My own brother Jim has also served with the Defence Forces.  I have a tradition of understanding Army men from the times about which I am talking.  We are making these statements on International Workers' Day.  Members of our Defence Forces are workers as well as having a very particular and critical area of work.  I want to note that it is unacceptable that members of the Defence Forces are still being provided with inadequate conditions of pay with which to support themselves and their families.  It is important and urgent that this be dealt with and that we invest in the welfare of members of our Defence Forces and their families.  There are many countries around the world with very high military spending but in which members of the Defence Forces themselves still have very low pay and conditions.  We have a peacekeeping Army and Defence Forces and we can justifiably be extremely proud of that tradition.  We can also be proud of their support for the civilian authorities through every decade.</p> <p>I will ask the Minister of State one question now and I will have a few more later.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State were to tell us whether the implementation for permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and when we can expect that.  There are real issues and tensions in respect of our traditional stance of neutrality, collective EU responsibilities and solidarity in a world which is becoming more sharply and violently divided.  That is almost putting it mildly.  </p> <p>The Defence Forces are one of the true success stories in this democracy of ours.  They have served with honour and pride both at home and overseas since the foundation of the State.  Their loyalty to his State at all times has been a testament to how an armed force can support a government and, more important, its people.  Our Defence Forces mix easily in Irish communities and are very much part of them.  To echo a point made by Senator Colm Burke and others, they mix and relate equally well with the people they support all over the world in their peacekeeping duties.  </p> <p>In recent times the Defence Forces have struggled, to put it mildly, to recruit and retain personnel.  Surely with the right incentives and some creativity this issue can be overcome.  We have to overcome it.  It is particularly concerning that the organisation continually loses key technical staff which it then seems unable to replace.  We need to invest in our Defence Forces now.  They are excellent value for money compared to any defence force around the world.  </p> <p>There may be opportunity on the horizon for our Defence Forces, especially in the context of the EU.  Those opportunities can be availed of in keeping with our neutral stance.  It is vitally important that a lack of investment at this time does not deny our Defence Forces access to opportunities which can maximise their potential; more importantly their potential as a critical asset to Ireland; and our nation's potential in respect of any ongoing and future developments at EU level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They play an ambassadorial role and enhance our reputation in a practical way among ordinary people around the world.  Ireland has participated on the world stage through the UN but it is important to remember that Ireland has also participated in EU-sponsored peacekeeping missions.<br/><br/>I attended a dinner ten years ago to commemorate men who fought and fell in the First World War as well as members of our Defence Forces who had died, mainly on UN duty.  I was sitting beside a youngish woman and I asked her what was her interest or involvement.  She replied that she had lost a son abroad with the Army a few years previously.  I commiserated with her and said that I was sure it was a comfort to her to know that he died trying to bring peace to people.  She cut me dead with her response, saying, &quot;No, I lost my son&quot;.  I relate that story because at the sharp end of what our Defence Forces do is the possibility of losing life in the service of others and it is daughters, sons, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and partners who are affected as well and not only the soldiers.<br/><br/>In summer 1940, our Army stood between two invasion threats, the most sinister of them being the Nazi threat.  However, there was also the threat that the UK would invade us to protect its interests.  Many Irishmen stayed to defend us to the hilt.  Our defensive capacity was exquisitely displayed in Jadotville, the Congo, in the early 1960s.  Men remained in their posts against excessive odds but because of their training, <i>esprits de corps</i>and morale and luck, nobody was killed.  They demonstrated what our troops can do.  They routinely support us during adverse weather events and other emergencies in conjunction with the civilian authorities.  Our armed forces continue to excel and are ambassadors on our behalf.  Our navy in the Mediterranean Sea deploys military and technical skills and displays sheer humanity to support families in difficult circumstances.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, &quot;You'll never miss your mother until she's gone&quot;.  That is the issue with investment.  The Minister of State has to invest now.  When I was trying to cram for an exam the night before instead of months before, my Dad used to say, &quot;Jack, it is too late to sharpen your sword when the drum beats for battle&quot;.  The Government cannot only invest in the Defence Forces when an emergency happens; it should invest in them now.  They are a critical backstop and, therefore, the Government needs to get on with that.<br/><br/>Is the Minister of State happy and content with the rate of staff turnover?  He stated:</p><blockquote>The success of Government policies is clearly evident in the economy which is continuing to grow strongly.  This is providing far more job opportunities than we have seen in recent years.</blockquote><p>It could be viewed as an excuse that the reason the Defence Fores cannot retain people is we have near full employment.  We want full employment but it should be our normal ambition to retain fully deployed Defence Forces in such circumstances.</p></speech>

I will go through them as succinctly as I can because most of them have been raised by colleagues.  Since 2009, the salaries and allowances of Defence Forces personnel have been cut significantly.  Many rely on family income supplement as the pay is so low.</p> <p>There is a serious problem with recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, particularly at officer level, to which the Minister of State alluded in his contribution.  Many are taking up better paid jobs in the private sector and, therefore, we have a brain drain.  Senator Dolan asked a fair question about what is being done not only to react to the brain drain but to invest to ensure there is not a repetition of this in the future among those who are recruited.  The fact that the Public Service Pay Commission has prioritised the examination of recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces demonstrates the seriousness of the problem.  The Minister of State needs to outline when the Department&rsquo;s submission to the commission will be completed.  He also needs to outline if he has engaged with PDFORRA, the representative of the ordinary rank and file members, in preparing this submission in order that the views of ordinary members of the Defence Forces are represented in this regard.</p> <p>The European committee of social rights recently recommended that members of the Defence Forces should have the right to collective bargaining.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this right and has introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il to give effect to it.  We are calling on the Minister of State to immediately introduce an effective mechanism to give effect to the decision of the European committee.  We also commend PDFORRA for taking this action.  It is a disgrace that members of the Defence Forces were forced to go to Europe to have this basic right vindicated.</p> <p>On the issue of European militarisation and neutrality, I would appreciate if the Minister of State could clarify if he supports the position adopted by the four Fine Gael MEPs in respect of our neutrality and if this is now considered Government policy.  Fine Gael MEPs recently voted in the European Parliament in favour of a report calling for each member state to spend 2% of their current GOP on defence.  Currently, Ireland spends 0.3% of its GDP on defence.  The Minister of State needs to clarify if he supports this position and if he intends to increase defence spending in line with other member states.  While Sinn F&eacute;in supports increased investment in our Defence Forces, in particular to address issues such as pay, we have huge concerns at proposed increases to align us with the European militarisation agenda, particularly given the demands in terms of housing and health within society.</p> <p>I raised with the Minister of State's predecessor the issue of planning and administering recruitment drives throughout the State.  We are approaching a time, for example, where universities will be holding freshers' fairs and there will be any number of events throughout the summer.  What obstacles does the Minister of State face in instructing the Defence Forces to recruit nationally and to attend universities in the Six Counties and other such events where appropriate?  This would give young people from the North who may wish to avail of a career in the Defence Forces the easiest and most comfortable avenue to do that.  Perhaps it is an unfair question to throw at him now but could he reflect on that and revert with a response?</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister of State would agree that is a low number and is 443 below the agreed recommended strength.  Despite the fact that in 2016 and 2017 we had recruitment campaigns, the problem still exists.  That tells us that we have a real problem in attracting new people to the Defence Forces and a serious problem in retaining the numbers we have.  That in turn raises another question, namely, what is the problem?  Clearly the terms and conditions which those members of the Defence Forces enjoy, if that is the right word to use, need to be looked at.  Clearly people are speaking with their feet because they are not joining and large numbers of those who are here are leaving, which is disconcerting.  As a result, this issue remains to be solved to a level that is satisfactory to all concerned, despite the Minister of State's best efforts.  A report in todays edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>newspaper claims that last year alone, the taxpayer spent &euro;15 million to replace Defence Forces personnel who left because of pay issues.<br/><br/>That is a very concerning fact and a lot of Defence Forces personnel depend on social welfare payments to put bread and milk on their table.  A recent survey of Defence Forces personnel who are in receipt of family income support tells its own story.  A total of 792 privates, 519 corporals and 58 captains are getting family income support.  It goes to show that this problem stretches right across all ranks.  If we are serious about it, the elephant in the room is pay and conditions.  Other Members have alluded to it.  To be fair, it is not a problem the Minister of State faces in his area alone but is a problem faced across many sectors including the nursing and teaching professions.  It is an issue that needs to be tackled if we are going to retain people and attract new people to join the Defence Forces.  It is right and proper to acknowledge the reasonable work done by PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, on behalf of their members.  Their approach and contribution on these issues has been very measured, as I am sure the Minister of State, with whom they have a good relationship, will agree.  I hope that with their best efforts, we can see some progress in this light.  It has to be said that this Fine Gael-led Government's decision to not have a full Ministry at the Cabinet table for defence is a backward step and it is one I would like to see reversed.  I am sure the Minister of State himself would like to see his feet under the Cabinet table and I am sure he is well capable of doing that.  It does not make his job any easier when he goes to his colleagues and he tries to make a case for the hard-working men and women of the Defence Forces but if we are serious about doing that, this is something we need to look at.<br/><br/>To conclude, I thank the Minister of State for his continuing efforts to address this important issue.  The security of our State is what we are talking about.  It is about basic respect for the men and women who stick on a uniform to defend that State and all they are looking for are reasonable terms and conditions in order for them to stay within that job.</p></speech>

I call the Minister of State to respond and conclude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-05-01a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018050100002#UU00300"><p>As many Members raised the issue of pay, that will be the first issue I will address.  Thereafter, I will try to go through as many of the issues people have raised with me as possible.  There have been significant improvements in pay for members of the Defence Forces under the Lansdowne Road agreement, particularly for lower-paid members.  The pay scales will increase further in all ranks over the lifetime of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The Permanent Defence Force representative associations participated in the negotiations on the agreement and their members subsequently voted to accept the terms of the agreement.  I acknowledge both PDFORRA and RACO for their participation in this regard, as well as for the excellent working relationship I have with them.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised people's eligibility for working family payment.  This is determined having regard to criteria such as family income and the number of dependants.  Circumstances surrounding an application for working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement, is a private matter between the applicant and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Family income and the number of dependants are key variables in determining eligibility.  Public service pay is determined having regard to the specific public service position, skill levels etc. and not family circumstances.  The Senator mentioned 300 privates - I am not sure but by the time he had finished totting up, he reached a figure of more than 750 members of the Irish Defence Forces who were in receipt of this payment.  I encourage the Senator to go back to where he got those figures because he is making a huge mistake.  There are fewer than 100, or just a touch over 100, members of the Irish Defence Forces in receipt of this family payment.  Like all this stuff that is out there in the ether, it is absolutely false.  In a similar manner to the texts and tweets that go out, a huge amount of it is totally false.  Everyone came in here and they are so proud of the Irish Defence Forces, as I absolutely am.  I have to compliment Senator Leyden, who did not criticise the Defence Forces organisation.  I compliment him on that, as well as my party colleague, Senator Colm Burke.  They did not go out and start throwing out figures that there are gaps here and there and everything like that because some of the information that has been put out this evening is totally untrue.  Senator Gallagher's comments on the family income supplement are totally untrue.  I hope that on some occasion, the Senator will come back into the House and withdraw that figure because that is damaging.  In one sentence he stated he was very proud of the Defence Forces and I do not fault that.  I believe him 100%, as does every Member, but I ask him to please not put out misinformation.  Alternatively, if he has information and wants to get it checked by me I will do my best to do that.  However, that observation is totally untrue.</p> <p>In some quarters, the example that a commandant with four children could qualify for working family payment is being used as an example of low pay.  The annual salary for a commandant paying class A PRSI ranges between &euro;63,644 and &euro;77,129, including the military service allowance and depending on points on the pay scale.  Moreover, there are higher rates of pay for specialists serving in the engineering corps, the legal services office etc., as well as in other areas.  While individuals in receipt of annual salaries of amounts in excess of &euro;60,000 may have their own financial difficulties arising from personal circumstances, a basic salary amount of this nature cannot be considered as low pay.</p> <p>Senator Leyden spoke about the military personnel, particularly those who have a skill set which is directly transferable to non-military work and is very attractive for prospective employers.  He is dead right.  We have a challenge.  I highlighted it.  I am not hiding in saying that we have a challenge in that regard, be it in respect of pilots, air traffic controllers or engineers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept that they are going out into the private sector.  I am happy to say that was highlighted in the report by the Public Service Pay Commission which was published in May 2017.  Subsequently, on 17 October, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, prioritised two specific areas to be addressed under specialist pay, namely, the health sector and the Defence Forces.  When we submit information to the Public Service Pay Commission we must submit real data.  We are currently working with the military management on the issue.  A pilot submission has already been made to the Public Service Pay Commission but it is based on data and evidence.  That is what we have been asked to do by the officials and I have ensured that is the approach that has been taken.</p><p>Retention of certain specialist personnel within the Defence Forces was specifically referenced in the first report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission has commenced the process and is examining in more detail the recruitment and retention challenges within the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence has been requested to provide hard data and detailed evidence for the commission.  Military management has provided some material for consideration.  The type and extent of the material requested by the Department in connection with specialist personnel within the specific corps and services is proving more difficult to obtain.  I am not going to put in a half-hearted effort, nor are my officials going to do it.  They will put in the full facts and the data that are needed and required.</p><p>I will respond to the points raised by Senator Craughwell.  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Personnel deployed by units or engaged in development training should not be confused with vacancies.  Units are maintained in order that personnel can deploy, not for units to remain fully manned in barracks.  I recently spoke to a senior military officer about gap analysis.  I thought what he said was a genuine example of the gaps we have.  I accept there are challenges in that regard.  When a fire engine is deployed to the scene of a fire or accident one does not bring in additional fire engines to the base while others are in use.  If we send people overseas, of course there will be gaps.  If personnel are taken from Cork, Galway or Kilkenny then I accept there will be gaps but we must manage with the resources that are left behind.  I have been assured by military management that the Defence Forces are capable of carrying out all of the duties required of them within the White Paper and all that is expected by the Government.</p><p>The Defence Forces have always drawn personnel from units for overseas service and other employments and personnel also engage in training on an ongoing basis.  It is important that military personnel have experience of a full range of duties so that they can be part of a military force in a situation where they may be called upon to reinforce operations in various parts of the country.  We have seen that specifically during the recent bad weather and snow in March.  Military personnel can be deployed to locations where the relevant experience can be gained.  That is to be welcomed.  Any decisions regarding scaling back on overseas deployments, deployment at home or for training will be informed by the advice of the Chief of Staff.  I can confirm that I have not received such advice to date.</p><p>Currently, 640 members of the Defence Forces personnel are serving on overseas duties.  That is a significant contribution in the context of the resources available for defence.  The majority are serving in the Middle East, including Ireland's current contribution of 375 personnel participating in UNIFIL.  This year not only marks the 60th anniversary of Ireland's first participation in UN peacekeeping but also marks the 40th anniversary of Ireland's first deployment to Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.  In recognition of that we are planning a programme of events to commemorate the anniversaries during the summer.</p><p>From speaking to my ministerial colleagues across the EU I know that the retention challenges we face in this country are also an issue for many other military forces, in particular in the filling of specialist posts.  Work is under way to address the challenges.  That will remain a priority for me personally as Minister of State.</p><p>The Department has forwarded an initial tranche of information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform relating to Air Corps pilots.  Further material on the challenges in the defence sector will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks when the collation of data and information is completed.  The submission will be finalised shortly and will be sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is co-ordinating the responses on behalf of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p><p>Senator Leyden raised an issue.  I agree with what he said about PDFORRA and RACO.  I work very closely with them.  It is my duty as Minister to work closely with them.  I meet them annually and discuss with them any issues that arise.</p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the White Paper on Defence 2015.  The review is expected towards the end of 2018.  Society has changed since 2015 but we must be able to face the challenges.  We will address them.  I have every confidence in all of the security services, be it An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces assisting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an aid to the civil power when required.  I do not believe there is a crisis but I accept there are challenges.  I did not want to come in here this evening and say that everything is rosy in the garden, let us move on, there is nothing to see here.  I want to be truthful and upfront and tell Members exactly what is happening.  We have challenges but we are working to address them.</p><p>Senator Leyden referred to the contracts.  I am reviewing the 1994 and the 2006 contracts at the moment.  In terms of people exiting the organisation, he referred to more than 30 cadets exiting in 2017.  That is totally untrue.  A total of 12 cadets exited in 2017 for various reasons.  It would be like someone going into politics and not liking it in the first term and leaving.  If a person loves politics he or she will stay.  If a person goes into teaching, nursing or the Army, if he or she does not like it he or she will get out.  The reasons for the 12 cadets leaving vary and they include medical reasons.  A total of 209 personnel in training left.</p></speech>

In 2001, during the so-called boom, 302 personnel left.  In 2007, which was the height of the boom, 188 left.  The numbers leaving fell in each of the years from 2011 to 2014 because there was a recession and people wanted to stay.  A total of 169 left in 2016 and 209 left for various reasons in 2017.  Some might not have been up to it and they left and others left of their own accord.</p> <p>I am not aware of the heavy machine gun incident, which was nearly an accident.  I do not micromanage and I take action when I am told about issues.  I read in the public fora about a ship going out and having to come back because of insufficient crew.  I am not aware of the case.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about our neutrality.  No matter what decision we make in Europe I will make sure that Ireland's position is reflected in that.  When we signed up to PESCO, I brought it to the Government and to the D&aacute;il for approval.  I also brought the issue to the Seanad for discussion even though there was not a vote on it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paul Kehoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I came in here and explained exactly the reasons we were joining PESCO.  Our joining is a good thing.  One of the reasons is, as Senator Craughwell said, that we face different challenges.  We cannot be left behind.  If we are to have a Defence Force that has capabilities and experience, we must be able to be as good as the rest.  However, our neutral stance is very much reflected in all the decisions we make as a Government.  Senator Gallagher stated that we have contributed hugely to overseas duties.  I agree absolutely, and being able to work with like-minded countries and states within PESCO is very important.</p><p>Recruitment to the Defence Forces has been ongoing and has never stopped.  From 2011 to 2016, when members of the Opposition were saying we should stop recruitment into the Defence Forces and recruit elsewhere, we did not do so because it was so important to have continuous recruitment into the Defence Forces.  I received, through negotiations with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, a &euro;98 million package in the last budget.  We have &euro;541 million for the period 2018-22 to spend on all types of infrastructure, whether equipment, barracks or whatever else.  I outlined some of the equipment platforms we are renewing and upgrading in my opening speech.</p><p>Reference was made to family members being lost overseas.  As I have stated previously, we are celebrating our 60th year of participation in UN duties and 40 years in UNIFIL.  It is important we celebrate - I would call it a celebration - our anniversaries and our participation in UN peacekeeping.  As part of these celebrations, I will include each and every one of the families who lost either a son or a daughter - it has been all males who have lost their lives overseas, to my recollection - in some sort of service or event over that weekend.  It will be a very solemn ceremony specifically for the family members.  I am determined to do this because I believe it is important and because the people who lost their lives overseas sacrificed not just their lives, but also the lives of their parents, wives, partners and children.  I was delighted that in March of this year, over St. Patrick's Day, to bring back one of the surviving members of a serious incident involving UNIFIL in Lebanon.  It was the first time he had been back to visit the scene of the accident in which two of his colleagues were shot.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised a number of issues about neutrality, which I have addressed.  Recruitment closed on Sunday night.  Last year, I introduced a proposal that we should have two tranches of recruitment, one in the first part of the year and the second in the second half of the year, because I felt that people were applying for the Defence Forces and were left for almost 12 months on a rolling application.  I thought that was wrong.  No young person should have to wait for seven, eight or 12 months to be called.  He or she should know within four or five months exactly where he or she stands.  That is only right and proper, and I am very happy with the number of applications.  Furthermore, the apprenticeship for the Air Corps is still open.</p><p>I think it was Senator Robbie Gallagher who said it is a pity that I am not at the Cabinet table.  I inform Senator Gallagher that I have my feet firmly under the Cabinet table and am proud to fight at the Cabinet table on behalf of the Defence Forces.  I have been given full responsibility as Minister of State with responsibility for defence and I will represent all members of the Defence Forces, from the newly recruited to the most senior, as long as I am in this position, and I am proud to do so.</p></speech>
