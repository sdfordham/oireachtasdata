    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1382" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#B00400"><p>I raise the issue of third level funding in general, with particular reference to the Castlebar campus of GMIT which, like many institutes of technology, faces significant financial challenges, notwithstanding the fact that student numbers are growing at third and fourth level across the State.  However, most of the buoyancy is within the universities sector and, unfortunately, the institutes of technology are struggling.  A financial review carried out last year for the Department of Education and Skills identified this issue which I raise wondering what steps are being taken.</p> <p>In the case of the Castlebar campus of GMIT, there is a debt shortfall of &euro;2 million.  I understand there is also a deficit in Letterfrack.  The Castlebar campus matter was highlighted at the monthly meeting of Mayo County Council where concerns were raised by my colleague, Councillor Michael Smyth, and Councillor Michael Kilcoyne.  A meeting has taken place with the president of GMIT, but I understand it may not have resulted in much.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Department to give a commitment to provide additional funding in order that the current suite of courses will not be reduced in any way.  There is a precedent within the Department in the provision of an additional &euro;3 million which was made available to a second campus of Letterkenny Institute of Technology in Killybegs for the ongoing suite of courses offered there.  </p> <p>I am not sure if a request has been made, but certainly one is to be made for a meeting between the Minister and a delegation from Mayo County Council to discuss this issue.  I understand a motion was passed at the most recent monthly meeting of the council seeking a meeting.  I encourage the Minister to meet councillors as they are the persons best equipped to raise local concerns about the campus.  I hope he has some news or an update for us and can share the outlook of the Department.  I note that he provided additional funding in the recent budget, which I welcome.  Ultimately, however, there are increasing education demands and the IT sector must be funded to play a key role.  It cannot leverage funding from the private sector in the same way as universities for research and development and in other avenues.  The IT sector must be encouraged, supported and facilitated across the board to meet the capacity demands on the third and fourth level education sector in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#B00500"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The higher education sector is vital in achieving our long-term ambitions as a nation.  After nine years of continuous cuts to the budget for these institutions, I have been pleased to provide for the first increase in investment this year.  Beyond that, we have committed to a demographic dividend in the coming three years.  On top of this, we have decided to develop, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, an Exchequer-employer mechanism.  We have published a paper for public consultation and would welcome submissions.</p> <p>Direct funding for individual colleges is not provided through the Department but through the HEA which we assign to deal directly with institutes of technology and the universities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not come through the Department.  We assign the HEA to deal directly with these institutes of technology and with the universities.  They are independent bodies and have their own governing authorities.  The HEA is reviewing its funding mechanism.</p><p>The Senator is right that there was a recent review of the entire institute of technology sector during which issues such as the difficulties they have in funding were raised.  Very specifically the difficulties of IOTs with multiple campuses were highlighted as an issue that the HEA wants to support as part of its ongoing development of funding in the sector.  That is a positive backdrop to the discussion we are having.</p><p>My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the IOTs, including Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IOTs and in particular is working closely with those institutes operating in deficit to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible.  In line with the HEA&rsquo;s policy for dealing with financially vulnerable institutes, GMIT has agreed a three-year financial plan with the HEA to reach a balanced budget by 2017-18 and an external financial expert has been appointed to review the plan.</p><p>GMIT has also identified a number of areas to address its financial position including implementation of a retention strategy; review of the offering versus other higher institutes of education to try to increase demand; and a new programme development to bring increased student numbers.  The HEA has also stated that plans for the future of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology must support the sustainable development of provision on all campuses.  That is a very important principle.</p><p>The HEA and the GMIT governing body have reconfirmed to my Department their commitment to implementing a viable development plan for the Castlebar campus as part of this process.  GMIT has appointed an interim head of the campus in Castlebar to lead this process.  The GMIT board has also established a sub-committee look at the overall strategy and future plans for the institute.</p><p>The Department and the HEA recognise the particular challenges attached to multi-campus provision in GMIT and other institutes of technology.  A major review of the funding allocation model of higher education has commenced and the review will look at how the future model can take account of the additional costs associated with these arrangements.  My Department and the HEA are committed to such multi-campus provision, including that at Castlebar.</p><p>The rest of the response deals with the wider issues of funding this sector.  I believe, as the Senator does, that one of the keys to building a strong sustainable competitive advantage in our regions is building around the skill base.  I regard the presence of campuses and the development of those campuses as vital to securing that long-term regional capability.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise that rationalisation of services into the central pillar of GMIT would be at the expense of the Castlebar campus.  I appreciate that the HEA has responsibility, but overall responsibility rests with the Minister.  Would he be willing to meet the delegation from Mayo County Council to discuss not just that issue, but other issues relating to third level education in the Mayo area?</p></speech>

It is important that we develop this plan, particularly for Castlebar and that we carve out a strong and resilient future for it.  I will be meeting representatives of the college to get an understanding of the challenges and how it will meet them.  I regularly go to different parts of the education sector to have consultation sessions where we hear local ideas.</p> <p>As local authorities are not specifically an education body, I am not committing to meet local authorities.  Unfortunately, I get such requests on a very frequent basis.  I assure the Senator that I am very conscious of the needs of Castlebar.  I will ensure I get first-hand experience from those who are extremely committed to its development.  I believe that together with the HEA and the new funding models we can carve out a strong future for Castlebar.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1411" speakername="Aidan Davitt" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#D00200"><p>My query is a simple one that relates to Edmonton school outside Killucan.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the situation regarding it.  The school sought upgrading works for toilet facilities last year under the summer works scheme but was unsuccessful.  The school has again sought a grant for this year.  I have been in the school with the local Deputy Robert Troy and, to say the least, the facilities are exceptionally poor.  I would be surprised if the school would pass a health and safety review.  The facilities at the school must be upgraded with the utmost urgency.  I implore the Minister to look at them himself.</p> <p>The upgrade works that are required have been costed at &euro;40,000, which is not a large amount.  I am sure the Minister will fund a summer works scheme this summer.  I am pleased he is in the House and that I can make him aware of the conditions in the school.  It is not an exaggeration to say the amenities are exceptionally poor.  In addition to the substandard conditions for the pupils the teachers must also endure the existing facilities, which are just not good enough.  I would very much appreciate if the Minister could give a firm commitment on Edmonton school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#D00300"><p>I thank Senator Davitt for raising this issue.  The summer works scheme is one that was completely suspended at the height of the downturn following the crash.  It was reintroduced in 2014 to 2015 and it is to be provided in the 2016 to 2017 school year.  It generally runs in two-year cycles.  The scheme for 2016 to 2017 is again in a two-year cycle.  The first phase of it for 2016 dealt with the first two categories, namely, gasworks and electrical works, and the next phase will go down through the remaining categories.</p> <p>The position in regard to St. Patrick's national school, Edmonton, is that it has applied for summer works.  As Senator Davitt outlined, it is a co-ed school with 77 pupils.  The school applied for the scheme to upgrade toilet facilities.  Under the classification for the summer works scheme, toilets come under category 5.  The assessment of applications for the summer works categories is now being undertaken by the Department.  I expect to be in a position to announce a further round of successful applications in the near future.  I should point out that nearly half of all schools in the country have applied for the scheme and as Senator Davitt can imagine, given the interruption of the scheme for a couple of years, there is a backlog of demand.  The Department must apply prioritisation criteria to ensure the most urgent cases are addressed.  The 2017 scheme is a continuation of last year's scheme and if we are in a position I hope we will announce a further scheme for 2018 and 2019.  That is the current status of the scheme.  The work is ongoing and decisions will be made shortly.</p></speech>

We have made him aware of the position.  I do not say it for the sake of saying it but because I have been in the school with the local Deputies and if the Minister were there on the ground himself he would consider making this an urgent case.  I thank him for coming here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#D00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  I will alert officials to the case Senator Davitt has made but I think the school itself has made a very strong case in its submission.  Unfortunately, given the nearly 1,700 applications from schools around the country it is a challenge to allocate the resources in a fair way that meets as many of the needs as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-28a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032800002#F00100"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being with us.  The Mahon tribunal investigated planning corruption in Dublin between 1997 and 2012.  The tribunal cost more than &euro;160 million, consisted of 589 days of public hearings and taking evidence and had 427 witnesses.  One might ask what the taxpayer has to show for all of this work and all this money and these hours of investigation?  We know that court decisions relating to 12 named persons, including a former Minister, developers and a Dublin City assistant manager were subsequently quashed.  Hard-hitting and clear recommendations have been made in the report by the tribunal.  We need to hear how they are progressing.  Can the Minister of State explain why some of the key recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report have not been implemented?  For example, it recommended the disclosure of the identities of all those making political donations in excess of &euro;55.  That is not my choice nor my recommendation, but it is what Mr. Justice Mahon said to a Deputy.  The report also refers to various thresholds concerning donations.  That is an area on which the tribunal has made strong recommendations.  I want to hear what the Government is going to do about it.</p> <p>I am aware of the Corruption Bill, and no doubt the Minister of State is also.  I recognise that it is not the Minister of State's responsibility nor the responsibility of his Department.  There was a direct effect following Ireland's failure to implement recommendations in terms of corruption.  We know that Ireland was recently placed 19th in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2016.  It was expressly stated in its findings that, "The failure of the Government to implement the Mahon tribunal and the Moriarty tribunal recommendations was at the very heart of this change".  That is profound, and it is something that we need to address.  </p> <p>The Mahon tribunal uncovered extraordinary information about widespread corruption in the planning process, and that infected the planning process for decades.  That was a legacy we had in the past.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, brought in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016, which has been passed by both Houses.  How is the Minister of State going to implement the recommendations that have come from the Mahon tribunal?  Can he advise the House of his plans to establish an independent planning regulators office?  This was part of the programme for Government.  The Minister of State has a lot of work on his plate.  The key issues I want to identify today are the implementation of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal - I would like a timeframe for that - and how it is intended to proceed with the independent planning regulator.</p></speech>

The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, otherwise known as the Mahon tribunal, was established by order of the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government back in 1997 to inquire into and report on various planning matters as set out in resolutions passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad concerning the establishment of the tribunal.  As Senator Boyhan will be aware, the tribunal made in total 64 recommendations, of which ten are planning related and fall to my Department to implement.  Some of the planning-related recommendations have already been implemented, such as the development of regional, spatial and economic strategies by the regional assemblies, and prohibiting the use of powers available to elected members under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 concerning planning matters.</p> <p>The majority of the remaining Mahon tribunal planning-related recommendations are provided for in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 which is presently being progressed through the Oireachtas, with D&aacute;il Committee Stage scheduled for 12th of April next.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand the Senator raised this issue with me during a debate last week.  All Stages of the Bill are progressing.  </p><p>The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 proposes to provide legislative underpinning in respect of the following tribunal recommendations.  It proposes to place on a statutory footing the proposed new national planning framework, to be titled Ireland 2040 - Our Plan, as a successor to the 2002 national spatial strategy.  It also proposes the establishment of a new independent office of the planning regulator to take over the functions of evaluating and assessing local development plans and regional strategies, to generally oversee the operation of the planning system and to conduct necessary reviews of the operation of the planning system.  This proposal is particularly important and will introduce a further institutional layer of sophistication and oversight to the planning system.</p><p>The Bill also proposes enhanced transparency in the planning process, requiring the publication of submissions, local area plans and development plans, as well as the chief executive's report on such submissions on the website of the planning authority.  It also proposes the forwarding of any proposed grant of planning commission which will materially contravene a development or a local area plan to the relevant regional assembly for observations.  The payment of reduced or no fees by elected members when making submissions and planning applications as well as the noting of such representations on a development planning file is also proposed.</p><p>There are two planning related recommendations in the final report of the Mahon tribunal which have not yet been progressed, one of which the Senator mentioned.  The first recommendation relates to the proposal that members of regional assemblies shall be directly elected.  In this regard, the new regional assembly structures were only established in 2014, further to the Local Government Reform Act of that year.  Accordingly, it is considered premature to progress this recommendation at the early stage of the operation of the new regional assembly structures.  However, it is intended that implementation of this recommendation will be reviewed after the new structures have run a full five-year term in 2019.</p><p>The other outstanding tribunal recommendation which remains to be progressed, and to which the Senator referred, relates to the introduction of a requirement that applicants for planning permission be required to disclose if they have made a political donation to a member of a local authority or elected representative when submitting a planning application and also to indicate the identity of the recipient of any such political donation.</p><p>On this matter, it is considered that issues relating to political donations generally are probably most appropriately addressed in the standards in public office legislation, which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the Minister will reflect further on whether it might be possible to address the issue of planning related political donations in the specific context of planning legislation.  Committee Stage of the relevant Bill will be debated in April.  I hope I have clarified the position for the Senator.</p></speech>

It will feed into a proposal on a draft Bill on which we are working and which will come before the House at some point.</p> <p>I want to raise two issues.  The Minister of State has not identified the new independent office of planning regulation.  He acknowledged it, but gave no commitment on its implementation, including the date of its establishment.  I ask him to come back to the House on that.</p> <p>On the payment of reduced or no fees for county councillors and elected members of the 31 local authorities, we are none the wiser.  I ask the Minister of State to share some of his thoughts on that.</p></speech>

As he knows, at the start of last year his predecessor, Kathleen Lynch, announced one of the most comprehensive investment programmes in public nursing home facilities in the history of the State.  As part of this &euro;400 million investment programme by the Government, 33 existing home facilities throughout the country will be replaced and 57 others will be refurbished or extended.  Before this breakthrough announcement, many communities feared that some nursing homes would be closed because of a failure to meet the required HIQA standards.  With this significant funding programme, that will now not be the case.</p> <p>In County Roscommon, the Plunkett home in my town of Boyle and &Aacute;ras Mh&aacute;thair Ph&oacute;il in Castlerea benefit from &euro;1.14 million and &euro;850,000, respectively.  The single biggest beneficiary in County Roscommon was the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town.  After a long and hard fought campaign by many stakeholders, including myself, &euro;9 million in funding was finally secured to upgrade its facilities.  The funding allocation of &euro;9 million will ensure that the facility will become compliant with the environmental aspects of HIQA standards by 2021.  It is important to state that HIQA inspections of the Sacred Heart Hospital have confirmed the excellence of care that residents receive, which is reassuring for residents and their families.  If I may be a little parochial, my mother, who is 89 years of age, has been in the Sacred Heart Hospital for the past two months.  My family and I are absolutely delighted with the care she receives and I thank the doctors, nurses and staff there.</p> <p>Many people like my mother are availing of rehabilitative care but the health care ranges from continual care to rehabilitative, palliative and respite care for up to 95 residents.  However, as is the case with many long-established public nursing homes, the physical environment needs improvement.  Part of the Sacred Heart building dates from 1842 and has undergone modifications over the years to improve facilities but HIQA inspections have found that significant structural improvements are required to ensure compliance.  From my regular visits, it is evident that the building is not designed and laid out to meet fully the needs of the residents.  Most of the bedrooms are multi-occupancy and accommodate up to four beds in each room.  No one can argue that this does not impact on the privacy and dignity of residents.</p> <p>Thankfully, a specific plan is now in place to make provision for a new 50-bed unit on the site of the Sacred Heart Hospital.  This will involve an extensive refurbishment of the building to provide residents' accommodation in en-suite, single and two-bed rooms along with a suitable communal space and sanitary facilities.  As I stated at the outset, the funding was announced more than a year ago.  We now need a commencement date for the works on the new Sacred Heart unit.  I hope the Minister of State can give an indication of the timescale today.</p></speech>

I know he is committed to developing services for senior citizens, health services and disability services in the Roscommon area.</p> <p>Although it is Government policy to facilitate older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, there will always be a cohort of people who need long-term care.  Quality residential care must continue to be available to those who need it.  We are strongly in favour of choice with regard to services for senior citizens.  Public residential care units are a significant and crucial part of our framework of services for older people.  They provide more than 5,000 long-stay beds, amounting to approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high but we recognise and accept that many of our public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.</p> <p>The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon.  The hospital was registered with HIQA in 2015 for a period of three years with the maximum occupancy of 95 people.  The beds provided by nursing homes such as Sacred Heart Hospital are an essential part of our health care infrastructure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The beds provided by nursing homes like the Sacred Heart home in Roscommon represent an essential part of our health care infrastructure.  Without them, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  Therefore, it is essential for them to be put on a sustainable footing and for the fabric of the buildings from which they operate to be modernised and improved.</p><p>The capital programme that was announced last year is one of the most comprehensive programmes of investment in public nursing home facilities ever undertaken by the State.  It provides for the replacement and refurbishment of 90 public nursing homes across the country.  Significant work was undertaken by the HSE to determine the most appropriate scheduling of projects over the five-year period from 2016 to 2021, within the phased provision of funding, to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Under this capital programme, it is proposed to deliver a new community nursing unit at the Sacred Heart home by 2021.  This project will replace existing beds where the physical environment requires significant improvement.  Like all health care infrastructure developments, this project requires a lead-in time to complete its various stages, including appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, review of costing estimates and finalisation of financing.  This project is at the appraisal stage.  The HSE expects that construction will begin in 2020 and will be completed and operational by 2021.  The works, when completed, will ensure the hospital&rsquo;s long and proud tradition will continue well into the future.</p></speech>

I am delighted that the Government is fully committed to upgrading the Sacred Heart nursing home.  The Minister of State has said that the "project is at the appraisal stage".  He mentioned that the various stages before the construction stage include "appraisal, project brief, design feasibility [and] review of costing estimates".  I have sat in on the three stages that have happened at the Sacred Heart's sister facility at Roscommon County Hospital.  It has taken almost four years for the endoscopy building at the hospital, which is now providing excellent facilities in Roscommon, to get up and running.  I sat in from the appraisal stage to the design stage.  I thank the management and staff of the hospital.  Along with doing their own significant work, they were able to make an input into the development of the endoscopy unit.  As a result, the hospital now has significant accreditation as a working hospital.  The input of hospital management and staff enabled them to determine the best possible result.  I would like to think the knowledge and endeavours of the staff of the Sacred Heart home will be included in the appraisal stage because it is absolutely vital.  I am delighted that this project is going ahead.  I do not think people fully realise how much work goes on during the appraisal, project brief and design stages.  It is a long and drawn-out process.  It has to include all the stakeholders, including the staff, to ensure we get the best possible result.  I thank the Minister of State again.  I wish him well.</p></speech>

I know how committed he is to the protection of our senior citizens and the elderly, particularly in the Roscommon area.  I take his point that the bureaucracy associated with the different stages can sometimes lead to delays.  I will be responsible after this debate for passing on Senator's Feighan message that we need to ensure progress is made with these projects.  It is important to provide for services to be made available to senior citizens who otherwise do not fit into options like home support and home care packages.  There are other issues with the provision of services for our senior citizens.  As I have said, approximately 5,000 people across the country fall into that category.  It is essential for the senior citizens in the Roscommon area whom we are discussing to get services of the best quality.  The quality services they deserve as a right include proper, modern and state-of-the-art beds, conditions and toilet facilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senior citizens worked for all their lives.  The least we can do for them, towards the end of their years, is our best to support them.  It is very important that we do.  I also take the Senator's point about the staff in the Sacred Heart Home.  I reassure him that every provision will be made and every avenue followed to ensure the staff and patients will receive the support and services they deserve.  I will bring the points raised by him to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.</p></speech>

Most notably, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has failed to appear in the D&aacute;il today and has, for all intents and purposes, gone to ground.  Some 937,000 false breath tests have been registered on the PULSE system and there have been more than 14,000 wrongful convictions.  This is the most recent scandal affecting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, demoralising the force and bringing it to its knees.  There has been an inadequate response from the Government.  Instead of answering questions and uncovering facts, we have been accused of being "Political" with a capital "P".  Responses, or the lack thereof, by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il today and the Commissioner, and the deafening silence from the T&aacute;naiste, have been wholly inadequate.  It is incredible that the T&aacute;naiste has not attended the D&aacute;il.  Both she and the Garda Commissioner must attend the joint justice committee to give a proper and detailed explanation of the wrongdoings.  There must be accountability for one of the largest miscarriages of justice in volume terms in the State.  Albeit relating to minor offences, this constitutes a significant wrongdoing.</p> <p>The presumption relied upon in many District Courts around the country that a fixed penalty notice is deemed to have been served correctly is being challenged by judges, undermining the criminal justice system and putting it on the back foot.  This is only one of the many repercussions that the scandal is having on the criminal justice system.  At a point when we are not too far from the previous scandal and the force is on its knees, we need to know what steps the Commissioner and the T&aacute;naiste are taking to unveil the truth.  The culture and morale of the force are at an all-time low.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il believe that a Northern Ireland Patten-type commission needs to be established to improve the force and boost morale.  We acknowledge the hard work of the majority of garda&iacute;, but this scandal is effectively taking away from them.  We need transparency and accountability.  It is not credible that the Commissioner did not unveil the content of this revelation to the Policing Authority when they reportedly met six times in the past year.  Will the T&aacute;naiste attend the House to make a statement and answer questions on these matters?</p> <p>The second issue relates to the deaths of three cyclists on our roads in the past two weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Yesterday, a lady in her late 30s was killed on Templeville Road, and I extend my thoughts and prayers to her family on my behalf and on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  We need to start taking seriously the deaths of cyclists on our roads.  We need to ensure more protection is given and there is an awareness campaign so motorists take heed of cyclists.  If three murders had taken place in this city over the past two weeks there would be uproar.  Three cyclists have died in the past two weeks and not enough has been done about it.  The Government needs to take action on this.</p></speech>

We have an increasing number of judicial vacancies and it would appear the legislation which was the subject of some pre-publicity has not materialised.  The court system is becoming increasingly overburdened due to the absence of judges and, most importantly, the outlook is very poor.</p> <p>The role of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on legislation on the appointment of judges is causing grave concern, because more and more the line is being taken that somehow our present Judiciary is failing the country, is not of adequate quality, needs to be changed and is the product of cronyism.  The Constitution gives to the Executive of the State the right to nominate people to be appointed as judges in our courts.  This is an important function for the Government.  Nobody in his or her right mind thinks this can be abdicated without a change to the Constitution.  It is a function of the Government and the responsibility of the Government.  The choice of people for appointment to the Judiciary is a governmental decision.</p> <p>It is also sometimes stated appointments should not be political.  If this means party political I agree completely, but if it means political in the other sense I disagree fundamentally.  The persons put on the Supreme Court are chosen for their outlook, their ideology, and by reference to a number of issues which are political in another sense.  It is to the Government of the day the function of making nominations falls.</p> <p>In the United States of America we can see that a highly party-politicised appointments system to the Judiciary exists, but nobody thinks Ruth Ginsburg, for instance, was appointed to the US Supreme Court other than on the basis she was a legal liberal.  It was the entitlement of the US President to make an appointment in this respect.</p></speech>

Efforts to hem it in and prevent it from making appointments are, in my view, very misguided.</p> <p>I notice the general secretary of the Law Society advocates drawing our Judiciary from a broader spectrum of society as an end in itself.  I have a different perspective.  I say what we need to do is have excellence in the Judiciary, but nobody in the current debate, especially the Minister, Deputy Ross, is talking about the need for excellence in our Judiciary.</p></speech>

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anam d&iacute;lis.  I commend the continuing efforts of all those involved in the recovery of R116 to reunite Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith with their families.  I hope that will happen before too long.  I am proud of my local community in Blacksod Bay on the Erris Peninsula for their hard work and solidarity with the families of the crew of R116 in the past 14 days.</p> <p>This week there has been yet another dent in public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People are completely bamboozled by how the figures for breath tests could have been exaggerated by 937,000 and how 14,700 people could have been wrongfully convicted of motoring offences.  If this was a one-off systems failure that could be dealt with in an efficient and transparent manner to reassure the public and restore confidence, we could live with it, but the fact that the Garda Commissioner is already at the centre of the Charleton inquiry and had knowledge of the latest debacle since 2014 is utterly unacceptable.  Sinn F&eacute;in, through Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, has made several attempts to strengthen the powers of the Policing Authority, but it has been blocked by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I am ask the Leader, as a matter of urgency, to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement to the House in order that we can hear first-hand why she is refusing to implement section 11 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and why she thinks it is acceptable that the person in charge is not accountable.  How much more does the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to be eroded before a change in leadership is necessary?  It is absolutely urgent that the Minister come before the House to explain why she is taking a hands-off role in the latest debacle.  We know that there will be many more debacles.</p></speech>

There is a substantial crisis of public confidence.  We have listened to commentators say it was carelessness or a systems failure and give many other excuses.  What we have is a management failure.  I am seeking to amend the Order of Business to have the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality called into the House to make a statement and take questions on the issue.  In my mind are the 14,700 citizens who were not believed when they appeared before the courts.  We have all read in local newspapers about people who said they never received notification and were never written to.  The court system told them that they were telling lies.</p></speech>

Excellence should be the aim at all times.  It is both a populist and dangerous road that we are currently going down when it comes to the Judiciary.</p> <p>It is a sad and costly reality that Ireland is on the road to becoming the fattest country in Europe.  I was encouraged and delighted to hear that many Departments have installed healthier option vending machines in their offices at the request of employees who want to choose such an option.  It is imperative that schools, workplaces and hospitals, in particular, follow.  It makes no sense that hospitals have vending machines laden with sugary drinks and foods.  Obesity has become one of the greatest public health challenges Ireland faces and many patients are in hospital because of obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease.  They and other patients should be encouraged to eat healthily and those who wish to should find it easy to do so.  It is difficult to find healthy options when visiting hospital tuck shops.  Although there have been conscious decisions and plans have been put in place to address the State's obesity issue, we need to keep the ball rolling.  I was encouraged by this move by Departments but we need to actively encourage workplaces, especially within Departments, to enforce these policies.</p></speech>

It is imposing major hardship throughout the country on workers, employers and everybody else who is badly affected.  This strike has the potential to escalate with Dublin Bus and school transport services in danger as well.  The Minister should not be in on the negotiations but he should use his position to request or direct all parties to suspend the strike and to sit down and negotiate.

The danger in this regard is serious.  I was told by people, who are concerned, that Bus &Eacute;ireann will become insolvent and then be privatised, and then there will be no nationwide service.  I appeal to the unions also to wake up and go back to the negotiating table.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey is from my home town and he is one of the greatest industrial relations negotiators the country has ever had.  He has resolved many strikes.  I appeal to the Leader and to the House to suggest to the Minister the nomination of Mr. Mulvey to come back and bring the parties together as a neutral, independent arbitrator in this dispute.  With his knowledge and experience, he could resolve this issue sooner rather than later.  It is extremely grave.</p></speech>

It has gone too far in respect of the Garda Commissioner.  The gap between the number of breath tests the Garda claims to have carried out and the number identified by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety coupled with the extraordinary interview on "Morning Ireland" earlier have to raise widespread concerns about the way the Garda does its work, which certainly does not instill any confidence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not want to pre-empt anything the Commissioner or the Minister for Justice and Equality, for that matter, might say but it warrants the Minister coming in here today to make some sort of a statement and be subject to reasonable questioning and clarification.  There are serious concerns about Garda management and also about Garda supervision.  Let us be clear here.  What it amounts to is approximately 1 million falsified breathalysed tests.  That is an extraordinary thing to happen on anyone's watch.  Who is responsible?  Who will ultimately take the rap?  Who will be sanctioned?  It is important that the Minister comes in here now and shares the facts.  Therefore I will support Senator Humphreys's proposal to amend the Order of Business.</p></speech>

The kernel of the issue put forward by the Minister is somewhat spurious and I do not think it is helpful.</p> <p>I would like to join in the expressions of sympathy to the families of both Captain Mark Duffy and Captain Dara Fitzpatrick who lost their lives.  I hope the two others lost in the same rescue can be found as soon as possible.  I join with the comments commending the people of Erris who have shown their true grit and humanity in responding to and supporting the search and rescue operation that is still under way.  </p> <p>I rise in particular on the matter of the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike.  As a general principle, I agree with the Minister's position.  The State has industrial dispute resolution mechanisms and they are there for a reason, but there are many bigger issues here that warrant the Minister to move on the matter in some fashion.  </p> <p>First, it has to be clear that there is a management issue.  It has been said that Bus &Eacute;ireann has made a 41% increase in the losses on Expressway in the period of one year.  Staff are being asked to take considerable cuts in their wages.  Is management taking any wage cuts?  I understand they are not.  In an environment when this should have been well anticipated, why are we now at crisis and facing insolvency?  If there are issues around management, faced with what we are faced in Bus &Eacute;ireann, some action is required on the part of the Minister.  This is in the context of public transport provision to rural areas and its commercial viability, in particular the people using bus passes on Expressway.  It is suggested that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not being properly compensated for the use of bus passes even though it is being asked to operate as a commercial concern.</p> <p>There are a lot of questions there and the bull needs to be grabbed by the horns.  I ask that the Minister would do that.</p></speech>

Some banks are selling off agricultural debts to multinational property asset companies which subsequently demand immediate payment of moneys owed.  Fears are growing that an entire generation of farmers could be wiped out, stalling hopes of a sustainable rural recovery.  Vast tracts of lands are now in the hands of vulture funds and farmers are under immense pressure.  When farmers lose their land, they not only lose an asset but also their income.</p> <p>The stress and anxiety experienced by these farmers has led to countless suicides.  We need to highlight the number of suicides that are directly linked to financial pressures from banks and financial institutions chasing their own debts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Last weekend the <i>Sunday Independent </i>published the findings of a national survey of the mental turmoil associated with debt, which were just scandalous.  It talked about how 44% of participants felt depressed either all or most of the time.  Over 30% said they had had suicidal thoughts in the previous four weeks, while 22% admitted they had active plans to kill themselves, which is shocking.  A total of 45% indicated they consumed harmful levels of alcohol.  The situation cannot be allowed to continue.  Does the Government have any plan to implement strict legislation to regulate vulture funds, the activities of which will wipe out a generation of farmers?  Young people lose interest in farming when they see the stress and anxiety their parents are suffering.  It will spell the destruction of rural communities and be a further drain on mental health services.  Banks are acting in a manner that is not acceptable in piling stress and misery on embattled farmers.  They are destroying viable farms and undermining recovery in rural areas.<br/><br/>Another serious issue which is emerging is the refusal of banks to release sites to the sons or daughters of farmers who are paying off a loan.  Evictions are not confined to rural areas.  A friend of mine lost a job last October.  She has a five year-old son and with her husband who is working has been served with a notice to vacate their apartment since it is being sold.  They are entitled to receive housing assistance payments, but no landlord is willing to take them.  Their only alternative is to go onto a housing list and be given accommodation in a hotel which is totally unsuitable, as their child will not have play facilities and they will not have cooking facilities.  There is a feeling of devastation in having to move into such places.  Can legislation be introduced to force landlords to accept housing assistance payments</p></speech>

I was talking to Ms Catherine Corless over the weekend.  She is the lady who brought the issues around the Tuam Mother and Baby Home to public attention.  Both she and the representatives of the survivors of many such homes are being frustrated by local authorities who are not allowing them access to very important public records on public funding that should be available to them to continue the research they are conducting.  I know that this issue is being debated in the other House and that there is going to be a vote on it this evening.  However, I am perplexed and dismayed that an amendment is being brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il to amend Sinn F&eacute;in's motion to try to block people from having access to files.  It will not preserve the site which we are trying to have preserved, with all other mother and baby home sites and those at Magdalen laundries and industrial schools.  I am absolutely dumbfounded that Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to block this.  One must ask the question: "Why is there such reticence on the part of some political parties and the State to allow people to see the historical archival files?"  In Galway, for example, we want to see records of the public moneys paid to those homes, including State funding and payments from organs of the State such as Galway County Council for the upkeep of the homes, as well as other documents.  I understand they are available on the websites of other local authorities.  I would like the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to come to the House to see if it is possible to have a certain degree of homogeneity in order that all local authorities would have to make these records publicly available.  People might then find the truth and join the dots of a very complicated jigsaw puzzle that is the history of these institutions.  I call for a debate with the Minister on this issue.</p> <p>I would also be grateful if the Leader updated me on an urgent issue I raised last week related to implementation of the International Protection Act 2015, the questionnaires being circulated and the issues connected with the direct provision system.  The Leader indicated that the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, would come to the House to discuss the issue.  It needs to happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

It is a wonderful facility which was constructed at huge cost, but it is lying idle.  It has been ready to be opened for some time.  It has been designed as a replacement unit for the very old O'Connor Unit, as it is known.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Ned O'Sullivan will know it on the site of the old St. Finan's Mental Hospital which has been disused for a long time.

However, on foot of a problem I do not understand, this unit is not being utilised.  It was built at a cost of I do not know how many millions of euro on the site of the old St. Anne's Isolation Hospital and is ready for use, but it is not being used.  People involved in mental health in Cork and Kerry are very concerned.  We are crying out for better mental health facilities because we need to look after people but this is an instance where a model building in a glorious setting in beautiful Killarney is being allowed to lie idle.

Unless wiser heads prevail, we are looking at a third election in the North in the space of a year or so or, even worse, the reimposition of direct rule from Britain.  This is at a time when the North faces major questions, not least of a budgetary nature and specifically in the context of the overarching worry of Brexit now and into the future.</p> <p>The people of this island endorsed the Good Friday Agreement and in doing so created a number of expectations on an awful lot of people.  In the main, those expectations rest on the shoulders of the political parties in the North.  When we were negotiating peace, in which, thankfully, we succeeded, the politicians in the North received fantastic support and goodwill from various Taoisigh, Prime Ministers and US Presidents.  Is it expecting too much of them now to step into the breach themselves and do what politicians are meant to do, namely, work things out?  I ask the Leader to keep the House briefed on developments in the North and, if he can, have the Taoiseach to attend to brief Members.  We are all politicians and I will not point the finger of blame at any particular party.  When it comes to it, however, the national interest, in this case in the formation of a Government in the North, is far more important than the preoccupations or vanities of any particular party.</p></speech>

Last night, I spoke at a TED Talks event in Trinity College before which there was a sponsored reception in the on-campus premises of the Bank of Ireland.  When a spokesperson for the bank talked about encouraging the exchange of ideas and freedom of speech, I shouted up to ask why, in that case, the bank unilaterally closed down the accounts of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.  While I was then love-bombed by the staff of Bank of Ireland, I subsequently discovered the students were contacted and told their sponsorship might be withdrawn.  It is a most extraordinary thing.  This morning, I contacted the TED Talks people in Trinity to find out the amount of the sponsorship so that I could cover it in the event that the bank withdrew it.  I was told, however, that the matter was covered by confidentiality clauses.  So much for Bank of Ireland, freedom of expression and the exchange of ideas.  This hypocrisy richly deserves to be exposed.</p></speech>

People need to be talking to each other to find a resolution.  I am on record as saying that I feel the business model under which Bus &Eacute;ireann has been operating, particularly with the Expressway routes, is effectively an unfair model.  Up to 60% of its passengers are people who avail of free travel, whereas the private operators are not required to take those who qualify for free travel.  It is almost impossible to compete when it is not a level playing field.  Everyone, including the workers, is aware that change is required.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that many of these workers are people with young families and mortgages.  They are under pressure.  I ask the Leader to convey our hope that talks would get under way as quickly as possible to find a resolution so that we can have a balanced public transport system involving Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>My final point relates to Irish Cement.  Limerick City and County Council has granted permission for a new plant to burn alternative fuels.  Many people in the area have serious concerns over pollution and yet it is still not licensed by the EPA.  We need to look at the law.  Before planning permission is granted for any physical infrastructure, the EPA should first be required to grant a licence.  I think it is the cart before the horse.</p></speech>

I was on the picket line yesterday with workers in Limerick.  I welcome that there has been support from all sides of the House on the issue.  I also welcome Senator Kieran O'Donnell's comments to the degree that he recognises there are issues of Government policy regarding how the company is structured.</p> <p>I will cite two issues.  The PSO was drastically cut back between 2009 and 2015.  It is not sufficient to support the public services that are needed at the moment.  There is a &euro;17 million deficit on the reimbursement for the free-travel scheme.  The last time I raised this in the Chamber, the Leader said the company was losing &euro;50,000 a day.  That is because it is not being funded properly.  The point is that it is not possible to solve an industrial relations issues when key issues of Government policy are underpinning the problem.</p> <p>I say this with respect, Fine Gael has the power to fix this.  It is that party that is in Government and it is being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The workers are out on strike because the Government, for all Fine Gael Members' kind words, is not taking action to deal with it.</p></speech>

I remind Members of this House that we are talking about workers who have to wait 20 years to earn the princely sum of &euro;624 a week, which is less than half of the salary Senators get from the outset.</p> <p>Fine Gael should face up to its responsibility for its failures in Government policy.

Across this House we have been raising this issue and the issue of Dublin Bus for a number of months.  SIPTU has announced that it is balloting its members in Dublin Bus and Irish Rail.  The Minister has known this was coming from the first day of his appointment, it cannot be a surprise to him.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From what was said on the radio this morning I am quite sure the Minister is delighted with the fact that there is widespread support for his interest in changing the judicial appointments process.  That is all very well and good but that is not his job.  His job is to be the Minister for transport.  The Independent Alliance now seems to be running around the place and getting very excited about the latest controversy with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the same time its senior Minister, who presents himself as the leader of the Independent Alliance group is responsible for the transport policy of this country.  On the day of his appointment he knew there was impending industrial unrest in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  As someone with the responsibility for the purse strings of the Department, he has an opportunity to set out a three to five-year strategy for transport policy in this country.  Senator Nash and I made this point as part of a Labour Party motion some months ago.  There is deafening silence from the Minister unless he wants to post a selfie of himself going to work at 10 a.m. on a bus that, according to him, bizarrely seemed to be somewhat lacking in passengers.  Most people who go to work at 10 a.m. on a weekday would probably find the bus slightly less packed than the good Minister, Deputy Ross.<br/><br/>Not to get personal about it - having just got personal about it - but people have to take responsibility for the jobs they hold.  This is the same Minister who has written scurrilous article after scurrilous article in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>when he had the opportunity to write them, saying very personal things about the trade union leadership and now he has the responsibility as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Trade to set out a vision for public transport in this country and he has failed in the most categorical way possible to do so.  I join with others in this House in respectfully asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to possibly stop taking selfies in the bus, worrying about issues in the Department of Justice and Equality, to take responsibility for his own job in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and to come into this august Chamber and discuss with us how he sees the coming weeks and months progressing.  One could ask what will happen in a couple of weeks' time if we have a Dublin Bus strike or a rail strike or the school buses do not run.  Will he come in at that stage and admit that perhaps it is part of his portfolio?  I respectfully support the contentions made by my colleagues across the House on this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister has the power to do this under legislation of 2009 but it would be a drastic move, tantamount to bringing in a broadcasting charge.  Virtually every person in the country has a computer, a laptop or an iPad, either for work purposes or day-to-day communication.  Whether they watch television or not, every person in the country could be obliged to pay the licence fee if the Minister makes such a change to the law.  There has been a lot of confusion in recent years about the possibility of such a charge.  In July 2013, the then Minister, Pat Rabbitte, made a clear commitment to introducing a broadcasting charge by 2015 and by the time that date arrived his successor, Alex White, told this House that he believed a public service broadcasting charge was inevitable, though not during his term.  Last year, our current Minister, Deputy Naughten, told the communications committee that the charge would not be introduced but should not be shelved completely.  At the same meeting, Deputy Timmy Dooley of Fianna F&aacute;il seemed to agree in principle with the idea of a charge.  I do not like the idea of a broadcasting charge being introduced by stealth and I certainly do not like the idea of it coming in by the use of a statutory instrument.</p><p>We heard a bizarre interview on Newstalk with the new director general of RTE, Dee Forbes, who told us the licence fee would be good value even if it was doubled.  She walked back any suggestion that she was seeking a doubling of the fee but it suggests that some people in RTE management are on a different planet.  It is time to discuss the issues around the threatened broadcasting charge and the licence fee and I call on the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to come to the House.  I have been critical of RTE, in particular in relation to the significant ongoing cost to the taxpayer of funding it, and it is now time to decide whether RTE should be scaled back to a public broadcast core or privatised.  RTE confirmed in 2015 that two of its presenters were paid between &euro;400,000 and &euro;500,000 per year, with two more earning between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000 per year and seven contractors earning between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000.  Five staff were earning between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000.  Is there any parallel for a taxpayer-funded organisation paying such massive salaries without any scrutiny or control by representatives of the people?  Some countries have no television licence fee at all and others, such as Portugal and Greece, have very low fees.</p></speech>

That is important and what the people want.  What they want, expressed most clearly in the election, are institutions that will function on the basis of commitments and agreements already reached.  The Government signed up to the institutions and are co-guarantors.  If it cannot stand up for Acht na Gaelige and a Bill of Rights and face down a negative veto on the grounds of national security by the British Government that is prohibiting investigations from taking place into and conclusions being reached on matters such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the case of Pat Finucane and the McGurk's Bar bombing, I am not quite sure what its role as co-guarantor entails.  The British Secretary of State has said in the House of Commons today that he is considering all options in the process in the North.  It is past time that we heard from the Government on the options it is considering.</p></speech>

As the political leaders have still not resolved their differences, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, could call another election or reintroduce direct rule.  I understand all parties are working as closely as possible, but I am disappointed.  I was at the funeral of Martin McGuinness last week when there was a symbolic political moment when the people in the church on the Bogside gave a very warm welcome to and applauded the leader of the DUP.  It showed a huge degree of dignity and grace and I hope that good will and good feeling can be carried into the negotiations.  We still have to work together.  </p><p>Bill Clinton thanked the Taoiseach for what he had said in the United States on St. Patrick's Day on behalf of the undocumented Irish.  It was incredible that we had an ex-President who was very close to the peace process acknowledging the Taoiseach's role.  I repeat that the media in the Republic of Ireland did a great disservice to the words of the Taoiseach in the White House.  The story eventually broke when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and the <i>New York Times</i>reported on how significant it was.  Where were the members of the Irish media?  They had one agenda, which was to say the St. Patrick's Day visit to the United States had been a failure.  It was not; it was one of the great successes.  The Taoiseach spoke on behalf of the undocumented Irish and great progress is being made on their behalf in the United States.  I hope it will continue to be made.</p></speech>

It is a concern I have expressed for years through the local authorities.  Some &euro;63 million in compensation has been paid in the past five years by the four local authorities in Dublin.  This is a massive issue for those of us who have worked in them during the years and have been calling for extra funding for improvements to footpaths, roads and services.  We have been told there is no money available, but we are now at the stage where &euro;63 million has been paid in compensation in five years by just four local authorities and I believe the figure is on the increase.  I am asking for the relevant Minister to come to the House to address us and put funding into the local authorities in order that people will not be left in a position where they will fall and trip because works are not being carried out as a result of the Government not providing enough funds for services that the people need.</p></speech>

The Minister is involved and is the major funder, along with the Government, of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p><p>The point was made during a previous debate with the Minister in the House that this is an area of investment.  We do not ask whether our schools are profitable.  The areas under dispute involve public infrastructure and investment.  The driver behind restructuring and the proposals that are on the table clearly send a message around the erosion of the subsidy and investment provided by the State for an essential public service.  Dividends are not available on its profit sheet but, rather, in the social cohesion and all that it brings to Irish society in terms of making transport available to and engagement by all of our citizens in public life possible.  </p><p>The Minister is involved.  Therefore, it behoves him to be responsible for that involvement and talk to us about how he plans to manifest that involvement and take appropriate action in respect of it.  I support those who spoke on the issue.</p><p>I want to highlight another issue.  I am concerned about the comments of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, over the weekend.  He is responsible for an important Department, namely, the Department of Social Protection, and has sent out messages regarding taxation.  As somebody who has seen the importance of investment in our citizens through the social protection system, I am concerned that he seems to be prioritising a message in respect of the cutting of taxation which may make crucial investment more difficult. </p><p>I want to draw attention to one line of his comments because it is relevant today.  He said, "We have allowed society to be divided into one group of people who pay for everything but get little in return due to means-tests, and another who believe they should be entitled to everything for free and that someone else should pay for it."  That is inaccurate because we know those in receipt of the lowest incomes pay a large amount through indirect taxation and VAT &ndash; in many cases, it is a larger proportion of their income than others pay.  Others contribute through care.</p><p>An Oxfam report which was launched today entitled Opening the Vault, showed an extraordinary degree of tax manipulation and evasion.  Some 76%-----</p></speech>

It was very enlightening.  I welcome the &euro;850,000 that will be invested in the surgical day care unit in Limerick.  People will now be able to come to the hospital on the morning of an operation or be assessed outside of the unit and will not take up unnecessary hospital beds overnight.  Operations can be carried out on the same day.</p> <p>I also welcome that the new accident and emergency department, which will be three times the size of the current one, is due to open at the end of May.  It will have state-of-the-art equipment.  Some of the equipment that is due to be supplied will be the among the best available in hospitals in Ireland.

All payments such as the payment of fines and motor tax should be done through the post office.  I cannot understand why that is not the case and I would like the Minister to come in here at some stage and explain it.  I would go a step further and suggest that there should be a new public service obligation for post offices in areas where a post office will not make money because it is not possible for it to make money.  Similar to the transport system, there should be a public service obligation contract for post offices in areas where they are needed.</p> <p>I agree with my good friend, Senator Mullen.  A debate on the future of public service broadcasting in this country in essential.  It is true that people are watching television on their mobile phones, laptops and so forth, but I believe that RTE has done a phenomenal job in public service broadcasting as a whole, if not all the time.  However, we need a re-evaluation and definition of what is public service broadcasting and what is balanced broadcasting.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</p></speech>

A total of 298 transplants were performed, which is a 12% increase from 2015.  A total of 600 people are awaiting these life saving transplants, whether it be of the heart, liver, kidney or pancreas.  Organ donor awareness week commences Saturday and the Irish Kidney Association is calling for a donor organ registry, which we have previously discussed in the Chamber, to be set up in line with the HSE consent policy to help increase donations from deceased persons.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is to prioritise this and I call on him to fast track it and to develop legislation to provide for an opt-out system where people would be regarded as having consented to organ donation unless they have specified otherwise.  I encourage people to become aware of and use the organ donation card until the legislation is enacted.  Apps and other systems are available for people to opt in but it is hoped that we will get the opt-out system soon enough.</p></speech>

All of us are united in considering the issues to be most disturbing and corrosive to the morale of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the way in which it is perceived by the public.  This needs to be arrested and reversed.  Government has committed to an external and thorough review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be waning because every day many fine men and women do a huge job in difficult and dangerous situations.  There is a culture within the Garda that needs to be changed.  The revelations last week are disturbing.  No one can stand over a misrepresentation of data or misuse or manipulation of statistics.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner are committed to rectifying matters.  The T&aacute;naiste has met the Garda Commissioner, and the chair of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, is also to meet the Garda Commissioner.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Garda Commissioner will come before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Thursday.  In that context, it is important for the Oireachtas to have a thorough discussion to probe the situation with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as we find it.  It is important to recognise that garda&iacute; have seen changes, particularly during the last Government's term in office.  What has happened has been most unacceptable.  The Taoiseach has said today that he is "very unhappy".</p><p>I will be happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business that has been proposed by Senator Humphreys.  I propose that the debate in question should take place at 8.30 p.m.  The T&aacute;naiste will be in the D&aacute;il this evening.  I propose that we accept the amendment and that we have one speaker per group with the T&aacute;naiste in the House this evening.  To be fair, the Business Committee of the D&aacute;il was discussing its plans as we were speaking on the Order of Business here.  The T&aacute;naiste will be in the Lower House this evening.  In light of the business and the commitments we have in this House, I am proposing that we have a debate at 8.30 p.m.  One representative of each group will engage with the T&aacute;naiste on the matter.  I think I am proposing a fair accommodation, given that the issue was raised in the House this afternoon.</p><p>Senators Leyden, Mulherin, O'Donnell, Gavan, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Higgins and Conway raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I join Senator Conway in saying that, in my experience, Bus &Eacute;ireann's drivers and those who work on the buses in Cork are tremendous ambassadors for the company.  None of them wants to be on strike.  As I have said previously in the House, it is incumbent on all sides to engage, re-engage and emerge into talks.  A resolution is required, not least for the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the company and the members of the travelling public who have been discommoded.  We all accept that the current Bus &Eacute;ireann model certainly has difficulties.  There is an issue with the Expressway service.  Equally, as Senator O'Donnell said, there is an issue with the amount of money being made available under the public service obligation, PSO, scheme.  Private companies do not have to take the free travel pass.  All of us who live in the real world recognise that changes are required.  People are committed to wanting to see this dispute resolved.  I appeal to all sides to engage and re-engage.  We can all go down the line of politicising this dispute and trying to be populist and to score points against the Minister, Deputy Ross.  A fair number of people here are good at tweeting and taking selfies.</p></speech>

I note the remarks of the Law Society this morning.  It has changed its position and is now in support of at least having a lay majority on the judicial appointments commission.  I know this puts it at a difference with the Bar Council.  What is important, irrespective of one's viewpoint, is that we have been well served by our Judiciary.  At the core of that is an independence that we must ensure is preserved.  I agree with Senator McDowell and others who have spoken that there must be a continuation of excellence in regard to our Judiciary.  In tandem with that, its independence must be maintained and preserved.  We have been well served by our Judiciary and I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House in that regard.</p> <p>Senators O'Sullivan, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Feighan referred to issues relating to the North and the Assembly.  On Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's comments, to be fair I do not think Senator O'Sullivan was lecturing.  He was saying what many people are thinking, that the elections are now over.  A mandate has been given to all political parties in the North to enter into government in the Assembly at Stormont and to act responsibly on behalf of all people in the North of our country.  That is the point that I took from Senator O'Sullivan and that is the point that I would make as Leader of the House and as somebody who is as committed as anybody to seeing the peace process continue.  In the words of former US President Clinton last week, our legacy must be to ensure that the peace is brought home.  It is important that, irrespective of whether it is Michelle O'Neill or Arlene Foster or whoever, there is a political responsibility to sit down and to govern on behalf of the people.  The last thing that anybody wants to see is direct rule or a further election.  That requires all sides to remember that the election is over.  It is now time to govern.</p></speech>

I join her, on my behalf and on behalf of the House, in offering sympathy to the families of the cyclists who were killed, including in a tragedy on the streets of our capital yesterday.  The safety of cyclists and those who use our roads is an issue we take very seriously.  A Private Members' Bill has been published by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon which provides for prohibiting passing cylists at a distance any closer than 1.5 m.  It is important that we highlight this matter.  Equally, it is incumbent on all those who use the roads to offer due care to cyclists and pedestrians.  Any death is a tragedy and the death of three cyclists is entirely too many.  I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to debate the matter.</p> <p>Senators Catherine Noone and Ray Butler raised the issue of obesity.  I join them in encouraging all State agencies, particularly Departments that have a responsibility in this area, to play their role in reducing the incidence of obesity.  I commend Senator Butler for his work with regard to diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes is an important issue that must be addressed and I will be happy to schedule that debate in the House.</p> <p>Senator Frances Black raised the matter of evictions.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, came to the House last week to discuss the progress report on Rebuilding Ireland.  I did not catch the reference the Senator made in terms of the evictions but my information is that the number of evictions of people from their homes is decreasing.  I will invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue of landlords and private rented accommodation.  All of us are anxious that people have security of tenure in their housing.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised a matter regarding the Tuam mother and baby home.  If he gives me the details, I will refer them to the Minister.  I have been in discussions with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, with regard to the International Protection Act and direct provision.  He is away this week and I hope to schedule that debate next week or during the week before the Easter recess.  It is on the list.  As the Senator knows, I have worked with him in the past to have issues resolved, so I am hoping to have that done either next week or the week after.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the very fine facility in Deer Lodge on Mill Road in Killarney.  I agree it is appalling that the home is not open for the 40 patients.  It might be better for the Senator to raise it as a Commencement matter, but I will take it up with the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Norris raised the issue of Bank of Ireland and the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

There is a need for freedom of speech and an exchange of ideas.  I would be appalled if a student organisation or group had its funding suspended because it supported a particular action.

I join with her in welcoming the good news story in Limerick.  I am sure that all Senators will join with me, including Senator Gavan, in welcoming the &euro;850,000 investment in the surgical day care unit and the new emergency department.  Both units will be fine additions to the hospital and will greatly benefit the people in the area.</p> <p>Senator Conway made an interesting point about post offices having a new public service contract.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the House to discuss the matter.  It is important that we have certainty about post offices.</p> <p>Senator Conway made an important point about unviable or unused post offices.  We should have a conversation on how frequently we use post offices as a society.  People talk about encountering faceless banks, particularly when lodging money into their bank accounts, either social welfare, wages or whatever.  Perhaps we should reverse the trend away from automation and encourage people to use banks and post offices.</p> <p>I join with Senator Devine in asking people to support the Irish Kidney Association and organ donation week.  I am the former chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that commissioned a fine report on organ donation.  It recommended that we change the organ donation system.  It is incumbent on us that we do so now, as a matter of urgency.  As the Senator rightly said, it is wrong to have 600 people awaiting organ transplant when people can be given the gift of new life by people donating an organ.  I hope that the Irish Kidney Association can work with all of us to change the system.</p> <p>I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business.

Senator Humphreys proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: "That the Minister for Justice and Equality attend the House to discuss the situation in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na." The Leader has indicated he is willing to accept the amendment.  Is the proposal by the Leader to deal with the amendment at 8.30 p.m. agreed to?  Agreed.  By way of clarification, how much time will be allocated for the principal speakers?</p></speech>

In A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government set out its aim to increase access to safe and timely care as close to patients' homes as possible.  We outlined that progressing this objective would be a priority for the partnership Government.  In our programme, we committed to extending the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  This initiative was subsequently announced as part of a range of health measures in budget 2017.  The Bill delivers on this important commitment in full, on time and without qualification.  We also committed to reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.  The Bill will see the prescription charge reduced for medical card holders who are over 70 years of age and their dependants.</p> <p>The legislation has two primary purposes.  First, it will ensure that all children for whom a domiciliary care allowance payment is being made will be eligible for a medical card.  Up to now, more than 9,800 of the 33,000 children for whom an allowance payment is made have not qualified for a medical card.  The Bill will ensure that all 33,000 children will be eligible.  This scheme will be operational from 1 June, with the HSE having a paper-based and online pre-registration system in place from 1 May.  This pre-registration will assist in allowing all those who wish to do so to use their new medical cards from 1 June.</p> <p>Second, it will reduce the prescription charge for medical card holders aged 70 years or older and their dependants.  The charge will be reduced to &euro;2 per prescription item, with a monthly cap of &euro;20 for an individual or family.  This targeted measure will benefit nearly 390,000 over 70s and their dependants.  It is expected to save this group in the region of &euro;10 million in 2017 and &euro;12 million in a full year.  Senators will note that this reduction was implemented on an administrative basis from 1 March.  The HSE issued a circular to pharmacies setting out the reduced charge and process.  I will take this opportunity on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf and mine to thank the HSE and pharmacies across the country for their swift implementation of this measure.</p> <p>In addition, I stress the importance of delivering the Bill in March in order to place this important measure on a statutory basis.</p></speech>
