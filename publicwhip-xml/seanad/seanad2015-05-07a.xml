    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1173" speakername="Lorraine Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#A00500"><p>I raise this matter on the Commencement of the House today to call for the creation of a single body to lead the charge against cyberbullying, work on awareness and establish an educational campaign on the issue.  Currently, eight Government bodies are involved in tackling the issue of cyberbullying, including the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Office of Internet Safety, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Such a broad arrangement is not conducive the to type of urgent and dedicated attention required to deal effectively with the issue of cyberbullying.  A cyberbullying task force would also act as an invaluable source of support, training and knowledge sharing.</p> <p>As has so often been reported, teachers, parents and young people throughout the country are struggling to deal with issues related to cyberbullying and are crying out for additional supports.  A cyberbullying task force would provide desperately needed tools of empowerment and education to enable citizens to navigate online environments safely and confidently without any fear.  There is no doubt about the many freedoms and benefits we enjoy in the Internet age, but cyberbullying detracts from these and causes a great deal of hurt and distress that has very real effects on people and their lives.  It is time for us as a Government to mobilise against such behaviour and to render cyberbullying as unacceptable as bullying in the offline world.  By establishing a dedicated cyberbullying task force and implementing the kind of legislation the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and I have proposed, the Government would send a strong message of support to those in need and a clear message of intent to those who offend.</p> <p>We have seen the wonderful work that agencies like the Road Safety Authority have done to curb road traffic accidents and fatalities.  Given that cyberbullying is ageless and the biggest issue confronting generations of online users, we ought to be as proactive as possible when dealing with it.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister to consider earnestly my submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#A00600"><p>I thank Senator Lorraine Higgins for raising this matter.  The pervasive use of social media together with the rise of connected mobile devices has created a new and unique set of challenges for individuals and Government.  The issues are complex.  The Internet is difficult to regulate and a balance must be struck between preserving freedom of expression online and protecting all our citizens from cyberbullying and harmful and grossly offensive content, particularly, but not exclusively, children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Alex White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2219"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2219&amp;amp;pid=AlexWhite&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All governments across the world are grappling with the challenge of finding an appropriate model for the governance of online content.  A cohesive Government response to this issue is necessary to achieve a safe and healthy online environment, which allows us to enjoy the many benefits of the Internet without exposure to unacceptable behaviour or risk.</p><p>Aspects of the legal and administrative system have adapted to the issues posed by electronic communications, and work has also been undertaken at European Union level.  The European Digital Single Market promises to bring new standards of accountability to the online world and provide greater powers for individual citizens to respond to online wrongs.  Here in Ireland, the Government established the Internet content governance advisory group in late 2013 to provide independent, expert advice on these matters.  The ICGAG's comprehensive analysis and recommendations were brought to Cabinet and published last June.  The ICGAG's recommendations have formed the basis of subsequent action, including the establishment of a cross-departmental group that is considering how best to implement the recommendations.</p><p>This cross-departmental group is chaired by an official from my Department, and includes representatives from the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs, and Education and Skills.  The group is also taking account of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission in its issues paper on cybercrime affecting personal safety and privacy, including cyberbullying.  The group will report back to Government shortly and the final report will be published in due course.  I look forward to having a debate in this House on that report to see how best we can move this agenda forward at that stage.</p><p>I agree with the Senator that the issue of cyberbullying would be best addressed in this context if only because the distinction between cyberbullying and other forms of undesirable online behaviour is unclear.  I understand the Senator listed eight Government bodies including a number of Departments that have an involvement in the area.  While it would be desirable and essential to have a coherent response, it is inevitable that different bodies will still have some responsibility over this area.  For example, for broadcasting the regulator is the BAI; the criminal dimension is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Data Protection Commissioner's responsibilities are set out in legislation and so on.  That said, I have considerable sympathy with the Senator, whose work in the area is well acknowledged, in saying that the response must be coherent, pulling together all the strands of Government activity both within Government and through agencies.  I look forward to discussing how best to achieve that when I bring a report to Government following the cross-departmental group's analysis of the ICGAG report.</p></speech>

I accept that cyberbullying issues will always straddle various Departments.  However, I am suggesting having one dedicated task force.</p> <p>While enacting law in the area is one thing, it is essential to have awareness and education.  I recently spoke to a number of teenagers at an event.  They did not have a clue as to whether they were cyberbullying and it took a long time to get that point through to them.  The number of garda&iacute;, students, teachers and parents, who have contacted me since I came out and spoke publicly about my experience, proves that this is a very serious issue.  At least three young people have told me they are self-harming as a consequence of the online bullying in their lives.  With due respect, the issue needs to be addressed with urgency.  The Department needs to act as swiftly as possible as soon as the report from the cross-departmental group becomes available.</p></speech>

We need to find the most appropriate instruments, which requires consideration and care as to how we proceed.  I can always understand frustration over the time it can take for decisions to be made.  I again draw the Senator's attention to the extensive recommendations in the ICGAG report, which is a very strong report in many respects.  It requires me to pull together activity in different Departments to ensure the cohesive approach the Senator correctly advocates.  I look forward to returning to the issue in this House with the Senator at some point in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, I am very disappointed that the Minister of State with responsibility for this sector, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is not here today.  It would nearly encourage me to postpone the issue completely.  As a former Minister of State, I took many Adjournment motions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and I appreciate that people can be out of the country.  I hope we will get a vehicle to raise this vital matter again.</p><p>The matter is the future of services for people in Roscommon who are suffering psychiatric problems.  The Rosalie unit in Castlerea which accommodates people with psychiatry of older life issues is threatened and the future of the high support hostel at Knockroe, Castlerea is unclear.  Staffing levels at the acute psychiatric unit remain a concern for staff.  The issue has been raised by Councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice in Castlerea and Councillor Orla Leyden.  Both have campaigned very strongly on the issue and have made very coherent arguments.</p><p>Councillor Fitzmaurice has criticised particularly the HSE's plans to close the unit in Castlerea and many community mental health facilities in Counties Roscommon and Galway.  The plans by the Government and the HSE to evict these voiceless and vulnerable people from the Rosalie unit are a disgrace.  With many people voicing opposition to this closure including nurses and doctors the Government must listen to the people of the county.  I agree totally with Councillor Fitzmaurice in that regard.  He has submitted very detailed documentation outlining what is happening on the ground in Roscommon.</p><p>Councillor Orla Leyden has also issued a statement in this regard and has attended meetings with the programme directors in Roscommon, but has not got any satisfactory response.  She said that over the last year, bit-by-bit psychiatric services in the area are being pulled apart.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for primary care, social care, disabilities and older people, and mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, needs to explain why the Government is continuing to tear apart psychiatric services in County Roscommon where day-care services are being dismantled and are under threat.</p><p>The Rosalie unit in Castlerea which accommodates people with psychiatry of older life issues is threatened and the future of the high support hostel at Knockroe, Castlerea is unclear.  Staffing levels at the acute psychiatric unit remain a concern for staff.  That unit was opened when the Government closed the large psychiatric unit in Castlerea, which is now a prison.  The service was provided in a hotel that was bought at the time.  It has served very effectively since and many extensions have been added on.</p><p>The <i>Roscommon People</i>recently carried a report about one of the Minister of State's colleagues.  It stated:<blockquote>Senator John Kelly has threatened to quit the Labour Party over the crisis in mental health services in County Roscommon.<br /><br />The Ballaghaderreen man's shock declaration follows a &quot;stormy&quot; meeting he had with Junior Health Minister Kathleen Lynch, his party colleague, last Thursday, over his concerns about local psychiatric services.</blockquote>Senator Kelly did not resign when the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon closed, which the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, had pledged to retain.  I would prefer Senator Kelly to continue on and do something about the issue within the Labour Party instead of taking the easy option of opting out.</p></speech>

That is why I was particularly anxious for the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to be here to respond to the questions allegedly raised with her by Senator Kelly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be preferable for a member of the Labour Party to stay within the Labour Party and fight for services instead of opting out, taking the easy option and fighting from the sidelines.

Similar to elsewhere, Galway-Roscommon mental health services are committed to full implementation of A Vision for Change.  The HSE appointed an expert group to review local community mental health services.  The group's report was published in June 2014 and focused on residential care settings and resources across both counties.  The key goal was to make recommendations that would ensure service users can maximise their full potential and improve the quality of their lives.  </p><p>The HSE in the Galway-Roscommon administrative area provides an inpatient and community mental health service for a population of 314,000.  They are at an advanced stage in the implementation of A Vision for Change and have already moved into population sectors of 50,000, appointed team co-ordinators and developed an overarching clinical governance model.  The area has six general adult team sectors, which are clinically led by two consultant psychiatrists, and a multi-disciplinary team as highlighted in A Vision for Change.  Each sector has its own unique service needs based on identified population, age groups, culture or other factors.  There are 12 consultant general adult psychiatrists across the two counties, which again is in line with A Vision for Change.  </p><p>Recent initiatives include the development of a psychiatry of later life team, the provision of an intensive home treatment team for Roscommon and the opening of an adolescent day hospital for the region.  Galway-Roscommon mental health services have also been successful in securing significant additional new staff posts through development funding since 2012, of which the bulk are now in place and the remaining posts well advanced through recruitment.  These include additional consultants in the areas of general adult community mental health teams, psychiatry of later life teams and rehabilitation and recovery teams.  Allied staff include occupational therapists, community mental health nurses and social workers.  </p><p>Key to modernising services in line with current and future demand and best international practice is reorientation from a hospital and bed-based focus to developing structures and processes required for enhanced community based provision.  Any decisions in respect of the individual services highlighted by the Senator can only be addressed in the context of the wider ongoing service change I have outlined.  It is worth noting also, as indicated on several occasions recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, that HSE West has, overall, a higher <i>per capita</i>investment in mental health than the national average.  </p><p>Every effort has been, and will continue to be, made to achieve change on a partnership basis, involving many different stakeholders on a national or local level and taking into account all genuine concerns relating to best operational practice.  Above all, the changes being implemented, which are so essential to mental health services, are keeping to the fore the best interests of the service user, particularly in terms of improved avenues for early intervention and recovery.  The Government will continue with the policy of modernising our mental health services with a view to providing the best possible service for those who need it.</p></speech>

Senator Kelly should consider his position in light of this reply but I hope we get the opportunity to have a more detailed debate with the Minister in this House in the near future.  We may also rely on requests under freedom of information or other sources to get information from this Government.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is not carrying out her responsibilities to the people of the west and she is washing her hands of this particular issue.  I am disgusted with the response and disappointed with the way this matter is being dealt with.  The voiceless people who are being supposedly cared for are being neglected and thrown out in society without any support whatsoever.  It is a blight on this Government and we are not finished with this yet.</p></speech>

My topic relates to school transport and the situation facing one particular family in County Cavan.  The family had applied online for school transport and were told they were eligible for it.  They got their school tickets and the children were initially picked up by a bus.  However, they then received notification that although they were eligible for school transport no school transport service was currently available to take them to school.  They were then told that they would be able to receive the remote area grant towards the cost of private school transport arrangements.</p> <p>The reason I raise this matter is to try to find a way around this problem, particularly in view of the fact that the contractor who had initially picked up the children does not see a problem in diverting the route to pick them up.  Given that the family were eligible for school transport when a bus service was available, is there some flexibility over this matter?  It is an issue that has come up in a number of rural areas.</p> <p>Parents are calling for the route to be changed to allow some type of pick-up to take place.  They say the pick-up options that were given to them were not feasible but the rerouting of the bus could be a positive thing.  It is very hard to contemplate how the rules can dictate that a bus travel down one road when the need for the service is along another.  This is particularly relevant when one considers that the contractor does not believe there is a material difference in changing the route to collect these children.  It seems that the only barrier is an administrative one.  Minor changes should be able to be made to the system at local level and a flexible approach and a bit of common sense will go a long way in meeting the needs of children - not just these children but others in other areas.  A detour is all that is required and it would benefit this family in gaining access to education for the children.  I ask that the Minister request the school transport office to look again at the bus service in question and see how these children may be accommodated.  Considering the financial pressure parents are under when it comes to funding children's education, whether in the form of contributions, the cost of uniforms or other such costs, it is not a big ask to review the scheme for these children.  </p> <p>The second part of this commencement matter relates to the remote area grant.  As no service is available the family have been told they may be able to receive a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.  How will this be administered?  Will they get it towards the end of the year?  In many families one car is used for work so they would have to get a taxi to get the children to school and having to meet the costs of these upfront would be very difficult.  If the family gets the remote area grant to get their children to school can it be provided as soon as possible so that there are no barriers to getting the children to school?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kathryn Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is there any possibility of introducing flexibility into the route to facilitate this family?

School transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  This school year, for example, some 113,000 children, including almost 10,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported daily to schools throughout the country.  The purpose of the primary school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside in an location that is remote from their nearest school.  Children are eligible for transport if they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, is responsible for determining eligibility for school transport and for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes.</p> <p>The closing date for receipt of applications for school transport for this school year was the 25 April 2014.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the application for school transport for the family in question was not received until March 2015.  Although the children are eligible for school transport, I understand there is no school transport service operating from the area in which these children reside.  However, Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that tickets were issued in error because a service was not available to the family.  In accordance with terms of the scheme, families of eligible children for whom no school transport service is available may, following an application for transport within the prescribed time limits, receive a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.  If it is not possible to accommodate these children for the 2015-16 school year, the family will be eligible for a remote area grant from the commencement of that school year.  This grant is calculated at a fixed daily rate and is payable annually at the end of the school year, based on the distance a family resides from their school of eligibility and on the level of school attendance.  The full details of the remote area grant are available on the Department's website.  It is important to emphasise that the terms of the primary school transport scheme are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></speech>

It is appropriate to have it and my colleague, Senator Leyden, will be taking the debate for Fianna F&aacute;il.  There are many issues to consider in this context and I raise an issue I raised yesterday in regard to the Commission's work programme from which it is clear that it wants to take away Ireland's corporate tax advantage by ensuring that any profits generated by companies based in Ireland will be paid in the country where it perceives they are generated.  In this consumer age where Internet banking and Internet sales and activity are done in cyber space, it will be difficult for the Commission to define how a product is sold in Germany if it is bought through an Irish-based company.  The EU is determined to take away our corporate tax advantage and that proposal is included in the work programme.  Its work programme has been passed apparently by a committee of these Houses and brought before the House without having been debated.  That is not the scrutiny or the transparency that we had hoped for or that the Government had promised, having regard to allowing this proposal to remain in the Commission's the work programme.  It should be removed and Ireland should seek its removal.</p> <p>I note that today's newspapers are full of more election promises for members of the public sector who are in line to gain &euro;800 euro each.  If  the previous generosity of the Government with regard to the public sector is anything to go by, the money will go to those at the top end not to those at the bottom.  Let us break down the &euro;800 figure.  This year we will borrow &euro;4.6 billion, which works out at &euro;2,500 per working person.  What the Government is doing is borrowing money to buy votes.</p></speech>

That is three-card-trick economics at its best.</p> <p>We can also note that 250 people in this country have assets of &euro;76 billion while the combined net worth of half the population is &euro;63 billion.  Some of those 250 people with their billions in assets are not even paying the &euro;200,000 exile tax that the Government imposed.  It has not collected that tax, those people are not being pursued for it yet they have assets worth more than the assets of half of the population combined.  The Government is saying that this is okay.  Those people who are tax exiles are based all over Europe on this Europe Day.  They live in Monte Carlo and places where the sun shines a lot more than it shines here.  Yet, even the Government's tax policy with respect to the domiciliary levy is not being collected from those people who can well afford to pay it.  When we consider we will borrow &euro;2,500 per working person and then give public sector workers a pay increase, that represents three-card-trick economics at its finest.  I ask on this Europe Day that the Government pursue those people who are not paying the &euro;200,000 levy and to name and shame them.</p></speech>

Other colleagues have talked about this previously.  There have been some reports of an increase in the incidence of burglary in recent months and years even while, generally, crime rates are decreasing in a range of categories.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> At the justice committee yesterday we had a briefing from officials on the content of the new heads of a Bill which the Minister for Justice and Equality has published recently on burglary.  In particular the Bill will seek to address issues around bail and sentencing for repeat offenders with a number of burglary convictions.  As we are all aware, however, there is far more to the issue of crime prevention than simply bail and sentencing.  Indeed, there is much to be done beyond the legislative framework on crime prevention, particularly around policing, better supports for victims and juvenile liaison - we know a large number of these types of offences are committed by people under 18 years of age.  Will the Leader arrange a debate focusing on the broader aspects of crime prevention as well as the specific debate which we will have in due course on the burglary Bill?  I call on the Leader to bring in the Minister for Justice and Equality on that matter.</p><p>I welcome the moves being taken at governmental level to legislate on collective bargaining.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ged Nash, who has been working on the preparation of a Bill to recognise collective bargaining rights for workers, protect against victimisation for those active in unions in the workplace and deal with the issue of registered employment agreements and sectoral agreements.  I welcome these moves and look forward to the legislation in due course.  Will the Leader inquire about when that legislation is likely to come before the Seanad?  I understand it is due to be approved shortly.</p><p>I commend our colleague Senator Norris on his participation in the debate on the marriage equality referendum in "Tonight with Vincent Browne" on TV3 last night.  I thought he spoke excellent sense, if I may say so.  In the same context I welcome the Law Society of Ireland announcement yesterday to the effect that it was supporting a "Yes" vote in the referendum because marriage equality is a human right.  There were forthright comments from the director general of the Law Society.  I note that in recent days we have also seen doctors coming out in support of marriage equality, for example, the group Doctors for Marriage Equality.  All the children's rights groups working on the front line in the protection of children's rights, such as the ISPCC, Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance, have called for a "Yes" vote in the marriage equality referendum debate as well.  Those of us who are out canvassing will take note of these developments.</p></speech>

It is estimated that the market is worth approximately &euro;21 million but that it is not being used.  It is possible for companies to use it and they are capable of using it but we need to train people up to do it.</p><p>I had an interesting morning at the launch of Springboard this morning.  This year's Springboard is an adventure and the Government has put a sizable amount of money into it.  It has put &euro;27 million this year alone into educating people who have the wrong skills to move them from one skill to another skill.  The work being done is amazing.  Some &euro;27 million has been allocated for this year, which will bring the total to &euro;100 million over five years.</p><p>I raise the matter because I believe it is worthy of having a discussion on it.  It is not urgent at the moment, but I believe it would be worthwhile to discuss it next time we have the Minister for Education and Skills in the House because there is an opportunity to tie up these two things.  The stories we heard this morning were of mainly American companies - but not only American companies, there were Irish companies as well - which want to employ more people but cannot unless they can get the skills.  Springboard is creating those skills and giving an opportunity to these companies to expand and employ more people with technology that has not been used up to now.  I believe this is worthy of discussion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, were there today.  They spoke well and explained exactly what they hoped to do.  I believe the Government is doing the right thing and is behind them but we could do more to encourage it.</p></speech>

Today, a study has come out from Peter Lunn, a senior researcher from the ESRI whom I have known over the years through my work with the Irish Sports Council.  His research paper is called &quot;Participation in School Sport and Post-School Pathways: Evidence from Ireland&quot;.  With the junior certificate and leaving certificate due to take place next month, this report is apropos because there is a serious correlation between the students who participate in sports and results in the senior cycle.  The report states that between 9 and 14% of these students go on to third level education compared with those who do participate in sports or exercise during that period.</p><p>In my work as a coach in recent years I am frequently asked by parents whether they should allow their Johnny or Mary to participate in sports while they are doing the junior or leaving certificate.  My response to is always, &quot;Yes, you should.&quot; for two reasons.  First, participating in sports keeps a student's mind off his studies and takes the pressure off.  Second, participating in his studies keeps his mind off sports.</p><p>I prefer to think of the bigger picture in respect of this report.  While the report refers to participation in sports, I am keen to bring it back to another issue I am strongly in favour of, that is, physical education in the senior cycle.  After junior certificate most students have a tendency to drop out of physical education and it is not compulsory for them for them to participate.  Why is this?  It is because the pressure from parents is on them to study.  It is important for students to continue to be active in physical education as they go through their studies.</p><p>The debate I am calling for is on something I have mentioned on dozens of occasions, here and outside, that is, physical education.  I have raised the matter in respect of primary schools but it is relevant in secondary schools as well.  I am calling on the Government to make serious investments in physical education facilities such as PE halls in schools.  I said yesterday that I get numerous requests from schools looking for supports but they get no support.</p></speech>

There has been a substantial growth in these kinds of contracts in Ireland in recent years.  It is difficult to quantify exactly how many people are affected because people on these contracts do not even know they are on them.</p> <p>The contracts themselves cover a range of arrangements that mean workers have no guaranteed weekly hours or income and they are only being paid for the hours that they actually do work.  There are some employers, one, in particular, Dunnes Stores, about which we have seen much coverage in recent times, using use zero-hours contracts to cut away, avoid holiday pay and avoid pensions and other benefits enjoyed by other employees.</p> <p>The thing is that workers are unable to take on other work when they are on these contracts because they are obliged to be available for work on the whim of the employer.  The growth of zero-hours contracts along with other forms of precarious employment is one of the main reasons working people in this country have seen a decline in their living standards in recent years.  While we have had much good news in recent years on the employment front with 95,000 jobs created, if we do not create more well-paid jobs with guaranteed hours we will end up with a two-tier workforce with many people stuck in working poverty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2385"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2385&amp;amp;pid=LorraineHiggins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We recently saw in the Dunnes Stores dispute how many people in that business were on such contracts.  We also saw the dreadful treatment of employees after they had returned to work after being on strike.  The attitude towards employees means that Dunnes Stores' slogan, "Always better value", has a new meaning.  We need to clamp down on these employment practices and enforce an attitude of zero tolerance to zero-hours contracts.  The casualisation of working hours is unsustainable.  At the end of the day, Ireland will only succeed when working people succeed.  That is why I am calling for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to attend the House to discuss the issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Some 25% are present today for the Order of Business, which is regrettable.  We need to re-examine how we order the business of the House to ensure full participation.  It is regrettable that the Order of Business which used to be the most vital part of the schedule for the day is diminishing all the time.  I ask the Leader to look into the matter.</p></speech>

I reiterate the call I made yesterday to the Leader for a more comprehensive debate not just on quarterly economic statements but also on how the country will proceed in the next five to ten years and how any excess money will be spent.  It has been announced that there many well be between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.8 billion in additional moneys available in the forthcoming budget.  It has been reported in the newspapers today that the Government may allocate around &euro;300 million of this money to the public sector in increased pay.  The public sector plays a crucial and fundamental role in the operation of the State, but it would be wrong for the Government in the lead up to a general election to try to use any surplus money like confetti at a wedding in providing money for public servants without any increase in productivity, efficiency or the effectiveness of public sector organisations across the board.  That has not happened.  The old saying goes, "Never waste a recession".  The Government keeps using the mantra that it will not do things in the way they were done in the past, but it is doing them in exactly the same way.  It comes down to keeping the trade union movement which funds the Labour Party happy.</p></speech>

The morale of public servants is at an all-time low and a pay increase of 2% or 3% will not resolve that issue.  There will have to be meaningful reforms to include scorecard systems whereby every individual plays a role in ensuring the future of public service organisations.  When rolled out originally in the 1980s in Sheffield by the NHS, it was called the balanced scorecard system.  Under the scheme, every individual in the public sector has an equal input in ensuring the future of an organisation.</p></speech>

Other public servants have no input; they are asked to follow orders, even though those orders have not been properly scrutinised.  Public servants lower down the chain know that things are not being done right.  Politicians talk about reform as if it was something new, but there has been no actual reform.  A best practice model is not being introduced either.  We are going to reward inefficiencies, while ignoring the need for real reform and to lift morale across the public sector.  It is a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

I agree with him, however, that we had a good and useful debate last night with the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.  The truth is we did not have enough time in two hours.  As the Senator suggested, we should have an ongoing debate in this regard.  I sat close to the Minister of State for two hours and saw that he was being attentive and taking copious notes on what every speaker was saying.  When he came to respond, however, and as the Leader saw, he did not have time to deal with half of the matters that had been raised.</p></speech>

We know that we have 10% fewer staff in the public sector since the Government took office, but there has also been an increase in productivity, including under the Haddington Road agreement.

However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is an unprecedented meltdown in the health service.  Problems I identified 22 years ago when I first came back to the country are just as bad as or worse than they ever were, despite numerous changes of Government.  Blame attaches to parties on both sides of the House.  God bless the good old Civil War, the gift that keeps on giving.  However, if people focused on trying to fix the health service, they might be somewhat embarrassed by the fact that in a population of 4.5 million some 400,000 people are on waiting lists to be seen.  One hears figures in the United States for the percentage of the young urban male population who are engaged with the criminal justice system, but this is every bit as embarrassing.  Nearly 10% of people in this country - certainly more than 10% of adults - are waiting to be seen in the health service.  Some 778 have been waiting for more than four years, while 83,000 have been waiting for over one year.  The issue is the sheer bloody abnormality of waiting for one year to see a doctor in a modern western country, yet the penny has still not dropped after 22 years.  There is something bizarre about a system which has as one of its metrics getting the number waiting for one year down to a reasonable number.  Some 67,000 people are waiting for treatment.  They are the ones who have already been seen in the system; therefore, one can work it out.  One may be part of a double waiting process, whereby a patient waits to be seen, is then scheduled for treatment and then waits again for treatment.  This excludes 14,500 inpatients awaiting diagnostic endoscopy services.  I live through this every day in hospital, with patients sitting on beds waiting for days at a time for tests to be carried out.  We have found out that at Limerick hospital, an institution that is staffed by very fine nurses and doctors, 2,400 patients have been registered as being on trolleys.  In an equivalent period nine years ago the figure was one third of this.  It is simply outrageous.</p><p>I do not like to use the word &quot;scandal&quot; lightly, but we are aware of the latest series of concerns about quality issues in obstetrics and radiology.  In addition, data are emerging that show a large number of consultants in post, in a country that is desperately short of specialists, are locums.  The country with the largest number of medical schools in the world per head of population and which churns out more medical graduates <i>per capita</i>than nearly every other country in the world is importing doctors from some of the most medically under-served countries in the world.  We cannot even create enough career level jobs for the people we have available here.  I recently received representations from several colleagues who had been forced to quit and retire.  Given their skills and expertise, the system has thus been deprived of unbelievable human and intellectual capital because they have reached their 65th birthday.  I have highlighted the case of one of them before who has not been completely replaced.  I recently received representations from another colleague who told me - I will not regionalise it or identify them-----</p></speech>

Is the Cathaoirleach on for one?  I have recently been informed about what happened with a post considered to be an extraordinarily sought after position.  The post should have had Irish graduates lining up, dusting off their curricula vitae and promoting the fact that they had training in America, Boston, London or wherever.  It should have enticed them to come back but no Irish graduate applied for the post.  That shows we desperately need to take a serious look at the issues.  They are interrelated and come down to one core issue - the management, structure and financing of the health service, which is not something that can be administratively adjusted.</p></speech>

However, I agree with him on how the business of the House is run, particularly Commencement matters.  When we table specific Commencement matters, we want the specific Minister in charge to come to the House and deal with the matter.  Over the past four years I have been totally frustrated to have health issues that I tabled for Commencement debates being responded to by, for example, the Minister responsible for small business.  Two weeks ago I raised the issue of a Castlerea unit but the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport took the debate.  Today, Senator Leyden tabled the same matter but the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection attended.  I know for a fact that these Ministers know nothing about the issue.  All they do is read out a departmental script and, therefore, we have no debate.  We ask the questions but receive answers from a man or woman who knows nothing about the issue.  Therefore, will the Leader change the way we do business?  If I table a health matter, I want the Minister for Health or his Minister of State to respond.  It is not as if we are trying to inconvenience Ministers.  We are prepared to wait an extra week or two for the relevant Minister to attend.</p></speech>

It is a stark reminder that nothing has changed as far as health service administration is concerned, which is depressing.  Governments and Ministers have changed over the past ten to 15 years but the service has not improved.  We have all read about the ever-lengthening hospital waiting queues and, therefore, must concede that root and branch reform is required.  In that regard, I support the intervention made by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.  He asked us to reflect on the fact that we cannot simply return to the concept of business as usual.</p> <p>There is a debate on the concept of pay restoration.  We all want to see public servants and all workers, especially those at the lower end of the payscale, having their wages increased, be it by way of pay or, preferably, a reduction in tax and USC.  We simply cannot buy into the concept of pay restoration.  Restoration to what?  Is it restoration to the type of economy which ruined this country over the past ten years?  Is it the restoration to a Celtic tiger boom and bust scenario?  No, thanks.  We need to focus on what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill remarked upon, the need for absolute root and branch reform across the system.  Obviously that applies to the health service and the problems raised by Senator Crown this morning.  The matter is worthy of  serious debate.</p> <p>Our learned colleague, Senator Crown, presented the statistic that almost 10% of the population await a service or appointment from the health department.  That is a Third World statistic and one which we should not stand over.</p></speech>

We are all keenly aware of the terrible circumstances that some people endure who live on the streets.  Whenever we meet a homeless person living in such conditions we feel shocked.  Our pride is also hurt that any citizen should find it necessary to live in such conditions.  Neither justifies the recent efforts to defame a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members will be aware of a particular incident that involved a homeless person and a garda but this was posted on social media websites.  For weeks and months many people took it to be an exact report of what happened.  Subsequently, it was discovered that the report was not the complete picture because footage of what happened, which was totally different, was taken from another source.  I know the Garda has been exonerated since.  We must remind ourselves that behind the uniform is a human being and reflect on how he must have felt during the period when he was misrepresented and defamed in this manner.  It is a warning to us all of the abuse which can take place on social media.  Sometimes people are not lucky enough, as the garda was, to be exonerated by a report which was published in recent days.  I urge people to be alert to those dangers in the future.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the incident has done harm to the cause of homeless people.  I wonder what was the agenda of the people who posted the item on social media.  Was it to undermine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Was it to make a political point?  Whatever it was, it did not serve the purpose of helping the homeless.  I am glad that the garda has been exonerated.  In future we should all be that little bit more alert when issues like this surface and give it time to have the matter examined.  If we had all rushed to comment when the case first surfaced, then we would have added to the damage inflicted.</p></speech>

It is a matter the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, has raised on several occasions.  It is important that small and medium-sized enterprises can trade online.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That led to Springboard, the aim of which is to update skills.  I refer not only to the skills of workers but also to those of people running businesses.  Springboard is certainly a very good project.  There is a need to update skills, as mentioned.  There are many companies coming to the State, but we just do not have the skills they need.  Therefore, upskilling is very important.</p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to the issues of obesity and participation in sport and exercise.  He referred to the importance of physical education, particularly in the senior cycle.  Physical education in primary schools was mentioned yesterday.  The Senator also emphasised the need to promote capital projects in order that people would have access to sports halls and so on.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is due to come to the House on 17 June for statements on tackling obesity.  This will be an opportunity to engage in debate.  We will try to get the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the other matters the Senator mentioned in respect of physical education.</p><p>Senators Terry Leyden and John Kelly referred to Ministers of State taking Commencement debates.  I cannot dictate what Minister should come to the House to discuss the issues raised; that is a matter for the Government.  There is very little that I can do in this regard.  If a Senator does not want the Minister who turns up to take the debate, that Senator should not speak in the debate and should instead wait until another Minister is available.  I have no control over who comes to the House to take Commencement debates.</p></speech>

We will certainly consider whether we should retain the Commencement debate or revert to the Adjournment debate and have the Order of Business at 10.30 a.m., but I do not see too much change.  There were not many more Senators present when we had the Order of Business at 10.30 a.m.  I heard all of Senators' excuses, including about attendance at committees, and we changed the system to accommodate them, but they are still not coming.  They are coming a minute or two before the Order of Business ends to catch the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s eye in order to speak.  Nothing has changed in that regard.  We have changed the time, but the level of participation of Members on the Order of Business has not changed very much.  We will certainly examine the issue.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the spending of money like confetti.</p></speech>

The public service made significant reforms through these agreements.  Pay increases will be modest because the Government has managed the economy in a prudent manner and will continue to do so.  The increases, if and when they are granted, will be achieved through negotiation, as always.  I can assure the Senator that nothing will be done that will damage the economy.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the spring economic statement and called for a further debate on it.  I will certainly try to have the Minister in the House again to discuss the matter.</p> <p>Senator John Crown referred to problems in the health service.  When the Government took office, the waiting lists only included people who had seen consultants and were awaiting operations.  The Government has introduced a more transparent system, under which people who are waiting to see consultants are included in the waiting lists.  That is why they are so large and unacceptable.  I asked the Minister to come to the House today, as requested, but he is not in Dublin today.  Therefore, I cannot accede to the Senator's request.  However, I will ask the Minister to come to the House at a later date.  The Senator was also correct to ask why consultants were not taking up the hundreds of posts vacant in the health service.  Why do we have to seek locums?  Why are the positions not being filled?  This is a very serious question, to which we need an answer.  As I stated, I cannot accede to the request that the Minister come to the House today.</p> <p>Senator Paul Bradford referred to the public service.  I addressed that matter in my reply to Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.</p> <p>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to an incident of which I was not aware.  He is correct that there are many people trying to undermine the Garda.  We have seen umpteen cases in recent times.  There is certainly a danger with social media in the sense that people are defamed regularly.  Something will have to be done about cyber-bullying, an issue which has been mentioned by Senator Lorraine Higgins and others.  I hope the Government will make proposals in this regard.  We have all been inundated with e-mails asking us to stop the Labour Party from introducing legislation on cyber-bullying as it might prevent freedom of speech.  That is a load of rubbish.  The matter needs to be addressed.  I agree with the sentiments of Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in this case.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether Senator Wilson wishes to make the main contribution on it.  Schedule 1 states a person shall be disqualified if he or she is adjudged a bankrupt.  We have serious issues with this.  The rule relating to bankrupts serving in the Oireachtas has been removed so why is the provision included in the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1164" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#O00500"><p>The Minister of State is aware we raised our concerns about this issue on Committee Stage.  Until quite recently, when a citizen of the State took an action to the Supreme Court, it was not possible for a citizen to stand for election to the either House of the Oireachtas, the Presidency or the European Parliament if he or she was adjudged a bankrupt.  If a person holding any of these positions was adjudged a bankrupt, he or she would have to resign.  This law has been changed.  On Committee Stage I asked the Minister of State to seek advice from the Attorney General on the constitutionality of preventing a person who was adjudged a bankrupt or who entered into a financial arrangement with creditors being disbarred from sitting on the board of this organisation.  Did the Minister of State seek the advice of the Attorney General in this regard or did he seek advice from the officials?  My advice is it is unconstitutional to prevent such people from sitting on the board.</p> <p>The answer the Minister of State gave me on Committee Stage was that it was normal procedure.  I pointed out to him during the debate that normal procedures no longer exist and things have moved on.  During my time in the House it was normal procedure to prevent county or city councillors from sitting on boards.  There was no reason for this other than civil servants decided they should not sit on the boards.  This was removed as a result of consistent objections on all sides of the House.  It is equally wrong to prevent people who have fallen on hard times and have had to come to an arrangement with creditors, and in some cases who have been adjudged a bankrupt, from sitting on the board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been advised that it is also unconstitutional.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill pointed out that a number of well-known sports personalities who are currently experiencing financial difficulties could make excellent members of the board.  High-profile former Members of the Oireachtas could be equally capable of contributing to the board but they will be prevented from doing so under this legislation.  A considerable number of voluntary and professional sporting organisations are facing financial problems.  Will the directors of those organisations be prevented from sitting on the board if they are declared bankrupt or have to come to an arrangement with their creditors?  Will the Minister of State to explain to the House why he is preventing these people from sitting on the board?  I urge him to reconsider and withdraw the ban.</p></speech>

The importance of sports to Irish life cannot be underestimated.  We see the role that sports play in every rural town, village and school in this country.  The Bill will provide for the administration of sports in this State by establishing the Sport Ireland body through the dissolution and merger of the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  It also makes enhanced provision to prevent doping in Irish sports.  The establishment of Sport Ireland will result in the more efficient development of sports and the implementation of sports policy by bringing responsibility for sporting matters under one agency.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#P01100"><p>Senator Wilson made a useful intervention in regard to membership of the board and the prohibitions set out in the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response in this regard.  I also welcome Senator Brennan's intervention regarding charges and liabilities.  Perhaps we were remiss in not being more vocal on this matter on Second and Committee Stages.  The amalgamation of the Abbotstown campus into the new body may result in the State taking on significant liabilities.  Perhaps the Minister of State can indicate whether a preliminary estimate has been made of the liabilities arising from Abbotstown and other developments.</p> <p>I accept the Minister of State's bona fides on the appointment of the chief executive.  He indicated last week that the appointment would be for an initial period of 12 months, following which the appointment will be made void and the process will start again.  I welcome the broad principle of this Bill.  Sport Ireland will be good for sports, society and the economy.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke on the Order of Business about the role that sports can play in the fight against obesity.  This Bill is part of that broader package.  However, if we are trying to show that things have changed in the economy and in how we manage State agencies, it is not appropriate to directly appoint the first chief executive of this new body.  At the end of his or her 12-month term of office, the new board will decide either to rubber-stamp his or her reappointment or to appoint somebody else to the position.  I recognise that the word "transparency" has been misused and abused but it is important none the less in the interest of transparency that the first person to occupy this important position is appointed through a public process rather than in the backroom of some Department.  Anything less would interfere with the signal that we are changing the way we do business.  I have no idea who will be appointed, and I am sure a range of good people will be considered.  However, the holder of this position will be a major player in the development and expansion of Irish sports and, as such, should be appointed in a public and transparent manner.  If a public competition is held for the post, it will give confidence in the appointment.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's response to my question about whether organisations will be directly represented.  He cannot pick the GAA for a seat on the board while ignoring the IFA or the IRFU.  It will be difficult enough for him without laying down further restrictions on the appointment of the board.  However, the appointment of a chief executive will be the first act of the new game of Sport Ireland.  It should be a transparent, competitive and accountable process.  When the HSE was first established, we would have thought it an usual way of doing business had the Minster for Health made the first appointment to that body without a competitive process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister of State to reflect on this issue.  I do not expect that he will amend the Bill at this stage but we need a strong assurance that the first chief executive will be appointed in a transparent manner if we are to have confidence in the man or woman appointed to that position.  The future of Irish sports requires a strong beginning without any ifs, buts or doubts.  I worry that the method of appointing the first chief executive is not appropriate.</p></speech>

The Minister of State addressed that issue last week when he indicated that the legal liabilities would remain with Sport Ireland.  He also addressed the issue of the new CEO by stating that it would be a temporary position lasting no longer than one year.  This will facilitate the process of transition.  I presume this Bill will be signed by the President and enacted at the earliest opportunity.  For the sake of continuity, a temporary CEO is being appointed for a one year term and it will then be up to the new board of Sport Ireland to advertise and recruit for the position.  The board will decide who to appoint as the new CEO.  I understand that no amendment has been tabled on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I had expected to sees hundreds of amendments given that I was unable to submit one 48 hours before the debate was scheduled.  I abided by the rules of the House.</p></speech>

Do not change the rules.  I am not changing the rules.  Senators were given time to submit amendments.

I asked my officials to investigate the position with the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General.  The Senators opposite are such great parliamentarians that they allowed nine Bills through the House without asking this question.  The provision in question was in each of those Bills but nobody asked about it.  I am merely making an observation.</p></speech>

Senator Wilson and other had concerns that paragraphs (a) and (b) might be unconstitutional.  Having taken advice from the draftsmen in the Attorney General's office, I can see no basis for declaring the provisions as unconstitutional.  These are standard provisions which reflect policies about the suitability of individuals to hold positions on a board.  I am informed that these provisions have been included in a number of Bills since the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 was passed.</p></speech>

The combined budget of the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Authority amounts to more than &euro;76 million.  As members of the board will be responsible for the expenditure of this significant level of Exchequer funding, I do not think it is wrong to include provisions in the Bill on the suitability of members for positions on the board.  Based on the advice I have received, I do not think any issue arises in respect of the constitutionality of these provisions.  Other legislation containing similar provisions include the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Water Services Act 2013, Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, Industrial Development Act (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) 2014, Education and Training Boards Act 2013, Local Government Reform Act 2014, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 and Shannon Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.</p></speech>

The Minister of State indicated that the advice was provided by the draftsmen in the Attorney General's office.  Was advice sought from the Attorney General rather than a draftsman or other official and, if so, did she provide a written response?  Making deals between banks and people who owe money has been a cornerstone of this Government's policy on dealing with private debt.  In 2013, the Taoiseach stated that the Government would do everything possible to ensure the banks entered into deals with those who owed money.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now the Government is saying that because deals were done or may be done, it will exclude those people from civic participation at the highest level in sport in our country.

These people will be excluded from even applying to the Minister of State or any Oireachtas committee to become a member of this new organisation. </p><p>I believe that, with or without the advice of the Attorney General, there is an issue in this regard.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#CC00300"><p>It is a great pleasure to be here for statements on Europe Day and the European Commission's work programme.  I am very grateful to the House for giving me the opportunity to contribute to these exchanges in the run up to Europe Day.</p> <p>The work programme produced by the new Commission last December, A New Start, sets out the actions the Commission intends to take this year to make a real difference for jobs, growth and investment.  President Juncker has referred to "leading an EU that is bigger and more ambitious on big things, and smaller and more modest on small things", while First Vice President Timmermans has highlighted the need to "clear the decks so political efforts are focussed on the real priorities", which are most important to the citizens of our European Union.</p> <p>There is a clear emphasis on strengthening the economic recovery that is now at last under way, but that recovery remains fragile, and a strong fit with the strategic agenda agreed by the European Council last June will be required.</p> <p>There will be 23 new initiatives in 2015, reflecting a significant streamlining of effort.  The Commission is also proposing to withdraw or modify up to 80 pending legislative proposals, and has identified further legislation that it will review and amend to make the European Union work much better for all our citizens and businesses.  First Vice President Timmermans will report within the next year on how the approach to better regulation could be further strengthened.</p> <p>Ireland is a strong supporter of the overall political emphasis that has been established by the new Commission.  It sets clear direction, prioritising what is important, simplifying what is already in place and withdrawing what is unnecessary, while repealing what is out of date.</p> <p>While welcoming the clear prioritisation of economic issues in current circumstances, we should also be clear that the emphasis on better regulation is no less important in the environmental and social policy areas.  It means striking the right balance through stronger preparations at policy design stage - well targeted measures that avoid unnecessary or disproportionate administrative burdens, and produce better outcomes for both citizens and businesses.  This is the right emphasis and it has my full support.</p> <p>At the heart of the Commission's work programme is President Juncker's investment plan, which is aiming to mobilise &euro;315 billion in net additional investments in the real economy over the next three years.  Progress here remains firmly on track.  Finance Ministers agreed a general approach in March on the draft regulation setting up the new European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI.  Negotiations are now underway with the European Parliament, which took a very positive view when President Juncker originally highlighted this initiative at the time of his election last July.  The March European Council took stock of progress and reinforced expectations for political agreement by June.</p> <p>The key focus of the Commission's proposals is essentially on getting in place quickly a pipeline of high quality projects that would otherwise be unlikely to proceed, while attracting private investors by reducing complexity and sharing risk.</p> <p>It is clear that President Juncker's investment plan cannot be a magic bullet for all of Europe's economic problems but it is also likely that it can make a significant contribution, combined with the right mix of structural, fiscal and monetary policies.  As Vice President Katainen has indicated, there is plenty of liquidity in Europe, but it is not currently being translated into investment.</p> <p>It also reflects a shared view by Governments on the important role targeted investment can play at this stage of the economic recovery.  We continue to see potential to develop synergies between the EU investment plan and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, both established by the Government last year.  These share the emphasis of the EU plan on using public resources to mobilise a stronger pipeline of private investments in the real economy.  Work towards identifying specific areas of co-operation will continue over coming months.</p> <p>We should also keep in mind the indirect benefits of the new investment plan.  A period of prolonged EU-wide economic stagnation is probably the main risk to our own economic recovery.  A boost to the wider European economic outlook is therefore an important boost for Ireland too.</p> <p>The Commission adopted its Digital Single Market Strategy yesterday, setting out 16 key actions which it will deliver by the end of next year.  These will be presented under three key pillars: simplifying access for consumers and business; creating the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish, including through data protection reform; and maximising the growth potential of the digital economy, including by developing the right standards for big data, cloud computing, and fully interoperable e-services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2320"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2320&amp;amp;pid=DaraMurphy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland supports a high level of ambition for a fully functioning digital Single Market that is open and competitive.  This is a clear win-win proposition for consumers and businesses, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  However, we must be careful that our approach is one that supports and does not undermine investment, innovation and entrepreneurship.  With Europe still facing unacceptably high levels of unemployment, most jobs are created by fast growing young firms.  Barriers to doing business digitally should, therefore, be seen as barriers to growth.</p><p>Turning to the external environment, Ireland believes the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, will bring benefits to economies on both sides of the Atlantic.  It will promote job creation, economic growth and investment.  It will be important in maintaining the strong EU-US leadership on international regulatory standards at a time when other global players are becoming more important.  Politically, it will underline on both sides of the Atlantic the continuing vital importance of the strong EU-US relationship.  The negotiations are not easy and there will be a need for give and take on both sides, but the prize on offer at the end is worth the time and intense efforts both sides are continuing to make in the negotiations.</p><p>Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m visited Dublin in March to launch the Copenhagen economics report with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the implications of the TTIP for Ireland.  It suggested the TTIP should be positive, predicting gains in the order of 1.1 % of GDP.  Other findings included the potential for increased exports of approximately 3.8%, increased imports and increases in real wages and investment.  I hope we can maintain the high level of ambition and exclude as few areas as possible, but we must remain conscious that in any negotiations there will be sensitive issues.  Beef production is one such issue for Ireland and will have to be handled carefully.  In some circles in Europe there is ongoing public debate about aspects of the TTIP such as the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  Winning this debate requires that we take part in it respectfully and openly, listen to legitimate concerns, make adjustments where necessary and challenge those making unfounded claims with the facts.</p><p>As Members will be aware, scrutiny of the European Union's business was previously centralised in the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  It is more appropriate and a considerable improvement that sectoral committees that understand the wider context into which EU legislation plays now have responsibility for the scrutiny of proposals.  Following on from recent reforms, sectoral committees set their own scrutiny priorities, focusing on the issues of most relevance to their specific areas of work and interest.  The mainstreaming of EU scrutiny with sectoral committees allows the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, under the chairmanship of Deputy Dominic Hannigan, to focus on matters concerning the strategic direction of the European Union, as well as those of a cross-cutting nature.  Some useful work has been done to date, most recently in the joint committee's examination of the implications for Ireland of a UK exit from the European Union, which is of interest to us today as voters in the United Kingdom go to the polls.  It is welcome that sectoral committees have identified proposals, both legislative and non-legislative, from the European Commission's annual work programme that they intend to subject to detailed scrutiny.  This will enable members to focus on issues and proposals that will have a lasting impact on all of our lives and demonstrates the value and importance of an effective Oireachtas scrutiny mechanism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#DD00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  It is appropriate to recognise Europe Day, which I presume is happening all over Europe.  Perhaps this morning's effort in the hall of the Oireachtas could be improved for the future and involve Members further, including the Cathaoirleach, the Leader of the House, the leader of our delegation to the Council of Europe, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, and others.  We might not give Europe Day the recognition it deserves, makes it a special day each year or recognises our involvement in the European Union and the benefits we have derived from our membership since the early 1970s.  The Leader has been actively trying to devise a method of scrutinising certain EU legislative proposals based on new developments in that regard.  I will work with him and other Senators to ensure the House, as opposed to sectoral committees, will have an opportunity to scrutinise legislation on important and strategic issues.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the European Union has been damaged by the amount of legislation and recommendations coming from the European Commission that have never been scrutinised by either House or any of their committees.  This led to the disastrous situation involving the preservation of cutaway bogs.  The issue was handled in a way that created many difficulties for Governments, farmers and bog owners and such difficulties should be avoided.  The more scrutiny of legislation there is, the more they can be avoided.</p> <p>In the European Union there is a vast area of responsibility.  The Minister of State made a point about legislative scrutiny.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine held 12 meetings, considered 53 proposals and referred five for further scrutiny, while the remainder were deemed not to warrant further scrutiny.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection held five meetings; the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht , six; the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, eight; the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, 11; the Joint Committee on Health and Children, three; the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, 13; the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, eight; and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, seven.  The level of scrutiny is higher than it ever was.</p> <p>I compliment Deputy Dominic Hannigan, Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am a member, on his leadership in dealing with the referendum on the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Some of these issues will be resolved tomorrow or late tonight after the votes have been counted and the new British Government has been formed.  One of the leading parties has promoted the holding of a referendum in two years time, which is causing uncertainty and difficulty for everyone involved, particularly us.  If the United Kingdom were to withdraw from the European union, Ireland would be the most affected, especially given the work that has been done in the North via the Good Friday Agreement, the committees that have been formed and the joint efforts in promoting tourism, Waterways Ireland, etc.  These wonderful efforts might need to be renegotiated, given the fact that the Republic of Ireland would be in the European Union, while Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom would be under British rule.  These issues are of great concern.  I accompanied the Chairman, Deputy Dominic Hannigan, and other committee members to London recently to discuss with British MPs and others the implications for both countries.  Ireland cannot stand idly by if the referendum is held.  We would have a role to play and become deeply involved because of the implications for the Republic.  In the meantime, the uncertainty has had a small benefit.  American multinationals are not comfortable in making major investments in the United Kingdom if there is a possibility that it will withdraw from the European Union.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a practical proposition.  When we spoke to members of committees there, they did not seem to be aware of the implications of withdrawing from the European Union, with its 450 million customers.  The car industry would be in great jeopardy because of the imposition of taxes, but we will all know more about it in the next 24 hours.</p><p>We heard a submission today at the committee meeting from the National Youth Action Group which gave a very good and comprehensive report on the attitudes of young people.  They argue that there is not enough in the schools system about the benefits of European membership and on how the European Union works.  The Minister of State might consider this in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills.  Programmes, including history modules, should emphasise the benefits of EU membership.  I heard a very good submission from Ms Liz Wall, national president of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  Her organisation has put forward a most positive point about the European Union and her submission will be considered by the committee in due course.  It was heartening to hear somebody who represented 10,000 women in Ireland expressing a very positive view based on the work she had carried out.  Ms Maureen Kavanagh made a very interesting contribution today on older people in the European Union.  Although people aged 55 years are not old, she indicated that this generation had strong memories of Ireland before accession.  The post-colonial inward focus before accession to the European Economic Community meant that Ireland was an unequal and unfair society.  The people concerned are absolutely satisfied with what has been achieved through EU membership.  Measures that discriminated against women were lifted after we became a member of the European Union.</p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State and wish him a happy Europe Day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I concur with Senator Terry Leyden who, in fairness, is a very enthusiastic member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and a big promoter of the European Union for Fianna F&aacute;il.  I agree with his comments on Europe Day, which could be embraced a little more in the House in a positive way.  I know that it is difficult to generate enthusiasm, not least among the media, about the European Union, but it would be good if we could make more of a deal of it in the House.</p><p>Europe Day offers us the opportunity to discuss many issues relating to the European Union, including the challenges and opportunities we face, as well as the work programme, to which the Minister of State alluded.  There can be no question that citizens expect the European Union to make a difference on the big societal changes we face, whether economic or social, such as unemployment and competitiveness.  However, if we distil the broader ideas into narrower, more easily defined concepts, it often provokes a more favourable response from people in their attitudes towards the European Union.  The termination of mobile phone roaming charges and the Youth Guarantee are two specific policy objectives which show that the European Union has a direct and positive impact on the lives of its citizens.</p><p>When reflecting on Europe Day, it is worthwhile looking back to the position we were in when we joined the European Economic Community 41 years ago in 1973 to get the full context.  Since 1973 we have seen both Ireland and the European Union make unprecedented progress in economic and social matters.  We must not forget that it has been the single most successful peace project of all time.  In this Government term we held the EU Presidency for the seventh time.  We have held the Presidency during key periods in the European Union's history - when the Berlin Wall fell, when Ireland facilitated the reunification of Germany within the European Union when others hesitated, and in 2004 when the biggest expansion of the Union took place with the addition of ten new member states.  Each time we have held the position, we have served wider Community interests.  There were significant achievements on the budget, in banking, fisheries policy, dealing with the issue of youth employment and advancing a new trade and investment partnership with the United States.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's comments on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which will be extremely positive in the context of investment and growth between the United States and the European Union.  Irish politicians, diplomats and civil servants are doing a professional job at all levels across the European Union.  Our reputation has been hard fought for but well maintained.</p><p>The Ireland of 1973 was a very different place from the Ireland of today.  There has been phenomenal economic, social and political change in Ireland in the past 42 years in which our membership of the European Union was a crucial catalyst.  In 1973 EU membership seemed to promise us many things, including access to a larger market, greater export opportunities for business, more employment, better wages and the removal of protectionist barriers.  At the time of accession, Ireland's gross domestic product, GDP, was two thirds of the EU average, but now it is a third higher.  In 1972 the net benefit to Ireland of EU contributions was &euro;41.4 million, or 1.2% of GDP; in 1992 the net benefit was &euro;2.08 billion or 5.5% of GDP, while in 2004 it was &euro;1.59 billion or 1.3% of GDP.  In total, in the past 40 years the net benefit to Ireland has been in excess of &euro;20 billion in cash from the European Union.  The value of exports has increased from $1.1 billion in 1973 to $110 billion, while GDP has grown four times over.  As such, when we reflect on Europe Day, we must reflect on these positive achievements during the years.</p><p>Similarly, when we look to the future, we must admit that the European Union is in a period of rapid transition, as Senator Terry Leyden mentioned.  We have learned a great many lessons from our membership, not least that compromise is necessary and that strong representation and diplomatic links throughout the European Union are vital in order to succeed.  The &quot;Brexit&quot; and &quot;Grexit&quot;, as the possible exits from the European Union of Britain and Greece are called, pose dilemmas that the Union has never faced before and the year ahead could yet be a defining one.  As the Minister of State said, today will be interesting in terms of whether the United Kingdom will remain in the European Union.  Nevertheless, the ordinary work of the Commission must continue and we must ensure the European Union will work to provide solutions for citizens through initiatives such as the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>When the Commission adopted its work programme for 2015, it set out the actions it intended to take this year to make a real difference in terms of job creation, growth and investment to bring concrete benefits for citizens.  The intentions are clear and the 2015 programme includes the delivery of<i></i>the announced investment plan, opening up the opportunities of the digital single market for citizens and business, launching the European energy union and putting forward a new, balanced European agenda on migration, as mentioned by the Minister of State.  If we look further at the details of these proposals, we find an ambitious agenda for the year, specifically the investment plan for Europe which will see an unlocking of public and private investments in the real economy of at least &euro;315 billion in the next three years.  In addition, an ambitious digital single market package should create the conditions for a vibrant digital economy and society by complementing the telecommunications regulatory environment and modernising copyright rules.  I know that the Minister of State has done much work in the area of data protection.  In addition, we have taken the first steps towards a European energy union.  This is a vital proposal to ensure energy supply security, further integrate national energy markets, reduce European energy demand and decarbonise the energy mix.  This will be important for Ireland in the years ahead.</p><p>All told, while we reflect on Europe Day, the challenges posed by talk of both a potential British and Greek exit, as well as the work of the Commission in the year ahead, we can be sure Ireland's best interest will best be preserved when we work at the heart of a strong European Union.  That is why the Government has worked to ensure we have strong representation in the European Parliament and that we put our best foot forward with a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs who has ensured a vital link between the Cabinet and our European partners, while also working to attract inward investment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has shown a capacity to influence the debate and build relationships with key decision-makers.  Its negotiations with the ECB, the IMF and other international organisations are an abject lesson in the value of hard work, persistence and determination.  They are in stark contrast to the diplomacy practised by other countries in recent negotiations.</p><p>The lessons learned from Ireland's membership of the EU have been many and varied.  The one lesson, however, is that it has been a good thing for Ireland, our citizens, businesses large and small, exporters and consumers.  Above all else, it has ensured our rights throughout the EU.  That is what we should remember when we reflect on Europe Day and what the Europe of 2015 offers to our citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#FF00200"><p>I thank Senator van Turnhout for allowing me to speak before her.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, and I am delighted to hear what he had to say.</p><p>Senator Noone referred to 1973, but I will go back to 1958 when I had just finished in university.  On the following day I went to the Continent and spent the winter there.  I came back from that winter believing for the first time that there was a thing called Europe.  We never heard of it back in the 1950s and had not even recognised Europe.  At around that time, or shortly afterwards, President de Gaulle said &quot;Non&quot; - he did not want Britain or Ireland coming into the Common Market.  We did come in at a later stage, however.</p><p>Later on I became the president of Euro Commerce, which represents all the retail and wholesale trades in Europe.  I was president for three years and vice president for a further three years.  In those days, that body represented 27 countries, not 28.  It was a real reminder of the opportunities we have.</p><p>The Minister of State spoke about the digital Single Market and the 16 key actions that will be taken, which is a reminder of what can be done on this basis.  As a European I am excited about what we can achieve.  Rather than covering some of the areas that will be mentioned in this debate, I will touch on one or two others.  We should be having more debates on the EU itself.  Currently there are several prominent issues to the fore to which we are not paying attention.</p><p>Two of the great successes of the EU, free movement and the creation of a common currency, are being severely undermined.  First, we must discuss the plight of emigrants who try to reach the EU.  Some EU member states, such as Italy, Malta and Greece, are bearing most of the responsibility for illegal migrants.  It is estimated that 50% of illegal migrants end up in Greece because it is the first EU country they reach.  We are spared this due to our location, but we cannot turn a blind eye to it.  We spoke about this the other day when it was announced that the <i>LE Eithne</i>would sail to the Mediterranean.  That vessel will rescue people who are in danger of drowning and then leave them on the shores of Italy and Malta.  I could well imagine Malta, Greece and Italy saying: &quot;Hold it.  Why should we have to burden ourselves with all these immigrants that are coming?&quot;  In the context of discussions on how Europe treats the so-called boat people, I think we have a moral obligation to take more of these people who are fleeing from terrible conflicts, such as the one going on in Syria.</p><p>I will quote from a recent article in <i>The Economist, </i>which stated that<blockquote>Generous countries like Sweden and Germany want others to take up the slack: two-thirds of migrants end up in just five EU countries, according to [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel ... The countries on the front line, like Italy and Malta, want the task of processing asylum-seekers to be redistributed.  Everyone accepts that the Dublin regulation, according to which asylum-seekers should be dispatched to their European country of entry for processing, is a failure.</blockquote>I do not think that regulation is working, so we must find a solution.  I would be interested to know the Minister of State's view on Ireland's role in that particular area.</p><p>Unfortunately, the plight of people in the Ukraine is not getting the attention it needs, yet they are an immediate neighbour of the EU's.  It has been reported that aid organisations are advised not to give families in the rebel zones in the Ukraine the &euro;268 cash assistance to which they are entitled for fear of driving up inflation.  People there rely increasingly on small parcels of food and other products donated from private individuals.  That is a real concern.  Perhaps Ireland could play a greater role through Irish Aid and its world-renowned NGOs to help those suffering on Europe's doorstep.</p><p>As a business person, I would like to see more research on the cost of EU legislation to Ireland through a detailed audit.  Germany's Better Regulation Council says that at least half, if not 60%, of the regulatory costs for businesses is generated by EU legislation.  It is easy for MEPs and EU officials in Brussels to pass legislation and for that to be transposed into Irish legislation, which can have a massive effect on SMEs.  In this respect, I was glad to read last week that there has been a proposal at EU level that any new laws adopted by the EU will have to be approved by an independent scrutiny panel to make sure they do not impose unnecessary burdens on businesses before they can be tabled.  This is according to a leaked document from the European Commission.  I hope this is true, as similar proposals in the past have not happened.  This is something Ireland could push for at EU level.</p><p>Other speakers have referred to the possible implications of an UK exit from the EU, and Northern Ireland's corporation tax rate.  One of the most important questions we must consider is what would happen if the UK leaves the European Union, the so-called BrExit.  We will know more about that tonight because if the Conservatives win the election, they have promised a referendum on that issue.  The BrExit is inextricably linked to the outcome of the UK general election, so we need to prepare ourselves for all eventualities.  It is amazing to consider that each week there is &euro;1 billion worth of trade between both countries, supporting about 400,000 jobs.  There is no getting away from the fact that we are the UK's largest trading partner.</p><p>A new report by the German think tank Bertelsmann-Stiftung,<i></i>examined three possible scenarios under which the UK could leave the European Union: one, a so-called soft exit whereby the UK secures a trade agreement and status comparable to that of Norway and Switzerland; two, a deep cut, where the UK enjoys a trading status equivalent to that between the EU and the United States; and three, isolation.  Under the best case scenario, the Irish economy would contract by at least 0.8%, which is incredible.  They say, however, that we would suffer an even bigger economic hit of 2.7% if the UK was unable to agree an EU trade deal.  This is the sort of study that we should be doing ourselves.  I urge the Government to consider what we should be doing.</p><p>We should also consider the plan that Northern Ireland has to reduce its corporation tax to 12.5% to match the rate here.  The rate is currently 20% in the UK, so I wonder how much foreign investment and jobs we are likely to lose if that goes ahead.  Do we have any figures on this and, if not, is it possible to get them?</p><p>I am delighted the Minister of State has attended the House on Europe Day.  It gives us an opportunity to discuss these items.  Having listened to Senators Leyden and Noone, I believe they are on top of what is happening.  However, I do not think we are giving the matter enough attention in general in Ireland.  We should do so in future.  I know the Minister of State's heart is in the right place in this regard.</p></speech>

I am also glad of the opportunity to discuss this matter.  I have a special affiliation with Europe having run as a candidate in last year's European Parliament elections.</p> <p>I would like to begin by highlighting that Europe Day, on 9 May, will mark 65 years since the then French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, presented his proposal on the creation of an organised Europe.  It was designed to ensure peaceful accords between European countries after the horrors of the first half of the 20th century.  The proposal, now known as the Schuman Declaration, is widely regarded to be the act that created what is now the European Union.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2385"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2385&amp;amp;pid=LorraineHiggins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With celebrations for Europe Day being prepared across the EU, it is important to reflect on the significance of this day for Ireland and for all member states.  One of the central themes in this year's celebrations is the European Year of Development, a field in which the EU institutions do a large amount of work supporting and initiating key projects in development aid and the fight against poverty.</p><p>We only have to look at the investment that has taken place here in Ireland since our joining of the then EEC in 1973 to see the dramatic changes our membership of the EU has brought, in everything from roads infrastructure to equality legislation.  This investment continues, to the direct benefit of citizens across member states and here in Ireland.  As an example, in my capacity as a Galway East-based Senator, I was delighted to learn recently that a new primary care centre will be developed for the town of Tuam, as part of a project to build 14 primary care centres nationwide.  This project will be one of the first to receive pre-financing under the Juncker Commission's new investment plan for Europe.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, and the European Investment Fund, EIF, have agreed to fund up to &euro;70 million of the construction costs.  Such funding supports are crucial and bring a myriad of benefits to Irish citizens, including short and long-term employment and the provision of quality, community-based health care services.</p><p>The European Commission's work plan for 2015 reflects the concerns of the modern democracies which are at the heart of the European project.  The plan for the next 12 months is mindful of citizens' concerns about major issues such as employment and economic stability and their desire to see greater transparency in how Europe conducts its affairs.  The 2015 plan sets out ambitious targets for the year ahead, not least of which is a funding allocation of &euro;315 billion over the next three years for economic investment to the benefit of Europe.</p><p>Here in Ireland, we enjoy a robust technological and digital sector.  For many of our citizens, the lnternet is a core part of their lives and in many cases, their livelihoods.  Therefore, the Commission's desire to develop an digital single market package is most welcome.  I commend the Commission for its intent to create the conditions for a thriving digital economy and society by complementing the telecommunications regulatory environment, modernising copyright rules, simplifying rules for consumers making online and digital purchases, enhancing cyber-security and mainstreaming digitalisation.  There is no doubt that citizens, as private individuals and as consumers, need better protections online, as do producers of copyrighted material.  I am heartened to see the Commission recognises the lacunae that need to be addressed and I will be watching these developments closely, especially in relation to those which involve tackling cyber crime that takes place across borders.  This is not an easy task given the nature of digital technologies and how swiftly they are evolving.  Nevertheless, tackling such issues is vital and I hope Ireland, as a member state and a country with many of the world's biggest tech names on its doorstep, can make a significant contribution to the Commission's work in this area.</p><p>Globally, we are experiencing levels of inequality not seen since the nineteenth century.  Such inequality threatens our economic stability and can, as history has repeatedly shown, lead to serious civil unrest.  Key to delivering fairer societies is the redistribution of capital through the tax system.  That is why I welcome the Commission's commitment over the next 12 months to a fairer approach to taxation.  Beginning with an action plan on efforts to combat tax evasion and tax fraud, it will include a communication on a renewed approach for corporate taxation in the single market in the light of global developments.</p><p>The action plan will also, as stated, "Starting from the work done on base erosion and profit shifting at OECD and G20 levels . . . [include] . . . measures at EU level in order to move to a system on the basis of which the country where profits are generated is also the country of taxation, including in the digital economy".  The Commission will aim at a stabilising corporate tax base in the EU for a fair taxation environment, including re-launching work towards a common consolidated corporate tax base.  Such proposals will hopefully lead us to a much more level playing field, where those who make huge profits play their part in ensuring our societies remain fair, stable and progressive.</p><p>I wish all the Members a very happy Europe Day, 2015 in advance of 9 May.  I hope all citizens and member states celebrate the day in the spirit of our union which was born out of a longing to ensure peace, prosperity and a bright future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#GG00200"><p>It is very important that we mark Europe Day on Saturday.  The challenge for all of us will be whether we are willing to discuss Europe with those around us because we all have a responsibility and a role in that discussion.  I thank the Leader, Senator Cummins, who has been very good at facilitating and encouraging us to get more involved and active on the issue of the EU and its importance in our lives and those of the people we represent.  I thank him also for organising a recent briefing with the European Commission representation in Ireland, with Barbara Nolan and Jonathan Claridge.  It was an excellent briefing and it is a pity more Senators did not turn up.  I hope next time we can encourage more to come along.</p> <p>It is good to see sentiment is rising, according to the latest Eurobarometer polls, in November 2014.  Trust is rising, which is positive.  The EU has taken some very positive measures to deal with youth unemployment.  We have seen, across Europe but particularly in Ireland how young people are disproportionately impacted by a recession through losing jobs and having to emigrate.  What statistics are available to demonstrate the success or failure of the youth employment initiative?  We hail big flagship projects but how do we, as Senators and parliamentarians, demonstrate to the public that it is worth this investment, the initiatives are working and we are able to use the experience?  I appreciate what the Commission Vice-President Timmermans is doing in trying to reduce the number of initiatives.  It is very positive but part of me wonders what the Parliament will do with all the extra time it will have without the Commission producing initiatives.  We may have to move to implementation.  That will be very tough for member states because we will have to stop coming up with lots of new ideas and get down to the gritty work of implementing what is happening at an EU level.</p> <p>In respect of the work that will happen to lighten the regulatory burden it is very important that we hear from small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, and civil society organisations across the sector.  We can all say how important it is to lighten the regulatory burden but how we do it is also important.</p> <p>Ireland has to play a very active role in respect of the possible UK in-out referendum.  I am very encouraged by the fact that the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all other players in the Government have taken on a role in that referendum.  Ireland will not stay silent on an issue of such importance to the EU and to our closest neighbours, the UK.  It most definitely will have ramifications for us, mostly negative.</p> <p>The lack of an EU immigration policy is an issue.  We can say what we want about the United States, US, but it has very clear immigration rules and one can apply to go there.  The EU cannot get its head around it.  In certain member states there is rising sentiment, stimulated by the lack of EU leadership on the issue.  We think that if we just put up the borders people will not come.  If I have a choice between certain death and probable death I will take probable death.  That is why people are getting on boats.  We have to wake up.  Being part of the EU is part of our values.  We sing about the respect for human dignity, liberty, equality or human rights but when it comes to people who are not EU citizens do we, all of a sudden, throw the values into the Mediterranean as well?  Member states have to take this issue more seriously.  We should not call them migrants, they are individuals just like any of us and if I was in their situation I would get on that boat.  We all have to know we would do that if we were facing certain death in the situations they are fleeing.  The EU has a responsibility and a role on the world stage. </p> <p>The digital single market and the fact that we could create up to &euro;340 billion of additional growth in Europe over the next ten years is very exciting.  I hope Ireland will maximise its slice of that pie.  It is well-placed in respect of that market.  I am also very heartened to see that within the development of that policy the EU is considering child protection issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> An issue on which I wrote a report and had great support from Members on all sides of the House is child abuse material.  I was heartened to read on the Commission's website that it is considering having a system of filtering child abuse material in the absence of us not having an effective system to remove child abuse images.  It will look at doing that at a European Union level.  It is happening in the United Kingdom.  In Ireland, UPC and the mobile phone operators have brought in such a system, but it is voluntary rather than us saying these images should be blocked.  There are very good reasons we need to do that.  Twenty-seven per cent of women in the EU, not in Africa or some other country, have experienced some form of physical violence before the age of 15.  We must step up what we are doing on the issue of child protection and children's rights.</p><p>We know that approximately 16% of the victims of trafficking registered by EU member states are children.  We know that violence is still relatively hidden and under-reported, with 90% of all abuse undetected, according to the World Health Organisation.  That ranges from issues such as child sexual abuse and exploitation to bullying and cyberbullying.</p><p>In terms of these statements, I know we look at the area from a business and jobs perspective but we must ensure that we also use the children's rights lens when we are looking at those issues.</p><p>I refer to an excellent reflection paper the EU produced yesterday on the 9th European Forum on the Rights of the Child - co-ordination and co-operation in integrated child protection systems.  I am disheartened to see that 25 EU member states are parties to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland are the only three countries in the EU that have not signed up to that convention.  It is something we need to examine.  I believe the capacity legislation may be the blocking mechanism for us.  We always say that Ireland plays our role in that regard but when we look at the implementation issues, we are not as good.  We need to focus on that issue and consider how we are implementing and upholding our responsibilities as EU citizens, whether here in Ireland, within the European borders or on the world stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-05-07a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015050700002#HH00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, to the House to discuss Europe Day, which we will celebrate on Saturday, and the European Commission's 2015 work programme.  As Senator van Turnhout mentioned, I invited Ms Barbara Nolan, Head of the European Commission Representation in Ireland, here last week where Senators had the opportunity to discuss the Commission's 2015 work programme, including Ireland's priorities for the coming year.  At that briefing Ms Nolan detailed the Commission's announcement at the end of last year and referred to it as a "new start", reflected in the Commission's determination to ensure it works better, is more open and more democratic.</p> <p>The new approach by the Commission was flagged by President Juncker at the European Parliament in 2014, when he outlined ten political priorities on which the new Commission's mandate to 2019 would be based.  Ms Nolan reiterated the Commission's commitment to initiatives upon which it can deliver, and actions it will take in 2015.</p> <p>The work programme for 2015 sets out 23 new initiatives, which are grouped under ten political priorities.  The 23 new initiatives for 2015 will be in addition to the many actions already agreed over the past years including the European Semester, Structural Funds commitments and monitoring the application of EU law, to name a few.</p> <p>President Juncker and the Commission are also committed to cutting red tape and improving existing legislation during its mandate, essentially lightening the regulatory burden and ensuring existing EU legislation is fit for purpose, something Senator Quinn and all involved in business will welcome.</p> <p>I invited Members of the House to pick three priorities from the initiatives in the Commission's work programme.  The first they chose was item 2, which was promoting integration and employability in the labour market.  This initiative to promote labour integration and employability will include a package of measures to support member states in getting people, especially the longer-term unemployed and younger people, into work and developing a skilled workforce.  This will include measures to follow up on the implementation of the youth employment initiative, a proposal for a Council recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed, which should be adopted by mid-July or September, as well as measures to promote skills development which will be launched later this year or early next year by the Commission.</p> <p>Linked to that is the investment plan which is intended to kick-start investment, jobs and growth in Europe.  The new &euro;315 billion plan was developed in close co-operation with the European Investment Bank.  Implementing this plan is the top priority for 2015, and is an area where the Commission is looking forward to working closely with the Irish authorities.</p> <p>It is worth noting that funding has already started to flow from the new investment fund, as Senator Higgins mentioned.  An Irish project for constructing 14 new primary health care centres was one of the first projects to be funded under this initiative.</p> <p>The Members also chose item 5, which is the strategic framework for energy union.  This project was launched by the Commission in February of this year and sets out a strategy for sustainable, secure and affordable energy in Europe.  The focus is on energy supply security; integration of national energy markets, including the issue of interconnectors, which is relevant to Ireland; reduction in European energy demand; and decarbonising the energy mix and promoting research and innovation in the energy field.</p> <p>One startling figure to be aware of is that the EU is the largest energy importer in the world, importing 53% of its energy.  As this is such a major topic I hope to organise another briefing session for Members with an energy expert from Commission headquarters on the energy union strategic framework very soon.</p> <p>The third items the Members chose was the Internal Market strategy for goods and services.  The Commission's Internal Market strategy will aim to deliver a renewed and integrated approach for the Single Market, deliver further integration, and improve mutual recognition and standardisation in key industrial and services sectors where the economic potential is greatest, for example, business services, construction, retail, regulated professions, advanced manufacturing and combined services-goods provision.  A particular focus will be on small and medium enterprises, SME.</p> <p>Linked to item 7 is the Commission initiative to create a capital markets union which has the potential to be a huge benefit for consumers, businesses and communities.  The proposed capital markets union would improve access to financing; increase and diversify the sources of funding; and make markets work more effectively.</p> <p>The role of national parliaments in taking forward the Commission's work programme is an important one, and the Seanad can have a significant impact on the scrutiny of EU legislation and the work programme.  The Commission has been clear on the need to deepen the existing political dialogue with national parliaments and it is now time for the Seanad, with the co-operation of the European Commission representation office, to help build this close co-operation with the Seanad and the joint Oireachtas committees.</p> <p>I can assure the Minister of State that we have no intention in this House to duplicate what is happening in any of the committees but I know the Government fully supports the recommendation of the Seanad reform group that this House should have a greater role in EU policy, and the EU work programme in particular.  We need to engage more in European affairs because there is a disengagement on the part of the people with Europe, and we should lead on that.</p> <p>In the coming months we hope to have a number of Commissioners address the House.  We intend to have debates on the three items from the EU work programme I mentioned, and I am sure the Minister of State will be present for some of those debates.  I thank him for coming to the House.  It has been a fruitful debate as we look forward to celebrating Europe Day on Saturday next.</p></speech>

The main benefit of Europe Day is that it gives people an opportunity to think about Europe and how important it is in our lives.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout suggested that on Saturday people might take the time to engage with friends and family and talk about the European union.  Naturally, much of the time we talk about the Union, we think about the economic and regulatory requirements and difficulties it presents.  However, since its inception and since Schuman made the moves to set it up many decades ago, the European Union has been a remarkable force for good for the people of Europe and Ireland.  We have benefitted enormously from it, whether economically or, as Senator Leyden mentioned, through the changes that have come about here, particularly changes affecting women and how our society functions.</p><p>From time to time we need to take stock of what existed in Europe before the EEC or the European Union came to save a Continent that had settled its differences over hundreds of years through strife, war and violence.  As Senator Noone said, the fundamental reason we have the European Union is that Europe required a peace process.  It is for that reason there has been significant reference here today to the election that is taking place as we speak in the United Kingdom.  The outcome of that election is important.  Membership, involvement and engagement within the European Union of our close friends and colleagues in the United Kingdom are a matter of national importance to us.  That is why the Government, with the support of the Opposition, has been very blunt and forthright in saying that we want and will encourage the United Kingdom, under whatever government comes about and whether or not there is a referendum, to remain an active member of the European Union.  That is in our economic interest and in the interest of not only the European Union but of Europe.  The United Kingdom will always be an important part of Europe and we believe it should remain a member and work within the European Union.</p><p>The crisis in the Mediterranean was highlighted in our debate this afternoon and Members are aware the Government has committed the services of the <i>LE Eithne</i>to assist in rescue operations there.  We have also committed funding to the operation, targeted specifically at those refugees most affected.  We are also playing a significant part in taking in refugees here.</p><p>I do not have specific figures to hand on youth unemployment and the direct effect of the Youth Guarantee, but I will forward them to the Senator.  We are glad to see a significant reduction in youth unemployment.  In any economic crisis, it is generally young people who are most affected and who are required to leave our shores due to their inability to find work.  This is the reason we need new initiatives, such as TTIP,  the ambitious Juncker package or other fiscal measures.  We have seen these develop, though perhaps quite late in the process.  However, under the new Commission and under the new presidency of the Central Bank, we now see a European Union that is functioning well and is starting to tackle many of the social and economic issues.</p><p>This is an opportunity for us to consider the position and to encourage and demand of Europe that it be ambitious for our people.  We are ambitious for Europe, but we have also seen and will continue to see great benefits here.  Given our population, Ireland has always played a disproportionately significant and strong and active role as a member of the European Union.  I compliment the bipartisan approach seen here, particularly in the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  While there is much that divides us politically, by and large Ireland's membership and strong support of the Union unites us politically.  Long may that continue.</p></speech>
