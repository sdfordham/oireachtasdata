The Minister is welcome and I thank him for his attendance.</p> <p>I refer to phase 3 of a project to remove bad bends on the N2, the Dublin to Derry road, along the stretch from Monaghan town to Emyvale.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2017, Transport Infrastructure Ireland allocated &euro;600,000 towards this project, which will be phase 3 up as far as Emyvale village.  Unfortunately, this will not allow Monaghan County Council to go to tender, which is very disappointing as the council is ready to go with its documentation and all it needs is the go-ahead from Transport Infrastructure Ireland to do so.  </p><p>As the Minister is aware, the N2 is a particularly busy stretch of road way.  It takes traffic from Donegal, Derry and Tyrone to Dublin so it takes all the North-South and South-North traffic on a daily basis and the numbers are very high.  There are many dangerous bends and corners that need to be removed.  It is a small enough project as it is only 3.5 km long.  It is slightly ironic that we are discussing this stretch of road way this afternoon.  I am disappointed and very saddened to report to the House that before lunch time, I learned of a fatality on this stretch of road.  I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the family involved.  It is a very dangerous stretch of road and the corners need to be removed as a matter of urgency.  I ask that a fund be made available to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and that the Minister consider allocating funding so that this job can move to tender.  Failing that, I would ask the Minister to give a commitment to the House this afternoon that this road will be committed to in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020700002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this very important issue.  I was not aware of the fatality to which he referred but I join him in expressing my sympathy to the families involved in yet another tragedy on our roads.  It is particularly sad considering that the Senator is talking about the safety aspects of this road, a subject underlined by this tragedy.  The dangerous aspect of this road will be a factor when consideration is given to any changes to be made.</p> <p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects such as the N2 is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  The Government's capital investment plan, which is entitled Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment, provides the strategic and financial framework for TII's national roads programme for the period from 2016 to 2021.  As Minister,.I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan.  </p> <p>In planning the construction schedule for individual projects, TII must also to take account of the annual budgets available.  The focus of TII's activities during the coming years is, accordingly, being centred on the progression of the major national road schemes that were identified for development during the period of the Government's investment plan.  In this regard, the proposed N2 Slane bypass has been included in the plan among those schemes that are planned to commence during the period subject to necessary approvals.  Funding totalling &euro;1.2 million has been provided by TII in 2017 to prepare a new design for the scheme.  Within the available finding, I understand TII is hoping to progress minor road improvement schemes on the N2 during the period of the plan.  These schemes involve the realignment and-or widening of the existing single carriageway road and include the N2 Monaghan to Emyvale Improvement phase 3 scheme where land acquisition and finalisation of tender documentation is ongoing. In addition, road pavement overlay and safety schemes were completed on the N2 in 2016, including sections of the route at Balrenny to Knockmooney in County Meath and Emyvale village in County Monaghan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Safety works at Blakestown Cross in County Louth are anticipated for completion in February 2017.  TII also advises that Monaghan County Council appointed consultants last year to review the safety aspects of the existing N2 between Ardee and Monaghan.  The findings of this review are being examined.</p><p>On the safety issue, because today, sadly, it is so topical and important, last year Monaghan County Council appointed consultants to report on safety on the N2 between Ardee and Monaghan.  The short-term measures outlined have been identified and I will provide the table.  These proposals must go before Monaghan County Council for approval.  Until approval is received no works can proceed at these locations.  The focus at present is to get the short-term proposals under way before medium or long-term proposals can be delivered.</p></speech>

As he has outlined, we have a serious problem on the stretch of roadway from Ardee to the Border.  Unfortunately, fatalities occur there too often.  It is ironic and sad that as we discuss this issue there was a fatality earlier this morning.  It highlights the urgency attached to this particular stretch of roadway.  I do not know the number of fatalities, but over the past two years the number of fatalities on this stretch of roadway is way above the national norm.  This is something we should treat as a matter of urgency.  I urge the Minister to focus his efforts and those of the Department on this, so something can be done with this stretch of roadway to ensure the citizens who travel on it can do so in a safe manner.</p></speech>

The building used was an RIC barracks which was burned down during the Civil War and refurbished.  It is totally out of date.  It has no showers, changing rooms, interview rooms or wheelchair access.  In May 2010, an advertisement was placed in the newspapers looking for a suitable site.  I understand one was identified but no progress has been made since.  I understand there was litigation on the matter, but I am not sure why.</p> <p>The population in the area is 17,000 and moving towards 20,000.  It is not satisfactory that there is no Garda station for a population of this size.  It is in this context I request to know the up-to-date situation.  When is it likely a site will be identified?  When is it likely tenders will be invited to build a new station for the area?  It is extremely important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The area, being on the outskirts of Cork city, will continue to grow and it has a very young population.  Therefore, it is very important that a new station be put in place at the earliest possible date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-02-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017020700002#D00200"><p>On behalf of the Minister, who, unfortunately, cannot be here, I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  He has a keen interest in justice and equality.  He will appreciate that the programme for the replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation the OPW, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  This includes identifying and progressing any necessary new builds and any remedial or refurbishment works required at individual stations.  The Minister has no direct role in these matters.  The Minister, however, has been informed by the Garda authorities that the proposed site for the new Garda station in Glanmire has been the subject of legal proceedings, which were settled towards the end of 2016.  I understand that the Garda and OPW are working very closely to progress the development as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the proposed Glanmire station forms part of the Garda station building and refurbishment programme for the period 2016 to 2021, which makes provision for the major refurbishment of stations and facilities, including facilities for meeting victims of crime; essential remedial works to existing stations; the development of large-scale property and exhibit-management stores; the upgrading of cells; and the provision of improved custody management facilities.</p> <p>Under the programme, in addition to the proposed Glanmire station, new stations will be provided in Bailieborough, Sligo, Macroom and Clonmel.  This is in addition to the new divisional headquarters in Dublin and Wexford, as well as a new regional  headquarters in Galway, whose development is currently under way at a cost of over &euro;100 million and which are expected to be completed in 2017.  Of course, these measures cannot be viewed in isolation from the Government's overarching commitment to ensuring a strong and viable police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this, the Senator will be aware that, in July 2016, the Government approved the Minister's proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In addition, the Government's capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021 provides some &euro;205 million for investment in Garda ICT infrastructure and &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet.  Taken together, the above measures reinforce the Government's commitment to enabling significant reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to providing a high-profile and visible policing service for our communities.</p></speech>

It is now 2017 and I am concerned that seven years have been lost.  As I outlined, there is a growing population and a totally inapt Garda station.  Could any commitment be given to prioritise the works in view the seven-year delay?  I am glad to hear the position on the legal proceedings.  I am surprised a process such as this took six years to conclude.  I am glad, after the time lost, that we can now fast-track the development and accord to it priority in a schedule of work.</p></speech>

He has made his points very well.  There is a high degree of urbanisation in the general area in question and people need to feel safe in their own community.  I regret that legal proceedings held up progress for five or six years but the matter was resolved just before Christmas.  I hope there will be further progress and, of course, I will relay the Senator's concerns to the Minister.</p></speech>

It is timely that this Commencement matter is being heard today after last night's programme on RTE.  I commend RTE on the programme and on highlighting what all of us know has been happening for many years, which is that people are suffering in pain while they wait for vital treatment.  I hope the focus on the issue in the RTE programme will provoke consciousness among those making decisions in this area.  This morning the Minister said it was unacceptable and it is certainly unacceptable to those waiting in pain.  It is also unacceptable for those waiting in pain every day for physiotherapy services.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the numerous representations I receive from parents all over County Mayo, I was prompted to raise this case by a particular woman in the county.  She is called Karen and she has an eight year old son, Jack, who has cerebral palsy.  Four years ago Jack had surgery, without which he was facing life in a wheelchair.  It was not available in Ireland so he had it in the United States after fund-raising &euro;70,000 in the local community.  On returning, and on the advice of doctors in the US, Jack began a physiotherapy programme at First Step therapy in Patrickswell in County Limerick, the only place other than D&uacute;n Laoghaire where this particular physiotherapy, called spider cage and lokomat therapy, was available.  The complex surgery that was carried out in the USA requires this specific type of physiotherapy in order to get maximum benefits.  The therapy that Jack receives through the HSE is just 45 minutes, twice a month, which is inadequate in terms of both the amount he needs and the type of physiotherapy he requires.  The therapy is paid for entirely by the family with no support from the HSE.  He attends this centre every second weekend for two hours, on a Friday evening and again on a Saturday morning, and all of it is self-funded with Karen footing the cost for the diesel and fund-raising for the cost of accommodation and the therapy itself.  This works out at between &euro;400 and &euro;500 for each trip.  Why should parents like Karen have to depend on charity fund-raising to provide this vital treatment to keep her son from being wheelchair bound?  Without the follow-up care the surgery becomes less and less effective.  The physiotherapy is not an optional extra but essential for Jack to have any quality of life to alleviate his pain.  </p> <p>I have travelled to Limerick with Karen and Jack to see the great work being done by the First Step rehabilitation centre, which was opened several years ago by then Minister for Health, Mary Harney.  I am asking for two things from the Minister today.  Jack is not the only person in this situation and I am only using him as an example of what children have to go through when they do not have this vital physiotherapy available to them in their local areas, by which I do not mean their own parish or county but their region.  Is it possible for the HSE to put in place a funding mechanism that would help Karen and other families pay for travel, accommodation and the therapy which is needed for their children?  Can he instruct the HSE to carry out a full cost-benefit analysis on the setting up of similar physiotherapy centres in each province to meet the needs of children?</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position on the matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with her introductory remarks on the programme last night on RTE.  I find it totally unacceptable and I agree that we have to do something about it.  That is the reality of it.  Children, or anyone in pain, should not have to wait around like that.  We have to deal with the waiting lists.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been very proactive over the last couple of hours in dealing with it through the hospitals and the HSE.  However, it is unacceptable that people are in that situation.</p><p>In regard to the Senator's matter, the HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve his or her full potential and to maximise independence.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families, their carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with, and on behalf of, the HSE.  The HSE works very closely with a number of voluntary service providers that specialise in the provision of services to children with cerebral palsy, offering a number of therapy services, including physiotherapy and gait analysis.  These include Enable Ireland and the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.  In 2005, the CRC commenced the provision of a range of services to people in the mid-west region, including the world's first gait laboratory.  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years, including an additional funding of &euro;31 million last year.  This extra &euro;31 million is also available for the social care and disabilities service plan 2017.</p><p>The First Step Therapy Centre is a private company based in Limerick that offers intensive physiotherapy programmes for children and adults with neuro-muscular disorders.  The HSE acknowledges that service users may choose to access privately provided therapy services.  However, it is not generally the policy of the HSE to fund private therapy sessions.  I have set up a task force and I met with it in the last couple of days.  It is looking at the idea of personalised budgets.  This could be a situation where people might be given a certain amount of funding to access physiotherapy services.  Karen and Jack's case could easily fall under that.  </p><p>The HSE is working closely with all the service providers to ensure available resources are used in a creative and flexible manner in order to be responsive to the needs that present.  However, the health service as a whole has to co-operate within the parameters of funding available to it, and given the current economic environment this has become a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, the voluntary service providers, service users and their families.  Physiotherapy services for adults and children are generally delivered through the primary care teams, community therapy services, specialist disability providers or early intervention on children's teams from zero to 18 years of age, which continue to be developed under the progress and disability service for children and young people zero to 18 programme.</p><p>The HSE also provides assist devices to people with disabilities to enable them to maintain their health, optimise functional ability and facilitate care in the primary care setting.  In addition, access to rehabilitation equipment is also provided where appropriate.  The issues raised are very important and we have to look at some creative ideas to deal with situations like Karen and Jack case raised today.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that a task force has been set up, but the crux of it is that the money be used to meet the needs of the individual patient, because the same treatment is not suitable across the board.  I disagree with the Minister of State in terms of the picture he paints of children being able to access physiotherapy when they need it.  That is not the case.  It is not my understanding, or experience, of it.  Physiotherapy twice a month for a child like Jack is absolutely unacceptable.  There should be an examination of where the money is going and we need to ensure the supports and services provided to children reach the areas where it is most needed.</p></speech>

When I took over as Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I inherited a situation whereby there had been seven or eight years with no investment whatsoever.  We had to start reinvesting and reforming services.</p> <p>The Senator raised an important point, namely, that a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out.  I will bring that point to the HSE, in particular those directly involved with disability services.  Something must be done.  If we are providing millions of euro for the reform of, and investment in, services, we need to ensure the money goes to people such as Jack.  I want to focus on such cases.</p> <p>The Senator referred to access to physiotherapy services.  I have had the same experience as she has had, in particular in recent years.  There is a major crisis.  Most people on the front line accept that there is a crisis in speech and language therapy and physiotherapy services.  I hear the same from people in Waterford, Wexford, Mayo, Galway and across the north side of Dublin.  There is no point denying that is the reality.</p> <p>My objective is that no matter what budget we have, we prioritise people and ensure that a person with a disability receives services.  People may not know that &euro;1.688 billion will be provided for disability services in 2017, an increase of &euro;96.3 million, or 6%.  People like the Senator also demanding other things.  People are asking why, if that level of funding is available for services, children are on waiting lists.  That is my job.  We are going to try to reform the system.</p> <p>The cost-benefit analysis and access to physiotherapy are issues I will bring to the attention of managers in the HSE. </p></speech>

The Minister of State and I know about the situation at this stage.  I refer to the motorised transport grant, payment of which was suspended in 2013.  It was given to people with disabilities who needed to buy cars in order to retain employment or in exceptional circumstances to those with severe disabilities who lived in isolated locations and could not use public transport.</p> <p>When I first raised this issue, I gave the Minister of State the details of a woman who has been looking after her husband since 1995.  He contracted viral inflammation of the brain and suffered considerable brain damage.  He has epileptic fits, suffers from depression, has word finding problems and problems with comprehension and memory.  He had a further heart attack in 1999.  This woman needs a car.  There are consultant appointments on a continuous basis.  She is driving an eight-year old car.  The motorised transport grant allowed her to change her car every few years.  She is in a desperate state following the suspension of grant payments.</p> <p>When I raised the issue last September, I told the Minister of State that her car was seven years old and she would have a problem if it broke down.  The engine collapsed and she bought a reconditioned engine using a loan from a credit union.  She is now living from day to day.  She needs to bring her husband out for a cup of tea.  She cares for him 24 hours a day because she is the only one he will allow to care for him given his medical condition.</p> <p>Last September, the Minister of State said the Government has decided that detailed preparatory work required on a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Department of Health.  He confirmed the work is at an advanced stage and that the drafting of primary legislation was almost ready to go.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John O'Mahony:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since then I have received a copy of a letter that was sent in 2013 by the Secretary General of the Department of Health to those in the HSE in County Mayo.  It stated the Government had agreed an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach would be asked to develop detailed proposals for the operation of a new scheme or schemes and that it would report back to the Government in October 2013.</p><p>We are now some four years on and it is four months since I raised the issue.  I know the Minister of State is aware of this particular case and I am sure there are multiple such cases throughout the country.  Something really needs to be done to solve this situation.  As I stated when I previously raised the issue, this family could have pursued the State for the treatment as others who got awards of hundreds of thousands of euro did at the time, but they are so honest and all they wanted was for the support and care to be given at home and, basically, to save the State money.  However, here we are in a situation that has not improved.  The problem is this woman feels she has no hope.</p></speech>

I absolutely take on board and am aware of the case about which he spoke.  As the Senator will already be aware, conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman regarding the legal status of both the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes in February 2013.  I feel it is important to clarify that there are no plans to restore either of these schemes as they previously operated.  However, the Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  In that regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to more than 4,700 people who were in receipt of the mobility allowance.  Therefore, in the region of 4,700 people are receiving &euro;208.50 per month.</p> <p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Department of Health.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that the programme for a partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new transport support scheme.  Both the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and I are committed to its progression as soon as possible.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals is at an advanced stage and I anticipate that this will be brought to Government shortly.  In that regard, the Health (Transport Support) Bill is included in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  The proposals will seek to ensure the following: that there is firm statutory basis to the scheme&rsquo;s operation; that there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme; that resources are targeted at those with the greatest need; and that the scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable when introduced on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs, while keeping within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  The challenge is to develop a new scheme on a statutory basis, within a limited budget, targeted towards those with the greatest need.  I can assure the Senator that the matter will be brought to the Government for consideration and decision as soon as possible.  I look forward to what will be a valuable and constructive debate when the Bill comes before this House in due course.</p></speech>

I accept the Senator's point about the specific case he raises and the need to be proactive and take the lead on this issue.  When we entered government almost 12 months ago, we stated action was needed in introducing legislation on the motorised transport grant.  I had not realised the issue had been discussed four years ago by the previous Government or other Secretaries General in the Department of Health.  I give the Senator a commitment to do my best to progress the matter.  While the legislation is being finalised, it is unacceptable that so little progress has been made in the past four years.  I will work closely with the Minister to get up and running on the issue.</p></speech>

It is unbelievable that, in this day and age, people are left to suffer on hospital waiting lists to the extent that they contemplate suicide.  Last night's programme unveiled that waiting lists may be significantly longer than those published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, with a pre-admit list comprising 23,000 patients and a pre-planned list of approximately 60,000 patients not included in the NTPF's monthly reports.</p> <p>Last year, Deputy Kelleher of my party raised his concerns about waiting times for children suffering from scoliosis.  I share his concern and believe that this situation highlights the need to get the new national children's hospital constructed without further delay.  Obviously, there are concerns about costings, but these must be ironed out so that our children have an efficient and state-of-the-art facility to attend.  They deserve nothing less.  I have voiced my support numerous times for the national children's hospital, as it is a necessity in easing the waiting lists facing children with scoliosis and those suffering from other ailments.</p> <p>The new orthopaedic unit has opened at Crumlin children's hospital.  One would imagine that it would be fully operational and ready to help ease the suffering of children with scoliosis on waiting lists.  However, the theatre is not open because of a scarcity of theatre nurses due to the Government's bad planning.  This situation must be remedied immediately.  Issues around staff shortages, the costs of implants and other bottlenecks in the health system must be addressed and the recruitment of new nurses must be a priority.  Bad planning must be rectified immediately and those suffering on waiting lists, including children, must be given an opportunity to attend consultants and have their surgeries scheduled.</p> <p>Yesterday was the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, FGM.  More than 2,500 women and girls living in Ireland are estimated to have undergone FGM according to 2008 research done by the national network of African women living in Ireland.  It is a major issue that I must raise in the Chamber today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It involves the mutilation of female genitalia for non-medical reasons and is a serious violation of the human rights of females.  FGM has been inflicted on approximately 200 million females and the horrific procedure is generally performed on young girls between infancy and the age of 15 years.  I reiterate the calls made by numerous non-governmental organisations for its elimination.  Awareness of the practice is key.  As such, it is necessary to raise the issue today.</p></speech>

It illustrated the physical and emotional burden on sufferers waiting for long periods for life-altering operations and the impact of the waiting periods on their families and friends as they watched them suffer.  It also documented how, as time passed, the condition of patients worsened.  The long-term impact can be far-reaching.  One of the most disturbing findings of the investigation was that there were two unpublished waiting lists for health treatment in Ireland.  I second the words of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, when he stated this was wrong and something over which the Government could not stand.  He also added that he was ashamed.  What shames me as a Senator is that there are very sick children on waiting lists for mental health treatment, inlcuding for early onset psychosis, anorexia, bulimia, self-harm and addiction.  They are equally vulnerable, but not once was the waiting list of these children mentioned last night.  What shames me even more is that not only did they not get a look in last night, or this morning when the Government spoke about the need for extra beds and staff in the health service, but there was no mention that last year in Ireland 17,794 children had been referred to the CAMHS and that 5,379 children had not been dealt with at all.  The waiting lists for mental health treatment are extremely serious and equally as critical as the devastating interviews we saw last night.  Each month, approximately 2,500 children await assessments.  Almost half of these children will not be seen during the first year, while some of them will not be seen after a year.  What strikes me as bizarre is that the national service plan published in December 2016 warned us that the number of children on the waiting list would increase in the coming 12 months.  Why are mental health sufferers second-class citizens?  Why is the same urgency not given to dealing with their situation?  It appears that this and previous Governments have operated a two-tier system of health care which ignores and neglects children and adolescents suffering from a mental health illness.  In the 1990s the then Government got rid of the asylum.  We opened up the doors of our Victorian hospitals and integrated those with mental health issues into society.  I am beginning to wonder whether this institutional deconstruction had any effect on our attitudes and ideas about mental health services.  Is anyone becoming a little exhausted with the talk about reform and the absence of a discussion on delivery?  Is it not a source of outrage that the administration is not giving the public a full and frank image of waiting lists?  Is it not a source of disappointment that once again mental health service waiting lists are completely ignored?</p></speech>

I commend RTE for the service it has done in highlighting the problem of waiting lists.  It is not a new phenomenon to us as we deal with it every day, as we have for the past few years.  It is deplorable that Minister for Health after Minister for Health, including Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, Mary Harney, Senator James Reilly and the current incumbent, has presided over a situation where thousands and thousands of people throughout the country wait in pain without being able to obtain treatment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The crux of it is if I need an MRI scan tomorrow morning and I produce &euro;250 or &euro;300, I will get the same MRI on the same equipment with the same consultant within ten days, but if I do not have the money I have to wait in pain.  The people who have been responsible for delivering that type of health service should hang their heads in shame.<br/><br/>I want to raise an industrial dispute issue in my own area.  Hastings Garage in Westport recently imposed compulsory redundancies on three members of staff.  <i>Ex gratia</i>payments were recommended by the Labour Court for all three, with one employee to be given the option of returning to employment at the garage.  The company has made it clear that it will not abide by this second ruling concerning payments.  No explanation was given as to how the redundancies were chosen.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s industrial relations strategy is contradictory and utterly useless.  These industrial disputes can often be viewed as legal proceedings going on in the background.  In reality these disputes have led to great hardship for families, many of whom are already struggling.  The Government has been at pains to instruct Bus &Eacute;ireann workers and others to go to the Labour Court and abide by its recommendations.  Here we have a case where a ruling has been made but one party refuses to abide by the decision.  The Government cannot, on the one hand, hide behind the excuse of urging engagement with the Labour Court, yet in other circumstances remain completely silent.  I would like to have the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation explain to us here in the House exactly what the Government's strategy is to deal with industrial unrest.<br/><br/>It does not have to be that Minister.  I know the Taoiseach is acutely aware of this dispute within his constituency.  There is a basic need to stand up for fairness and to be seen to do so.  We have enough problems with creating and keeping jobs in the west.  It is vital that fair play is seen to prevail in this situation.  I urge the Government to intervene to ensure that the right thing is done for these workers and that the company is made to adhere to the Labour Court ruling.</p></speech>

However, it made no mention of 600,000 people with disabilities and mental health needs, even though it is acknowledged that these people are in the throes of a long-term crisis.  We have public service pay pressures and a deep housing crisis, which also affects people with disabilities.  We have the health issues that have again been exposed here today and we have the Brexit challenges.  The glaring fact is that we have an ongoing crisis for those 600,000 people and their families, a crisis long acknowledged by successive Governments.</p><p>The troika left town at the end of 2013 and the recession ended that year.  People with disabilities are now in the fourth year following the recession, still feeling its worst effects with little or no hope that the situation will change.  Last week the CSO confirmed that the modest recovery has not extended to people with disabilities for whom poverty rates are increasing while they are thankfully decreasing for the general population.  Four years after the troika left Ireland, more than half of people living with disabilities are not able to afford four essential items: adequate heating; two pairs of strong shoes; a warm coat; and meat a few times a week.  These are the facts of Ireland today.</p><p>The SILC figures released last week show that people with disabilities are at twice the risk of living in poverty at just under 35% as opposed to 19% for the general population.  These are stark facts.  Consistent poverty for people with disabilities has increased by 8%; the deprivation rate has increased by just under 2%; and the risk of poverty has increased by almost 10%.  While the rate is thankfully falling for the general population, it is going the wrong way for too many people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This crisis is absolutely out of control.

That did not happen.  There are real pressures in other areas, but this too is a real issue and if the Government is honest and honourable about its commitments to people with disabilities, the upcoming budget in October has to have a real, meaningful, cross-Government package for people with disabilities.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to come into this House and set out what he and his Government intend to do to make that a reality for the coming year?</p></speech>

I know that announcement has been made following a Cabinet meeting today.  It is in keeping with the recommendation made by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill in his inquiry earlier last year.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on US immigration policy in light of the restrictions that were announced by US President Trump last week.  I was among many people who protested outside the US Embassy on Thursday evening.  The numbers there in the lashing rain showed the immense concern among Irish people at the nature of the new restrictions that President Trump announced, notably the restrictions on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries.</p> <p>This is not just about that particular restriction.  We saw the chairman of Ornua, formerly the Irish Dairy Board, talking about difficulties that he has had since President Trump took office with getting Irish graduates into the US for the first time.  The new immigration policy in the US is a much bigger issue than just that restriction.  I welcome that over the weekend, the US courts have effectively brought about the suspension of the ban.  I am conscious that the ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing the appeal being brought by the US Department of Justice this afternoon.  I hope the US justice system will be robust enough to withstand the dreadful critiques that we have seen from President Trump and the attacks that he has made on members of the judiciary.  I hope we will see the most recent immigration restrictions lifted or indefinitely suspended.</p> <p>If the restrictions remain in place, I would join with the Labour Party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in calling on the Taoiseach to stay away from the White House on St. Patrick's Day.  There is immense concern among Irish people at the nature of these restrictions and the Taoiseach would do well to note people's concerns.</p></speech>

Perhaps in all the international news about President Trump, the international news focus has gone off Syria.  This week, Amnesty International accused the Syrian regime of hanging 13,000 people at an infamous prison, Saydnaya, near Damascus.  This appalling report was utterly dismissed yesterday by Syria's President, Bashar al-Assad, in a comment to Belgian media.  The English translation of that refers to Mr. al-Assad being utterly dismissive of the United Nations, international tribunals, and any attempt to make his regime accountable for war crimes committed.  I again call on the Leader for a debate on Syria.</p></speech>

It is outrageous that successive Ministers have been given information that is not accurate and that figures, waiting lists and reports are not accurate or reflective.  This is not good enough.  It is not good that a Minister would receive the wrong information.  Effectively, this is a case of somebody lying.  We need a serious investigation in the HSE as to why the Minister and previous Ministers were given the wrong information.  Heads should roll.  How can a Minister make a case to Government for extra funding if he or she does not have the full facts?  In terms of the money that is required to get the health service up to a standard over which people can stand, it requires a significant increase in funding.  We need a debate in this country about having no tax cuts for the next number of years.  The extra resources that become available as a result of not having tax cuts should be ring-fenced and put into capital expenditure in the health services.  Most decent human beings and taxpayers in this country would be quite happy to see their taxes increase by a percentage or two in order to solve this problem once and for all.  Every year since I have been elected, people have stood up here pre-budget and looked for tax and universal social charge reductions and tax breaks.  That day must go.  We need to see a significant increase in health spending to deal with what we saw last night on television.  </p></speech>

Mark Twain said that "facts are stubborn, but statistics are more pliable" but when one does not have the facts, there is nothing one can do about it.  While heads should roll, in a modern democracy, the fact that the lists are not accurate means that the HSE has a lot to answer for.  That does not mean that the Minister is not the person in charge.  The former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, appeared here many times and one would swear that he was a commentator on the health service instead of being the Minister for Health.  Nobody can point to any reforms he made when he was Minister for Health.</p> <p>The leader of the DUP is also a person who seems to be unable to grasp facts as they apply to the real world.  She is not a woman of detail, as we know, because even though she was in charge of the department that promoted and signed off on the renewable energy scheme, she said she did not realise that the devil was in the detail and that, in reality, she was giving away hundreds of billions of pounds to people to literally burn money.

They are actually taking the pellets south and reselling them.  That is enterprising and I am sure the DUP would love that type of enterprise.  The leader of the DUP also said something yesterday that is not a fact either.  She said more people in Northern Ireland speak Polish than speak Irish.  That is not true.  There are 30,000 Polish speakers and 105,000 people who speak Irish.  She did not seem to understand the most important fact of all when she announced the DUP's policies and said that she did not support an Irish language Act and would not see one implemented.

I ask that the Minister for Health come to the House to explain the relationships among the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Department of Health and the Minister himself.  It is a complex web.  We cannot lay blame here today without all of the facts.  We need to see what the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund is.  While I note and welcome the Government's commitment to provide additional funds and resources to the fund this year and next year as set out clearly in the budget and programme for Government, it is important to have a statement on the issue.  Who actually validates lists and how does the whole system work?</p> <p>We need more information than we heard last night.  It was an appalling story and an appalling vista.

The report set out that 84% of teachers surveyed said they did not cover online safety on the curriculum while 64% said they did not have sufficient resources.  We need to have a debate in the House on this very serious issue which is only getting worse given the extent to which technology and online matters are so far ahead of those who make policy in this area.  A new survey released yesterday and conducted by the national anti-bullying centre at DCU emphasises the need for additional measures to combat this scourge as a matter of priority.</p> <p>Only one in three parents feels confident that he or she can protect children online.  Parental concerns revolve around risks of cyberbullying, access to pornographic content, online grooming and generally spending too much time on the Internet.  When it comes to lifestyle issues, the last is the biggest of them all.  Children are going online at increasingly younger ages.  Combined with the exponential growth in mobile phones, this presents an immense challenge for parents.</p> <p>The latest study highlighted how new apps and social media platforms are coming onto the market all the time and being targeted at children as young as nine.  A second report out today also confirmed that one in ten children in Ireland says he or she has been cyberbullied.  Both reports are being released to highlight Safer Internet Day which is tomorrow.  They call for parental education around digital technologies and their use.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the survey of parental attitudes conducted last month among parents of children aged zero to 18 found that they employ a range of strategies to try to protect their children, the most common being limiting screen time.  As most children are accessing the Internet on tablets and mobile phones now, it is very difficult for parents to have any control.  Certainly, they cannot watch their children on a 24-7 basis.  Of parents, 53% are happy with how they monitor their children's use of the Internet but 40% admit it is easy for their children to use the Internet without their knowledge.  I ask the Leader for a debate in the House on this issue and to suggest to the Minister that we create a one-stop-shop for this issue nationally.  There should be strategic campaigns for parents and a back-up service to help them with the issue of cyberbullying.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to direct the National Treatment Purchase Fund to obtain accurate and real figures on waiting lists.  There are two waiting lists, one of which involves massaging the figures.  Waiting lists are already shockingly high, with the number of scheduled procedures having risen from 50,000 in 2013 to 80,000 in 2016.  The saddest point is that the public patients are suffering most.</p> <p>Since Christmas, the number of people on trolleys in corridors of the hospitals has been the highest.  The number of people waiting for appointments and procedures has rocketed.  There is no accountability in the health system.  There is no leadership.  I heard the Minister say last night that this is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable and it is not good enough.</p> <p>Another urgent case that the Minister is not addressing - I have asked that the Minister appear in the House next week - concerns the unacceptably large number of cancer patients fighting for medical cards.

It is a shocking shame that it takes a television programme for notice to be taken rather than our calling out these issues long in advance of such programmes.  Patricia Connolly told her story of waiting over a year for a gynaecology appointment in Cork.  She is condemned to a life of pain on painkillers.  She is one of at least 4,265 women, if not more, in Cork who are waiting for a gynaecology assessment.  This is nothing new.  I raised this matter with the Minister in September but nothing has happened since.  There are just more women living in pain on the list.</p> <p>We need to know what needs to be done to solve the issues in Cork.  We just need the Minister to ensure that the doctors' four-point plan is put in place.  The four recommendations the doctors made to the Minister some weeks ago are to employ additional gynaecology theatre staff to increase the theatre capacity from 30% to 100%; to develop a gynaecology day unit; to build and staff the gynaecology one-stop shop, which was part of the cancer plan in 2014; and to employ a minimum of four additional consultant gynaecologists.</p> <p>To end the misery for women in Cork and the region, we need concrete action beyond the Minister's genuine emotion and warm words.  I want to know what specific actions he will take.  What is the timeframe for these actions?  On 25 January, the last time the Minister addressed this matter in the Seanad, he told us he had requested a report from the HSE on both the inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.  Is this report ready?  Will it address the practical issues in CUMH, which issues are the outliers?  Can we see the report?  The Minister said on the occasion in question that the situation is not acceptable.  What does this actually mean for women waiting to get the treatment they need?  What action will the Minister take to provide a sustainable solution to build real capacity and not fund something that just relies on the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  In January, the Minister promised to meet the consultants and management in February to agree the actions and promises.  Has a date been set?  The consultants have sent their proposals to the Minister.  It would take him just under 30 minutes to consider their practical proposals.  I would like the Leader to bring the Minister for Health here to answer these questions for all the people on the list.</p></speech>

It is quite shocking that we have figures such as those aired and that there are two sets of figures.  The CEO of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, has many questions to answer in this regard.  People want to hear more than statements of shock from us.  The HSE is charged with delivering a health care service to the people.  There are children with scoliosis who need timely intervention and surgery but it does not seem to matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The list goes on and I know that the Minister has been deeply affected.  However, we have seen this with Minister after Minister and need to get to the bottom of it.  What is shocking and shameful needs to be pointed out.  I support the suggestion that the Minister come back into the House.  I raised a very important concern about how the health care groups were operating.  I am reliably informed that, since they have been set up, there have been 122 new general manager grade A posts at St. Stephens Hospital central administration but that there are 120 consultant vacancies nationwide.  We need front-line staff, but these new managers cost in excess of &euro;100 million per year.  What is going on?  I raised this issue during statements on the health service and have not received any answer.  I would like an answer because it is very peculiar that, with vacancies a problem in the health service, there is no problem in filling managerial posts centrally.</p></speech>

Last Saturday there was to be a picket placed at Shelbourne Park to highlight the difficulties within the industry.  On Friday evening the interim CEO of the Irish Greyhound Board called off the race meeting due to be held in Shelbourne Park on Saturday night.  Among other things, he claimed he was concerned that racegoers might be intimidated.  The hard facts are that the people who attend race meetings on a weekly basis are the same people who were supporting the placing of the picket.  The claim made by the interim CEO was unfounded and extremely unfair.  The actions taken by owners and trainers have not been taken lightly but out of years of frustration at the lack of action in dealing with problems within the industry.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Seanad for a debate on this issue and to find out why the legislation which has been promised since last year and which I am informed is ready is not being brought forward.  I also want to know the circumstances around the departure of the former CEO before Christmas and its implications for the Irish Greyhound Board in terms of contractual obligations, given that the person in question only served two years of a three-year contract.  I also want to ask about the procedures used in appointing the interim CEO to the Irish Greyhound Board, how long the appointment is for and when the position will be advertised.  The Leader referred to a meeting held last Wednesday in Naas between the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association and the interim CEO.  The meeting was a non-event and completely unsuccessful.  One of the issues raised by the group was the closing of the race track at Harold's Cross, one of the most profitable tracks in the country.  The interim CEO said he did not want to discuss it.  The track was being closed - end of.  Another picket will be placed at Shelbourne Park next Saturday at 3 p.m.  The national awards ceremony is taking place there at 4 p.m., but this is not the action of people who want to disrupt the industry.  They are frustrated at the lack of action on the part of the Government to clean up an industry they all love and to which many of them have given their lives.</p></speech>

I must commend the excellent work on the ground.  It was like a scene from Martha Mitchell's "Gone With The Wind" in Atlanta, Georgia, with the chaos.  Organised chaos, perhaps.  Once one gets into that situation the medical team moves very quickly.  There were only two emergency recovery cubicles in that particular section.  There needs to be a reconfiguration of the hospital system so that accident and emergency departments become mini hospitals within hospitals, and that there are beds allocated there to ensure that people are not on trolleys.

If he wants to talk about the history of politics and the way this country was left after his Government was in place, he should mention that his Minister for Health left not only our health services but our economy in a terrible state.  Whatever we say about the last Government, it stood up to the mark over the last five years to repair the economy and put funding back into health services.</p> <p>If we look at the facts, Ireland has the second highest expenditure on health services among OECD countries.  It is not just about funding.  It is about accountability.  I would ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House, because we need political accountability.</p> <p>We also need administrative accountability for the manner in which these funds are being spent in our health services.  I point the finger of blame at the HSE which is not managing the funding provided by the taxpayer to the best of its ability to provide essential health services to our communities.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Reilly, the former Minister for Health, was mentioned.  He reconfigured the acute hospital networks in 2013, but the problem has been that the governing boards of those hospitals have not been appointed.  We are now four years down the road.  Without accountability the HSE is not going to be held to account for the harrowing scenes we saw on "Prime Time" last night, which we are all concerned about and are expressing our outrage on.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Health to the House to explain why the hospital boards have still not been appointed to govern the hospital networks that were reconfigured in 2013.  Without that accountability, without that governance, we are not going to see the improvements and efficiencies planned at that time.  We all need to work together, across parties if necessary, to ensure that we get to the fundamental problems in our health services, because arguing on parochial issues as our colleague, Senator Leyden, has just done will not solve the problem.  We need to stand up and be counted on a more national level.</p></speech>

These people need safeguarding because of the policies of the President of the United States, Donald Trump.  During his first press conference, the then President-elect decided to target the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors.  In doing so, the stock prices for major US pharmaceuticals dropped more than $25 billion in 20 minutes.  It is the longer-term impact which can be more profound and about which we must be concerned.</p><p>My party colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, expressed his unease at President Trump's comments at the time and also questioned the failure of the Government to spell out any plan to respond to the emerging threats to jobs in US owned companies in Ireland.  One month on, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has yet to adequately respond to these threats or illustrate any kind of plan to deal with them.  President Trump wants the US pharmaceutical companies to which Ireland is home to close up shop and return to the US.  He has spoken forcefully about getting US pharmaceutical companies to make a return and imposing sanctions on those which do not.</p><p>It is worth remembering that Pfizer employs 3,200 people at six different sites across the country.  AbbVie's Irish operation employs more than 500 people in five locations across the country and Boston Scientific, which was founded in Galway in 1994, employs more than 4,000 people across Ireland.  These are just a few of the companies that are providing jobs and benefitting the Irish economy.</p><p>If we have learned anything from the first 18 days of the reign of President Trump, it is that he was not simply paying lip-service throughout his campaign, and his plans for the pharmaceutical industry are no exception.  He is a populist President and pharmaceutical companies are a popular villain.  We cannot allow his comments, which are very likely to become actions, to rock a recovering country and one of our most fruitful industries.</p></speech>

It has been an ongoing problem for many years.  We want waiting times diminished for patients but it is not and never has been just an issue of resources.</p> <p>I wish to correct the record for the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in.  During my tenure as Minister for Health, inpatient waiting lists came down to eight months, despite &euro;2.5 billion less being available.  The number of people who had to endure long waits on trolleys, the most acutely ill and seriously sick, reduced by a third.  There are still far too many waiting on trolleys and more work has to be done.</p> <p>The bottom line is that no part of the health service exists in isolation.  If we want to cure what is happening in accident and emergency departments and fix our waiting lists, we must fix what is happening in primary care.  Unless there is a new GP contract and more emphasis on prevention and early detection, people will continue to wait.  As the programme pointed out last night, if people are left on waiting lists they go from being elective cases, that is, having their surgery in a planned way, to emergency cases.  All the statistics show that the outcome is not as good for patients and the expense on the State is greater.</p> <p>I commend the Minister for starting negotiations on a new GP contract but we also have to look at who is doing what within our health service.  I have mentioned treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, efficient, timely and as near to home as possible.  Consultants are doing work that GPs could be doing and GPs are doing work that nurses could be doing.  We are all doing work that other paramedics could be doing.  All that must change.</p> <p>I also want to comment on management.  It takes six years for a student to become a doctor and approximately four years to become a GP or 12 years to become a specialist.  What do we spend on our managers?  Many of them are excellent administrators who were promoted into management positions, and who do not get study leave or extra training and are left in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->During our time with the special delivery unit, SDU, we set up a programme to train 30 a year and provide postgraduate training.  That programme needs to continue and be amplified.  The point has been made that the funds go into the system and that we have the best doctors and nurses in the world.  It is management that we need to address.  There is no point in Senators giving out about management unless they are prepared to train and support managers during the course of their careers in order that they can do the job we all want to see done.</p><p>There is still a need for capital investment.  Members have mentioned the emergency department in Galway.  The same can be said of the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital.  There is a need for more primary care units and day hospitals.  All of these things will help to treat patients long before they get to the position where they will need to be in an acute hospital.  That is what needs to be done.</p></speech>

From speaking to European colleagues, it has come to my attention that the Irish language may also come under attack in the European Union as a result of Brexit.  As the Government has decided that the Taoiseach is the Minister for Brexit, I request his presence in the Chamber in the coming days to discuss this worrying prospect.  Currently, there are 24 official languages of the European Union, Irish being the official language of Ireland.  The EU institutions currently use three languages, namely, English, French and German, in conducting its everyday business.  English is by far the dominant language, with 80% of documents written in it.  The next most popular language is French, at 7%.  When the United Kingdom exits the European Union, no country will have English as its official language.  The talk is that France and Germany will push to have their languages become more prominent in EU institutions and lessen the use of English.  As a result of this push, pressure may come on Ireland from other member states eager to maintain the status of English to drop Irish as our official language.  Danuta H&uuml;bner, the head of the European Parliament's committee on constitutional affairs, has recently warned us of this prospect.  <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>has reported that French and German are being used increasingly since the referendum in June.  Therefore, the prospect of Ireland coming under pressure to change our official language is worrying.  The Government must guarantee that it will fight to maintain the status of the Irish language in order that it will not be diminished, notwithstanding the pressure that might be exerted on us to change it to facilitate other member countries.  As an Irish speaker, I find this prospect worrying.  We must protect the status of the Irish language in the European Union.  If we do not, it will have a knock-on effect at home.</p></speech>

My colleague referred to the average spend per head of population on health.  We have the second highest spend in the OECD, but the question is whether we are spending the money wisely and, if not, how that situation has arisen.  When one considers the HSE's 2015 annual report, it is worrying that the number of managers went from 4,700 to 5,000, an increase of 300.  The number of clerical assistants increased by 700, whereas the number of public health nurses increased by 60.  This is in an area in which we should be increasing the numbers of those on the ground to ensure people receive advice and care in their homes and localities rather than having to be admitted to hospital.</p> <p>Some of the figures for the health service are being lost in the process.  For instance, there are 3.2 million outpatient attendances every year, or 63,000 per week.  There are 23,000 attendances in emergency department per week, which gives a total of 86,000 attendances in these two areas alone per week.  This is outside the numbers in hospitals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The figure of 86,000 per week shows the volume of work that is being done.  We do not give credit to those who are doing this work.<br/><br/>Three weeks ago, I wrote an article for the <i>Evening Echo</i>in Cork about the increase in population.  In the past 30 years, the population of County Cork has increased from 410,000 to 542,000, an increase of 132,000 or approximately 30%.  In the same period, the number of hospital beds in the county has not increased.  We had plenty of money in the period between 1998 and 2008, yet not one new major hospital facility was opened in the county during that time and no real long-term planning took place.  One of the major problems in health care is that planning seems to be done on an annual basis rather than for the long term.  Time and again, I have raised the need to provide more hospital beds in response to demographic change.  We can open all the primary care centres we like but they will not sort out the problems of accident and emergency departments and waiting lists.  The number of beds in major hospitals must be increased.  While doctors have increased the number of day procedures, which reduces the number of overnight admissions, this does not solve the problem.  Planning is needed in this area.</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, the bias shown towards Dublin has created serious logistical problems.  In the past 20 years, an excellent road network has been constructed, which means there is nothing to prevent major urban development outside Dublin.  The Minister speaks about such development but if he is serious about it, he should row back on the decision taken by the previous Government to put a stop to decentralisation.  In Mullingar, where I live, more than &euro;2 million was paid for a centrally located site that was fenced and shovel ready.  It was to be used for a new Department of Education and Skills office in the town.  Approximately 300 people took job offers and were ready to move to Mullingar before the plug was pulled on the project by the previous Government.  I do not wish to make a party political issue of this decision but it is now up to the Minister to press ahead with this project to advance the national development plan.</p> <p>The decentralisation programme was shelved for financial reasons and should be reintroduced under the national development plan.  The site to which I referred in Mullingar is ready to roll and provides an ideal opportunity for a decentralisation project.  I impress on the Leader the need to speak to the Minister for Education and Skills to find out whether he will roll out the 300 jobs promised to the town in a new departmental facility.  </p></speech>

Yesterday, while attending a conference a Boyle, a young man from Elphin thanked me for introducing an air ambulance service in County Roscommon, which saved his life.  Six months ago, the air ambulance service transferred him from the scene of a car accident to an accident and emergency unit in Galway within 35 minutes.  There are dozens of men and women, young and old, in County Roscommon who have had similar experiences.</p> <p>I called into Roscommon hospital this morning on my way to Dublin, as I do every week.  The hospital is so busy I could not find a parking space.  This is a major issue and a national disgrace.  The hospital has become much busier and needs more parking spaces.</p> <p>The reason for my late arrival today is that I was attending the 13th national health summit in Croke Park, at which I was one of the speakers.  More than 300 stakeholders in the health system, including managers, consultants and doctors, attended.  After I spoke, Audrey Carville, who organised the summit, asked whether anyone present believed the downgrading of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital had been a mistake or had cost lives.  Not one of the 300 health professionals present raised a hand.</p></speech>

The people in Roscommon are not fools.  They will not tolerate people like the Senator going up to the top of the hill, moaning and shouting, and saying people's lives are at risk.  They know that it is much safer, that they have a better hospital and that the work that the last Government did secured the future and safety of the people of Roscommon.</p></speech>

Never the twain shall meet as far as the two of you are concerned.</p> <p>I rarely comment here but on the health issue, it is a problem people face at some time in their lives.  Some commentators talk about mental health and disabilities in a very balanced way.  We should have a full, balanced debate with the Minister some time.  I have been in politics for more than 30 years and it has been an issue for all that time.  With the way things are going, we should not have been surprised with the RTE programme last night.  All it did was shine a spotlight.  I held clinics for many years and many of those issues were raised.  We tried to the best we could and we probably failed.  We should have a full debate here, not an hour debate.  Perhaps the Leader can invite the Minister to the House for four hours.  Let us see who will contribute in a balanced way and get the Minister to respond.  That is only a suggestion, which I rarely make from the Chair.</p></speech>

Some 16 Members raised the issue of health in regard to the programme last night, entitled Living on the List.  Those of us who are involved in our families, in our homes, in our lives and in our communities and as politicians recognise that the figures and what was portrayed in last night's programme were unacceptable.  Nobody, whether young or old, man or woman or young boy or young girl, should have to wait in any type of pain.  The stories and what was portrayed in that programme last night should not, as the Cathaoirleach said, be new to people.  This has been going on for far too long, despite the best efforts of many and the abdication of responsibility by some.  The "Prime Time Investigates" programme, if it does anything, will perhaps help to focus minds.  Senator Boyhan was correct when he spoke of the need to have a synergy and a relationship between the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is something that has been badly missing.</p> <p>As Leader of the House and a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health, there should be one list.  There should be no duplicity.  There should be no changing or alteration.  There should be one list that should be reflective of the situation.  The figure is far too high.  It is about time we looked at the reality here.  It is time for accountability.  Those who are tasked with the running and delivery of our health system must be held to account.  There is political accountability but there is no accountability among those who are asked to administer the running of our health system.  It is time this happened.  </p> <p>As somebody who has spent five years chairing the Joint Committee on Health and who had a working relationship with many in the health system, my confidence in those who are tasked with running our health system is at an all time low.  I would question their ability to lead the health system out of this debacle.  We have seen an increase in the budget allocated to the Department of Health and the HSE in the last budget.  When the party opposite was in government, when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin ran out of the Department of Health, the budget was at an all-time high and there were waiting lists.  It is not about apportioning blame to Ministers.  It is about apportioning blame to those who run the health system and who manage-----</p></speech>

These are human beings, fellow citizens of ours, and they deserve better from our health system.  It is time for holistic change regarding the use of theatre spaces.  Senator Kelleher referred to Cork University Maternity Hospital and I very much welcome the appointment of Professor John Higgins to his new role.  I support him, wish him well and hope to see a change in the use of theatres.  We also need to see changes in the use of beds and we need to see more beds open if possible.  Equally, consultants must look at their work practices, how they operate and do business too.  As Senator Coffey rightly pointed out, we are allocating money but it is not just about the resources.  How do we allocate that money and where is it spent?  We have the second highest level of spending on health in the OECD.  That is something we need to look at and change.  The role of the HSE must be altered.</p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, allocation for this year will allow it to utilise capacity in the private acute hospital sector to provide treatment for those waiting longest.  The HSE has been asked to submit an action plan to improve waiting lists in the public acute hospitals for inpatient, day case and outpatient services.  The HSE and the NTPF must work strategically and collaboratively on this issue.  The Minister has taken steps and while the action to date has been far too little, it is important that we work to end the blight of long waiting times for those who need to be seen.  To go back to my fundamental point, they are people who deserve better.  They are not numbers or statistics; they are people.  </p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of female genital mutilation in the context of the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012.  I share her views and agree that we must work collaboratively to end this awful scourge.  I would be happy to work with her on that and I thank her for highlighting the issue.</p><p>Senator Freeman raised the issue of child mental health and specifically mental health waiting lists.  I do not see people being treated as second class citizens by anyone involved in the health system but mental health is an issue that we must continue to push to the fore.  I would be happy to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee, who was here last week, to the House to discuss the issue.  She has secured more posts and increased funding for the mental health area.  </p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of an industrial dispute in County Mayo.  That is a matter for the mechanisms of the State, specifically the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The Senator could raise the matter as a Topical Issue but it is important that the mechanisms of the State are used to reach a resolution.</p><p>Senator Dolan referred to an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>but I would not believe everything I read in that newspaper because it does not always get everything right.</p></speech>

I would be happy to organise debates on Syria and on US immigration policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Martin Conway posed a question about the use of taxes and tax increases which, perhaps, is an issue for debate prior to the budget.  I will be happy to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to debate it.  </p><p>Senator Mark Daly spoke about the DUP leader and a multiplicity of other issues.  I do not propose to get into the nuances of the election campaign in the North.  However, I share the views of the Senator and those of Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee on a different point about the Irish language, that it is important that people in the North who use Irish as their first language be supported in that regard.  I have previously expressed the view which I reiterate today that the decision to withdraw funding for Irish language summer schools only to reinstate it was wrong.  It should never have been withdrawn.  The Government, as co-guarantor of the St. Andrew's Agreement, will continue to promote the use of the Irish language, including north of the Border.  </p><p>In reference to Israel and Palestine, I will be happy to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House for a debate on the matter raised.  </p><p>Senator Catherine Noone raised the issue of cyber safety.  This is safer Internet usage week.  All of us involved with children or who have children of our own or who are in a position to influence should raise the issue of cyber awareness and safety in the context of Internet usage.  There is a very good advertisement promoting cyber security which poses the question: "Would you let your child walk around Dublin, meeting several thousand people...?"  That is potentially what can happen on the Internet.  It is important, therefore, that we raise the point.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy referred to the greyhound industry.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, come to the House to discuss the issue.  I am not aware of the details of appointments or reappointments.  The Senator may be aware that the matter was discussed by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I will be happy to arrange such a debate in the House.</p><p>Senator Keith Swanick referred to President Trump's policy on the pharmaceutical and medtech industries.  The points made by the Senator are ones of which we should be much be more cognisant, given the changes in policy flagged by President Trump.  US investment in Ireland last year amounted to &euro;343 billion, an increase of 28% on the figure for 2014.  Ireland constitutes 1% of the European economy but attracted 20% of all US foreign direct investment in Europe in 2015.  More than 140,000 people are directly employed in over 700 US firms in Ireland, accounting for over 74% of IDA-supported employment.  It would be worrying if the changes flagged were to come about.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, come to the House to debate the issue.</p><p>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee referred to Irish being the official language of Ireland in the European Union.  I hope there will be no change in that regard.  I certainly would not support any such change.  I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss the issue.  The Senator might also consider raising it by way of a Commencement matter.  The point she raises is worthy of support and I am happy to support her in that regard.</p><p>Senator Aidan Davitt referred to the national development plan and the proposals of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, in the context of Ireland 2040.  I will be happy to arrange a debate on the issue of decentralisation and how the programme collapsed under a previous Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The issue raised by the Senator with reference to Mullingar is one-----</p></speech>

I am disappointed that they were not ruled out of order.  They were designed to address the situation of mandatory retirement for critical health professionals in the public health system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are senior decision makers in our system, who are forced to retire for no reason other than their age.  As Professor Crown stated during the 2015 debate, we are not so flush with trained experienced staff that we can afford to offload them voluntarily.  The Longer Healthy Living Bill 2015 received cross-party support.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality examined in detail the broader issue of mandatory retirement in the context of the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill tabled by the then Labour Party Deputy, Anne Ferris.  One of the submissions was from Dr. Enda Shanahan, who helped me formulate some of my amendments.  He stated that two years prior to coming before the committee he was compelled to retire from the health service, where he worked as a specialist hospital doctor.  He wrote to the management, and the then Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Senator Reilly, indicating he was able and willing to keep working in the public health sector after the age of 65.  He explained he was physically fit, still running all distances up to and including marathons, and medically fit for purpose as certified by the Medical Council's continuous professional development process.  The answer was that retirement was mandatory on reaching the age of 65.  At no point was any objective effort made to assess his suitability to continue working.  He was retired purely because of a date in the calendar.</p><p>The health service is on life support.  It is in dire need of resuscitation and reform.  As a doctor and a Senator who is trying to be constructive, pragmatic and solution driven, I am bitterly disappointed the amendments have been ruled out of order on a technicality.  The amendments would have helped in a small way to ameliorate the staff shortages which plague our health system.  Last night, we saw the "RTE Investigates" programme which highlighted the shambles and cover-up that has become the norm in our health system.  A simple "Sorry" does not cut it any more for the Irish people.  We are embattled by staff shortages, a shortage of senior consultants, not enough GPs and a dearth of highly qualified specialist nursing staff.  We have an ailing and failing health service.  I intend to introduce to the House a new Bill comprising these amendments.</p><p>I remind Senators and the Minister of State that at present 250 consultant posts are unoccupied and 25% of all vacancies received no applications.  I welcome Dr. Enda Shanahan, who contributed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and who is in the Gallery.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleague, Senator Swanick, on tabling these very worthwhile amendments.  While I fully accept the ruling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach that they are out of order on the grounds they would be a charge on the Exchequer, I fail to see how they could be a charge on the Exchequer.  As Senator Swanick has pointed out, we have more than 200 vacancies for consultants.  When Professor Crown was colleague of ours in the House, he brought forward legislation in this regard.  At the time it was well received but nothing was done about it.  While the House may not have a role in bringing forward legislation with financial consequences for the State, I urge colleagues on both sides of the Lower House to bring forward such legislation.  I welcome the fact that Senator Swanick has said he intends to initiate such legislation in the House but I fear it will be knocked down for the same reasons as his amendments have been ruled out of order this afternoon.</p> <p>At a time when we are discussing extending the retirement age to 68, 69 and even 70 in the years to come, I fail to see why it is not feasible, given the vacancies to which we have referred, to extend the retirement age for consultants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a charge on the Exchequer because we have nobody to fill their vacancies when they occur.

People such as Senator Reilly, who tried to introduce initiatives to benefit the health service, were ridiculed, not only by some Opposition Deputies and Senators, but also by colleagues in his own party, including a recent former Minister for Health.</p> <p>We have to stand up and say it as it is.  We do not have the consultants to service our health service.  Until we consider realistic proposals, such as those made by Senator Swanick, to extend the retirement age of consultants who want to continue in their practices and until we realistically tackle the pay and conditions of consultants who have been forced to leave the country to work under better circumstances elsewhere in the world, we will continue to have a crisis in our health service.

The bottom like here is the performance of one's duty.  One's suitability to perform those duties should be based on competence and not age.  Everybody is living longer, thankfully - not everybody, obviously.  As a group, humanity is living longer.  People are healthy.  We have already had statements at the Global Economic Forum, pointing out that we have this host of individuals aged between 65 and 80 who are healthy, wealthy and looking for something to do, as an opportunity for tourism in this country.</p> <p>I fully support the concept that people should be adjudicated upon in terms of their ability to carry out their job on competence and not age.  To complement the point, with the new under-sixes contract, GPs can work until 72 years of age if they wish.  I do not suggest that people should be forced to work beyond 65 if that is not their desire, but they certainly should not be prevented from doing so when they have built up an expertise over many years that is very hard to replace.</p></speech>
