    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015112400002#B00500"><p>I also thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Commencement matter which concerns the need for the Minister for Finance to outline the current position on the home carer tax credit, the number of people in receipt of same and if there are plans to reform it.  As the Minister of State is probably aware, the home carer tax credit is outlined as being available to a spouse in a family with one earner who is caring in the home for a child eligible to receive child benefit or for an aged or disabled person.  The tax credit has been increased to &euro;1,000 in budget 2016.  </p> <p>At a public meeting I held on the matter of taxation I found that a great many people were unaware of this tax credit, even where it applied directly to their situation.  It is clear that a potentially high number of people are missing out on this tax credit.  It is also clear that there is still a distinct lack of knowledge among the general public of its existence, its broad application and how it can be availed of.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State how many are in receipt of it and if there are plans to continue it in future budgets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015112400002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising what is quite an important issue.  It is interesting that she said the issue of lack of awareness was highlighted at public meetings.  It is good, therefore, that it is receiving an airing and if even one person picks up on it, that will be positive.</p><p>The home carer tax credit is a tax support which may be claimed by a married couple or civil partners where one spouse or civil partner, the home carer, cares for one or more dependent persons.  For this purpose, dependent persons include dependent children, the elderly or an incapacitated person.  The credit, then the home carer's allowance, was introduced to the tax code in 2000 in the context of the move towards the individualisation of the income tax system which limited the transferability of standard tax bands between spouses.  The allowance was introduced to acknowledge the choice families made where one spouse stayed at home to care for children or the elderly.  In 2013, the most recent year for which complete data are available, Revenue records indicate that the credit was claimed by approximately 82,500 families at a cost to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;61.9 million.  That is one of the figures for which the Senator asked.  It is interesting that more than 80,000 families are in receipt of the payment.</p><p><b></b>The Senator may be aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan,<b></b>has enhanced the home carer tax credit in budget 2016.  The current value of the credit is &euro;810 per year.  This will increase by &euro;190 to &euro;1,000 with effect from 2016.<b></b>The credit is available primarily to single income families, but the home carer is allowed to earn a certain amount of income before the credit is withdrawn.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once the home carer's income increases above this threshold, the credit tapers off at a rate of &euro;1 for every &euro;2 earned.  In this respect, a further enhancement to the credit introduced in budget 2016 intended specifically to be of benefit to lower-income families is an increase in the home carer's income threshold from &euro;5,080 to &euro;7,200, which is quite significant.  This will allow the home carer to earn up to &euro;7,200 in 2016 before the credit begins to taper out.  It will fully taper out once the home carer's income reaches &euro;9,200.  This measure will be of specific benefit to lower-income families as, under the terms of the credit, a family may elect to claim either the home carer credit or the increased standard rate band for two-income families, but not both.</p><p>With regard to the numbers availing of the credit, it should be noted that the Revenue Commissioners have for a number of years taken steps to automatically allow the credit without the person having to make a claim, wherever possible.  For example, Revenue uses data it receives from the Department of Social Protection on child benefit, together with other data from its own records, to automatically grant the credit each year in the tax credit certificates of PAYE taxpayers.  I am advised that Revenue gave the relief automatically to approximately 81,000 taxpayers on this basis in 2015.  This is one of the positive changes within the Department of Social Protection and Revenue whereby these are automatically done and do not need to be claimed in the first instance.  Revenue also pre-populates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the home carer tax credit where it was claimed in the previous year.</p><p>Information with regard to the increase in the home carer's tax credit announced in budget 2016 is included in Revenue's budget summary leaflet published on its website.  The Revenue Commissioners also produce a leaflet, available at their offices or on their website, giving details of the credit and how to claim it, and a number of illustrative worked examples.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has no further plans to change the home carer's credit at this time, as the budget 2016 enhancements to the credit will need to be incorporated into the system before further amendments are contemplated.  Subject to completing the legislative process, the budget 2016 enhancements to the credit will come into effect from 2016.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

On a positive note, I know the figure we have is from 2013, but it states that in 2015, the Revenue relief automatically applied to 81,000 and previously in 2013 some 82,500 families availed of it.  Clearly, only a very small number of people do not have to actively look for it.  It would be interesting to know how many families are entitled to it but are not aware of it.  It is a helpful answer and I appreciate the Minister of State coming to the House to give it to me.</p></speech>

Some 82,500 families are receiving &euro;61.9 million.  One of the benefits of the joined-up thinking with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue operating together is to ensure the maximum number of people receive that benefit without having to go through the process of claiming.  The figures show clearly how efficiently it is being administrated.  There is no harm in highlighting the issue.  I am sure a number of families are not aware of it and are not claiming it.  I thank the Senator for highlighting the issue.</p></speech>

In September the Department of Justice and Equality announced that it was of the opinion that there was no need for a referendum in order to establish a system of specialist family law courts and rather it could be done by legislation.  What is the timeframe for dealing with that legislation?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Despite recent positive developments, such as the reporting of family law cases, the Minister will be aware there remains disquiet about the operation of the current system.  This disquiet arises on a number of fronts, one being the fragmented nature of the system.  There are three courts - the District Court,  the Circuit Court and the High Court - hearing various aspects relating to family law.  In addition, there are long delays getting the most basic applications heard.  The result of such delays is that if a person does not have his or her case heard by the judge on the day it is listed, he or she could be wait months for it to be heard.  To put it simply, there are not enough sittings to deal with these cases.</p><p>Will the Minister of State give a commitment that the system envisaged will be one where specialist judges will sit and listen only to family law matters and that they will sit regularly?  There is little point in taking judges from the existing system where they are overloaded with work as matters stand.  There is no requirement for judges who hear family law matters to have any specialist knowledge in the area.  It is also the case that family law matters are often heard at the end of a busy day on which other legal matters have been dealt with.  This means family law litigants are forced to sit around courthouses hoping that their cases will be heard.  While I accept this practice is out of a wish to grant as much privacy as possible to the parties, it is far from ideal.  I do not need to go into the other shortcomings of the current system because I know the Minister of State is aware of them.</p><p>The Minister of State will also be aware of the varying stories about the perceived gender bias that is supposed to operate in the family law courts.  In light of the passing of the marriage equality referendum, I ask that the perception of a more gender-neutral attitude would emerge in family law matters.  Now that children of married same-sex partners can be the subject of court orders, it is hoped that the best interests of the child, and only that, will be the overriding consideration.  Of course, the introduction of specialist courts and trained judges would also go a long way towards eroding this perception.</p><p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the work she has done in reforming the system.  I know she shares the concerns of citizens that our system of family law is not as it should be.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, to provide some assurance that the reform of the system is ongoing by providing an update to the House on the proposed introduction of the specialist family law courts and by indicating where that legislation currently stands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-11-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015112400002#D00200"><p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is unavailable to be here to take this matter.  However, the issue is very close to her heart and is getting her fullest attention.</p> <p>I take this opportunity to inform the House of developments in regard to the establishment of specialist family courts.  As the Senator is aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a dedicated family court.  While it was originally anticipated that a referendum to amend Article 34 of the Constitution would be required in order to remove any constitutional obstacle to the establishment of a separate family court, it appears from more recent examination of the issues that it will be possible to proceed with the establishment of the court in a manner which does not require such a referendum, which is very positive news.  This could be achieved by establishing the court as a separate division within existing court structures.  The Department of Justice and Equality is currently finalising proposals for future legislation based on submissions which have been received in regard to the family court and ongoing consultations with interested parties.</p> <p>I wish to outline in general terms the principle features of the proposed family court system.  A district family court, a circuit family court and a family high court will be established as divisions of the existing courts.  It is envisaged that judges will be appointed full-time to the district family court and the circuit family court.  In the case of the family high court, it is anticipated there would not be sufficient case loads to warrant the appointment of judges full-time to family law matters.  Therefore, judges of the family high court will also be able to hear other cases.  The judges appointed to the family courts will be selected on the basis of their training, experience and expertise in dealing with family law matters.</p> <p>The new legislation will include a set of guiding principles that will apply to all family law proceedings.  These guiding principles will underline the importance of encouraging and facilitating, as far as possible, the resolution of disputes by means of alternative resolution methods, including mediation, which provide an opportunity for a less adversarial, less argumentative, less stressful and less costly resolution of disputes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister intends to bring the proposals to establish the new family courts to Government as soon as they are finalised.  She intends, at that point, to refer the draft general scheme of the legislation to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for the usual pre-legislative scrutiny conducted prior to the formal drafting of the Bill.  Once again, on behalf of the Minister, I thank Senator Naughton for raising this issue.</p></speech>

We all know that anyone who enters the family law system does so as an option of last resort.  I welcome, in particular, the commitment given that judges will be appointed full time to the District Court and Circuit Family Court which is a positive step forward.  I also welcome the commitment to facilitate, as far as possible, the resolution of disputes by means of alternative solution methods.  I look forward to the legislation passing through the various Stages in the House.</p></speech>

For the information of the House, I wish to confirm that the groundbreaking Child and Family Relationships Act was enacted earlier this year and is due to be commenced in the coming weeks which I am sure will be of interest to this House.  It will better protect children and their families for decades to come.  It also contributes to giving meaningful effect to the now constitutionally enshrined principle of the child's best interests and right to be heard which often was not automatically done in the courts in terms of looking at these cases.  I think there is a need for specialisation for judges in terms of lower courts.  The Minister is fully committed to doing so, as quickly as possible, and to getting the legislation to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for proper pre-legislative scrutiny.  I hope to see the legislation enacted as soon as possible next year.</p></speech>

I am sure he has responded to this matter in the D&aacute;il and, if not, I am sure he will do so over the next couple of days.  Of course, he has taken some media queries on the subject but it is useful that we avail of this opportunity for a brief exchange of views in the Upper House and I thank him for bringing some realism to the debate.</p> <p>Everybody wishes that a magic wand could somehow be waved by a Minister and the Government in order that we would be in a position to put in place a perfect health care system and a perfect system for funding such care.  Unfortunately, that is easier said than done.  As long as I have been a Member of this House and the other House, the provision and payment or subsidising of health care has always been on the agenda.  The matter has never been fully addressed and certainly not fully responded to.</p> <p>It could be said, that over the course of the term of one Government or even two, it is possibly not easy to put in place a long-term system of health care delivery and funding.  Therefore, we must think about what should happen beyond the lifetime of one, two or three Governments but start from a position of certainty.</p> <p>Having had lengthy discussions here and elsewhere about Canadian, Dutch, Australian and every sort of model of health care provision, perhaps our new starting point must be to improve the current system, its funding, structures and delivery of service.  Everybody concedes that once people access the health service in this country, notwithstanding the enormous challenges it is faced with, a very good service is delivered to the vast majority of citizens.  The problem appears to be access and bed provision among other matters.</p> <p>We must first address the improvement of the current system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Reinventing the wheel is fine.  It has been tried by many Ministers and many Governments but it does not seem to have worked.  If the Minister has brought the first phase of thinking on a universal health insurance to a conclusion, at least we know what is the new starting point.  If I was lucky enough to hold the Taoiseach's position, I would say the same.  He outlined last week that other possible methodologies of funding universal health care will be examined by the Government and the ESRI.  No matter what report is produced, it will find that such a scheme will be very expensive.  The days of expecting an insurance premium of &euro;300 or &euro;400 per person to cover universal health provision are long gone.  The Minister was correct in pointing out last week that the concept of asking people to pay &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500 for what would possibly be a basic cover package was not acceptable or politically expedient.  I am interested to hear where the Minister thinks we should move next.  </p><p>Everybody cheers about the concept of universal health insurance and the concept of universal health care itself but it must be funded.  We are at a stage where we have to be realistic.  The Minister and his colleagues in government are fortunate to be in a position where nobody expects miracles.  Everybody must be realistic enough to know that health care is hugely expensive and there is no easy funding mechanism.  We should look at all the options and everything should be on the table.  However, at this stage, there is no point in tying ourselves into a universal health care insurance model as originally construed five or six years ago because, clearly, it does not appear to add up.  I recall having discussions with the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health, Mary Harney, on the matter at a time when the political party of which I was a member was strongly advocating the Dutch health model and she strongly advised me of her dialogue with the Dutch health department and Ministers who were trying to move away from the scheme.  I was always uneasy that we were going to introduce what we thought was the perfect system from a country which was already losing faith in that particular funding mechanism.</p><p>We have a blank sheet to work with to see how the present system can be funded better, administered better and work better.  The glass is half full.  On the whole, the people in the service do a very good job.  A huge amount of work is done in the health service.  We rightly hear of the hard cases, the people on the trolleys and the waiting lists.  We must rid the system of those trolleys and waiting lists but I appreciate it is not easy.  </p><p>I look forward to the Minister's initial observations on the future funding models and, perhaps, his broader plans.  We cannot afford to be fixated on the concept of universal health insurance.  It has been examined and people bought into it in good faith.  It is not a sin to admit it was an impossible target to achieve and to look at other models both of a care provision and a care funding scenario.</p></speech>

I spoke on it in the D&aacute;il last week.The Government is committed to a major programme of health reform, the aim of which is to implement universal health care in Ireland.  This means timely access for everyone to effective, quality, affordable health services.  </p><p>In April 2014, the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance<i></i>was published.  It proposed a competitive, multi-payer model of compulsory universal health insurance as the means to achieve universal health care.  Following its publication, the Department of Health initiated a major costing project, involving the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others, to examine the cost implications of a change to the model of UHI proposed in the White Paper.  This initial costing project has now been completed and the underlying reports by the ESRI and KPMG, on behalf of the Health Insurance Authority, were published last week.</p><p>The analysis finds that the introduction of the White Paper model of UHI is likely to increase health care expenditure, with additional costs arising as a result of addressing unmet need for health care and the high transactional costs of operating in an insured environment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The high Exchequer subsidies and individual premiums that would be required to fund this model are not acceptable either now and nor would they be at any time in the future.  The reports essentially support the Government decision not to rush the implementation of universal health insurance in advance of this costing exercise.  It is also clear that there is a need for further research and cost modelling on the best means to achieve universal health care.  I have decided, therefore, that the next phases in the costing exercise will include a deeper exploration of meeting the cost of unmet need for health care and a more detailed comparative analysis of relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models, both single and multi-payer.</p><p>The introduction of universal health care represents the most fundamental change in our health service in the history of the State.  We have already introduced the first phases, with GP care without fees or a means test for the youngest and oldest in our society.  The latter came into effect during summer.  It is vital that before deciding on which funding model to adopt, key building blocks are put in place to provide a solid foundation for universal health care.  I have already signalled my commitment to pushing ahead with these key important reforms.</p><p>The reforms include putting in place sufficient capacity to satisfy unmet demand in terms of specialists, critical care beds and other infrastructure because a system without adequate capacity will always result in waiting lists and rationing, no matter how it is structured.  We need to strengthen primary and social care, which includes the further phased extension of GP care without fees and the improved management of chronic disease.  We need to put in place reformed structures to replace the HSE, including hospital groups and community health care organisations.  These are now established on an administrative basis, although we still have to appoint all the boards of the hospital groups and put them on a statutory footing.  We need to implement financial reforms, including a more efficient activity-based funding model.  Some people prefer to term this "money following the patient".  The conversion year for the model is 2016.  We also need to implement the Healthy Ireland programme and drive forward new patient safety measures.  This will reduce the cost of health care in the long term and improve public health.</p><p>As well as representing major milestones on the road to universal health care, these are important initiatives in their own right with the potential to drive performance improvement and deliver significant benefits in terms of timely access to high quality health care for all the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

The five points on which he is trying to make progress are a significant part of his contribution this afternoon and I wish him well on advancing those necessary improvements.  We could end up being fixated on the concept of what we frame as universal health care and universal health insurance to fund it.  In Britain, for example, there is what is supposed to be universal health care, also known as the NHS.  It is probably not working as well as it did 20 or 30 years ago.  The majority of citizens in this country, by way of the GMS medical card-public health care system, had a degree of universal health care.  Tags, titles and framework names about our health service is not really where we must go.  We must go into the provision of those five priorities identified by the Minister and others.  We must concentrate on them.  My question concerned universal health insurance, notwithstanding the view that I and many other people share that it may well be financially unaffordable.</p> <p>When will the Minister get the next range of reports on the matter?  Will he then be in a position to indicate whether an entirely new funding model is required?  We cannot keep kicking the can down the road.  The citizen is demanding a health service.  How we frame it or the title we give it are not particularly important.  When does the Minister expect the next range of apparent funding mechanisms to be brought forward?  It would be better if we could concede the old concept is simply not going to happen and move onto new ideas and approaches.</p></speech>

He touched on some of the issues, including whether to have a Dutch, Canadian or, as he mentioned, British model.  Whatever we do, we need to have an Irish model because everyone's model of health care is different.  Whatever we do will have to suit our circumstances and needs and have regard to the point from which we are coming, which is crucial to all of this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I certainly hope to know the outcome of the research on the cost of meeting unmet demand in the health service next year.  I do not have a date for the funding model, but I still hope to have it next year.  That does not mean, however, that we will go ahead with it.  As I mentioned, we have to make sure there is adequate capacity in the health service, that we strengthen primary and social care provision and put in place the reform structures and financial reforms needed before we change the funding model.  Otherwise no funding model will work.  It will take more than five years to do these things, which means that I do not anticipate the next Government, if my party leads it, being able to change the funding model for health care substantially.</p><p>It is also important that we face up to a few things to which we may not want to face up.  Any system of universal health care, no matter where it is in place, whether it be the NHS in Britain, the Dutch system or the Canadian system, involves some rationing.  Universal health care systems involve waiting lists in some form, telling people they have to wait because there is somebody with higher priority ahead of them or that they cannot receive some drug or treatment because it is not considered to be cost effective.  That is why in every democratic country in the world there is, to some extent, a two-tier system.  We allow people to spend their own money on health care if they want to.  Even in Britain, where access to health care is very good, 10% or 15% of the population have private health insurance policies with BUPA in order that they can skip queues, choose a consultant or access treatments that are not considered to be cost-effective for the general population.  We need to be honest about this in the debate.</p><p>Compulsory health insurance schemes can work and do in other countries, for example, in Holland.  However, they are expensive.  I am not sure having a system of compulsory health insurance would be right for Ireland.  What would we do if people refused to pay?  Would we fine them or tax them as happens in America if they do not take out insurance under Obamacare?  Would we jail them?  If they continued to refuse and turned up looking for treatment, would we then refuse them?  I do not think we would that in Ireland which is different from other countries.  In European countries compulsory health insurance systems have tended to build up over time.  Usually an employer pays for insurance for an employee at first and then people subsequently pay for themselves.  We do not have that tradition in Ireland and I do not think it would be right for us for these various reasons.</p><p>No matter with what funding model we end up in the long term, we first need to address the four major deficit areas.  We need to make sure there is enough capacity; strengthen primary and social care provision; put in place reformed structures and achieve financial changes which are also important.</p></speech>

This has worsened by 100% in terms of trolleys, waiting lists and so forth since 2007.  For the last 15 months the numbers have increased consistently month on month.  That happens to coincide with the same 15 months that Deputy Varadkar has been Minister for Health.</p> <p>It is two years since the Taoiseach said he was taking personal responsibility for the health service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since then we have had the establishment of a task force and the publication of a report.  Eleven weeks after that report was put into the public domain, there still is no plan in place.  The Minister continues to be the best pundit there is when it comes to the health service but, unfortunately, he has not realised he is a player.  In fact, he is the captain of the team from a health perspective and the person from whom we expect leadership.  Communities throughout the country require hospital emergency departments that work and are able to deal with patients, whether they are elderly people or young children, whether they are ill or have been injured in an accident.</p><p>The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which co-chaired the task force, announced this week that having balloted its entire membership, 92% are in favour of industrial action.  That action will take place on 15 December in four hospitals around the country, the identity of which will not be known for some time.  It could happen in Sligo, in Waterford, in a Dublin hospital or anywhere else.  What is certain is that it will not serve patients well.  It is time the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, dispensed with the punditry and commentary and instead took action on this issue.</p><p>As I said, the situation has got progressively worse month on month in the course of his tenure.  We saw the abandonment last week of the plan for universal health insurance, one of the components of the Government's five-point plan.  There has been a doubling in recent years of the numbers on trolleys.  There are ongoing problems with resources throughout the entire health service.  Last evening, I spoke to a couple, one of whom is 87 years of age and the other 82, whose joint income from the contributory old age pension is less than &euro;500 per week.  They have had their medical cards taken away despite both suffering from illness.  Indeed, one is facing imminent surgery of a serious nature in Galway.  This, sadly, is the health service in respect of which the Minister, for all his capabilities as a pundit, has shown an almost unique talent to replicate the headless chicken approach of his predecessor, the now Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.</p><p>As I said, we will not put this matter to a vote today.  However, we will do so later in the week unless a three-hour debate is arranged without the imposition of prohibitive five-minute slots for Members to speak.  We must have a meaningful debate on what tangible measures can be implemented by the Government.  We have had enough punditry and commentary.  What we need now is a functioning health service that can cater for people in emergency departments throughout the country.</p></speech>

The budget has been deemed to be compliant and no changes are required.  With the deficit falling well below 3% this year, Ireland will exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact at the end of 2015 and a balanced budget is in prospect within the coming years.  Reducing the deficit below 3% is an important milestone in our recovery.</p> <p>The Christmas social welfare bonus was abolished in 2009 by the previous Government.  One of the consequences of the improvement in our economic situation is the very welcome provision for a 75% Christmas bonus payment this year, which will directly benefit 1.2 million social welfare customers and their dependants.  Those bonuses will be paid in the first week of December, the necessary regulations having been signed yesterday.  We hope, given the further improvement which is in prospect, that the payment will be increased further next year.</p></speech>

The outline he gave of the current status of the banking inquiry was extremely enlightening for listeners.  I am glad he drew a parallel between the possible amendment of the report by the sub-committee and the very numerous amendments that are carried through by this House.  He has helped the public to understand the work we do, which is very often unregarded, unnoticed and unremarked on in the media.</p> <p>I was sad to hear of the bankruptcy of Sir Anthony O'Reilly, who is a remarkable man.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was a great rugby player for this country.  He went on to administer the Heinz corporation in America, an enormous multinational, which made him very wealthy and very famous in the United States of America, but he did not forget Ireland.  He started the Ireland Fund, which has done an enormous amount of good.  He also attempted to rescue Waterford Crystal, one of the iconic industries in this country.  It very sad that a major figure like this, approaching the end of his days, as I and at least one of my other colleagues are, is in this position.  I am sure he will be protected to a certain extent by his wife's wealth but it is still very sad to see a public figure like this brought down by financial circumstances.</p></speech>

I was in Montenegro last week on Council of Europe business, so I was not here to congratulate her.  I wish her every success.  She replaces her colleague, Senator Jimmy Harte, and I know she will bring a unique experience to this House and will be a contributor to many debates.  It adds to the quality of the House and is a great boost that she has been elected directly from the North, which is a great step forward.  My grandparents came from Lurgan in County Armagh, so I have a connection with the North.  I wish her success on both sides of the Border, whatever political life she pursues.  She is certainly entitled to it.  She was elected honourably and well and it was a great choice of candidate.</p> <p>I concur with Senator Norris.  It is good to recognise the work of a truly great Irishman in Sir Anthony O'Reilly.  People are sometimes too quick to judge.  While we will not go through his career today, what Senator Norris said is very true.  The Ireland Fund alone has done enormous work around the country.  In fact, I applied once on behalf of a project in Castlecoote in County Roscommon and I recall getting about &pound;10,000 for a small community centre, which developed different opportunities for the area.  He should certainly be recognised and this House should wish him well, whether we do that individually or collectively.  I would love to meet that man, given his experiences in Ireland, his work throughout the world for Ireland and his work in taking on difficult tasks in regard to Waterford Crystal, in which he had great faith because it was an iconic brand and he felt it was worth preserving.  It is a day of congratulation, although it is not a matter of congratulation to be declared bankrupt.  As far as I am concerned, he still has the highest standing in Irish life and no bankruptcy will ever affect that.  The work he has done for the people of Ireland will never be forgotten.</p></speech>

I was at school at the same time as him and played rugby against him.  I have a photograph at home, of which I am very proud, of the two of us running.  We, in the Newbridge Dominicans, were playing the Jesuits.  We cheated.  We said a novena for bad weather - nine days prayer for bad weather - and the Lord listened to us and we got the worst day ever.  O'Reilly only got the ball twice, so he only scored two tries.  We did not win but it was a great record.  </p> <p>As Senator Leyden said, we should remember the work he has done for the Ireland Fund over the years.  I got to know Sir Anthony O'Reilly very well over those years and have been to the weddings of some of his sons.  He is a man we should be very proud of.  Despite his recent financial difficulties, when I wrote to him recently, I got a lovely note back thanking me for my note.</p> <p>I would also like to raise the issue of the crime wave we are experiencing.  There are steps we can take, one of which is a copy of what is being done in other countries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should be able to help citizens feel more connected to the Garda.  A person may not be in a situation to ring 999 or whatever the number is but may want to talk to a garda about a certain issue.  The 999 number is for emergencies and is only to be used when a crime is being committed or help is required immediately.  We could create for citizens a telephone number that is easy to remember in order that they might share their concerns if they see something that needs to be done.  According to the relevant website, "101 is the number to call when you want to contact your local police in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland - when it's less urgent than a 999 call," that is, to report crimes and other matters in respect of which an emergency response is not needed.  This number can be used if there is a minor traffic collision, if people want to give the police information about crime in their areas or if someone wants to speak to an officer in general terms.  This has been done in several other countries and we should consider it here because people may want to contact the Garda but may not need to call 999 and create urgency about something that is, if fact, not quite so urgent.  It would be worthwhile passing this comment on to the Minister for Justice and Equality in the hope that it might be passed on to the Garda.  It would cost nothing to establish the new number and calls to it would not give rise to the same urgency as that attaching to 999 calls.  People could use it in order to highlight something that requires attention.</p></speech>

This will cause great stress and worry for many patients, particularly elderly people, during the winter.  While I can appreciate much of the frustration of nurses regarding the continued overcrowding in hospitals and, in some instances, the limited resources available, very significant progress is being made.  The emergency department task force plan is taking effect and there are 20% fewer people on trolleys today than was the case 12 months ago.  A total of 197 hospital beds have been opened since October, with 44 more to open in the next two weeks.  Almost 760 more nurses have been employed since this time last year and a recent overseas recruitment drive has given rise to 400 definite expressions of interest, which is good news in the context of the acute shortage of nursing personnel.  I hope that between now and 15 December all parties will make use of the Workplace Relations Commission to resolve the outstanding issues.  I understand that apart from those relating to overcrowding and staffing, there are other issues that need to be addressed.  I hope the INMO and the Health Service Executive, HSE, management will redouble their efforts to ensure that a binding agreement that will make industrial action unnecessary will be put in place.  These matters must to be sorted out around a table and the old, the sick and those who depend on hospital services do not deserve to be put under pressure and stress coming into winter.  A solution must be found.  I hope this proposed industrial action for 15 December will be called off.</p></speech>

Opposition Senators and some Government Senators have been calling for this for almost a year and it has not happened.  It is not fair to say to nurses because they are pondering strike action as a last resort that they are putting older persons at risk or that they are responsible for what is happening.  Government Senators have to take responsibility for what is happening in the health service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I invite Senator Mullins to visit University Hospital Waterford or any of the hospitals in the State that are under fierce pressure because of a lack of capacity.  We do not need a debate but more beds in public hospitals, more nurses, more junior doctors, more consultants and more capacity.  That is the only way we will reduce pressure in accident and emergency departments.  Anybody who understands health care will say that if one has real problems in the accident and emergency department then there will be problems everywhere in the hospital because that is where all of  the problems come together at that same time.  This situation is a symptom of what is wrong across the health service where we have a lack of investment in primary care, community nursing units and geriatric care facilities.  We still do not have many of the community nursing units that were promised.  That includes a 100-bed unit that was promised for Waterford which has still not been delivered.  The Government is responsible for these problems.</p><p>I welcome a debate but let us be honest.  The people who are lying on hospital trolleys, despite what the Government's representatives say, do not want politicians to keep talking and going around in circles on this issue.  Instead, they want delivery, results, action and more resources but the time to do all of that was in the last budget.  Let us look at what this Government did.  A sum of &euro;180 million was given to the top 14% income earners yet only a fraction of that, in additional moneys, was put into the health service.  That is what the Government did and its Senators should take responsibility.  I would welcome a debate on the issue and believe we must hold the Minister for Health to account.  The Government promised that it would bring in real reform of the HSE and all the rest.  The Government has done precious little.  In fact, it has abandoned its policy for universal health insurance.  We need to invite the Minister in here to discuss these issues and what has really created the problems in the health service.  I say to Senator Mullins that the nurses, junior doctors or consultants have not created the problems but the politicians in power who have not done what they said they would do.</p></speech>

As announced in the budget, the bonus paid to pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and people who are long-term unemployed will rise by 75% this year.  Let us recall that the Christmas bonus was abolished in 2009 but re-introduced by the present Government.  The regulations which provide for the 75% Christmas bonus to be paid were signed yesterday and must be welcomed.  Weekly social welfare payments, with which the Christmas bonus will be paid, includes the State pension, both contributory and non-contributory, the widow's and widower's pension, both contributory and non-contributory, the guardians payment both contributory and non-contributory, and those receiving invalidity pensions, blind pension, deserted wives' benefit, carer's allowance and benefit, disability allowances, farm assist long-term jobseeker's allowance and long-term supplementary welfare allowance.  A pensioner couple, both in receipt of the non-contributory State pension, will receive a bonus of &euro;328.50.  A single person on disability allowance will receive a bonus payment of &euro;141.  A person in receipt of a carer's allowance with two dependant children will get a bonus of &euro;197.70.</p></speech>

I was surprised that they were very concerned about the cost of telephone directory inquiries but having checked out the matter I realised that they were right to be concerned.  Before the meeting such costs had  not occurred to me.  Now I know that when one telephones directory inquiries from a landline and ask to be put through to a number of a supplier or potential customer, the chances are one will finish up paying &euro;7 or &euro;8.  That is a lot of money for the service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Telephone bills are dear enough without paying for the privilege of ascertaining the number before one telephones.</p><p>The major telephone companies should examine this issue.  I ask the acting Leader to take up the matter with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White.  The sum of &euro;8 may not appear to be a large amount but if one has recourse to direct inquiries on a regular basis - as I and I am sure other Members have been - it adds up.  One is hostage to fortune because one has no choice.  One cannot lug all the local directories around.  One telephone directory is supplied free of charge to people in their own telephone area, of which there are 20 or 30 in the country.   As one has to depend on directory inquiries, that is an issue that should be looked at.</p><p>There was a big song and dance here in the past couple of weeks when the Government announced an additional 600 teaching jobs.  Many young teachers hoping to leave training colleges and young teachers who are lucky to be working as substitutes were delighted at the prospect of having jobs to apply for, yet when they read the small print they discovered they were not full-time teaching positions but part-time jobs involving hours on offer and top-up hours in certain schools.  There was much disappointment about that.  I seek clarification from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, as to how many actual full-time teaching jobs had been created in a sector where jobs are badly needed, given that we have more qualified teachers than we have jobs for them.</p></speech>

I agree there are difficulties that need to be resolved but there are many positive things happening.  For example, in 2014 there were more than 3.2 million outpatient appointments where day care procedures were carried out or involving outpatient attendances with medical personnel.  The free GP care scheme for those under the age of six has been introduced.  The next step is the introduction of free GP care for under 12s, to be followed by the third category which is the under 18s.</p> <p>The message we are getting is that the entire health system is falling apart but that is not the case.  There are many people working in it who are providing a very good service to a large number of people but we need to work out the difficulties.  One is the need to start doing long-term planning.  I attended a meeting last week at which we discussed a hospital built in 1780.  No long-term planning has been done in respect of our hospitals.  The maternity units of three hospitals in Dublin have to be replaced.  While the children's hospital is progressing, hospitals around the country need to be replaced also and there is a need to set out a five, ten, 15, 20 year programme.  There is also the question of how we employ people who can provide the services required.</p> <p>I attended the Irish Kidney Association dinner on Saturday night.  No progress has been made in the past 15 years in terms of the number of kidney transplants and, given that the number is way below what it should be, the issue needs to be addressed.  There are more than 1,900 people on dialysis which is a huge cost.  The only way to reduce that cost is through increasing the number of transplants and every effort should be made to ensure the expertise is available to carry out such transplants.  Where there are living donors a great deal more works needs to be done in that area.</p></speech>

We witnessed considerable media coverage of a case of a woman from Galway who had been abused. In March her abuser pleaded guilty in Galway Circuit Criminal Court and was subsequently sentenced and was to be imprisoned for five years in July.  It has transpired that the person is in a wheelchair and was sent home for house arrest.  I know the woman and have been in contact with her.  She is outraged at the way the system is dealing with the issues around the management of the sentence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The hoo-ha in the media and the way the issue was portrayed by the media was also quite distasteful to her.</p><p>How did the information about this man being released and sent home get released to the media?  Who tipped off the press?  Did it come from the Garda or the Irish Prison Service?  How will this man be made to serve his sentence?  That is one of the issues.  That he is in a wheelchair should not have an impact on the situation.  The fact that it will cost the State approximately &euro;2 million, according to some media reports, to keep him under house arrest seems absolutely outrageous as well.  This is a serious issue and the Minister needs to investigate it.  Will she come into this House and tell us if she will investigate how this information was released and why the victim was not made aware of the situation until she saw it in the media and was being harangued by media outlets?</p><p>The situation highlights the fact that we still have not seen the victims of crime Bill come through the Houses.  We need to know when the Bill will be brought forward.  When will we sit in the Seanad and have it enacted so that issues such as this one can be brought up and addressed?  There is a serious need for an investigation into exactly what happened.  When will the perpetrator in question be forced to fulfil his sentence, as is right?</p></speech>

He called for a debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, in respect of the issue of overcrowding in accident and emergency units and patients on trolleys.  With its customary efficiency, the Leader's office has already been on to the Minister's office to try to schedule the debate.  I am happy to try to schedule it but I am mindful that there is a heavy legislative schedule between now and Christmas, which is only three full working weeks away.  We therefore may not be able to do so in that limited timeframe but we can do it in the new year.  </p> <p>I thank the Leader's office for the information that we have scheduled in the term of this Seanad, 41 separate debates on the health care portfolio.  I think I am right in saying that it is more than any other portfolio.  This is separate and distinct from the many debates we have had on health care during matters on the Adjournment and matters on the Commencement.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, was present a short while ago today responding to a matter raised on the Commencement by Senator Paul Bradford.  The matter concerned the future of universal health insurance and the Minister set out some factual matters in terms of the Government's achievements on health care reform.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, is a regular visitor to the House as was the previous Minister, Deputy Reilly.  We have had a whole range of health care debates but I am happy to try to facilitate colleagues who wish to have a debate on this important issue.  </p> <p>As colleagues will be aware, there has been investment in seeking to tackle overcrowding.  There have been some positive figures, as some colleagues have pointed out, in particular Senator Burke.  Some really key structural changes have been made by the Government in health care.  These include establishing hospital groups, building more than 45 primary care centres, establishing the new Child and Family Agency, Tusla, and stabilising the private health insurance market.</p> <p>In terms of reform, Senator Burke also pointed out that free GP care was introduced for children under six years of age and those over 70 years of age and moves are being made to introduce the same package for those under 12 years of age.  We have increased numbers of staff in our health service.  Since January of this year, there has been approximately 500 more nurses recruited and, since September 2011, almost 300 additional consultants recruited.  There has also been a trebling of mental health funding in the past four years.  There have been positive changes, reforms and structural developments made in the health service.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, gave a full response to Senator Bradford in a matter on the Commencement in this regard.  </p> <p>In respect of the particular issue that has arisen today, colleagues have all expressed concerned about the vote by the INMO for industrial action, potentially, on 15 December.  I know that Tony O'Brien of the HSE has already said HSE management will engage with the INMO through the Workplace Relations Commission to seek to resolve the issues concerning overcrowding and avert that industrial action.  Such a resolution will be in the interests of the staff working in the health care system but, more important, in the interests of patients.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all wish for a speedy resolution to those matters in the coming weeks.  I think that answers Senator MacSharry's point.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan welcomed the EU's approval of the budget and deficit reduction targets and noted that these targets are being met and indeed exceeded.  He also welcomed the good news on the Christmas bonus.  Having been abolished in 2009 by the previous Government, it is on its way to being fully restored, with a 75% restoration in the current budget.  Some 1.2 million recipients of social welfare payments will benefit from this, with payments to start from next week.  That development is hugely welcome.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, signed the regulations necessary to restore this portion of the bonus yesterday.  This news was also welcomed by Senator Brennan.</p><p>Senator Norris offered congratulations to Senator Barrett on his radio interview on the banking inquiry.  I did not hear the interview but others told me how good he was.  I join Senator Norris in congratulating him.  I gather that Senator Barrett made the point that the banking inquiry should not be allowed to fail because it is too important.  I know other colleagues cannot be here for the Order of Business because they are working on the banking inquiry.  We wish them well with it.</p><p>Senator Norris also spoke on the bankruptcy of Sir Anthony O'Reilly and offered his commiseration and concern at the news.  He noted the achievements of Tony O'Reilly, particularly in respect of the Ireland Funds and in his attempt to rescue Waterford Glass-Waterford Wedgwood.  I join Senator Norris in expressing concern.  I have my own family connection to Waterford Glass, which was established by my grandfather in 1946.  It was such an iconic brand.  Tony O'Reilly's work in trying to rescue it by investing a huge amount money is definitely to be noted and commended.</p><p>I also offer congratulations to Senator Norris on his being honoured by Trinity College this Friday.  I hope I can say that on the Order of Business without breaching any confidence.</p></speech>

We all offered our welcomes to Senator Cahill last week but I am happy to thank Senator Leyden for his words today.  I note that, as he pointed out, Senator Cahill will bring her unique experience and her Northern perspective and will make a really significant contribution in the weeks and months ahead.  Senator Leyden also referred to Sir Anthony O'Reilly and concurred with Senator Norris on that matter.</p> <p>Senator Quinn concurred with Senators Norris and Leyden on Tony O'Reilly and his great work on the Ireland Funds.  He also referred to crime issues and, in his customary way, put forward a constructive proposal for change.  I will bring the Senator's proposal back to the justice committee.  We have been holding hearings on rural crime recently.  I think his suggestion of setting up a policing helpline of the sort that is in place in the UK, which citizens can ring if they do not require an emergency response but have concerns around policing matters, is very positive and constructive.</p> <p>Senator Mullins expressed his concern about the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO proposal to take industrial action and pointed out the improvements that have been made.  In particular, he indicated that there have been improvements in the figures for those waiting on trolleys, although there are still far too many patients who are forced to wait.  Nonetheless, there has been a 20% reduction on the figure which obtained a year ago.  The Senator also referred to nurses' recruitment, which I have already mentioned, and expressed his hope that the issues may be resolved in advance of 15 December so that industrial action will not be necessary.</p> <p>Senator Cullinane called for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to come to the House.  I have responded to that.  The Minister was already in today on a Commencement matter and I have no doubt he will come in again in response to our request for a debate on accident and emergency departments and overcrowding.</p> <p>Senator Brennan welcomed the fact that the Christmas bonus will be paid and that 1.2 million recipients will benefit from it.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan referred to a meeting with SMEs in County Kerry and spoke on the cost of directory enquiries.  I was not aware that the cost was so high.  It might be something that could be raised as a Commencement matter.  It is certainly of concern if people are still paying very high rates.  This matter was raised some years ago in public debate.  I thought it had been dealt with and that the costs had come down.  Clearly, they have gone up again.  Senator O'Sullivan also referred to 600 extra teaching jobs.  I understood that they were full-time positions.  We can certainly make enquiries as to the nature of those posts.  As I recall, the announcement referred to full-time teaching posts.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke welcomed the calls for a debate on health care.  We have already put in a request for the Minister to come before us.  The Senator pointed out positive developments in health care, particularly the roll-out of free GP care for the two key vulnerable groups of children under six and people over 70 and the fact that we will move on to roll out free GP care to children under 12 in due course.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to a very particular case about which I had read in the newspapers.  I agree with him that it is a matter of grave concern in terms of sentencing.  Given the doctrine of separation of powers, it is not something in which we, as legislators, can intervene directly but it raises bigger questions about disclosure of information.  Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, it is an offence for a serving Garda to disclose confidential matters concerning investigations.  We do not know where the information in the public domain came from but it is a matter that clearly should be raised by the individual victim concerned.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill received pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last month.  It is being progressed, so I hope it will be brought before us in the next few weeks.  The case itself raises questions about bigger issues relating to the structure of the criminal justice system.  On Monday, I had the pleasure of attending an open policy forum hosted by the Department of Justice and Equality, which was attended by the Minister.  Indeed, she stayed for the full morning.  The forum was to look at the proposal to establish a criminal justice inspectorate.  This recommendation was made by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last year and has also been made by a number of bodies.  There is a model in Northern Ireland for a criminal justice inspectorate and the head of Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland spoke to us on Monday.  This is the sort of issue that could well come within the remit of a general inspectorate.</p></speech>

It must be acknowledged that public servants and public service pensioners have played a significant part in taking this country off its knees.  Five separate pieces of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation have contributed &euro;2.2 billion annually to stabilising the public finances.  Now, through the Government's prudent management of the economy, we are in a position to commence the unwinding of the financial emergency legislation.</p><p>This Bill, which is designed to give legislative effect to the negotiated provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement, illustrates that the Government is committed to the orderly unwinding of the existing legislation.  The terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement were approved by the Government on 3 June this year and accepted by the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, on 16 September following full consultation with its members.  The agreement provides for partial pay restoration to public and civil servants.  It also provides for a reduction in the level of pension-related deductions paid by public and civil servants.  The restorations are significantly weighted in favour of the lower paid.  These changes to the FEMPI measures require the Government to bring forward primary legislation to amend the existing Acts.</p><p>The Lansdowne Road agreement is not just about take-home pay.  In addition, it secures and enhances the considerable reforms the Government has delivered since 2011.  When we came into office, reform of the public service was a key component of our strategy to meet the enormous challenges we faced.  Collective agreements implemented by the Government provide for 15 million additional working hours by public and civil servants, helping the Government to provide additional services to citizens with fewer staff.  Under those agreements, we have seen overtime and other payments substantially reduced while other conditions relating to pensions, sick leave and holidays have all been amended.</p><p>The Lansdowne Road agreement builds on this progress and ensures public service and Civil Service reform will continue to play a key role in Ireland's recovery.  The agreement strikes the right balance between the legitimate aspirations of public servants for pay recovery and the objective of sustaining or improving public finances.  I have consistently acknowledged that during the crisis, the sacrifices of public servants and public service pensioners assisted in putting this country on the road to recovery while sustaining our public services.  Therefore, as economic growth returns and private sector wages increase, it is only right that all public servants and public service pensioners start to see their take-home pay improve.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Howlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Others take the view that the emergency is over and that the emergency legislation should be dismantled in its entirety immediately.  This would be wholly irresponsible.  While significant progress has been made, with employment on the increase, national debt in decline and public finances under control, we must be restrained.  We must manage the process in a responsible, sustainable way, with the long-term interests of the country at the centre of policy-making.  Therefore, this Bill is not about giving away in a reckless, unplanned manner but rather about giving back, in a measured and prudent way, to those who were committed to maintaining services in the face of the fiscal discipline that was required.<br/><br/>The estimated additional cost of the measures agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement is &euro;267 million next year, an extra &euro;290 million in 2017 and a further &euro;287 million in 2018.  In addition, the reduction of the public service pension reduction carries a cost of &euro;30 million for each of the years 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  The Bill is concerned with the amendment of prior legislation, predominantly the FEMPI Acts, so as to give effect to what has been agreed by the employer, that is, the Government, and the public service unions in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  As I have said, it is the first step in the carefully managed unwinding of the FEMPI legislation necessary for the pay and pensions of public servants to be restored.  As the House will see, the measures it introduces are proportionate and fair, with something given back to all, since all contributed, but with the lower paid standing to receive most, relative to where they were.<br/><br/>For the benefit of Senators, I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 3 concerns pay restoration for public servants.  It amends the FEMPI (No. 2) Act of 2009 to allow the reductions effected under that Act to be lessened.  It is important to stress that the nature of this is progressive and measured, with lower paid public servants standing to gain most proportionately.  It is also equitable, with the rationale being that since all public servants suffered pay reductions under the previous FEMPI Acts, all should receive relief of some kind.  The restoration will take place in the following way.  From 1 January next, public servants earning annual salaries up to &euro;24,000 will have their salary increased by 2.5%, while those earning between &euro;24,000 and &euro;31,000 will receive a 1% increase.  On 1 September 2017, the salary of all public servants earning less than &euro;65,000 will be increased by &euro;1,000.  As well as these measures, this section also reverses the additional pay cuts for the higher paid from 2013, as follows.  Where their annual salary is between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000, the amount by which it was reduced will be restored in two halves - first on 1 April 2017 and then on 1 January 2018.  This restoration was an agreed part of the Haddington Road negotiations and the Government is happy to follow through on the firm commitment we made with the unions.  For public servants with an annual salary of over &euro;110,000, the amount by which it was reduced will be restored in three equal parts - on 1 April 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.  This slower restoration of the cuts for this group is, I believe, proportionate and fair.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 4<b></b>amends the FEMPI Act 2013 to extend by a further two years the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales with respect to any public servants who are not encompassed by a registered collective agreement, as outlined in section 7 of that Act, that is, by the Haddington Road or Lansdowne Road agreements.  This provision follows the existing structure of the 2013 Act and is now extended to accommodate the newly negotiated Lansdowne Road agreement.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 5 deals with the pension-related deduction payable by all public servants and introduces measures to reduce it, putting money back into the pockets of those who have had to pay this additional levy on their wages for six years.  To this end, it amends the first FEMPI Act of 2009 so that this year's exemption threshold increases from &euro;15,000 up to &euro;17,500.  This provision provides for outstanding moneys due in respect of the small change effected in pension-related deduction rates under the Haddington Road agreement in January 2014, rather than in July 2013, when all other measures took effect.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Howlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=535"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=535&amp;amp;pid=BrendanHowlin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The cost of this is &euro;20 million.  From 1 January next year, the exemption threshold rises to &euro;26,083, so no income below that figure will be reduced.  This figure is a blended sum which equates with the provisions agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement whereby the threshold is increased to &euro;24,750 from 1 January 2016 and to &euro;28,750 per annum from 1 September 2016.  There were to have been two implementation dates next year.  For administrative  purposes, the two figures have been amalgamated into one which will operate from the beginning of the year in order to achieve the agreed reductions over the course of the year.  The full year effect of the new rate is then set for 2017.</p><p>Sections 6 and 7 confer the public service pension reduction, PSPR, payable by retired public servants on their pensions.  Both sections amend the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2010.  There are three groups affected by the public sector pension reduction.  They will all have the amount payable reduced over the next three years, through incremental increases in the threshold of exemptions.  The three categories of retired public servants who pay PSPR and will have their pensions partially and proportionately restored by the measures in the Bill include: those with pensions of over &euro;12,000 who had the levy imposed by the FEMPI Act 2010; those with pensions worth &euro;32,500 who are also affected by a further levy in the FEMPI Act 2013; and those who retired after 29 February 2012 and receive pensions over &euro;32,500 and thus were affected by the FEMPI Act 2013 only.  At the end of the implementation of this Act in respect of pensioners, any pensioner who has a pension less than &euro;35,000, and that is almost 80% of all public sector pensions, will have his or her pension fully restored once this Act is fully implemented.</p><p>Sections 8 and 9 are straightforward amendments to the FEMPI Act 2009.  The changes being made reflect the very different economic context in which we are now operating six years after the original Act and the need to adjust upwards in some cases rather than solely downwards, which was unfortunately the trend of late.  The original FEMPI Act gave the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the power to reduce the fees paid to health professionals for services provided to the State.  This amendment allows the Minister for Health to increase those payments and stipulates certain considerations to be borne in mind when doing so.  Similarly, section 9 will allow other Ministers, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to increase the fees paid by the State for certain services should he or she wish to do so.  This is to ensure that people who are paid by way of fees rather than by way of salary also benefit from the pay restoration.</p><p>Section 10 is necessary to allow an exemption to be made to the provisions of the FEMPI (No. 2) Act 2009 which prevents any increase in pay for public servants.  The 2009 Act, introduced by the last Administration, makes it unlawful to increase the pay of public servants, the exemption being allowed for here is where an increase is provided for in a registered collective agreement, such as Haddington Road agreement or Lansdowne Road agreement.  For example, in the Haddington Road agreement, it was agreed that teachers would cease to receive allowances for supervision and substitution but that from next year, 2016, their wages would be adjusted to reflect this.  The agreement was that teachers would agree to lose the allowance for substitution and supervision but from next year, that fee would be incorporated into their salaries and the provision in section 10 is to allow that to be done legally.  This will happen only to public servants who adhere to the agreements we negotiated with them.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the Bill, the last two sections deal with other Acts besides the FEMPI legislation.  Section 11 comprises amendments to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 in respect of the pay of the Judiciary.  These are in two parts, the first of which is to provide that the pay of the Judiciary will continue to be set by Government order but that such orders will no longer need to amend primary legislation.  This is done on the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and while not a significant change in itself, it ensures best legal practice is adhered to.</p></speech>
