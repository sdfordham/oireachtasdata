The Minister of State conveyed the message that he wanted to be in the House today for the debate but he was unable to reschedule a number of commitments.  We tried but, unfortunately, the Commencement matter could not be rescheduled to facilitate him.  In fairness, he has conveyed his concern on the issue.</p> <p>Some years ago I met John Gorman.  He was a 17-year-old lad caught up in the siege all those years ago.  He is a man of the highest integrity who, along with others, has campaigned for many years for recognition of what they did.  I met him with a former member of the Defence Forces from Donegal, Eunan Carroll.  Having met those two men of integrity I could see that a serious injustice had been done but it was not until I watched the film dramatisation of what had happened that this truly sank in.  A group of over 150 Irish soldiers heroically did their duty for United Nations international peacekeeping.  They had participated in what was probably one of the most remarkable military feats in military history in that not one of them lost their lives.  Sadly, the same was not true of many of the mercenaries on the other side of the conflict who attacked them.</p> <p>One might have thought they would come home to a hero's welcome after a month of imprisonment.  Instead, they were betrayed utterly by the powers that be, by those in the State caught up in this Cold War piggy-in-the-middle situation.  Worse than betrayal, they were allowed to be presented as cowards for all of these years.  They had to suffer that indignity as well.  Eunan Carroll tells me that he billeted with many of those men but they never talked about Jadotville.  They were involved in such heroic events over six days and they held their ground on behalf of the international community for six days.  Yet, subsequently, they felt unable to talk about it, such was the sense of betrayal among those men.</p> <p>With all due respect, giving scrolls is not going to cut it.  I strongly and passionately believe there needs to be a presentation of military medals of gallantry in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in for all the men who served that day.</p> <p>In the past week, two of those heroic men who served the United Nations during the days of the siege have lost their lives.  They have passed away after many years.  Sergeant John "Butch" McManus passed away this week and Bill Ready is being buried in Mullingar today.  Gathered at the funeral will be all his old comrades from Jadotville who are still alive.  As the years go on those numbers will grow smaller and smaller.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, contacted me.  I realise he shares my sense of determination on this issue.  We need to do more than simply hand out scrolls on account of the scale of the betrayal.  These men served the people with honour and exhibited extraordinary heroism during those days.  They came home and were betrayed for many years.  The only way that can be turned around is for the surviving members to be taken to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, together with members of the families of those who are deceased.  They should be brought to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and all should be presented with medals for military gallantry.  That would be an appropriate way to respond.  It would signify a reversal of the injustice they have endured.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#B00600"><p>I thank Senator Mac Lochlainn for raising this matter and for his passionate comments on behalf of the survivors and families of the deceased.  As the Senator pointed out, the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Kehoe, was keen be here personally to address this debate, but prior commitments precluded it.  Unfortunately, despite the agreement of the Senator and the Minister of State, it was not possible to have the debate rescheduled.</p> <p>I wish to reassure the House that the Government is fully aware of the bravery and heroism of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, who took part in the siege at Jadotville in September 1961.  Against this background, I wish to address the considerations and legislative restrictions around the award of medals.  I will proceed to outline the actions that have been taken to date by this Government and previous Administrations to recognise and honour these men.</p> <p>The issue of the award of medals to those in A Company was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to the then Chief of Staff, who forwarded the letter to the medals board.  The board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that it was not prepared to alter its findings.</p> <p>The legal position under Defence Forces regulations is that there is no provision for the Minister to make an award of the military medal for gallantry other than on the recommendation of a military board appointed by the Chief of Staff.  Nor is there any mechanism for a case to be referred back to a military board for fresh examination.</p> <p>In 2004 the then Minister for Defence initiated a re-examination of the Jadotville case on foot of a request from a retired Army officer.  The report that resulted was prepared by a board of military officers who fully exonerated the actions of A Company and recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given appropriate recognition.  Subsequently, in November 2005, a commemorative stone to honour their actions was unveiled in Custume Barracks, Athlone, attended by members of the company, their families and the families of the deceased members of the unit.  A bronze plaque was affixed to the stone with an inscription recognising their valiant actions.</p> <p>In November 2006 there was a presentation of scrolls to the members of A Company by the then Minister of State in recognition of their bravery.  In February 2007 portraits of Lieutenant Colonel McNamee, 35th Battalion commander, and Commandant Pat Quinlan, company commander, A Company, were unveiled at the Military College and now hang in the Congo room in the United Nations Training School Ireland in the Curragh.  In September 2011 a nominal roll of A Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th anniversary of the Jadotville affair.</p> <p>Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, decided to issue a unit citation and insignia to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion.  On 17 September 2016, the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville ,a special ceremony was held in Custume Barracks, Athlone, to present the unit citation to the company in recognition of their collective bravery, courage and professional performance during the siege of Jadotville when they were cut off from support and reinforcements.  During the ceremony a copy of the citation was presented to each member of the unit or to the next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.  In addition, to reflect the fact that the unit has received a citation, a special insignia has been commissioned which will be worn by each member of A Company.  A unit citation is used by a number of militaries as a way of recognising the collective actions and outstanding service of personnel attached to particular military units.  This was the first time such a unit citation was awarded in the Defence Forces.  The decision of the Minister provides a formal recognition of the collective bravery and actions of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#C00100"><p>The painting of Commandant Quinlan that hangs in the officers' mess, which the Minister of State mentioned, apparently refers to the misfortune that took place in Jadotville.  The Minister of State referred to the decision made in 1965.  That is no shock to me.  The true cowards with regard to Jadotville were those in the political establishment, and some in the military establishment, who allowed the names of those involved to be besmirched.  That is the profound damage.  Imagine being involved, as a young man, in that situation of heroism, defending the honour of the Irish people, taking part in peacekeeping for the United Nations and yet being treated like that for years afterward and feeling one could not even talk about Jadotville.  They were labelled the "Jadotville Jacks".  With all due respect, I do not believe that scrolls or the like are appropriate to reverse the betrayal those men faced.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has watched "The Siege of Jadotville" and we discussed this briefly last week.  Generations of Irish people never heard of Jadotville.  I had never heard of it until I met John Gorman and Eunan Carroll, but I know all about it now.  Many Irish people are deeply and profoundly angry to learn about the betrayal of those men.</p> <p>The Minister can refer to legislation, blockages and the reasons it cannot be done.  However, we can do anything we put our mind to in this State.  The way to right the wrong is not a matter for the Minister but for the President, Michael D. Higgins, in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, who can bestow the honour on those men and on the families of the deceased members.  Whatever it is, the appropriate honour must be bestowed at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, with the President acting on behalf of all of the Irish people.  I believe it should be the military medal for gallantry, the highest honour the State can award.  The Minister should forget about what has happened and about the legislative barriers involved and should make this happen.  He should work with his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, and raise it with the Taoiseach.  They must be made aware of the growing anger not just among the families of those men who carried it alone for all those years but in wider society, including among individuals such as myself.  There is growing outrage and anger about the failure to give them the honour they deserve.  The Minister must reflect on this and understand the hurt and the pain.  The appropriate way to reverse that is to take those people to the highest place of honour in the State - &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in - and honour them appropriately.</p></speech>

I will raise it with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  As I said, there is no provision under the Defence Forces regulations for the Minister of State to make an award of a military medal for gallantry.  The Senator or others will be able to check whether the legal position can be changed or how that can be done.  However, I will convey the Senator's concern to the Minister, Deputy Kehoe.  Perhaps the Senator could also write to the President, Michael D. Higgins, to convey his views and see if he can get involved.  I, too, had not heard about the siege at Jadotville or the issues involved until very recently and I have not had an opportunity yet to see the film.  However, I have read some of the media reports and I saw the television footage of the ceremony in Athlone in September.  As soon as I see the Minister of State, I will highlight the Senator's concerns and the passionate way in which he asked for these changes to be enacted.</p></speech>

The first is the recent presidential election in the United States and the second is the nurses' planned ballot for industrial action.  I want to address briefly the result recorded in the US presidential election.  I, like many, thought that Hillary Clinton would finally break the glass ceiling and we would see the first female President of the United States of America elected.  I was saddened to see the results pour in and the candidate who spent her life campaigning for women's issues lose.  It should be acknowledged that the Clintons have been great friends to Ireland and Bill Clinton's Administration in the 1990s focused on helping to secure peace in Northern Ireland.  I do not in any way seek to take from the democratic will of the American people and it is incumbent on political Administrations across the world to prepare to maintain our positive relationship with the United States under a Donald Trump Administration.</p> <p>However, I call on the Government to establish urgently a special task force to work with the American Administration to protect the many undocumented Irish who have built their lives in the United States.  We all know the deep bonds that have existed between our country and the USA for generations.  We know many Irish people emigrated during the Famine and they helped build the United States.  We know that many Americans proudly call themselves Irish-American and now many Irish living in the USA will be deeply concerned about what the future holds for them under the Trump Administration, given the hard-line approach he took towards emigrants during the campaign.  Those expressed views must leave undocumented Irish emigrants waking up in fear of what the coming years will bring.  It is important that they see their Government back home liaising with the Trump Administration to ensure that some efforts are made to resolve this emigration lacuna for them.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is the threatened ballot of nurses for industrial action.  We all know that we are living in very uncertain times.  We are in the middle of Brexit, we have seen our exports fall, we have seen tax receipts from the retail sector decrease and we have seen the markets become more turbulent in the wake of last night's election result.  We must ensure our public services continue to be protected in these uncertain times.  We also know that there are 3,800 fewer nurses in our health service working under immense pressure.  I know this because I have a family member who has been receiving services over the past 15 years during which there has been a steady decline of nurses.  I call on the Minister to engage actively with the union to ensure this strike does not go ahead.  The thought of this strike puts fear in the hearts of patients and their families.  I call on the Minister to engage with a view to resolving this dispute within the confines of the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p></speech>

We have Brexit, industrial relations problems that are bringing this country to its knees and, this morning, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.  Some weeks ago, I warned that we need to be careful in what we said about Mr. Trump because I predicted he might become President.  I also predicted that in Europe some weeks ago when people were slagging him off.  The bottom line is that he is now the President of the United States.  I congratulate him.  I wish him well for the future, and I sincerely hope he can work with the undocumented Irish in the United States.</p> <p>I congratulate and thank my colleague, Senator Mac Lochlainn, who raised the issue of the Jadotville heroes earlier this morning.  It behoves everybody in this Oireachtas to ensure these people are given more than a photocopy of the presidential citation.  I agree with Senator Mac Lochlainn that they should be brought to &Aacute;ras an &Uacute;achtar&aacute;in, given a military medal and recognised for what they are.</p> <p>I call on the Government to clarify the position with respect to county councillors' pay and PRSI issues.  E-mails are being sent from this House morning, noon and night promising the sun, moon and stars to our colleagues who put us in this House.  We must stop the messing and give them straight answers.  Do we intend to fix their PRSI issues and increase their salaries?  If not, we should tell them that straight out and stop the messing.  It is unfair on people.

I call on the Deputy Leader to organise a debate on foreign policy in this House in light of that election result because there are serious implications for Ireland on which other speakers have touched.  Ms Hillary Clinton's defeat is a huge disappointment for progressive politics, the cause of women in politics, and for Ireland.  It is fair to say that the undocumented Irish, the many people whose status in the US is uncertain, will be very concerned today.  Not only the Irish but many others will be facing a period of real uncertainty this morning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Donald Trump's victory has huge implications at international level in terms of climate change agreements - in respect of which he has made some comments - and of US foreign policy more generally.  I would like a debate on the cause of women in politics because the level of misogyny expressed during the US election campaign will be very off-putting for many younger women considering a career in politics.  As somebody who has always worked very hard to try to ensure that more women enter politics in Ireland and elsewhere, the outcome of the election is really worrying.  We need to express strong commendation of and support for Hillary Clinton and her campaign team for putting up such a strong fight and for ensuring the prospect of having a woman President in the US is no longer just hypothetical but is a real prospect.  I hope we will see that prospect come true for our daughters' sake, if not for our own.</p><p>I welcome the calling off of the ASTI industrial action and hope we will see a resolution through the talks and the intervention of a third party.  It is very welcome for all concerned.</p></speech>

He used to talk about the tyranny of democracy.  I was never quite sure what he meant but I have a better idea this morning given the result in America.  I am disappointed.  Anyone on the left would be disappointed with the result.  I blame the Democratic Party because it chose the wrong candidate.  It had a particular good candidate in Bernie Sanders who is genuinely of the left.  Hillary Clinton was damaged and, in many ways, what happened to her replicates what happened to the British Labour Party and, indeed, our Labour Party as a result of moving too far to the right for too long.  When they stood claiming to represent working people, those people looked at them and said, "We do not believe you."  It is a shame because we have ended up with the worst of all possible results.</p> <p>There will be serious implications for this country.  As part of his campaign, Donald Trump said he would slash tax rates for corporations in America.  That may have implications for future investment in this country.  No doubt we will hear the usual siren voices from the right demanding ever lower corporation tax rates here in response.  Those calls have already begun to be made in light of Brexit.  I predict that our two conservative parties will align their cause to embrace the race to the bottom in taxation, wages and public services in the year to come.  We should do the opposite.  We should embrace a call for fair taxation, good public services and decent wages.  We should build a broad political front for progress and a fair society.  If we do not, we will see the rise of the far right - now established with a new American President-elect - across Europe and Asia.  As matters stand, next March there will be a far-right government in the Netherlands and another in France a couple of months after that.</p> <p>What we are seeing is a repetition of what happened in the 1930s.  It behoves all of us who believe in progressive politics - I do not claim a monopoly on that because there are progressives in all parties - to try to work together to offer a real alternative based on a fair society.  There will be implications for the peace process because, for all her faults, Mrs. Clinton was committed to being a positive force for engagement in the North.  We cannot expect that level of help from Donald Trump.  As my colleague, Senator Ardagh, said, there will be implications for the tens of thousands of undocumented Irish in America.  Prospects to regularise these people have had a severe setback with this election.  I will be calling for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come in and have that debate on foreign affairs.  Perhaps there is merit in a task force because there is an awful lot of work ahead of us now to try - despite all of our reservations - to establish the best relations we can with this new regime and progress all the matters that are important to us in terms of our economy and our people.</p> <p>I want to highlight SIPTU's Big Start campaign, which relates to child care and which is being launched this morning.  There is a huge problem with child care in this country.  While there is some merit in the proposals from the Government, unfortunately they do not at all address the issues of pay and conditions for child care workers.  This needs to be addressed.  Clearly, we cannot be in two places at one time but I urge people to have a look at the SIPTU Big Start campaign.  I call upon the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to come before the House to explain why she has excluded trade unions from her committee on child care.</p></speech>

They effectively want to retreat within their borders and build a wall.  That wall should not be about a wall of minds.  These were and are great countries.  Ireland is now in a unique situation among the nations of the world.  It can be a conduit between the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, of which Ireland is a very strong and active member.  We can take that place.  Dublin is an international city and Ireland is a member of the international community.  I would like to think the Government will allocate an awful lot more resources to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and IDA Ireland in order that we might take the place to which I refer.  Ireland has proven itself as a member of the United Nations.  Various countries have been very good to us and now we must step up to the plate and try to work with our great friends in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.  Our country has a great future as the diplomat of Europe and the world.</p></speech>

We also commiserate with Hillary Clinton.  It was a very close call.  I recognise the contribution she and her husband made to the peace process in Ireland.  We now have a new situation.  I welcome very much the speech this morning by Donald Trump.  It was an embracing speech and one that would give hope.  Franklin D. Roosevelt said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  Donald Trump's ambition now is to rebuild America and its roads and bridges.  Who better to help than the Irish?  Mr. Trump has proposed a corporation tax of 15%.  Ours is 12.5%, so we are competitive.  The reason multinational companies are here is because it provides a foothold in a Europe of over 500 million people.  Mr. Trump's election does not change that.  Irish American companies employ over 100,000 people in the United States of America.  We are very strong.  There are also 25,000 undocumented Irish.  With Republican control of the Senate and House of Representatives and the Office of the President, it is now time for decisions to be made.  There must be an amnesty for those who are there.  There must be a properly regulated approach to emigration into the United States of America.  I believe this will come about.  CRH employs 24,000 people in the United States of America.  That workforce is placed in 47 states and the company is the largest producers of asphalt, aggregate and ready-mix concrete.  We are there and ready to help to rebuild America's bridges and roads.  We have to look out and forward and be progressive and realistic.</p> <p>I send my congratulations.  I propose that we send congratulations from this House to the President-elect of the United States of America and his Vice President-elect on their success in the election.  I hope the Taoiseach will present shamrock from the Trump golf club in Clare to President-elect Trump on 17 March 2017.</p></speech>

It was a unique election and, in many ways, the people doing the polling and those in the media really got it wrong this time.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of what we are doing in regard to legislating for the Irish Coast Guard service, an issue that has been raised previously.  At the moment, there is legislation for three of the primary response agencies, the fire service, the ambulance service and the Garda, but there is no legislation for the Coast Guard service.  It is only a footnote in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's agenda and is not treated directly as an emergency service.</p> <p>I call for a debate on this matter.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the Chamber to debate these issues and to outline the position of the 1,000 volunteers who work for the Irish Coast Guard service and where all their good work fits into the equation.  We need legislation that covers the Irish Coast Guard service and gives it a platform so it can increase its work profile to deliver more in outreach to the community, given it is a very important part of our coastal communities.  The service needs resources and needs to be more than just a footnote at the end of the Department's agenda.  If it was put on a legislative footing, it would give the service the impetus to move forward and become a more viable entity.  It needs to be supported.</p></speech>

We have just had a bitterly divisive US presidential election where one candidate, now the President-elect, decided to whip up anti-migrant sentiment and anger with the suggestion of building a wall on the Mexican frontier.  Here, on our island, there are 109 so-called peace walls dividing communities and enforcing segregation.  We want to see them consigned to the past.</p> <p>There is a disgusting undercurrent of populist anti-migrant sentiment creeping into mainstream political discourse across Europe.  What is happening in Calais and the despicable treatment of some of the most vulnerable people on this planet is vile.  Many blame the likes of UKIP.  However, the former Prime Minister, David Cameron, has a lot to answer for as he helped, through his actions, to unleash a level of mainstream bigotry on those of different colour and race.  It is worth remembering that one in four doctors in the NHS is a UK foreign national.  I used to be one of them.  The British health system, no more than our own in Ireland, would cease to operate if these bigots got their way.  The decision to hold a referendum to leave the EU was taken to appease the rebellious Conservative backbenchers who blame everything on Europe and foreigners.  We are all now reaping the fruits of what Cameron and others have sown.</p> <p>Separately, this Friday, as Senator Feighan noted, is armistice day.  England play Scotland at Wembley in a world cup qualifier and there is an ongoing dispute with FIFA about the plan for both teams to wear a black armband with a poppy on it.  In a great desire to appear even-handed, FIFA has decided to threaten the FAI and Ireland over the jersey worn, a photo of which I have with me, in the international friendly with Switzerland on 25 March last.  The jersey displayed the beautiful 1916 centenary logo.  Last week, a FIFA spokesperson said that the disciplinary committee of FIFA is evaluating the matter.  Is it some kind of sick joke that an organisation which presided over criminal mismanagement and questionable financial probity would have the cheek to try to sanction Ireland over this?  I remind Members that this logo is not the logo of the FAI, is not a commercial logo and is not a party-political logo.  It is the logo of this State and it is proudly on display in images on the website of the President, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to convey to FIFA in the most polite terms that it should get its own house in order before it starts interfering in the official State logo we have proudly used in this centenary year.</p></speech>

This means America will be travelling backwards socially for the next four years.  It is a great tragedy.</p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of our move into the museum space.  It is adjacent and it is certainly very convenient for Members, so there is no question but that it is very practical.  However, one cannot but listen to the voice of somebody like the very distinguished former director of the National Museum, Mr. Pat Wallace, who has made some very sharp comments indeed about this matter.

What struck me is that it is almost a carbon copy of Brexit.  Obviously, I wish to congratulate President-elect Trump.  The American people have spoken.  I also want to commiserate with Hillary Clinton.  The Clintons have been very good friends to Ireland.</p><p>We have a new president-elect in place.  It is important that Ireland protects its interests and works with President-elect Trump.  I note the Taoiseach has stated there will be continued bilateral relations and that we will have discussions around the issues of trade and immigration reform for the undocumented Irish.  At this moment in time, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote yet almost all of mid-America voted Republican.  I believe there is a disconnect between much of the electorate and the political system.  This is something we must take on board, as a country, in order to address those concerns.</p><p>Donald Trump wrote a book called <i>The Art of the Deal</i>.  We had a prominent American in the House recently.  I feel that Trump will probably end up being a very pragmatic politician.  It is about the art of the deal.  However, we have woken up today to the reality that the American people have spoken.  Regardless of what people think, we need to deal with that issue but we must also reflect on the point that this is virtually a carbon copy of Brexit.  There are issues that reflect back to some of the electorate here in Ireland and there are concerns.  There is a lesson in this for everyone.</p><p>It is important to note that Donald Trump has business interests in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Vice President-elect, Mike Pence, is an Irish-American.

People who apply to build a one-off house have to go to great lengths to prove their "intrinsic links" to an area.  Most of these applications are made in rural areas but some are made in rural towns.  Objectors can be from any corner of Ireland or even from outside the State.  They can place a legitimate negative statement or objection on file without having to prove the planning application will affect them in any way.  This is akin to giving guns to the inmates.  Why give someone with no links to the area the right to object to young people starting out in life with their hopes and dreams of a family and the security of their local area?  I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to address the House in this regard.  There is a serious imbalance in the planning process which must be addressed.</p></speech>

She is both capable and competent and, from a young age in college, she demonstrated her will and zeal for civil rights and equality.  Her commitment in this regard is well documented.  The US made history in electing a black President but on this occasion, the people did not want to continue in this vein and elect a woman President.</p> <p>As Members have alluded to, we have to be real.  Democracy has spoken and we all subscribe to democracy.  I join with those who have sent congratulations to President-elect Trump.  It has to be acknowledged he has succeeded against the odds.  He was not supported by the political establishment of the Republican Party and, as he said, it was not just a political campaign, it was a political movement.  He has given voice to an anti-establishment feeling among the majority of those who voted.</p> <p>His victory also reflects people's antipathy to political correctness.  Many people feel it is fake.  They are suffering and politicians are being bogged down by political correctness.  I agree and there is something to be learned from this.  Against all these odds, he has succeeded in a democratic forum.  We need to work with him and we need to get over ourselves, whatever other issues we have about what he does nor does not stand for.</p> <p>These issues can be discussed in another forum.  There is a great deal of trade between the US and Ireland.  There are many US multinationals here, with many of them being the mainstay of employment in my own county of Mayo.  I agree this result is similar to Brexit and we have to take a similar professional approach.  Along with joining Senator Leyden in asking that we send our congratulations from this House, I would like the House to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to address it at the earliest occasion he can do so.  We must accept that there is a new order.  We have to adapt and deal with that and we have to work with the President-elect.</p></speech>

It has come as a bit of a surprise to the majority of us, similar to the Brexit vote.  Perhaps there is a message for all of us that a large cohort of people feel disenfranchised and disconnected from the general populous.  We would be foolish to ignore this and I address that remark to all politicians.  To coin a phrase, we are where we are and we have to get on with it and respect the wishes of the American people.</p> <p>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills an issue that has arisen in respect of SUSI grants, particularly for applicants who live independently?  The general consensus is SUSI is working well and I compliment the staff.  However, an issue has arisen for those who live independently and who do not meet the tight criteria SUSI applies.  An example is a person on the rent-a-room scheme or someone who is renting an apartment and in receipt of a rent reduction for whatever reason.  They do not seem to meet the black and white criteria of SUSI.  It is disappointing that this barrier should exist at a time we are trying to encourage as many people as possible into further education.  Will the Leader bring this anomaly to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills in order that it can be addressed as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

She was a good friend to this country.  The media and the polls got it wrong.  People laughed on national radio about Mr. Trump and his carry-on but there is a lot of egg on a lot of people's faces.  I would like us to open up Spike Island for all the celebrities who supported the Clintons and said they would leave America.  We might have a bit of room for them down there because many of them were going to leave if Mr. Trump became President.  He got the message right in the final two weeks about working class families and the way in middle America factories, coal mines and the steel industry were closed down.  He hit the right chord and it won him many votes.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, my local newspaper reported on the closure of accident and emergency departments, including the one in Navan hospital.  The following week, politicians were saying it was not closing but it might close.  Will the Minister for Health come to the House to let us know what is going on in accident and emergency departments that are threatened with closure or only opening for 12 hours?  I would like him to come to the House to give us the full picture in order that we can debate the issue and not have politicians going to local newspapers scaremongering and getting people out to march around towns when there is no need to.</p></speech>

I am sorry poor Hillary Clinton has not made it but, as a nation, we will have to deal with the American President.  We have a great relationship as a country with America and no other country has the same access we have on St. Patrick's Day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Very few other countries have a national day when the US President automatically meets a leader.  I hope that next year our Taoiseach, whoever it is, will be there to meet Donald Trump with the bowl of shamrock.  As Senator Leyden said, it is possible that may come from his own golf course.</p><p>Nobody has mentioned it yet but I welcome the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, and the Department attending talks at the Teachers Conciliation Council with the chair, Ms Anna Perry.  It is very important.  I raised the issue the week before the mid-term, in that we were looking at one further scheduled day of school because of strike action on the Thursday before the break.  It is very welcome that last night the ASTI agreed to suspend its action, although we cannot be complacent about it.  I am the chairman of a school board and the action of the ASTI caused enormous difficulty for school boards, pupils, parents and teachers.  It would be helpful if the Leader could get the Minister in to speak to us about the difficulties so we could air them.  According to the ASTI deputy general secretary, there is a very big gap between the Department and the ASTI.  I welcome the development but we cannot be complacent.  It would helpful to have the Minister before us to explain where he is going on this.  We cannot allow a position to develop where more than half the secondary schools in the country are closed with parents and pupils being seriously discommoded.  Students, particularly those in exam years and studying for junior and leaving certificates, should not be put in a position where they cannot have their normal curriculum dealt with.  They may be competing with other pupils who are getting taught because they are in a school with Teachers Union of Ireland or non-ASTI staff.</p></speech>

I ask for a debate on the Irish language, Gaeltacht and island affairs.  It was noted that such a debate would occur in the House but to date it has not occurred.  Is it possible to bring the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, come before the House for that debate?</p> <p>I add to the congratulations and sentiments of goodwill towards President-elect Trump.  I am not particularly shocked by the outcome, to be honest, when we drill down through some of the detail of voter apathy and democratic interchange with the way political correctness, as has been referred to, has gone a bit mad, particularly right through the media, not just in America but across the developed world.  The ordinary voter does not really get political correctness and he or she is more concerned by his or her own economic whereabouts.  America has an unemployment rate of only 4.9%, which would be the envy of any European country, but people were still disenfranchised in a way so they voted as they did.</p> <p>There is a message here for political parties and politics in general.  As politicians, and particularly leaders in politics, we must stop following the media and instead set the agenda.  The politicians are forgetting to listen to the people and instead they are following the melee of media commentary on where a country or society wants to go.  They are forgetting to ask or to lead people where they should go.  There is a message there for us.  We will now see the fallout, and it will extend to this country as well due to the quite na&iuml;ve decision of the Taoiseach and other Ministers to deny an opportunity to meet Mr. Trump if he had been available to come here as a Republican nominee before the presidential election.  The issues remain.  We have St. Patrick's Day and there are many Irish citizens living in the United States.  It is vital that engagement is instigated with the new Administration with President-elect Trump at an early date.</p> <p>I ask the Acting Leader to facilitate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in coming to the House to discuss how those bridges can be built with the new Administration.  That will not only see President-elect Trump in the White House but it will also see the Republicans controlling Congress.  There are serious issues at stake.</p></speech>

Equally, I join other Senators in congratulating President-elect Trump.  We have nothing to fear and there is a great relationship between the two countries.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, will be there with him on St. Patrick's Day, as is traditional.  I appreciate very much Senator Mulherin's proposal to invite him but I presume, now that he is President-elect, that the Taoiseach will invite him to make a joint address to both Houses of Parliament here.  I have no doubt he will speak about his visit to Ireland when they meet, and that could be before St. Patrick's Day.  We have much to look forward to, although there are some regrets about the other candidate, with whom we commiserate.  We must look forward in a positive way and we do.  Events happen.  Who was surprised that the pollsters got it so wrong?  Look at what happened with Brexit.  It is becoming a pattern, is it not?  We are going forward with optimism and confidence.</p></speech>

The Leader gave a commitment he would be in within the next couple of weeks.  I would like a date to be arranged for that, as there are a number of important issues we wish to raise with him.  I also welcome the decision by the ASTI to call off its industrial action and to enter discussions with the Department of Education and Skills.  As we are all aware, disputes are always sorted out by talking.  The teachers have called off the strike and are speaking with the departmental officials.  I hope those discussions will be meaningful on the part of the Department.  This House should offer whatever encouragement it can to the Minister for Health in cutting off at the pass any threatened industrial action by nurses.  They have a very legitimate case and should be listened to.  The issue should be dealt with as a matter of urgency before it comes to strike action.</p> <p>Finally, I join other colleagues in congratulating President-elect Trump on his election as the next President of the United States.  I understand the Taoiseach will be in contact with him today to offer his congratulations on behalf of the people of this country.  I encourage the Taoiseach to invite President-elect Trump to visit this country as President of the United States of America.  There is a very special relationship between the peoples of both countries and I want to see that relationship continue in a positive manner.  I hope President-elect Trump will have an open door policy for St. Patrick's Day that has been the tradition for many decades.  I support Senator Mulherin's proposal that unless there is a joint address to both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I would like to see him addressing this House as well.  I wish him well.  I believe he will be pragmatic and we have already seen a change in tone.  I hope that continues and he will take into account everyone living in the United States of America.  Our relationship with America is very important to this country and I would like to see it continue.</p></speech>

I thank all of them for their contributions.</p> <p>The 127 million people who voted in yesterday's elections in the United States used the democratic system to decide who their leader will be for the next four years.  We have to respect the decision they have made.  I join others in conveying my congratulations to Donald Trump on his election.  I wish him and his country well over the next four years.  Like this country, the US is facing major challenges not only in local communities and urban areas, but also from an international point of view.  As the US is a major player on the international stage, it is important for Ireland to work with it to deal with the many issues we face domestically and globally.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to some of the challenges we are facing in Ireland, including the plight of more than 50,000 undocumented Irish people in the US and the need to deal with the industrial challenges we face.  We have to work with the American authorities to try to deal with such issues.  When this country decided many years ago to introduce a 12.5% corporation tax rate, it was pursuing a policy of looking into the future and making sure it would be ready and able to deal with challenges like those arising now because of the changes that are about to be proposed in the US.  American companies are based in Ireland because they want to access the European market of 500 million people.  Ireland is an important location from that perspective because it has skilled young people, educational institutions, infrastructure and the supports provided by all the service industries that serve these companies.  We have been fortunate.  Nine of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies are based in America but have a presence in Cork.  They have done well to employ people.  The issue of how Cork has done so well to attract international companies was raised at last night's Cork Chamber of Commerce dinner in Dublin, which I attended.  I hope other areas of the country will do similarly well and we will continue to attract investment to this country.  I agree with Senator Ardagh that we need to work even harder on this issue.  As a number of Senators said, we need to ensure IDA Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade get far more personnel and financial support so that this country has a presence in the places where decisions are made.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh also raised the prospect of industrial action by nurses.  I agree with her that this is an important issue.  I think the Government is fully committed to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The work of the public service pay commission, which was established recently, is getting under way.  The commission will make a valuable input into the future development of public pay policy.  I agree that the nurses' issue should be dealt with fairly within the whole process of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We cannot go outside that at this time.  We are facing major challenges in this country as a result of Brexit and the policy changes that will occur in the US.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about Brexit, industrial relations problems and councillors' pay.  I can inform him that a Committee Stage amendment to the Social Welfare Bill will address the PRSI issue.  That will be dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill to ensure councillors will have the same entitlements as self-employed people.  This change is coming about.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is dealing with the other aspect of the matter.  I am sure he will come back on that issue in the not too distant future.  I will raise with him the concerns that have been highlighted by Senator Craughwell and other Senators.  As recently as yesterday, I was contacted by councillors who believe this cannot be left unchanged and must be addressed within a short period of time.</p> <p>Senator Bacik and a number of other Senators spoke about foreign policy.  I agree with Senator Bacik that it might be appropriate to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to speak about how we might deal with the foreign policy issues and changes that are arising in the context of Brexit and the changes that are occurring in the US.  I will certainly make such a request because it would be appropriate to facilitate Senators in raising with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade their concerns about how the Department is planning for the future.</p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the decision to call off the ASTI industrial action and strike.  I remind the House that there are four different industrial disputes between the ASTI and the Department.  It is not just one issue.  I hope all four issues with the ASTI can be resolved.  It is important for our educators to be able to get on with the job they want to do and for our students to be able to get the benefits they want to get from our education system.</p> <p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of corporation tax in the context of the US election.  It is not that long ago that his party was complaining about the rate of corporation tax, which goes to show that all the parties which were in agreement about the 12.5% rate were correct.  I remind the Senator, who spoke about "the race to the bottom", that despite this country's economic downturn over the last five years, over &euro;20 billion was provided each year to make sure people with disabilities, the unemployed and people who suffered as a result of the recession received the proper supports.</p> <p>While I agree with the Senator that this was not enough, in fairness there was a change in last month's budget in relation to increases.  The total daily cost of our social welfare budget is &euro;57 million, which is a huge amount of money.  It is important to emphasise that we cannot provide for social welfare increases or support people on lower pay unless we make sure there are more people back at work.  If we want to be able to pay for services, we need to ensure an increased amount of tax is coming in.</p> <p>Senator Gavan also highlighted the pay and conditions of child care workers, who play an important part in our society.  We need to be conscious of this issue and keep it under review.  It might be worthwhile for the Senator to table a Commencement notice to make sure the Minister is aware of his anxiety with regard to this important issue.  I think this concern is shared by every Member of this House.</p> <p>Senator Feighan reminded us that 11 November is Armistice Day and mentioned that between 25,000 and 30,000 Irish people died in the First World War.  It is important to recognise their commitment and acknowledge that they died so that we might have the freedom to say what we believe in today.  It is important that we give recognition to Armistice Day and to the many people who died.</p> <p>Senator Feighan said that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and IDA Ireland should get the support they need as they face major challenges.  I have already referred to the need for additional staff.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Leyden also referred to the US election.  He acknowledged the contribution former President Bill Clinton made to Northern Ireland and it is important that we acknowledge both Hilary and Bill Clinton.  We must acknowledge the amount of time and effort he, and all of those involved, invested in order to ensure that the peace process worked.  Mr. Clinton made a major contribution to ensuring it worked and was delivered on.  I agree with Senator Leyden.  I listened to this morning's speech by the President-elect, Donald Trump.  It was very conciliatory.  While we all may have different views about how things should be done, we all have a common interest in trying to improve the lives of everyone and ensuring that people who are less fortunate get the necessary support.  The Senator also raised the very important issue of the contribution of Irish people in building and rebuilding America.  Vincent Browne recently interviewed somebody from Castlegregory, County Kerry, who is building tower blocks in New York on his television programme.</p></speech>

I will convey his concerns to the Minister.  It might be appropriate to table a Commencement Matter and have the Minister come before us in order to try to expedite the issue.</p> <p>Senator Keith Swanick raised the concerns about the anti-migrant sentiment.  He also referred to FIFA.  I have no difficulty speaking to the Leader and asking him to deal with the matter.  I will convey the concerns FIFA had regarding the logo on the Ireland jerseys.  The Leader might be the person to deal with that matter.  The Senator said one out of four doctors in the UK is of non-UK origin.  In Ireland, 38% of our doctors are non-Irish graduates and we need to be conscious of the contribution they are making to our health service.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised concerns about the National Museum and the Cathaoirleach dealt with the matter.  I will pass the Senator's concerns on to the Leader and ask the latter to revert to him.</p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the US election and the fact that the Vice President-elect is Irish American.  It is important that we send our congratulations to the Vice President-elect on the role he will play in the next four years and wish him well.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to the maritime and foreshore Bill.  I will raise the matter with the Minister.  A Commencement matter might be an appropriate way to bring it forward and get the Minister in to give the Senator some idea on the issue.  I am not passing the buck.</p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the very important issue of serial objectors.  A major development in the midlands - I will not mention it by name - has gone beyond An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Senator raised a very serious concern, especially regarding young people.  I was recently approached about a similar case involving a young couple who want to build a house on an outlying farm but whose plan has been objected to by somebody from outside the area.  This is a major concern, particularly when it is so expensive to build new homes.  Families can contribute by giving sites to their children or whomever.  This is being restricted as a result of planning objections and uncertainty.</p></speech>

I agree with her in that regard.  We should have no difficulty in inviting the President-elect to Ireland.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher referred to the US election and SUSI grants.  I will raise his concerns regarding the latter with the Minister for Education and Skills, and I hope the Minister will come here in the near future to deal with a number of education issues.  It might be appropriate to put down a Commencement matter to get the Minister to provide a written response on it.  While I can convey my comments on it and get the Minister to respond to the Senator, a Commencement matter might be the way to deal with it.</p> <p>Senator Butler referred to accident and emergency departments.  I am sorry if it looks like I am passing the buck.  However, if the Senator has a concern in respect of this issue, then a Commencement matter might be the way to obtain full clarification.  I will convey his concerns to the Minister.</p> <p>I have dealt with Senator Gerry Horkan's issues, namely, the ASTI, the US election and the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to come before the House.  It would be appropriate to get the Minister here given that a number of Senators want to raise a number of issues including the strikes, the ASTI, a number of industrial issues and SUSI grants.  I will ask the Minister to come to the House at an early date.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the US election and the part played by the media.  The latter operate in a democratic system and we must respect their contribution.  We cannot criticise them.  They are doing a job and dealing with election coverage in what they feel is the appropriate way.</p> <p>Senator Coghlan also raised the US election and the prospect of inviting the President-elect to Ireland, which I have dealt with.</p> <p>Senator Wilson referred to the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I have no difficulty in asking the latter to come here to deal with a number of issues about which the Senator has concerns.  I will ask him to do so.  I think he will be here reasonably soon.  I will ensure the Senator gets a response.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#W00400"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:&ldquo;(5) The Roads Acts of 1993 and the Roads Act of 2007 may be cited together as the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  We are discussing the Heritage Bill, yet I understand a primary concern for most people is the issue of road safety.  I am tabling this amendment to ensure that road safety, which is paramount to public health and safety, is dealt with where it should be dealt with, namely, under the Roads Act.</p><p>This Bill, as formulated, does nothing to address or enhance road safety.  I realise that issue is at the forefront of the concerns of all Senators.  This is why I have proposed amendments Nos. 1 and 6.  These amendments take steps to simplify and increase the ability of councils to apply the existing provisions of section 70 of the Roads Act and section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  These sections already permit cutting of hedgerows, even outside the permitted cutting period, in the interests of road safety.</p><p>This amendment will allow landowners to apply to the local council to cut where a danger arises while maintaining necessary environmental oversight.  These amendments will also go some way to ensuring that such necessary cutting can be centrally recorded in the interests of better data collection as well as to enhance the sensitivity of such work on the affected habitats.</p><p>These measures can form a new basis for the approach we take to hedgerow management and road safety, much like the approach being pioneered by councils in Clare, Donegal and Tipperary.  These councils have initiated pilot projects to encourage a joint approach, involving communities and landowners, in the cutting of hedges and trees where they need attention.  The Clare scheme provides a grant of &euro;50 per kilometre of roadside hedge or overhanging trees requiring attention.  The Bill is devoid of this type of innovation.</p><p>I wish to be perfectly clear.  The Heritage Bill, as it stands, does nothing in terms of road safety.  Road safety is already clearly provided for under the Roads Act.</p><p>I believe that the confusion that has arisen among councillors and the public in respect of the Heritage Bill is very much related to road safety.  I put it to the Minister that it is incumbent on the Government to explain clearly that farmers, landowners and the public can make provision for road safety in the existing law under the Roads Act and these powers need not be included in the Heritage Bill.</p><p>I am keen for the Minister to recognise that the Heritage Bill, as it stands, has nothing to do with road safety in respect of protecting the health and safety of the public, farmers and the people.  This amendment will go some way toward creating clarity on the matter.</p></speech>

This matter should not be dealt with as part of the Heritage Bill.  The Senator's amendment to deal with the matter under the Roads Act 1993 is the proper and most efficient way.  If we want to be seen as a clean, green and environmentally aware, then attacking our hedgerows through a back door element is not acceptable.</p> <p>Let us be honest.  If the real fear is that hedgerows are blocking signage or junctions, there is already adequate legislation.  If the existing legislation is not adequate, then the Senator's amendments clear up any mystery or confusion.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#W00600"><p>I support the amendment.  The amendment proposed by Senator O'Sullivan is indeed a proposal to deal with road safety.  It is fundamental and important.  The Roads Act is the correct and appropriate place to deal with the question of road safety.  It is altogether discomfiting to see that the wrongly-named Heritage Bill and the Wildlife Act should be the focus of proposals relating to road safety.</p><p>Previously, the Government undertook consultation on the question of hedgerow cutting.  The report following the Government consultation relating to hedge cutting stated clearly:</p><blockquote>...any changes must be in line with Ireland's obligations to protect and enhance our habitats, birds and other species and not to increase the threat to them.  This will be an overriding consideration in any proposals for change.</blockquote> <p>Instead, we are seeing the opposite approach whereby we are over-riding, in every sense, our obligations to nature to apply a blunt and inappropriate instrument to the question of road safety.</p><p>I will come back to the concerns relating to section 8 presently, but first I will speak to the amendment put forward by my colleague, Senator O'Sullivan.  Her proposals amount to actual concrete measures to deal with road safety.  The amendments set out how an individual or group who are concerned about road safety in respect of any area of hedgerow or overhang would be in a position to go to a local authority and request the use of a section 70 order.  We are seeking something that would strengthen the practical implementation of road safety.  We seek measures whereby those who are concerned can take immediate action and have a route to action.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under the Minister's proposals set out in section 8, there is no resource for a concerned member of the public, a pedestrian or a family with children who wish to cycle to and from work to act to strengthen road safety.  They are reliant on the old measures and on the potential random will of a landowner.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 is a precise, useful targeted proposal to deal with a measure.  It provides for the taking of responsibility.  It provides that the local authority has responsibility and there is a root of accountability for how hedgerows are cut.  The Minister also has responsibility.  In the alternative that has been put forward we see an abrogation of responsibility for road safety.  The Government and local authorities are saying that they will leave the matter entirely up to an individual landowner and that they will abrogate their responsibilities in terms of being fully accountable for issues of road safety.  There is a washing of hands with respect to road safety.  That alternative would disimprove road safety in Ireland.  In contrast to that, I urge those who have genuine concerns to say that the inclusion of amendment No. 6 would be the instrument which would allow the Minister to address the concerns of those who may have contacted her on road safety issues.   Amendment No. 6 provides for the insertion of the words "the removal or destruction of vegetation required by a notice served by a local authority under 70 of the Roads Act 1993" and the words "Such works shall be considered exempted for the purposes of section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976".  We have a precision instrument which allows, where it is necessary, any exemptions already under the Wildlife Act.  That is provided; we have that capacity.  </p><p>Before we discuss this amendment further and consider voting on it, I would like to hear from the Minister why the precise instrument that is already provided for under section 70, which allows for a suspension of section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 in clear cases where it is necessary where it serves a purpose of public safety, is not considered adequate.  Moreover, why is the proposed extension of that to ensure that any concerned member of the public can take action not considered adequate for the purposes of road safety?  I have not heard any concrete argument as to why this is not already an adequate solution, except that it abdicates responsibility and means that less responsibility is placed on local authorities to take action and to be responsible and accountable for the decisions.  If something is dangerous in July, it is dangerous in August, and if it is dangerous in September, why precisely would we seek to change things simply in August and in March if there was such a fundamental problem with road safety?  If there is an area where there is a dangerous overhang of an hedge, under the proposals set out in the Bill, no member of the public would have recourse to have it addressed.  I have had extensive correspondence, as many other Members will have had, from many pedestrians and cyclists who speak about the protection offered to them by hedgerows and their importance to them.  They are some of the most vulnerable road users yet they have been some of the most adamant in calling for a responsible targeted approach rather than the slash and burn approach we see being put forward.</p><p>I urge all Members to consider and support this amendment put forward by Senator Grace O'Sullivan and if there are aspects of it that are of concern, we will have an opportunity on Report Stage to further strengthen and amend our Road Safety Acts, to ensure that any concerns are addressed.  I  urge Members to support amendment No. 6 and change section 10 accordingly. </p></speech>

I point out that the last time this Bill was presented by the Minister I was the only person in the House to put forward any opposition to it.  I could not even get a Member to stand as a teller or to be a seconder.  It is marvellous that we have this new group of people.  The Labour Party has changed its stance on this measure as well.  There is a possibility that we will get some of these amendments through today.  There is a significant change in the political context of this House which makes it much more likely that this silly series of legislative proposals should be attacked.  They were introduced for political purposes in the run up to an election to get the farmers' vote.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il was very delicate.  Its members could not come out against it because they did not want to lose the farmers' vote.</p> <p>My name should have been at the bottom of all these amendments but there was a mix up even thought I indicated that I would put my name to them, but it does not matter and it does not prevent me from speaking on them.</p> <p>One of the issues in this context that the Minister made great hay with, to use a metaphor that is surely appropriate, was the danger to life and limb on the roads.  This situation is fairly unusual because if a hedgerow is maintained properly and cut every year when the opportunity arises, it is very unlikely there will be such an enormous growth that the road will be blocked.  There maybe a little overhang of the hedge but nothing very much.  It would only be in a few cases that this would occur.  It seems the Roads Acts is the legislation within which to deal with this.  The business about burning, grubbing up and cutting the hedgerows was all introduced willy-nilly by the Minister.  Therefore, I am very happy to support this amendment.</p></speech>

We will support the amendment because the scientific argument for the cutting of the hedgerows at an earlier time in the year has not been put forward as strongly as we would like.  When we discussed this issue with Michelle O'Neill, a former Minister for agriculture in the North, we heard that they had a similar issue there.  I note the timing of the cutting here is in alignment with the timing of the cutting in the North.  We would prefer to err on the side of caution if the science is put forward that says that no damage can be done to the species in question in the hedgerows.</p> <p>It is important to understand there is a great frustration among rural communities about the maintenance and upkeep of hedges in particular.  The proposed amendment No. 6 goes a long way to address that.  It would allow a farmer or another person in a rural locality to go to the local authority and highlight that there is a road safety issue or that people have to walk in the middle of a country road, which can be equally dangerous, to avoid an overhanging hedge.  People can apply for permission in that respect from their local authority and that just needs to be notified.  That is a logical provision.  It is probably the prudent way to approach the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Minister will take on board the amendment in the spirit in which it is being put forward.</p></speech>

I refer to hedge cutting and hedgerows, both on farmland and along country roads throughout the country.  Farmers, by their nature, have been the custodians of the countryside and have protected hedgerows to the best of their ability, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for many years.  There are issues which - not from a farming but, rather, from a road safety point of view - must be addressed to allow for the cutting, in a very restricted manner, of vegetation that is overgrown and that is causing a health and safety or motoring hazard.  I include, in the latter regard, hazards to pedestrians, cyclists and runners on country roads, the hedges running alongside which become overgrown in the summer.  As someone who runs a lot on country roads every month of the year - but particularly during the summer - I have some experience of being pushed into hedges when trucks come along because the hedges are overgrown and vehicles cannot get by.</p><p>There is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The question that arises is how best to address it.  I remember when Second Stage of Bill was debated earlier in the year.  During the public consultation period, some 188 submissions were made on the issue relating to hedgerows by members of the public, interest groups, local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Indeed, very many good submissions were made to Senators by interested members of the public in recent days.  I wish to thank those people for contacting us to raise their concerns.</p><p>One of the submissions was made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which raised the issue of hedge cutting.  The Department identified the possible discrepancy between section 40 of the Wildlife Act and section 70 of the Roads Act 1993.  The Roads Act 1993 states:</p><blockquote>The owner or occupier of land shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a public road.</blockquote> <p>Therefore, if there was a road safety issue, one would imagine the landowner could take precautions to trim back the hedges along a public road.  Unfortunately, this is contradicted by - or there is a discrepancy in - the Wildlife Act, wherein section 40 allows only for local authorities or other Government bodies to carry out such remedial works as hedge cutting during the closed season in the interests of public safety.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine suggests that an amendment should be considered to section 40(2)(c) of the Wildlife Act.</p><p>Given this discrepancy, there is a question around whether we are going to have <i>carte blanche</i>in this Bill and allow all hedges, whether they interconnect with a public road or not, to be cut back in the closed season or the extension of the closed season in August.  That needs to be clarified.  We support the cutting back of hedges in the month of August in a very controlled way, but only those that interface with public roads and only on health and safety and road traffic grounds.</p><p>Why is the position not defined in the legislation?  Is it the Minister's intention to bring forward amendments on Report Stage?  I would rather not see this addressed in regulation because, with no disrespect to the Minister, there will be further Ministers down the road who can amend that regulation without having to come before the Houses.  The types of hedges to which we are referring need to be clearly defined in the primary legislation, otherwise what is proposed is very disingenuous.  We are trying to say it is for road users and to make our roads safer in the month of August, but we are also allowing other hedges to be cut.  There is an issue which needs to be clarified.  I hope there is some rationale for this but, to date, from the departmental briefing documentation available and from what is contained in the Bill, I have received no clarification.  Therefore, the questions being raised by members of the public and interest groups remain unanswered.</p></speech>

This is important legislation, wherever we are coming from or going to.  The issue relating to hedgerows  is a major one in respect of which we have all been canvassed and there are very different views on the approach we need to take.  The Minister's proposal of a two-year pilot programme is important and appropriate.  In considering the hedgerow issue, we should step back and look at what we did in the past and what we aim to do in the future.  There is an unusual situation in the Burren in County Clare whereby, because there was no burning, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is paying people to go in and cut out the willow this year.  We have to look at how we manage our habitats.  While I am not saying that this is the appropriate way to proceed, we must consider all angles.  We do not know until we try.  The Minister is trying something different and she must be supported in that.  Ultimately, what has happened has not been effective.</p> <p>On the issue of hedgerows being cut in August, this is very appropriate given that they die away in September in any event.  What is the point of having local authorities spending large sums cutting hedgerows that are dying away?  August is the peak time.  It comes after the growth in July and when the deep, dense hedgerow is there.  Something must be done to ensure the safety of rural roads and that the people who use them are protected.  That is what the Minister is trying to achieve.</p> <p>From an agricultural point of view, we all know how the weather changes in September.  If a farmer is to do anything on a land holding, such as reseeding or other work, August is the appropriate time to do it, particularly as the weather turns so fast.  Two years ago, nothing was done in September because the weather turned, which was due to nature and the environment in which we are living.  The two-year pilot period proposed by the Minister is the appropriate step.  We must take on board that pilot scheme and then make a conscious decision as to what has worked or not worked.</p> <p>With regard to what has happened in the Burren, we decided 30 years ago we were not going to do any more burning there and that the habitat would be allowed to run wild.  We are now paying contractors to go in to cut out the willow because it has taken over the Burren.  We have to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Let us look for something new and see what we can do.  We can look at this Bill again in two years' time.  I am sure the Minister will bring forward her report after two years and we will have a fair idea then of what has happened with regard to this two-year project.</p></speech>

It brings me such joy to see all the wonderful, beautiful wildlife we have in Ireland.  Unfortunately, what is being proposed in the key provisions of this Bill would add one more month to the period during which hedgerows can be cut and destroyed.  The latter will allow hedge cutting and removal in August and more burning in the mountains and uplands in March.  This will have a damaging impact on nesting birds and the life cycles of other wildlife.  While I am repeating much of what others have said, I think it is important that it should be said.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->During these months birds are trying to lay eggs and raise chicks, and other wildlife, such as bees and hedgehogs, are still dependent on these ecosystems.  Our wildlife requires protection, at least until the end of August and in some cases well into September.<br/><br/>I have been inundated, as we all have, with letters and e-mails from citizens from all around Ireland who are extremely concerned about what is being proposed in this Bill.  I have been touched by all the correspondence I received and I felt it was important that people's voices are heard here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is an e-mail I received from a woman in Tipperary and I hope she is watching in today because I was moved by it.  It states:</p><blockquote>Dear Ms. Black,<br /><br />As I write this email I am sitting looking out my kitchen window at the bird feeders hanging on a nearby tree.  I cannot tell you how much pleasure I get from looking at the birds who visit this feeder each day.  I am more than certain that the pleasure I get observing their daily activities has helped me to be a happy and content person.  Lots of my neighbours, many elderly, also have a huge love of nature and speak to me frequently about observing and feeding the little birds who visit their gardens.  These birds fly to the feeders from the nearby hedgerows.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that section 40 of the Wildlife Act is to be amended to allow hedge cutting in the month of August.  From observing birds, I know that many of the species are still sitting on eggs or feeding their young chicks, which are still in the nests, in the month of August.  This was especially apparent in the last two years when because of cold and wet weather the Spring/Summer season was delayed by almost 4 weeks.  Hedge cutting in the month of August would be detrimental to so many species, many of which are already in decline.<br /><br />I am not a member of any political party or group; I am just a concerned nature lover who is extremely upset at the prospect of what this amendment to the wild life act will do to the beautiful nature I see around me daily.  I am pleading with you to do everything in your powers to block this amendment which in my opinion if passed will have a huge impact on our lovely countryside.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this request; I am placing my trust in you.</blockquote><p>This letter says it all.  It brings us back to basics, to the importance of protecting our wildlife.  I am not against progress and I understand that we are entitled to make a living, but it is really important that we think of the bigger picture here and what is good for us all.<br/><br/>The changes to the Wildlife Act proposed in the Bill are not supported by scientific data and do not improve the laws of road safety.  We need a heritage Bill that is supported by strong Irish data.  We need a Bill that is more substantial, that could help all farmers and their communities.  We have a chance to do something right for the planet, right for our own personal legacies and right for nature.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#Z00200"><p>This is an important debate.  Biodiversity is one of these topics that is becoming more in vogue.  That is a good development because there is much going on in nature around us the significance of which, unless it is described or pointed out to us, or explained, is hard to understand.  It is clear in biodiversity that it is not merely an odd sentimentality.  We all live in the shadow of one other that way.  It is important that we take cognisance of the environment, but human beings have to live too and it is fair to say the minute somebody cultivates a garden, he or she is interfering with wildlife.  It is about achieving the balance.</p><p>Obviously, there are a lot of concerned citizens.  BirdWatch Ireland and a number of the advocacy organisations which have the interests of wildlife at heart have raised concerns.  When the Minister is responding, I would be interested to hear what the National Parks and Wildlife Service has to say about this.  It is to the fore in the defence of the environment and it is charged with doing that.</p><p>Of course, there are two parts to this under discussion - one is hedge cutting and the other is burning.  The reality is the local authorities have six months of the year to cut back the hedges, that is, from 1 September to 25 February.  The other reality is the urgency of hedge cutting among both the public and local authorities only seems to become apparent when there is considerable growth.  We see a lot of growth in July and August.  It strikes me that, compared with a lot of other tasks undertaken by the local authority, there is not as much forward planning involved.  Hedges should be cut back, where possible, within the appropriate times that are allowed and that are deemed to be more favourable to give the wildlife a chance.  It seems that in the case of a lot of local authorities there is not such forward planning and it only arises when the problem appears, whereas through local knowledge, one will be aware of the roads that lead to schools.  The local authority and its workmen on the ground know there are certain roads that, because of the bends and twists, will cause problems and the local authorities need to be challenged about hedge cutting programmes.</p><p>Having been a councillor, I am aware that funding for hedge cutting is an issue.  Perhaps that is why it is so <i>ad hoc</i>.  Sometimes the hedge cutting is carried out on the basis of who is shouting the loudest about a road safety issue.  Where I am from, roads leading to schools in rural areas get priority.</p><p>Another issue is a practical one.  Sometimes equipment being used for hedge cutting is not of the best sort, in that it is blunt, it traumatises the hedges and leaves them prone to disease.  They are not being cut back properly or, basically, are being butchered.  I immediately add there are many responsible contractors who know what they are about but in respect of the specifications or the definition of the job to be done - invariably, it is contractors who do the work - the councils need to ensure the equipment is appropriate and the contractors know what they are doing.  I refer to the proactive approach regarding Japanese knotweed.  For example, Mayo County Council has approached all the contractors and has set out the way one is to tackle the spread of Japanese knotweed to ensure it does not spread further.  It seems comprehensive.  It would be a worthwhile exercise to do the same in respect of the hedgerows to ensure that what is being done is being done appropriately.</p><p>There is another point that has to be made here.  When one has fresh growth into August, which is the month that is being talked about, birds are nesting in the heart of a hedgerow and out on the edges, it is really supposed to be verge trimming and not cutting right into the hedgerow.  There is a distinction.  I suppose, as I have made my own inquiries, including with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I would be interested to know officially what it is saying.</p><p>I will pick up a point made by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  It is something I wanted to put to the Minister also.  There is merit in looking at the issue of distinguishing between hedgerows which adjoin public roads and other hedgerows.  The vast majority of hedgerows are not along public roads.  They are within fields and elsewhere.  Some distinction should be made between those hedgerows where there is a road safety issue and others where there is not the urgency or compulsion that would require them to be cut.</p><p>Another point to be made about the August date is schools are coming back a lot earlier.  Schools now return in August and there is the issue of road safety.  It is not only about road safety because just as motorists fall foul of potholes, many people at times get their wing mirrors clipped on narrow country roads, which are well used.  As I say, there has to be a element of practicality about this.  As schools are coming back earlier, there is pressure coming from the public for the local authority to address the issue earlier.</p><p>We must go back to the basic point that if the local authorities had a plan in place - surely they know that these school roads would need to be done and that they should be well cut back in the first place at the appropriate time, that is, in advance of the February date - that would turn a lot of things on their heads because the way hedge cutting goes in a cyclical fashion at present, the derogation is used to do a lot of hedge cutting on the school roads and one would wonder if some of this can be avoided.</p><p>In relation to the burning, my impression from the legislation is that, while the Minister will being in regulations, there is another issue here.  The burning of vegetation is nothing new and in traditional farming it was done to get rid of the coarse grass and get at the fresher grass.  There is a debate about whether or not there is a necessity, but it did form part of traditional farming.  I also believe that traditional farmers did not torch something and walk away from it.  It is uncontrolled fires that lead to all sorts of environmental implications and there needs to be some sort of licensing system for the burning of old grass.  I would ask what the Minister envisions under these regulations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know my colleague, Senator Lombard, also mentioned the pilot projects both for burning and hedge cutting.  It is a very pragmatic way to go at it and try to get a balance between competing demands of road safety, farmers and the rightful demands of environmental protection.  Does the Minister envision a licensing regime in that regard?</p><p>While I am on my feet, I will make a point that the Minister might also address relating to powers of authorised persons under the legislation, specifically section 10(1).  It is the amendment to section 69 of the 1976 Act through section 7B.  The Minister might bear it in mind as I want to flag it.</p></speech>

As a result, I am opposing this Bill for the sake of our beautiful countryside.  I will address the amendment at hand.</p> <p>This Bill is poorly structured and does nothing to address road safety issues.  Road safety has been raised as an issue with regard to overgrown hedgerows, and as other Senators have already said, this is covered in existing legislation, namely, section 40 of the Wildlife Act and section 70 of the Roads Act.  These Acts allow county councils to issue orders to landowners to cut hedgerows that are deemed a danger, even outside the permitted cutting season.  The Heritage Bill 2016 does nothing to improve on this and creates greater confusion in the system.  An amendment has been submitted that would widen the scope of section 70 of the Roads Act and allow members of the public and landowners to request that councils allow them to cut dangerous hedgerows, and that is what we should support rather than what is proposed in the Bill.</p></speech>

They link our archaeological, geological, social and natural heritage.  They are a utility in the present but mark the past and their values are multifunctional in both practical and spiritual forms.  They enrich our understanding of history, ecology, rural society and farming practices.  They give character to an area, giving aesthetic appeal and creating a sense of place.  In practical terms, hedgerows are one of our greatest settings of biodiversity between our native flora and fauna, accommodating an array of bird life, insects, plants and mammals.</p> <p>Equally, agriculture is one our greatest traditions and the farming community is a custodian of the rural environment, as has been mentioned.  Many farmers are part of programme schemes designed to protect and enhance the environment, including providing deliberate and constructed habitats for wildlife, including birds.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned Sinn F&eacute;in's record at Stormont in the last term of the Executive, when the Minister responsible for agriculture, Ms Michelle O'Neill, rejected an extension of the hedge cutting process.  However, she did open her Department to listen to possible derogations from that legislation on a case-by-case basis, particularly where roadside hedgerows needed to be cut during the spring and summer months.</p> <p>As part of this process, a forum should be provided to discuss how we are not the only species living on the planet and it is not here to serve us alone or the unjust economy we have created.  Globally, capitalism and imperialism still eat away and erode the Earth, the fabric of which is devoured in the industrial process.  Capitalism is not easily reconciled with sustainability and opportunities like this provide a forum to discuss and engage on sustainability.  I look forward to speaking on section 8 and we will support amendments Nos. 1 and 6, as proposed by Senator Grace O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

We might have the opportunity to highlight future amendments to that section.</p><p>Returning to the question at hand, I ask for what is really a clarification in responding to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  I absolutely share the Senator's concern at the lack of precision, nuance and detail in how this might be followed up and what are the measures and tests.  That is why I am hoping the Senator and others in his party might support our amendment No. 6, as it allows precisely that kind of decision on what hedge can be impacted and why.  It leaves a chain of accountability and we know which hedges have been cut and why.  At a very basic level, it gives us tracking of the kinds of hedges that will be affected and why, as has been mentioned around the House.  The proposal is in amendment No. 6 and it allows people know how and why hedges are being cut.</p><p>The Senator mentioned that in March and August, only local authorities or road safety authorities could cut hedges.  Local authorities and road safety authorities can issue a section 70 notice to a landowner and that allows him or her to cut those hedges.  Moreover, the amendment we are considering clarifies this and makes it easier for the landowner to request a section 70 exemption much more easily and effectively.  If the landowner wants to cut, this will ensure he or she can do so.  As has been stated, a member of the public can also be involved.  There is a section 70 system that is functional and perhaps it can be improved.  We have set out concrete and effective improvements.  I would like the Minister to speak specifically to her view on the amendment, if she can support it and if there are road safety concerns extending beyond it.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the role of farmers and landowners as custodians of nature, which is important.  There are dual roles in this regard.  There is the responsibility of a landowner with respect to road safety and there is also the responsibility that many landowners and farmers have directly in the funding they receive under the Common Agricultural Policy.  A section of the funding they receive relates to their role as custodians of green space and nature.  That role of custodian being taken on by farmers and the role they have relating to road safety is currently balanced in the system we have.  Now we are placing all the risk and endangerment of their role as custodians of nature on landowners alone; in August, only the landowner could make the decisions in this regard.  We are saying that instead, by accepting amendment No. 6, the Minister can ensure the local authority and the Minister remain accountable in that the balancing of these roles is being properly achieved and there is tracking.</p><p>I will speak to my overall concerns about section 8 shortly but I would appreciate if the Minister could address that question of the road safety proposals put forward in amendment No. 6, whether she can support them and why she feels there is a road safety concern extending beyond that.  In August, there are busy roads and hedge cutting in itself creates a danger or road safety concern.  That is something to borne in mind, particularly during our tourist season and times when many people travel on roads they may not be used to.  We should consider how this is affected by hedge cutting with no notification to local authorities or clarity.  It would be <i>ad hoc</i>and there would be no measures to know whether it is taking place.  It could happen anywhere in Ireland at any time in August.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a very serious concern for road safety, as well as tourism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#BB00200"><p>I wish to make a couple of points.  The first relates to the custodianship of farmers.  This is a relatively recent phenomenon.  I am the oldest person in the House today and I recall that in 1940s to the 1960s the hedgerows in Ireland were a jungle.  The animal and flora life we have there is a result of neglect.  There was a history of neglect.  This hedge cutting is only happening in comparatively recent years, with EU grants and so forth.  Quite a large proportion of tillage farmers make 37% of their income from being guardians, so there is a motivation.  I used to visit my Irish uncle in Rutland, in England.  The difference between the manicured hedgerows of England and the jungle we had in Ireland was quite remarkable.</p> <p>I compliment Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on making the point, which was not made previously, that the overwhelming preponderance of hedgerows are internal or within the field structure.  They are not on the roads at all.  That is not referred to in the legislation and it should be.  The internal hedgerows should be excluded from this additional permission.</p> <p>I had intended to make the point made by Senator Mulherin, although slightly later on, regarding the massacre of the hedgerows by the inappropriate use of machinery that is not kept up to date or properly sharpened.  One can see the splintered shanks of trees, shrubs and so forth.  The machinery simply slashes across the hedgerow.  It is like a cartoon.  There should be some training of the personnel running these machines as well as supervision of the machines.</p> <p>The other issue in the second amendment has been raised by Members.  I strongly agree with it.  The Minister was advised strongly about this.  There is no scientific basis for this legislation.  There is simply no information.  No surveys have been carried out and no data, or very little, have been collected so this is a shot in the dark.  It is completely blind in terms of scientific information.  The scientific research that has been conducted points directly away from this Bill's provisions on enlarging the period for grubbing, burning, cutting and so forth.  People talk about the number of submissions they receive, and the pile I have with me is just part of them.  I am sure every Member has a similar amount.  However, we have received additional information about the number of rare wild birds that are threatened by this legislation.</p> <p>I hope there will be a strong vote on this today.  I am delighted Sinn F&eacute;in is on board this time.  That is excellent.  I believe we can win this one.</p></speech>

First, I thank the Senators for their contributions.  With regard to the first part of amendment No. 6, section 70 of the Roads Act provides that where a tree, hedge or shrub is considered a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road, a local authority may serve notice on the owner or occupier of the lands where the hedges and so forth are situated requiring the cutting, trimming or removal of the hedges or shrubs.  This amendment provides for the inclusion of these notices under section 40(2) of the Wildlife Act as an exempted activity.  I have considered the amendment and am prepared to accept it in principle, as it goes some way towards harmonising the provisions of the Roads Act on works to be undertaken for safety purposes along public roads with the provisions of section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  However, I intend to consult the Attorney General and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the wording of the amendment.  I will bring forward a further amendment on Report Stage to reflect the Senator's proposal.  I will also bring forward an amendment on Report Stage with regard to amendment No. 1 on the collective citation for the Roads Acts.  I thank the Senators for raising this issue as it clarifies an area of doubt.</p> <p>With regard to subsection (2) in amendment No. 6, there are provisions in section 40(2) of the Act for some strict exemptions from the prohibition on burning and cutting during the closed period, for example, for health and safety reasons, the destruction of noxious weeds and during works permitted under statute.  Specifically, section 40(2)(c) provides that public bodies such as local authorities can carry out hedge cutting for public health and safety reasons.  The amendment provides that all public bodies will have to notify me of all such work during the March to August period.  It should not be mandatory for public bodies to notify me of all such works, which I view as an onerous task which could potentially delay the carrying out of urgent work on health and safety grounds.  I have existing powers under section 43 of the Act to request details of such works from local authorities, with a statement of the public health and safety factors involved.  I have used these powers on a number of occasions in recent years.  I believe my existing powers are sufficient in this regard.  The subsection provides for over-regulation and I cannot accept it.</p> <p>As regards subsection (3) of the amendment, the proposed amendments are to the Roads Acts, which are outside the remit of the Bill.  Roads legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Accordingly, it is not possible for me to accept the amendments.</p> <p>I wish to make some general points on the legislation.  I am trying to allow managed hedge cutting and burning within the current closed period on a pilot basis for two years.  Currently, from 1 March to the end of August it is an offence to carry out burning or hedge cutting.  There have been repeated calls for this closed period to be amended, primarily to allow for better land management.  I am introducing some flexibility into the system.  Managed hedge cutting will be allowed under strict criteria during August to help ensure issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  Controlled burning will also be allowed in certain areas around the country, to be specified by the Minister, during March should it be necessary, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.  I announced a review in late 2014 of section 40 of the Wildlife Act, which relates to hedge cutting and burning.  These measures are being introduced as a result of that review.</p> <p>I have tried to strike a balance.  Hedgerows and scrub are important wildlife habitats, but they also must be managed in terms of biodiversity and land management.  I am not changing the closed period.  I am allowing for cutting and burning in a managed way within the current closed period.  I also wish to collect more information on the impacts, if any, of these changes.  We will collect the information on bird life on different types of hedgerows during this pilot period.</p></speech>

I am also from a rural area outside of Dublin.  The Minister is missing the point on this because hedgerows are part of our culture and part of a tradition going back to the late 1600s in Ireland.  The Minister is proposing to do a pilot study in months that have never been part of the provision, so it does not work.  We need to do a baseline survey.  With regard to hedgerows, I propose we do a pilot study in the month of August because of their enormous value to the farmer, the landowner, the public, to the health of Ireland and to food production.  I too have spoken to many farmers about this.  They said the issue of cutting the hedges in August is not really a huge deal to them at the moment but that the issues of Brexit, farm gate prices and lots of other issues are much more pertinent.  Nevertheless, I propose we do the baseline survey and the pilot study within the existing arrangement.  We should not allow the cutting in August or the burning in March and should continue with the existing legislation and from when this is agreed by the Minister, we should start the pilot project and baseline survey.  We should start collating the scientific data over a period of three to five years, gather the data and then base our decisions on those data.  We should not go in now and start cutting, grubbing and tearing the ditches down.  We should start the research now and in a period of three years, based on the gathering of good information, we should make the decision as to whether the cutting, grubbing destruction of the hedgerows should take place in August or whether the burning in the uplands should take place.</p> <p>If the Minister looks at the all-Ireland pollinator plan, she will see the value of the hedgerow system and the value of the uplands system in terms of pollinators, which we heard from a farmer in Cork today.  They are critical to the farmer, the development of agriculture and the health of our landscapes.  We need to recognise that what the Minister is proposing will have a negative impact on the ecological system for the farmers and the people of Ireland.  The hedgerows are not just for the birds; they are for the mammals and the bats.  I do not know if any survey was done with regard to bats and hedgerows.  The Minister does not have the data.  She cannot provide us with the data at this point in time.  She had a public consultation carried out.  </p></speech>

I have heard from NGOs that the Minister has not been available over the last two years to discuss this issue with them.  She has made herself available to other agencies but not to people who are also stakeholders.  These people represent more than 25,000 people who have signed a petition.  I turn to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and say those 25,000 people are their voters too.  This whole argument is skewed in favour of a small minority of farmers who are probably putting pressure on the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to do the research but let us not open the season of August to hedge cutting because it will impact on a wide range of biodiversity.  Equally, with the uplands, the gorse and furze is hugely important to the bees and pollinators in March.  I received a letter from a full-time bee farmer in County Louth.  His income is from the production of honey and he said if the upland areas are burnt, if that uncultivated land is destroyed, it will affect the foraging capacity of his bees, which will impact on the production of the honey.  That will impact on the income he, as a full-time bee farmer in this country, will have for his family.  We are developing artisan foods and products such as honey are extremely important as we try to put out an image of Ireland as the green country.  This is a regressive step and I am shocked it is on the agenda.  The Heritage Bill, in this regard, is far from a heritage Bill in terms of protection of the Irish environment.  We have received huge numbers of letters from farmers, environmentalists, schoolteachers and pupils in the schools who value our nature and the beauty, aesthetic value and economic potential of the hedgerows.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister to take account of what I am saying and, please, before we go any further, to provide us with scientific data or data from her consultation process that will convince us.

The Bill is not worth supporting and I ask Senators to take their time on it and not to allow it to go forward as it stands.</p></speech>

The amendment does not require that the Minister sanction or delay the process of any road cutting.  It requires that the Minister be notified.  It means there would be a central repository for tracking what is happening in our hedgerows and when and where cutting is taking place, and that the Minister would not abdicate responsibility for the overview of the matter.  I would first clarify the point given in response by the Minister which suggested her approval would be required for each instance of hedgerow cutting and, thereby, lead to a delay.  This is not what is set out.  It is a matter of a notification, bringing together the big picture and placing together the patterns in cutting and in our environment.</p><p>The Minister also spoke about having sufficient powers.  If the Minister feels she has sufficient powers regarding the area of road safety and hedge cutting, why are we proceeding with the proposals that are being set out?  Why, at the end of the Minister's speech, did she talk about driving along roads and the hedgerows?  Is it, or is it not, a road safety consideration?  If it is a road safety consideration, and the Minister is satisfied that they have sufficient powers, why are we proceeding?  At times, we hear it is a land management issue.  There is need for clarity.  Is it a land management issue or a road safety issue?  Later, I will speak on our amendment on data and the huge richness that is needed in research in the area.  Regarding road safety, we are going on an anecdotal, <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  The word &quot;managed&quot; is used regarding cutting.  There is nothing managed in the proposals.  It is deeply <i>ad hoc</i>in terms of the responsibility placed on individuals.</p><p>The Minister said something which is of extreme concern to me.  When we talk about our hedgerows, let it be clear that the hedgerows are not simply the preserve, responsibility and interest of those who live right beside a particular hedgerow.  I am from the west of Ireland and I know hedgerows and gorse.  We all live in Ireland together and, more to the point, we all live on a shared planet.  The hedgerows of Ireland are not simply a matter of interest to one person's commute.  They are a heritage for generations to come.  They are part of who we are as a nation.  They are the conduit of our wildlife and nature.  When we go to Europe, we do not go as individual landowners but collectively.  The Government goes to represent Ireland and to explain that what we will do for our environmental responsibility, given that we lost our woodlands in previous times, is to have hedgerows.  We list hedgerows when we go to Europe and say we are doing our bit for the environment.  We argue for hedgerows, an argument that will be much less credible in the future when we argue for our hedgerows to be included in the allowance we receive under the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is a collective argument and responsibility.</p><p>The Minister's fellow Minister lodged his commitments on climate change and said Ireland would do its part regarding climate change obligations.  Is this another conversation with another Minister that we cannot have?  The Minister is part of a Cabinet, and can speak to her colleague regarding roads, put forward workable amendments on road safety and ask where a policy fits in terms of climate change.  Has a conversation even happened regarding climate change concerns?</p><p>The idea is that we would gather data along the way, although where we would gather the data appears nowhere in the text.  What will we do?  Do we gather data on the next national bird song day and see if it sounds a little quieter?  There are no proposals for gathering data.  If the Minister has responsibility for heritage, is it not her first responsibility to know what she is doing regarding heritage and gather the information that is needed, not to slash and burn and ask questions later?  At a time when our planet is possibly more fragile than it has ever been, when we all feel the dangers and threats that exist and there is great instability, is it the time for a slash and burn approach to measures whereby we throw in a quick fix and abdicate our responsibilities?  It is a time for thoughtful, informed, careful and caring debate.  Let us have caring, thoughtful and evidence-based proposals.  We do not &quot;shoot first and ask questions later&quot;, a phrase that was used in one e-mail I received.</p><p>The people of Ireland who wrote to us are monitoring and know what is happening in the hedgerows.  They spoke about the detail and the change from one season to another, what they showed their children and what they cannot now show their grandchildren.  Where is all this detail and nuance?  Where is any of the evidence?  We are addressing it in terms of road safety and will return to it regarding section 8.  However, a 20-line throwaway is being justified by the Minister calling it a pilot.  Why will the Minister not pilot innovative measures regarding road safety, such as the proposals enumerated in County Clare?  Farmers there receive an incentive payment when they take measures during a difficult season and there are practical, real proposals that examine the issue hedge by hedge and identify the areas.  Communities know where the road safety concerns are.  Let us talk to them and come up with solutions that address the area.  I ask the Minister to take responsibility, not abdicate responsibility.  When the Minister returns with amendments regarding amendment No. 6, would the Minister give amendments in respect of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and all the areas and speak to her fellow Minister about it?</p></speech>

Far be it from me to defend a Fine Gael Minister, however, what might have been missed is that a door is being left open, from what I can see based on my number of years in the Seanad.  In similar situations previously when Ministers have said they were willing to examine amendments and take on board the rationale of an amendment, it leaves a gap for discussion.  I share the confusion of Senator Kevin Humphreys around the difference between amendments Nos. 1 and 6 to section 3.  Both of them seem to relate to the Road Traffic Act and while in one scenario the Minister seems to indicate that one can bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which will do what it says on the tin-----</p></speech>

I suggest that we at least enter into that dialogue to see if such an agreement can be arrived at.  I hope then, on Report Stage, we would have an amendment to which everybody could be agreeable.  That would be useful and it might be a positive way of moving the legislation forward.  If that is not possible, we will think about what the Minister has said and reserve the right to bring forward different Report Stage amendments around this area because it is an issue we feel must be addressed within this legislation.  We have some fantastic civil servants in the Houses and the Departments  and clever legislators could take on board the essence of the third section of amendment No. 6 and make it relevant to the legislation so that the concerns being addressed as part of the overall amendment could be taken on board in a new amendment.

What is the official advice of the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the proposal of hedgerow cutting in August and the proposals regarding the burning of vegetation, specifically the scientific basis for these?

Issues have been made of hedgerow cutting and when it happens, whether it is August, September, October, November or December.  Whenever hedge cutting happens, health and safety must be paramount, and it is up to the individual or the contractor involved to ensure his or her health and safety is paramount.  If one is cutting hedgerows in the month of August, that does not mean one's health and safety is less than when one cuts one's hedgerows in the month of December.  I do not see any issue regarding the amount of traffic or any other impediment regarding the cutting of hedges in August if proper health and safety procedures-----</p></speech>

Those issues need to be clarified.  It is a health and safety issue regarding the people on the roads themselves, the people who have the buggies and the cars.  These people need to be protected as well.  I live in a place called Minane Bridge, which is a very small rural community.  We do not have much down there.  When people walk on the roads, it is helpful if they walk safely.  In the month of August, is it too much to ask that we might have the hedges cut for that four-week period?</p></speech>

We do not have the luxury of footpaths or public lights.  What we have is the luxury of a road if we are lucky.  Sometimes we do not even have that luxury.  This Bill is about two things: health and safety to make sure that young people, old people and people of my generation can walk and drive safely on roads, and, when it comes to the agricultural community and the people who set the winter barley or want to reseed, that they have the possibility of cutting back the hedges so they can make sure that the land and the fields can be properly promoted.  We are not talking about cutting every hedge in every field.  We are talking about, when it comes to the 12-year cycle of reseeding a field in the month of August, having the possibility of cutting back that hedge so that it can be ploughed and the grass seed can be planted.  It is a practical element of farming and a practical issue that must be considered.  This Bill is what it is.  It is a very positive step forward, and there is a two-year pilot period so we have an open door and an issue to come back to, and we should consider that issue.  I have been canvassed literally on every section of the Bill, but my view is that it is a good Bill and we should support it.</p></speech>

The big point here - Senator Lombard touched on it as well - is striking a balance.  Yes, as Senator Norris pointed out, it is about minding the birds, but it is also about minding the people and achieving a balance in that regard.  The Bill asks us to extend the hedge-cutting season for one month, to include August, and to allow burning of vegetation in March.  The major point is that this is on a pilot basis in order that we can ensure that the best possible evidence is put forward and that an in-depth analysis and assessment is undertaken to look at any potential impact this would have on bird nesting and vegetation in order to inform any decision beyond the pilot phase.</p> <p>The farming community has been mentioned.  Allowing hedge cutting in August is a practical step in that it will allow our farmers more time to complete the job.  We have also touched on safety.  The Bill will also help to improve safety because farmers will have increased daylight hours.  It will allow them to carry out these tasks when soil conditions are better.  We must also think of being able to facilitate this work to ensure better land management, which the Bill will also allow, and better road safety, while being mindful of the necessary protections for wildlife and habitats.  Vegetation such as that found in scrub and hedgerows is an important wildlife habitat but it also needs to be managed.  I stress the importance of being able to strike a balance here.  This is on a pilot basis for two years, during which time an in-depth analysis and assessment will be carried out to investigate any potential impact it will have on flora and fauna, but it is about achieving a balance between the birds and the people.  That is what we need to do in this Bill.</p></speech>

As all Senators know, I am from a farming background and live in a rural area on small country roads.  From what I have heard so far, it is important that somebody set the record straight on behalf of the Irish farmer.  Even the phraseology, "slash and burn", suggests that farmers are trying purposely to harm, damage and inflict suffering on birds.  There is a big expense involved in the hedge-cutting we are all talking about, an expense the farmer could do without.  If it were not in the interest of the safety of the road, farmers would let their hedges grow for three, four, five or ten years because it costs them every year to cut them.  They are not doing it to get the birds; they are doing it for road safety.</p> <p>Regarding road hedges in particular, the main reason farmers want to go out in the month of August to cut hedges is that it is their busiest month and they are on the road with large tractors and trailers, drawing silage and grain.  They are at a height and can see cars coming.  The car is down low where the hedge and the grass is lying out; the car cannot see the farmer.  The farmer is cutting hedges in the interest of somebody else's safety.  If there were - God between us and all harm - an accident, the farmer is safer in his tractor than the person in the car.  Farmers here are acting diligently in favour of the motorist, cyclist and pedestrian.  They are also very cognisant of birds.  As a farmer, I can honestly stand up here and say that I have sown more hedges than I have removed or cut.  Farmers have the best interests of nature in their hearts at all times, but by some of the phraseology and the language here today, they are being damned.  As I said, cutting ditches is an added expense for them, yet they do it every year in the interests of the motorist, cyclist and pedestrian.</p></speech>

She informed the House that such burning as will be done in March and such hedge-cutting as will take place in August will be done subject to very strict conditions, but where are the conditions?  If one looks at the proposed legislation, it is clear that this House has no input into fixing what the conditions are.  If there are no conditions set out, this House will be in a position that it can do nothing to retrieve the situation.  I would have thought that the very first thing we should do, bearing in mind what has just been said by the previous speaker, is differentiate between on-road hedges and off-road hedges for starters.  The road safety argument only goes so far.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the great majority of hedgerows in Ireland are off-road hedgerows, the road safety arguments that are being made simply do not apply.</p><p>Although section 8(1) of the Bill provides for burning in March to be restricted to "such part or parts of the State as specified in the regulations", section 8(2) does not provide for the capacity to limit hedgecutting in August to any part of the State.

If one's interest was really confined to researching the possibility of hedgecutting in August, it strikes me as odd that one would extend this provision to all Twenty-six Counties with a view to working out what its consequences might be.</p></speech>

I suggest it would be a contradiction in terms to describe as a pilot scheme something that would be perpetually rolled out everywhere across Ireland for the month of August.  I say that without wishing to stretch language too far or use it in an inflammatory way.</p> <p>Under section 8 of this Bill, the Minister is seeking the power to make regulations in relation to burning "subject to such conditions or restrictions specified in the regulations to ensure the protection of fauna or flora", and in relation to hedgecutting in August "subject to such conditions or restrictions specified in regulations made by the Minister in relation to hedgerow husbandry, management or maintenance to protect fauna or flora".  Does this Bill provide any direction in respect of the "restrictions" that might be provided for?  What does one do if one wants to protect birdlife in a hedgerow?  Does one inform the relevant farmer that the regulations provide that he must inspect the hedgerow carefully for nests before he starts work?  Who is going to be in the field watching such operations to ensure the regulations are complied with?  In the absence of a busybody staring through the hedgerow to try to see what is happening on the other side of the ditch, how will anybody know whether the regulations are complied with?  It is all very well to say that the Minister may specify in regulations "conditions or restrictions " in order to protect fauna or flora, but that really does not assist us very far in the matter.</p> <p>I am sympathetic to farmers who want to keep their land properly maintained.  I have a small p&iacute;s&iacute;n of land attached to my house in County Roscommon.  I am always amazed by the extent to which the hedgerows shoot out and expand constantly unless they are disciplined, so to speak.  For that reason, I sympathise with any farmer who wants to ensure the square footage of his fields under cultivation is not encroached upon by uncontrolled hedgerows.</p> <p>As I have been listening to the debate, I have kept asking myself why it is so important for the cutting to take place in August rather than September.  The point was made that farmers want to be able to take the machines they use onto roads in conditions of safety.  I could appreciate the sense of that if there was a differentiation between on-road hedgerows and off-road hedgerows.  Maybe I am missing some point about agriculture when I say I cannot see why September is not just as good as August for carrying out off-road hedgecutting.  Given that the vast majority of hedges are off-road, it seems to me that the Minister could indicate some willingness to differentiate between on-road hedgerows and off-road hedgerows and consider whether it is really necessary to allow off-road hedgerows to be cut in the month of August when, as we know, a considerable amount of wildlife and birdlife is at risk from such activity.</p> <p>I have noticed something surprising at my own boundaries.  When the county council's contractors come up the road, they seem to create quite a deal of spectacular damage to the hedgerows.  While their machines may be crude, everything goes back to normal within one growing season and the extent of the damage done is no longer noticeable.  I just wanted to add that in to show a bit of balance.</p> <p>I am unhappy that this House is being asked to give the Minister these powers without being given any real assurances regarding the protections she could put in place to protect flora and fauna.  I am unhappy that the Bill does not differentiate between on-road hedgecutting that is necessary for road safety and off-road hedgecutting that is done purely for land management reasons.  I am unhappy that no explanation has been given as to why off-road hedgecutting cannot be done in September.  Why does it have to be done in August, which is a busy period for farmers, as far as I am concerned?  The reason they would set to their own off-road hedges in August escapes me.  I do not believe most farmers would do this work in the month of August.  I certainly think the protection for wildlife under the current situation is not a major intrusion on the right of farmers to use their land in a proper and effective way.</p></speech>

If there is a real road safety problem, we should be improving the Road Safety Acts.  I am not here to knock farmers.  I would not want to do that at any stage.  I do not want to get involved in the kind of slash-and-burn language that has been mentioned.  Farmers make a substantial contribution to the economy.  They will come under significant pressure as a result of the UK referendum and what is happening in the markets.  If they are to get a quality price, it is important for them to have a quality product that is developed in an environmentally friendly way and has a story attached to it.  The hedgerows must be part of that story, but instead we are attacking our own environment.  We are noted for our hedgerows.  When I talk to tourists, they always tell me they amazed by our hedgerows.  Senator Lombard let the cat out of the bag earlier when he said that the down week which farmers normally have in August is the best time to do this job because there is no way of knowing how the weather will change in September.</p></speech>

He obviously knows more than me.  If he says there is a down week in August, I will accept him at his word.  We should not be attacking our hedgerows.  The last time this Bill came before the House, Senator Norris referred to hedgerows as larders.  It does not make sense to cut down the hedgerows that feed the birds and mammals that live in them at the exact time when berries, pollen and everything else is in there.</p> <p>The Minister referred to fears like "health and safety reasons" and "roads with overgrown hedges".  Those issues can be dealt with and boxed off because they are covered in Senator Grace O'Sullivan's amendments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some of the amendments Senator O'Sullivan has proposed cover that ground.  Let us box it off.  Let us get up and agree to examine it.  Let us separate, in the first instance, the hedges that are off-road and internal to farms from hedges along the highways and byways.  Let us take time out.  Let us take a couple of weeks to examine this.  Let us engage with Senators and agree to find a solution.</p><p>No one wants to be attacking farmers.  Everyone wants farmers to make a good livelihood and to have a good future for their families.  However, the future not only of the country but of the planet will only be assured if we protect our environment.  Only yesterday, the Environmental Protection Agency published a document on our rivers and how the quality of our rivers has regressed over a period.</p><p>I believe the Bill is an attack on our heritage, and to call it the Heritage Bill is a nonsense.  The Minister should take some time and then come back.  Then, when the Minister is responding to the contribution of Senators, she should say that the Government will take everything into consideration and bring forward amendments on Report Stage to cover the genuine concerns of Senators and the public.</p><p>We have not even got to section 8, which is the fundamental element of the Bill.  I have problems with section 3, which undermines local authorities throughout the country.  It does not give them an opportunity for input into by-laws on account of the 21-day consultation period.  Local authorities will not have any opportunity to contribute.</p><p>The Bill should be withdrawn now in its entirety and should be reconsidered.  It should go out to proper public consultation.  It should be factually-based rather than based on the views of a small group.  I do not believe the majority of farmers support the Bill, because they can see the possible long-term damage to their futures.</p></speech>

I have worked in research for years.  We have always carried out pilot schemes to research how well an idea works.  However, there is nothing for us to compare this with.  There is no pre-test or post-test analysis.  The Minister is going straight into the post-test plan.  A baseline study should be set out to allow those involved to compare whether any intervention has had an effect on wildlife.  Cutting and then carrying out a study or looking at how it impacts on the environment will skew the results because there is absolutely nothing against which to compare them.</p> <p>In the main I am completely confused about why we have this pilot.  Is the purpose to carry out research?  If we have absolutely nothing to compare it to, it makes no sense to call it a pilot programme.</p> <p>Senator McDowell referred to the pilot operating across the Twenty-six Counties.  Pilot schemes undertaken for the purposes of research are always carried out in isolation to allow researchers compare the data with other places.  Researchers carry out a pilot somewhere to see how it works and to find out the impact it has, while monitoring another county to compare the situation.  Why is this pilot being implemented throughout the country?  Why not carry out research first to produce comparable data with a proper pilot scheme?</p></speech>

I would be concerned if there were any perception of an attribution of any malice of intent towards farmers.  I have spoken about this previously.  My colleagues, who have worked with a number of farmers on this matter, have spoken about it too.  We have discussed the crucial role farmers play as custodians of our green space.  They have responsibility for a vast part, not only of our economy, but of our society and heritage.  Many of them take this seriously and have a passionate concern in this regard.  Many of the letters and expressions of concern I have read have come from farmers.</p><p>Let us consider the proposals at a practical level, for example, the measures taken in Clare.  Indeed, let us consider the proposals from Fine Gael on how we support farmers with the costs and management of appropriate hedge cutting.  Practical measures can be put in place.  What is being offered by Fine Gael does not provide support to farmers.  It is not a help to farmers.  It will not produce additional supports.  It has no clarity or further means for them.  It is simply a blanket <i>ad hoc </i>provision with additional responsibilities that have been thrown on farmers alone, especially with regard to the August extension.</p><p>Many farmers have contacted us and many people are talking about this.  We spoke today with upland farmers who are seriously concerned about gorse burning.  I am not using the term &quot;burning&quot; in a pejorative sense.  Burning is the act; that is what it is.  Gorse burning has an impact on their farms.  Of all people, farmers understand the interdependence, interconnection and intricacy at play.</p><p>Others have spoken previously on the Wildlife Bill, which originated in this Chamber.  They spoke about the magnificent subtleties present in wildlife as well as the complex interaction.  Farmers understand that, and this is why many farmers have concerns about the damage that burning can do to soil.  They have concerns over hedgerow cutting as well.  They have deep concerns about pollination.</p><p>We have a national pollinator plan, but it is not referenced anywhere in the Bill.  Hedgerows are absolutely core to pollination.  They are the centre of the bees, butterflies and all the pollinators in Ireland.  They are the key to the green Ireland that we seek to promote to the world.  We have heard about the bees and the honey industry.  We have also heard about many of the high-quality food industries here.  A great festival took place recently in the west of Ireland.  There were talks about the high quality of local artisan food.  Hedgerows and hedgerow plants play a key role in that regard.</p><p>Reference has been made to the question of the two-year pilot.  Let us not underestimate the concerns over what might happen in a two-year pilot.  Ireland has a number of birds on the red list.  These birds are at risk of absolute extinction.  The birds on the list include the barn owl, the yellow hammer and the curlew.  There are 150 nesting pairs of curlews.  That is all we have of the curlew in Ireland.  What guarantees do we have?  Will we check after two years to see whether we still have 150 pairs of curlews?  Maybe we will have five, maybe we will have none or maybe we will have lost another species of great deep historical significance and resonance in Ireland.  We could also talk of the golden plover and the meadow pippet.  These birds are on the red list as well.  Then there are many birds and species on the amber list and they are vulnerable too.  What is the projection of the number of our birds and animals that are now in jeopardy and that will move into the endangered category over a two-year period?</p><p>Senators Humphreys and Norris made reference to the larder.  Let us not assume the larder will automatically be replenished.  We need to ensure that it is.  We need to protect it.  The hedgehog, for example, has been absolutely depleted in the United Kingdom.  The species is now the subject of extensive re-integration in urban areas.  Those involved are trying to bring it back.</p><p>I have tried to highlight several concerns.  Others have spoken to the many technical problems of the pilot, as proposed.  Another problem we have is the estimated damage.  Normally, we would not put anything through this House without a cost benefit analysis.  There is no benefit analysis in this case.  I concur with Senator Humphreys and I call on the Minister to reconsider the Bill as a whole.</p></speech>

We need some balance in this debate.  First, I want to declare that I am not a farmer.  However, I can bring something to the debate because I live in a rural area, side-by-side with farmers.  I see at first-hand what the land means to them in terms of sustaining their livelihoods in future.</p> <p>From listening to some of the language today one could be forgiven for guessing that an act of terrorism and destruction is being wrought on the countryside.  That is not the case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Farmers I know and live beside are responsible people.  I can see their practices and the way they manage their lands on a daily basis.  They do not want to destroy something that is on their land-holding unless something is needed, from a health and safety perspective or in terms of road access, to sustain their land and agricultural practices.</p><p>It is important that, first, we protect our wildlife.  The Minister and her Department are ensuring that we do that through regulation.  If there is evidence of wanton destruction, there will be the power to bring those people before the courts and to sanction them appropriately.  It is also important that we have sustainable land management practices in the agricultural sector.  It is important that farming people and country people reside alongside wildlife in a sustainable way.  That is something we all want to achieve.  Who is best placed to ensure that happens?  I do not mean any disrepect to some of the contributors, but I believe the people who reside and manage those lands are best placed to do that.  Therefore, we need to bring those people along with us in terms of having best and sustainable practices in the context of this Bill.</p><p>Senator McDowell queried why we would have off-road land cutting being allowed for an extra 31 days.  We will have a further opportunity to engage with people who know about this but it is my understanding that the month of August is a prime period for farmers to prepare the land for winter grain and for the setting of grass seed.  Sometimes when there is bad weather during the months of September and October, as has happened in recent years, that opportunity is lost and, by extension, a period of sustainability in food production is lost.  This is where conflict comes into our debate.  Some people speak about food security and the need to produce more food for the world, but they then try to restrict that by imposing more regulation and barriers to producing the food that we all need.  We need a balance.  The Minister's approach strikes that balance in having a regulated system but working with the various interests, including farming interests and people living in rural Ireland.  The road outside my house is very narrow and two cars cannot pass each other on it.  If the hedgerows are not maintained, there is a serious danger of car accidents.  It has to be dealt with in a balanced way.  From my experience, local authorities try to manage it locally to the best of their ability.  I welcome the Bill in that regard.  </p><p>I want to draw two other areas to the Minister's attention.  As a Minister of State in the former Government, I acted on another issue.  This refers to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Minister's Department, the Department with responsibility for the environment and the Office of Public Works, OPW, when a river has breached its banks and extensive flooding has occurred.  By the time farmers and others living in the countryside are allowed to repair that bank - bearing in mind that they have to apply for licences, permits and must have approvals from the Minister, Deputy Humphrey's Department and possibly two other Departments - their livelihoods, and the lands they manage and its sustainability are put at serious risk.  There is a need for a practical consent arrangement between the Minister's Department and the Department with responsibility for the environment and the OPW.  In areas where extensive flooding occurs, it puts farming livelihoods at risk and a fast-track approach to repairing and enhancing river banks needs to be put in place.</p><p>If we keep going down the road of imposing increased regulation on the people who live in the countryside, we will lose their support.  We need the support of those people on the ground if we are to have successful regulation and successful by-laws.  If the people on the ground do not buy into this regime, all we will have is further problems down the road.  I ask the Minister to take that into account.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is examining the consent aspect with respect to river banks and I expect this Minister's Department will be involved in that also.</p><p>There is a canal in my home town of Portlaw in County Waterford.  There are many canals throughout the country and they are very important infrastructure.  This legislation will have an impact on how those canals will be managed and sustained into the future.  Other colleagues have said that there is a need to extend the consultation period on any new by-laws or changes that occur.  Many local authorities, community groups and individuals who use the canals value them and it is important that we as policy makers also value them.  It is also important that those people have an adequate opportunity to make themselves aware of any impending by-laws or changes to how canals are being used.  The 21 day period provided is far too short.  If we consider the cycle of local authority meetings, their plenary meetings are held once a month.  If by-laws are being introduced, at the very least local councillors should have the opportunity to debate those at a plenary meeting.  Some notice is required for those meetings.  I ask the Minister to extend that consultation period substantially, at least to 60 days, to give local authority representatives an opportunity to raise any concerns there may be about new by-laws and that they can be brought up for proper debate before local authorities.</p></speech>

The timescale is too short.  The fines and regulations, which are excessively severe, will not encourage people to use the canals.  They are not in place on other Irish waterways.  There is a five day move-on rule, forcing boats to move every five days.  If they do not, they may have to pay &euro;150 a day if they are moored.  That is not acceptable.  The provision for the application of other penalties in the legislation with no independent appeal mechanism is disgraceful.  There is no adequate provision for elected local authority representatives to be consulted on any proposed by-laws, and there is provision to apply other penalties with no warning or independent  mechanism.  Proper pre-consultation and engagement with the canal communities should involve the users, the customers and the elected local authority representatives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#JJ00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials.  I thank the Minister of State for the work she is doing in the area of elderly care.</p> <p>In 2011, the Law Reform Commission published a report on the regulation of people who provide home care or who care for individuals in their own homes.  The research relating to the report was carried out in 2010.  As a result of that report, I have published the Health (Amendment) (Professional Home Care) Bill 2016.  I originally brought the legislation forward during the lifetime of the previous Seanad but, unfortunately, it was not reached.  I sincerely thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come to the House to deal with the matter today.</p> <p>I hold strong views on this issue.  I will outline the current position.  If a person serves prison time for any offence, there is nothing preventing him or her from setting up, on the morning he or she is released from prison, a company that undertakes to provide professional home care to elderly people.  What I am saying is not to be taken out of context.  I am merely highlighting the fact that there is no strict regulation in respect of who can provide the type of service to which I refer.</p> <p>The Law Reform Commission set out a number of recommendations in its 2011 report.  A key recommendation was that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, should be empowered to regulate and monitor undertakings that provide professional home care, whether public sector, private sector, for-profit or not-for-profit.  While the main beneficiaries of the proposed new HIQA regulations would most likely be those over 65 years of age, the proposed system should apply to professional home care provided to any adult over 18 years of age.  This was another recommendation contained in the Law Reform Commission report.  The HIQA national standards for professional home carers should be specifically tailored for the home-care setting.  Obviously, the regulations for nursing homes would be different from those relating to home care.  The recommendations build on the 2008 draft HSE home-care guidelines.  That is how the HIQA standards were subsequently agreed in respect of nursing homes.  Draft guidelines were published by the Health Service Executive in 2008.</p> <p>The proposed standards should have regard to specific principles, including the right of a care recipient to independent living, privacy, dignity, quality of care and protection from abuse.  There should be a specific register of professional home carers which would set out specific requirements in respect of the registration and monitoring.  The terms and conditions of home-care arrangements should be agreed between professional home carers and recipients.  This should be recorded in a care contract to ensure maximum protection for the care recipient.  These are some of the recommendations contained in the 2011 report.</p> <p>Almost six years have passed since the publication of the report and I believe we need to debate the issue.  Significant change has occurred in demographics in Ireland.  According to the 2006 census, 11% of the population was over 65 years of age.  It is predicted that 15.4% of the population will be over 65 years of age by 2021.  Another major change has taken place in the population over 85 years of age.  My understanding is that the number of those over 85 years has increased by 20% the past six years alone.  Things are changing a great deal.  This is a great thing about our health service.  I realise many people criticise it and some of those criticisms are justified.  However, despite all the criticism, people are living longer and looking after themselves better and for longer.  Moreover, there is more information with regard to how not to put one's health at risk.</p> <p>Another figure is relevant.  In 2002, a total of 114,000 people were living alone.  The prediction for 2021 is that the corresponding figure will be 210,000.  This is relevant for the older population.  For example, let us consider the figures for our hospitals.  Up to 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by those over 65 years of age.  As our population continues to age, there is going to be more demand on our health services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As our population ages, more demand will be placed on health services and on general practitioners.  It is predicted in one report that consultations with general practitioners by members of that older age group will increase by 33% by 2021.  In some European countries, there are four people retired for every two people working.  The demographics in Ireland will also change.  With regard to the current structure, if we consider the cost of the fair deal scheme and that more than 23,500 people are in private nursing homes and another 6,000 or 7,000 are living in community settings, that is not what everyone wants.  An increasing number of people want to remain in their own homes.  I recently attended the birthday party of a lady who is 100 years old and who lives alone.  I am sure other Senators could cite similar examples.  A relative of mine who is 95 years old and confined to a wheelchair is residing on her own but she can only do so because home care is being provided.</p><p>The Law Reform Commission report of 2011 refers to the fact that there is imbalance in the focus on residential care as opposed to home care.  The position in this regard has not changed substantially in the past five years.  We need to change the whole focus.  There are certain categories of people who will require residential care.  However, the number of people we should try to keep out of residential care will continue to rise and we need to ensure that we can continue to increase the number of home-help hours provided.  I have the 2015 figures and I am sure the Minister of State has more up-to-date ones.  Approximately 10.4 million hours of home care were provided to 47,915 people last year.  We have major challenges ahead of us.</p><p>I will briefly go through the detail of the Bill, which sets out the amendments to the various sections of the 2007 Act.  It defines what constitutes a designated centre and states that professional home care "means services which are required to ensure that an adult person, that is, a person aged 18 years and over, can continue to live independently in their own home and includes, but not limit it to the services of nurses, homes care attendants, home help, various therapies and personal care and palliative care".  It also sets out the amendment to section 8 of the Act of 2007, which deals with the standards of professional home care.  The Bill further sets out the various changes we need to bring about in order to put a proper regulatory structure in place.  In fairness to the people delivering services, be it through the HSE or private contractors, they are providing very good services right across the country.  I hope the 10.4 million home-care hours currently being provided could be increased to a major degree because this would ensure that we could assist many more people and that there would not be the same pressures on nursing homes and hospitals.</p><p>Another relevant issue relates to hospital discharges.  I dealt with a case recently of an elderly person living alone who was discharged from hospital.  I am not clear about the connection between the hospitals and the people working in the community.  No home care provision was set up for the person in question.  Therefore, they were very much reliance on their family members who live 50 to 60 miles away.  Much more co-ordination is required in that area.  Our hospital service also needs to have contact with the people who are contracted to provide the support to people in the community.</p><p>The Bill sets out in great detail what is needed but it also makes adequate provision for the Department to bring forward the necessary regulation.  It would have to examine it and deal with the regulation that needs to be brought in to provision supervision and so on.  When a Law Reform Commission report is brought forward, it is important that it is not simply left on a shelf and that we proactively examine what is the best way forward.  We cannot afford to leave this sector totally unregulated.  Unfortunately, in the case of many care facilities down through the years, we relied on the skills and judgment of those we thought were properly managing them but now we find that report after report has to be compiled.  That is not the way we should allow this area to be managed.  We should set up a regulatory structure.  The Bill deals with this issue and I know it is not written in stone.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on it.  I would also like the Department to be very proactively involved in developing the legislation and the level of regulation required in this area.  I thank the Minister for taking the time to be with us this afternoon.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Colm Burke who has done a great deal of work in this area in recent years.  This is a very important debate around ensuring that people who receive care in their homes across the country are being provided with the best possible care and that we have appropriate structures and regulation in place to deal with the difficulties that continue to arise.  We know, as Senator Colm Burke mentioned, that carers do very important work.  In the vast majority of cases, professional carers and family cares are doing the very best for the people for whom they care.  However, we know of situations where standards have not been at the level at which they should have been.</p> <p>In 2010, a "Prime Time Investigates" programme highlighted appalling standards of care that are just not acceptable.  However, since that time there has been a void in terms of dealing with this matter and putting in place regulatory standards to ensure that those people who are vulnerable and need care are supported in the best possible way.  HIQA said that it has received complaints about home-care provision but that it does not have any legal powers to investigate them.  That is a major issue.  HIQA can inspect community nursing home facilities but our main focus should be on supporting people in their homes.  We have seen increases in the number of home help hours and in the number of home care packages provided but we need to ensure that the care delivered in people's homes - which is where most people want to be if they have the right support - is to the highest possible standard.  We need to protect those individuals.  I urge the Minister and the Department to progress the work in this area in order to ensure that there is proper regulation to deal with cases where the standards we would all expect are not being reached.</p> <p>I very much support my colleague, Senator Colm Burke, in respect of the Bill he has brought forward.  I look forward to working with him and ensuring that progress is made in this area in terms of better regulation of professional home-care provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#KK00300"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support this legislation, which stems from a Law Reform Commission report published five years ago.  The legislation provides for a regulatory framework and legal standards to be put in place for professional home carers engaged in the provision of care to people in their own homes.  Similar legislation based on the Law Reform Commission report was published by Deputy Billy Kelleher in 2012.</p> <p>As Senator Colm Burke stated, it is recommend that HIQA should be given additional regulatory and inspection powers to ensure that appropriate legal standards are in place for undertakings that provide professional home care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The report did not propose that the HIQA regulatory and inspection system would apply to informal carers such as family members.  That is important in so far as it has allayed fears among people in the community.  I heard that at first hand in the practice.  The report made 29 recommendations for reform of the law and also included a draft health Bill to implement them, which is the one before the Seanad today.  The LRC pointed out that it is well known that the proportion of people living in Ireland who are aged over 65 has been increasing in recent years and is projected to increase at an even greater rate in the coming decades.</p><p>I wish to highlight a few welcome provisions in the Bill, but I will not go through them all.  It provides that palliative care be included in the definition of professional home care.  That is very important, as it is a basic human dignity that people can spend their final days in their own home, surrounded by their loved ones - friends and family.  The assessment must include an assessment of companionship, which is also very important.  As a rural GP I am very well aware of how mental illness affects the elderly population.  Those elderly people are often without a voice.  Companionship needs may include preparing snacks and monitoring diet and eating.  Malnutrition is rife in this country and we do not realise it, especially among the elderly population who have chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive airways disease.  Other elements of companionship include arranging appointments, reminders for medication, which is also important because it is estimated that half of all medications are taken incorrectly in this country.  In turn, that would prevent admissions to secondary care.</p><p>In developing a Bill such as the one before the House it is important that it is matched with investment in primary care.  By that I do not necessarily mean primary care centres, although they are important in certain locations.  I am referring to the provision of care in terms of bodies on the ground - the provision of nurses and GPs.  It is about the activity that happens within the primary care centre more so than the bricks and mortar of the centres.  If the Bill is to work we need investment in the carers who provide the front-line services in communities.</p><p>In terms of making home-care packages a statutory right, that was the aim behind a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill introduced by Deputy Willie O'Dea in the D&aacute;il prior to the recess.  If passed, the Bill would be an enormous step forward in helping to empower older people.  It would enshrine in legislation their right to services to allow them to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, which would not only benefit the individuals concerned and their families but also the State due to less demand being placed on long-term residential care services.  It is time we gave older people a greater choice in determining the care they receive.</p></speech>

The issue is extremely important in this ever-changing world where the background of technology has changed as well as societal behaviours and there is more widespread use of both private and public sectors in the provision of essential care.  In order to support people in their later years it is important that a proper regulatory framework is put in place which will give older people and their families the comfort and confidence of knowing their physical, mental, emotional and-or financial well-being will be safeguarded by regulatory legal powers.</p> <p>The provision of private home care has grown enormously and advertisements are constantly on television for it.  Several workers in the sector contacted me as they knew I had previous nursing experience to check out what was going on as they thought certain things were wrong.  They were very concerned and their response was really humane.  They were like whistleblowers.  Many of the companies just ignore elderly people lying in bed with incontinence difficulties and leave them there for a long time.  They do not want to put in the extra hours or the extra work as they are overwhelmed.  The area needs to be regulated, which is the reason the Bill is so important.  The experience of some home care staff has left them aghast at some of the practices.  The Bill is a very practical and much-needed step.</p> <p>Home care is the care that the vast majority of older people and their families seek, as opposed to residential care.  Many feel imprisoned when they go into a nursing home.  It suits some but not all, but often there is no choice available to people.  I note the progress of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.  There will be much more demand on the resources and we must build up the provision of home care and community care and keep people where they belong and feel comfortable.  That is what they deserve rather than being made to feel they are a burden on society and must be locked away or sent to prison.</p> <p>The basis of the Bill is built around the principles of independent living, privacy and dignity for people requiring home care, quality of care and most important, protection for people who receive care.  We agree with and fundamentally support those principles and have no hesitation in supporting the Bill.  We also welcome the proposed introduction of a register of all home carers and the introduction of an assessment of need, which are essential in moving towards the principles outlined.</p> <p>We have a concern about how the measures contained in the Bill will be implemented and adhered to.  Ultimately, the responsibility for adherence to standards will fall to HIQA.  I know HIQA and I commend its work.  As previous speakers said, it is a success story for a relatively new authority but the demand for its services is growing.  The added responsibility of regulating home care providers would stretch HIQA at a time when it is already stretched to the limit.  More supports and resources will have to be provided to HIQA to give the Bill any teeth.</p> <p>The Bill specifically deals with professional home care.  I acknowledge the care that is provided by thousands of family carers all over the country.  A significant amount of care provided to older people is done by unpaid family or friends in people's own homes.  Perhaps that angle could be examined on another occasion because Age Action and ALONE have raised cases of abuse, mostly of a financial nature.  I am conscious that it does not relate to the Bill before the House.</p> <p>The current State policy of care for older people is based on two pillars: first, financial support for nursing home residences, which has been the priority and we must move away from that being the sole focus; and, second, the provision of home help, home care and day care for older people.  Despite the fact that most care is provided for people living in their own homes, the vast bulk of State funding is spent on nursing home care.  The policy is a failed one as nursing home care demands huge resources.  Nursing home care is needed for some citizens obviously but there are many people who do not need it but end up in a nursing home.  Insufficient resources are directed towards the provision of home care compared with other countries, especially Scandinavian countries.  That is an evident policy failure on the part of the State.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, we proposed an additional &euro;32.4 million in supports for older people.  The funding was intended to increase home-help hours, which would cost &euro;20 million and an increase in home-care packages by 10% which would cost &euro;12.4 million.</p> <p>We are committed to the provision of health care services and social care services with equal access for all, based on need and to the greatest extent that resources allow.  That right is especially relevant for older people.  We are all aware that Ireland&rsquo;s population is ageing and our current services will not sustain our population into the future. </p> <p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Senator Colm Burke.  The Bill is progressive and it will implement safeguards for older citizens whom we respect and treasure.  New politics should not be just piece-meal.  It is an opportunity for progressive change.  My party's alternative budget is consistently dismissed as fairytale economics.  We all know it is not bonkers economics.  It is costed and it gives value for money.  People should open their eyes and their hearts to it and get some idea of what it contains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It contains a vision to deliver a fairer society, in particular, for what could be considered a very vulnerable group in the community.</p></speech>

I simply want to support this Bill and commend Senator Colm Burke for sticking with it along the way, following it and ensuring that it has been brought before the House.  Its contains commonsense provisions.  There is a commonsense approach.  Its provisions are there to protect, not only the person who is being cared for but the excellent carers who are out there as well.  As for its effect, this will protect all sides and eliminate the need for any of those who should not be involved in caring.  That is an important point.</p> <p>I would not be an expert in this area.  I would have assumed, maybe naively, that these regulations were already there for the carers in the home.  I am referring, for instance, to section 6 that provides that an assessment of needs of care of the recipient must be carried out in advance, and that the dignity, independence and needs of the person who is cared for have to be taken care of.  As Senator Colm Burke pointed out, the number of elderly people is increasing.  People are living longer.  It is more economic to care for them in the home.</p> <p>I do not usually listen to "Liveline" because it is continually a moan, but I heard it last week.  An elderly lady who rang in to Joe Duffy was not criticising the nursing home that she was in but wanted to get home.  There may have been an issue with the family or whatever, but a Bill like this can only further eliminate any of the loopholes, abuses or whatever in the system.</p> <p>It is vital that the provisions of this Bill are brought forward by the Department at the earliest opportunity.  It can only be a good result for everybody.</p></speech>

Home care enables people to live well with their disability, condition or frailty.  It enables people to live independently and continue to be active participants in their own homes, among their families - citizens in their own community and country.  Home care enables people to live where they wish to be, and often supports people with the most intimate and most personal care in familiar surroundings - familiarity being so important, for example, for a person with dementia or those caring for him or her.  Home care enables people to even die in the comfort of their own homes, supporting the person with end of life palliative care which is referenced in the Bill.  Therefore, home care is a really important part of the web of support that we all wish to rely on for those we know - people we love and for ourselves, the web of support that we would all wish to rely on when we no longer can fully look after ourselves.</p> <p>This Bill acknowledges that home care can be provided, though not exclusively, by "nurses, home care attendants, home helps", and includes various therapies and personal care, including, as Senator Swanick mentioned, companionship which is often forgotten.  Loneliness often really affects people.  The Bill covers all of the aspects, from eating food that is digestible to personal care, to palliative care and to companionship.</p> <p>Access to the right kind of home care, and at the right time, can literally transform the lives of both the person needing some support and his or her family, and this view is not new.  The excellent Law Reform Commission report, published in 2011, highlighted in unequivocal terms the case for home care dating as far back as 1968 with the Care of the Aged report, the 1970 Health Act, The Years Ahead report of 1988 and the 1997 impact of The Years Ahead report.  In fact, home care has been official Government policy and strategy since the 1990s and one wonders why home care, such an important plank of modern, dignified living for citizens, can be so neglected and unregulated for so long.</p> <p>More recently, the preference, benefit and cost effectiveness of home care was, once again, affirmed in the report of a joint study published in July this years by UCD, Age Action, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Association of Social Work, IASW, entitled, Meeting Older People's Preference for Care, where people's clear preference was for home care rather than residential care.</p> <p>This preference for home care was, once again, reflected in the support for the Alzheimer Society of Ireland's petition for expanded home care in its submission for the 2017 budget which was signed by 25,000 people.  I have the submission here.  It runs to three volumes, and is from people in all parts of the country.  That is something that we should be paying attention to and taking note of.  One can see what can happen when the citizen is ignored in countries such as the USA.  When people go to the bother of signing a petition, we should take note of what is in it and pay attention to it.</p> <p>In spite of warm words, photo opportunities by Ministers and politicians eager to be seen at pre-budget events, this preference for home care and the petition for it was only very modestly responded to, with a most modest increase in the home care budget for 2017.  It is a baby step in the right direction which, of course, I welcomed in place of the recent cuts we have all seen.  I welcome the additional funding but sometimes it is hard to see.  Official information about home care is hard to find and maybe the civil servants here can help us out with the language because sometimes one gets a letter in response and one is not sure whether the funding is more or less.  That would be important.</p> <p>It is also important that additional funding for home care, if it is allocated, actually gets through.  The most recent information I have on the modest - that word again - investment in home care through the national dementia strategy, co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, is that funding for the 500 intensive home-care packages has only reached 72 of the estimated 55,000 people with dementia in Ireland - a drop in the ocean.  Not only is the case and preference for home care proven, it is also cost effective and often cheaper than residential alternatives.  The availability of home care enables the health care system to work effectively for patients' timely and appropriate discharges, freeing up much-needed acute hospital beds.</p> <p>This is an important Bill as it addresses home care specifically.  Although home care is provided in its different guises to an estimated 50,000 people in Ireland for charge and often for profit, and funded by the taxpayer, shockingly, home care is not regulated.  Given its nature of home care workers working on their own providing the most intimate of care to vulnerable people, shockingly, home care remains an area that regulation does not reach.  The work is difficult and is usually carried out by the kindest and most compassionate of people, but some people are just not cut out for this kind of work which is sometimes badly paid.  From scandals of the past, we know that work like this can also attract the unscrupulous and the abusive - people in it for the wrong reasons with vulnerable people at their mercy.  The unregulated home-care sector makes it easy for such people to be up close and personal with people who are vulnerable, people we know, people we love and care about, people like ourselves one day. The kind and decent home care worker will welcome regulation and oversight and will have nothing to worry about.  The other kind might just be put off and be denied easy access to prey on vulnerable people.</p> <p>This Bill provides for the extension of the powers of HIQA to regulate professional, not family-provided, home care, building on and avoiding duplication of HIQA's expertise in its regulation of nursing homes and residential care for people with disability.  The Bill provides for HIQA to set out national standards.  These are already in draft form by the HSE.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill provides for the setting of training requirements for those providing this most sensitive and intimate of care and manual handling.

Shall we just wait for the scandal, the abuse or even the death of a vulnerable person in receipt of home care?  Must we wait for Joe Duffy or the hidden camera before we act?  If that is the case, perhaps those who voted to abolish the Seanad might have been right.  Today, we have an opportunity to prove the worth of the Seanad.  I urge support for this Bill.  It will improve the lives of people with disabilities, older people, people with chronic conditions and people such as ourselves in time.  We have a duty as legislators to put people first and to put protections in place.  There will be arguments about money, but money can be suddenly found to bail out banks or to fund pay deals.  It is important that we find the money to provide this regulation and to act before we see something horrible on our screens.  I urge the Minister of State to take up legislation on behalf of people with dementia or disabilities and older people who may not always be able to speak out for themselves.</p></speech>

I congratulate Senator Burke on his far sightedness in introducing this important legislation, which my party supports.  It is clear to everybody that a form of regulation is required in this sector and for home care provision in general.  We should use every lever at our disposal to make sure those who wish to be cared for at home, whether they are older or are chronically ill, have that option, and that it is viable and supported by the State.  We know from experience that long-term nursing home care is expensive and it is not in all cases the preferred option for a significant number of people.  Most wish to stay at home as long as they can to be cared by their loved ones and, indeed, by professionals.  While I acknowledge the demographic and economic challenges the country faces, we need to prepare and plan better for our future.  As most of my colleagues have said, most older people would like to retain their independence and autonomy in their homes and they should be supported in doing so.</p><p>The home care sector has evolved organically over the years and there is a complete absence of regulation in the sector, which is surprising to some.  A regulatory framework, therefore, is absolutely essential both for those who are being cared for and those who are operating in the sector.  The Bill recognises this but if we are serious about enabling people to remain in their own homes as long as possible, we need to do much more than merely regulate the sector and those who work in it.  Senator Swanick mentioned the need for investment in those who deliver the service, which is crucially important because the sector is characterised by low pay, limited protections, low hour contracts and it is open to exploitation not just in respect of those who are being cared for, but also in respect of those who work in the sector.  It is one of the great conundrums facing our society that those who do some of the most important jobs - it is not just a phenomenon unique to Ireland - such as those who deliver early years education and those who look after our older people, whether that is at home or in nursing homes, are treated extremely poorly in terms of pay and terms and conditions.</p><p>Section 2(<i>h</i>) of the legislation provides for the development of what might be described as a &quot;contract&quot; for the provision of care services, fee arrangements and so on.  It is important and it should be front and centre of any new legislation governing this area but the Bill is silent on the need to address the pay and working conditions of those who deliver services on the front line, day in, day out, in this exposed sector.  It does not recognise that the norms in the sector in the context of pay and terms and conditions need to be drastically altered, improved and enhanced.  We will never, for example, have a decent high quality and affordable child care sector or a decent, accessible, quality home care sector if that reality is not addressed.  I would like more effort to be made by this Administration to do that.</p><p>I fully support the principle that those who work in the sector and companies in the sector should be properly regulated, and progressive people in the sector believe that as well, but the Bill and the Government's approach in general to this area could be improved immeasurably - indeed, the message the Bill sends would be better understood - if a real and sincere effort was made to address those shortcomings in a sector that is extremely exposed.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Minster of State and Senator Burke on how those issues can be satisfactorily addressed by Government because we will not have a decent quality system unless we reward and support those who work in it.</p></speech>

Nobody would question the work the Senator has done to date in this area.  He has been working on the Bill for some time.  Home care is an increasingly important part of the supports that we offer to older people, and will continue to increase in importance into the future.  In that context, it behoves us to consider how home care should be provided and regulated.  The Senator has mentioned a number of the issues dealt with in the Law Reform Commission report.  This 2011 report highlighted the imbalance between residential and home care.  The number of people aged over 65 will double in the coming years while the number of people aged over 80 will treble.  Currently, 11 people a day are being diagnosed with dementia and that figure will only increase.  We need to continue to focus on the fact that getting older should never be seen as a burden on society and we need to continue to address the imbalance.</p> <p>It has long been Government policy to help older people and others to stay in their homes and communities for as long as possible, with long-term nursing care being seen as a last resort only after home care and other community-based supports have been fully utilised.  Under the Government, that emphasis is being strengthened.  People want to stay at home with the environment, possessions and friends built up over a lifetime and that are most familiar to them, and this is entirely understandable.  I also attended a party last year for a lady who was 100 years young and still living on her own and I want that to continue to happen.  Accordingly, the programme for partnership Government includes commitments to increase funding for home support services, to improve these supports, to introduce a uniform home care service so all recipients can receive a quality support, seven days per week, where possible, and to review the management, operation and funding of national home-help services.</p> <p>I am pleased that overall funding for services for older people will increase to &euro;765 million in 2017, which is an increase of &euro;82 million since the HSE's 2016 service plan.  This has focused on additional funding for home care, in particular, and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  During 2016, the number of home care packages will have increased by 1,000 from 15,450 to 16.450 and the HSE will provide more than 10.5 million home help hours.  Home care funding has increased by &euro;41 million over the initial 2016 provision, and this will be augmented in 2017 with a further &euro;27 million.  I will work hard to ensure we continue in this direction in future years.  I understand it is not enough and it is not the figure we need but we need to build on it.  The dementia home care packages, in particular, will need to be delivered throughout the lifetime of that programme but we need to reach a stage where there is proper regulation, a proper structure and a proper framework to provide support to people in their homes whether they have dementia, a disability, or simply need care.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is estimated that approximately 20% of the over 65 population receives some form of community-based support service annually from the State.  Traditionally, home care was viewed as providing a lower level of support than residential care, and not as an alternative to it.  Increasingly, however, it is considered possible to support many people at home who would previously have gone into residential care.  This requires an increase in the amount and intensity of home care, and more effective integration with other supports including nursing, therapies and other primary care services.  We want and have to develop home care services to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people.</p><p>Home care services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is no means testing or personal contribution towards the costs involved.  Other HSE provided or HSE funded services include day care, meals-on-wheels and respite care.  These are services we must protect.  People are cared for at home under a wide variety of arrangements, both formal and informal.  The HSE provides services directly and through service agreements with private and voluntary sector providers.  Informal care provided by family and friends plays a significant and invaluable role in providing care to older people.  Furthermore, many families choose to supplement the level of care provided by, or on behalf of, the HSE with additional privately procured home care.  It is estimated that home care provided or funded by the HSE accounts for only around 30% of the total market, with the balance being privately procured and paid for by individuals and families.  That is quite a low percentage.</p><p>Arrangements for home care provision have developed over the years with a significant local focus and while the HSE is incrementally developing a more consistent and coherent system, some legacy issues are still being worked through.  Unlike the nursing homes support scheme, which is evenly applied across the country and is centrally managed in a unified way, there remains more variation than we would want to see in home care arrangements.  For example, access to services can vary from place to place and at different times of the year.  We have all experienced and had difficulties with that in our constituencies. </p><p>It is clear, therefore, that there are issues to be addressed and that there does seem to be a case for a more structured and perhaps schematic approach to home care than has applied up to now.  Work to prepare for the development of a more formalised system is already in train, and the Department of Health has already asked the Health Research Board to carry out an evidence review of international approaches to the regulation and financing of home care services.  This review will describe approaches to the regulation of home care services in other jurisdictions including the legislative framework, registration processes, inspection regime, staff assessment and training requirements, and national standards.  It will examine the approach to financing of these services as well as eligibility requirements and entitlements for publically funded services, and who bears the cost of regulation.  Finally, it will review evaluations and assessments of the international approaches in terms of their effectiveness and costing issues.</p><p>The review will be presented to the Department of Health before the end of December and will be used as a basis to develop policy proposals in 2017 for the regulation and funding of home care services.  In terms of quality assurance in the home care sector, a significant step was taken in 2012 when the HSE introduced a single procurement framework for external providers.  This included quality standards in terms of governance and accountability, person-centred care, complaints management, training and qualifications.  Providers are monitored through service level agreements with the HSE and are required to provide a range of information on the services they provide.  From 1 September 2016, all new home care packages approved by the HSE will be provided by organisations that have been approved by the HSE following a detailed tender process.  The 32 approved providers appointed under this process meet a required level of quality based on consistent national standards.  I agree with Senator Nash and others about the need for a clear professional pathway for carers.  That would be an important step in ensuring the development of this profession and that those who provide the service feel valued and feel that their work is of worth.  Most carers provide amazing care.  The importance of regulating the sector, however, is not in dispute.</p><p>I share Senator Burke&rsquo;s concerns about the potential risks involved in delivering services on a one-to-one basis in the homes of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  However, there are characteristics particular to home care which make its regulation less straightforward than residential care, and we need to think through the implications of any new system in a careful and measured way.  Of its nature, home care is less uniform than residential care, and includes a wide variety of formal and informal arrangements.  Unlike the residential sector, family carers are a very significant part of the home care landscape, and we need to ensure that any new system of regulation does not have unintended consequences for them or for other informal carers.  Defining the margins between informal and formal service provision needs thorough assessment.</p><p>It is clear that there are considerable differences between the residential and home care contexts, and regulation needs to be designed for home care in a bespoke way that recognises its particular characteristics.  Regulation is necessary, and we are all agreed on that, but a significant amount of detailed preparation needs to be done in addition to that already done before final decisions are taken on its form.  For example, there are legal difficulties with the Bill proposed by Senator Burke in that it seeks to include home care providers within the current regulatory arrangements by extending the definition of "designated centre&rdquo; in the Health Act 2007 to include them.  However, home care services are not delivered in any one centre but at different locations and in people's homes.  Legal advice obtained by the Department confirms that a separate legal instrument will be required to establish a regulatory regime for these providers.</p><p>Work on developing an appropriate regulatory system is already well under way I have arranged that it shortly be given further impetus by the establishment of a new unit in the older persons services function of the Department which can focus on it to the level required.  I accordingly propose that Second Stage of the Bill be read again in 12 months&rsquo; time and I look forward to engaging further on this critical issue with the Senator and with this House as our work progresses.  We are all on the same page in respect of this issue.

I reiterate my colleague, Senator Devine's support for the Bill.  We welcome the fact that Fine Gael recognises the need to regulate the sector.  It is extremely important and Senator Burke has put a lot of work into this Bill.  I ask him to take my comments constructively.  They concern what is missing from the Bill and, with all due respect, from the Minister of State's speech.</p> <p>The big issue in home care is terms and conditions and pay.  Senator Nash referred to this.  Of course regulation has to protect the client and professional standards but if the elephant in the room, the appallingly low rates of pay in the sector, is not tackled, a quality service will not be provided.  There will be such a high level of staff turnover that clients will find that the person who cared for them last month has left and another has moved on.  I have personal experience of this because prior to getting this job I was a trade union official and we had a dedicated campaign on home care for years.  There is a shocking differentiation between the rates of pay for HSE home help workers, who are relatively well paid because they are unionised and have campaigned for that pay over the past 25 years, and the shocking rates of pay for private home care providers, the ones whose wonderful radio advertisements we hear each day.  Someone working for a private home care provider earns the minimum wage or slightly above that.  Is that all our loved ones are worth, &euro;9.15 an hour?  If we are serious about improving standards we have to tackle that issue and there is a simple way to do it, bring in the various partners, work towards an employment regulation order that sets standards of pay for the industry.  It can be done but there seems to be something in the Fine Gael DNA that means it always forgets about the workers and their pay and conditions when it is regulating.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the Minister of State's speech, she says many fine things.  She makes reference to the tender process.  She says "all new home care packages approved by the HSE will be provided by organisations that have been approved by the HSE following a detailed tender process".  Is there anything in the detailed tender process that references a decent rate of pay for home-care providers?  There is not.  Until the Minister of State incorporates that, she is not being serious about dealing with one of the key issues in the sector.  </p><p>The other issue I will raise about HSE home-care packages is that what always struck me from my work in the sector is that almost all of those home care packages are outsourced to private providers even when we have HSE home-care workers looking for more hours of work.  They are outsourced because it is easier.  The shocking thing is it is more expensive.  While the HSE providers are paying &euro;14 to &euro;16 an hour and the private providers are paying anywhere between &euro;9.15 and &euro;10 an hour, the private providers end up charging a higher hourly rate than the HSE home-help providers.  They do that because it is their profit.  It is more expensive for the taxpayer to do it this way yet it seems to be orthodoxy in HSE policy.  The attitude is that the Government is giving it a certain amount this year so it will outsource it.  The problem is that the outsourcing process is fundamentally flawed because the rates of pay are so poor.  I do not think the Minister of State will contradict me because I have demonstrated that there is nothing in the regulations being proposed, the Minister of State's speech or the tender process that addresses the issue of pay.</p><p>The issue of pay is a very simple thing to address.  It can be regulated.  I will give a different example from a different sector.  We have just signed an employment regulation order for the contract cleaning industry which stipulates minimum rates of pay above the minimum wage and stipulates a range of increases.  The only reason that will not happen in this sector is because the Minister of State lacks the political will to do so.  I would welcome the Minister of State standing up and saying she will prove me wrong and tackle the issue of low pay.  If we do not tackle the issue of low pay, we will never really tackle the issue of quality care.  Does anyone in this room really believe our loved ones are worth nothing more than &euro;9.15 or &euro;9.50 an hour?  For the level of care and attention that is required, we need to be serious and ensure the system is regulated, the sector is regulated and that decent pay rates apply.  Unfortunately, I have not seen any evidence of the political will to tackle that.  I would love to hear a response on that.</p></speech>

It is a very positive and necessary step forward and a really constructive proposal.  I previously had the opportunity for a number of years to work with Older and Bolder which was an alliance of older persons' organisations across Ireland that worked with groups such as the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, carers, active retirement groups and Age and Opportunity.  Of the many common issues, a key area of focus for us was health and home care.  I had the opportunity to be part of a national campaign called Make Home Work which specifically addressed and highlighted the need for quality, predictable, sensitive and appropriately regulated home care in Ireland.</p> <p>The Law Reform Commission report of 2011, which followed on from that campaign, is very substantial.  It is an excellent report and I welcome that it has so heavily informed the Bill and the proposals put forward.  I also commend a number of the important elements within the Bill which are very sensitively and well done.  I commend the Bill for looking at companionship plans and because it takes such care to look to the principles of independent living.  For far too long, we have had a system whereby older persons have been placed in residential care and, as a result, are placed out of the public mind and removed from active engagement in society.  As well as them losing in terms of their participation in society, society has lost out by the removal of so many older people who have immense experience, insight, ideas and engagement.  Home care has a huge role to play in ensuring independent living.  I also welcome the principles of privacy and dignity which are very important.  I would like the Minister of State to address our national positive ageing strategy and our fulfilment of our UN obligations in that regard.  Those principles are crucial.</p> <p>I share the concerns expressed by my colleagues in the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in about the quality of terms and conditions for those working in care, not just the question of pay rates but also the question of genuine pathways to progression, security of contract, predictability and management of contract.  We should ensure that working in care in Ireland is something that people can commit to.  We need to ensure that those persons described by Senator Kelleher who choose to do this with great care and sensitivity are not being asked to offer that up but are valued and have a pathway to a career in delivering quality care.  It is important that there is progress towards an employment regulation order to accompany any such Act.  The pathways and precedent are there and it is very important.</p> <p>I will touch on something that was mentioned around the tendering process.  I share the concern at the moment, which the Minister highlighted, that only 30% of our home-care services are being publicly provided.  We need to really look at strengthening public delivery within this model.  We need to look at the quality of training and recruitment in the HSE to ensure we have a huge cohort of care providers so that they are directly accountable for the care that is delivered in homes in Ireland.  They should not simply be regulated but also accountable within the HSE.  That will set the model which we expect and demand from any other providers in the sector, whether they are voluntary, community or private.  </p> <p>When I was with Older and Bolder we went into residential care homes and talked to older people about their preferences.  The strong and clear preference is for people to be cared for in their own home.  We have seen funding chipped away very seriously.  Units of time of 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 20 minutes have crept in and are absolutely contrary to the principles of dignity.  We talk about companionship plans because it is important that someone can sit and have tea and speak to somebody.  That is part of it.  The Bill is very positive.  Unfortunately in recent years the working practice has been moving in the wrong direction.  I have heard so many cases of people who move from two hours to one hour, who find they are on the clock, and are having a rushed bad meal.  I urge the Minister of State to take immediate high quality action in those areas.  The research is there.  As I said, we engaged in campaigns on this seven years ago.  There is a substantial body of work.  I urge that this be moved forward speedily.  </p> <p>As a note of caution, I will bring up, as I often do, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  There are proposals to introduce new investment court systems under which the introduction of new regulations that compromise profit can be subject to a claim of compensation.  It is absolutely imperative we get the regulation in place now while we have the freedom to do so and while it does not come with an additional potential price tag as a result of companies taking cases because of the introduction of absolutely reasonable health care focused regulation.  It is imperative we do that.  Unfortunately, as my colleague has mentioned, some of the companies working in this area have approached it with a view to increasing their profits at all costs.  We have seen companies fighting payment of staff who move from one home to another.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have also seen them fight, for example, holiday pay for staff.  There is a negative trend in how home care is delivered, and it is important that this Bill and the regulatory and other orders progress and that speedy action be taken to address that trend.</p><p>My very last point is that health care needs, as mentioned by the Minister, must be paramount.  It is very important that any further conditional review ensure that no obstacle is put in place that may discourage a vulnerable person or his or her family from accessing or seeking home care supports.  Regarding the question of contribution of payment and entitlement, it is important we do not end up creating barriers to a service which must remain determined by health care need.</p></speech>

I very much commend Senator Burke on it.  I know from first-hand experience the benefits provided by home care providers.  My mother-in-law lives with my family.  She is 90 years of age.  Home care providers come to our home, which allows her to stay in the home, and I could not praise them highly enough for the work they do.  They are caring, they work many hours and they provide what is in my view the primary care model.  I would have major problems with anything that would jeopardise that, which is why I support Senator Burke's Bill.  The providers with whom I come into contact operate to very high standards.  If the current system which allows providers to operate did not apply such standards, it would be to the detriment of both the providers employed and the people they look after in their homes.  I feel very strongly about this.</p> <p>The accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick has been perennially overcrowded.  I am the first to acknowledge that the structure is repugnant to proper care.  There are low ceilings.  It is very much like being in a pressure cooker because there are so many people crowded in there.  We want to ensure people do not have to go into accident and emergency departments.  Having home care providers, professionals providing services in the home, can prevent that from happening.  We have a new accident and emergency department coming on stream.  It will not be a panacea but it will go somewhere towards alleviating the pressure on the existing accident and emergency department.</p> <p>There are other issues.  I very much support the Bill that Senator Burke has brought forward.  I want to look on it as a positive measure.  It is about ensuring the reputation of and service provided by the professional providers are not undermined by someone who could operate under a system that does not have detailed regulation in place.  I therefore hope this legislation is brought forward.  I ask the Minister that this issue, which has been effectively pushed for a long time by Senator Burke, be fast tracked and we ensure it comes back before the House in some form with the contents of this Bill taken into account in order that we can ensure the primary care model we seek to promote is not only continued, but also enhanced.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-09a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016110900002#QQ01200"><p>I thank each Senator who contributed to this very constructive debate.  I also thank the Minister of State for her contribution.  A number of important issues were raised.  I agree with Senator Swanick on the issue of back-up support at local level, which cuts right across from nursing to general practitioners.  As I said in my introductory speech, there was a prediction that by 2021 attendance at GP practices would increase by 33% because there would be many more older people living in the community.  I also thank the seconder to the Bill, Senator Hopkins, for her contribution and her help and assistance, and Senator Richmond.  Each person who made a contribution made a very constructive one.</p> <p>We need to face up to a number of issues, one of which is the training of people who want to provide home care.  I am not sure if we have a proper structure for that.  I take on board what has been said about pay and conditions, but I think the appropriate mechanism for that would come through separate legislation.  One cannot make any job attractive unless there is adequate remuneration for the work people do.  That is important, and we need to consider that issue as well.  I am anxious to reverse what has occurred over recent years whereby, because so much political pressure has been put on ensuring people can get into residential care, we have not considered enough the issue of home care.</p> <p>I welcome what the Minister of State announced regarding home care packages and the additional funding for 2017, but we must fast-track the process.  We must ensure a proper regulatory framework is in place.  While I accept that, thanks to everyone involved in this area, from the HSE to the private sector, much progress has been made over a number of years, we still have much more work to do.  We still must ensure there is full accountability and that we can guarantee that the supports are there for people looking to stay in their homes.  I do not want to be taken up wrongly on the following point, but going back again to the Law Reform Commission report of 2011, these issues should not be parked within Departments.  I accept that the Minister of State is genuine on this matter and its progression because I have discussed with her a number of other issues, such as support and the fair deal legislation.  I hope this will be brought forward in combined legislation.  Subject to the approval of the Minister of State and the House, I propose not to press for the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage at this time.  However, we will require some progress from the Minister within the next three months.  I will face pressure from my colleagues to bring the issue back for further debate, but three to four months should allow us to get some idea as to the progress being made by the Department.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to further studies being carried out.  In fairness, the Law Reform Commission in 2011 carried out extensive research on what is happening at both local and international levels.  I always get concerned when I hear a Department tell me that it is carrying out further research.  Everyone who, like me, has served on a local authority will have had the experience a long time ago of a city or county manager saying he or she must get consultants in to carry out a further report before a decision can be made on a particular matter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The work is done.
