From listening in the corridors last night and this morning, I am aware oil was poured on troubled waters at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting and its members seem happy there is no heave against the Taoiseach.  While that may be the case, there are still many questions to be answered-----</p></speech>

Yesterday, I reiterated that the issue of the vacancy of the Seanad seat arose because of Deirdre Clune&rsquo;s election to the European Parliament.  The Seanad by-election concerns this, not the other House.  I have demanded and will continue to demand that the Taoiseach comes before this House to tender a full explanation to Members here about the shenanigans that went on.</p><p>A number of outstanding questions remain.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has not done herself proud in the replies she has given.  She mentioned in one of her statements that she wanted regional balance when she appointed Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA, the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  If one reflects on that, she was also aware that he was a potential Seanad by-election candidate and that once he became one, he would have to resign from the board.  Is this a simple ruse?  The Minister ignored the cap of nine members for the board of IMMA and enlarged it to 11 members, a bit like the banking inquiry shenanigans that happened here some time ago.  There is also the further question of why, despite the clear suggestion that a woman would have been the preferred candidate, did the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht chose to ignore this.</p><p>Some are claiming this debacle is over.  It is not because the Seanad by-election will take place on 10 October.  What if Mr. McNulty is elected by Government party Members?  If he is, it will create a serious crisis because he has already withdrawn from the race.  Has the Taoiseach directed the Members of his parliamentary party not to vote for him?  For anyone to claim this is over-----</p></speech>

I reiterate my demand that the Taoiseach, no one else, should come before this House to explain what has happened.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach comes to the House today to answer questions on this issue.  A similar amendment was rejected on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business but this side of the House will keep on insisting on this until the Taoiseach comes into this House and shows respect for this Chamber.  In a referendum last year, this Chamber was protected by the people.  The issue of the vacancy of a seat here is a matter for the Seanad.  It was very remiss of the Taoiseach and the Leader yesterday to reject this proposal.  I hope the Deputy Leader today will change the view of the Government side and request the Taoiseach to come to the House.  Even if it were for next Tuesday or Wednesday, I would then withdraw my amendment to the Order of Business.</p><p>The many unanswered questions concerning the debacle of the McNulty affair - which I accept is unfortunate for that man - affects the status and dignity of this House.  We need those answers and the only person to provide them is the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

The new model will be operable fully from 1 November which we all respect and support.</p><p>I gather there will be an announcement today regarding Part V of the planning process.

Trinity College Dublin dropped out of the top 100 while University College Dublin out of the top 200.  There has been a dramatic decline during this recession in the State funding of universities with an increase in fees and the use of some private incomes.</p> <p>The staff to student ratio has deteriorated.  It is over 18 compared with 11 in the United Kingdom.  If the Irish universities were ranked by funding, none would get remotely near the top 200.  We must invite the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in here to discuss the implications of this.  To have 20% more students and to lose 2,500 staff means fewer courses are on offer and the quality of the graduates will suffer.</p><p>The rankings are seriously defective in that they underestimate areas where Ireland has been successful in the past in the humanities, the social sciences and so on but they have an international impact.  There is a funding crisis.  There is an increase in Government attempts to control universities, which is a mistake.  There were financial problems which should not have been allowed to occur.  Our briefing note on higher education prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service states: &ldquo;Quality is something which has become &lsquo;increasingly government-driven rather than institution-led&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;.  That is a mistake.  It has involved layers of bureaucracy.  We need people in the classroom.  People of all senior ranks in universities should get back to lecturing.  There are problems like that.  There were some expense account scandals that the Comptroller and Auditor General had to investigate in Waterford and elsewhere.  We need more resources for the classroom.  The numbers are based on 2012 and will get worse before they get better.  This could be a point of decline in Irish education.  Nobody wants to see that.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the extra time.</p></speech>

This is the party that was hammered in the 2011 election and yet before it left office stuffed boards with its supporters and cronies that ran into seriously inflated numbers-----</p></speech>

How can we get more people back to work?  We all welcome the fact that the live register figures published yesterday show a further decrease in the numbers unemployed.  Employment is now at its highest level since 2009.  The numbers on the live register have fallen by 4% since the launch of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, from 15.1% in February 2012 to 11.1% in September 2014.  It is firmly on track to create the 100,000 jobs that it promised in the programme for Government.  Could we invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to the House in the next week or two to discuss how we can help spread employment opportunities to the regions and further help small businesses create much-needed employment in the rural communities that many in this House represent?</p><p>In light of the number of very serious and tragic accidents on farms in recent weeks I would like to have a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills about how to include a health and safety segment in the school curriculum so that young people, whether living on farms or travelling our roads, can be made much more aware of the hazards associated with large, high-powered equipment because tragedies such as those we have seen recently cannot be allowed to continue.  Too many families have been bereaved as a result of accidents that could have been prevented.</p></speech>

A journalist yesterday said, in the context of the ongoing State appointments row, that what politicians in these Houses know but do not admit is that all Governments have done this.  I will admit that all Governments have because that has been the system.<br/>It was pointed out that in the American political system, for example, the newly-appointed US ambassador to Ireland - whom I welcome and wish well, following his ratification - will serve for only two years because when the Obama Administration ends all the Democrat appointees will be gone.  If a Republican is elected President, Republicans will be appointed to boards.  That happened in Greece during the bailout process where, I discovered, as others I am sure did, that not only are state appointments made by politicians and governments but revenue collectors are appointed by the government, which has led to enormous inefficiencies.  I am not justifying this.  I applaud the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, for moving very quickly yesterday to send a memorandum to the Government to the effect that appointments to State boards will go through the Commission for Public Service Appointments.<br/>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications I went through a process this summer, with my committee colleagues, of sifting through 140 <i>curricula vitae</i>sent in by members of the public, in response to an advertisement from the committee.  This was to recommend four members for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and four members for the RTE Authority to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White.  We interviewed all eight candidates yesterday, which was an exercise in democracy at its purest.  All parties and none applauded it.<br/>I know that Senator Brennan, who is on the committee, will agree that while the process was very difficult and burdensome because of the time it consumed over the summer, we came up with four people for each board of whom we can feel very proud.  They have come through a very pure democratic process.  I have no idea what, if any, their political affiliations are, and Senator Brennan would say the same.  They are recommended on merit.  I welcome that process.  Maybe now we can take this item off the agenda and focus on the economy, as Senator Mullins says.<br/>It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the reduction in unemployment figures.  That is a wonderful development.  Long may it continue because it means that fewer sons and daughters, brothers and sisters will have to take a plane out of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100200004#C00600"><p>I agree with Senator Barrett&rsquo;s concerns about the future of third level education.  As a recent graduate of University College Dublin, UCD, I am well aware of what is happening on the front line and in particular of the pressure on academic staff to deliver with less and less resources.  We tend to talk in terms of falling unemployment figures and improved fiscal outlooks and so forth, as though the war on austerity was over but it is not over.  We are living with the results of austerity, particularly in the third level sector.  There is sometimes a lack of sympathy for that sector in the way that there is sympathy for the needs of children.  There is no doubt, however, that the way our universities fare is important for inward investment and for how the wider world perceives this country.</p><p>I was very disappointed to see all Irish universities, except the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, effectively fall down the rankings, and continue to fall as they have done for the past few years.  That includes Trinity College, Dublin.  I noticed, however, that the chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority made a few positive points including, for example, that the student contribution of &euro;250 should remain with the universities and not be effectively removed by the State&rsquo;s putting less money into third level education.  That should be considered.  Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to consider that as an immediate response to the crisis in third level education?  I would like the report on the funding of third level education to be expedited and put on the table as a matter of urgency.  I do not believe the Irish university system can continue to take the hits it has taken over recent years and not slip further in the international rankings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-02a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100200004#C00700"><p>I agree entirely with Senators Barrett and Hayden.</p> <p>There is little doubt that we must invest.  It has been interesting to hear the Government state for a number of years that one reason Ireland has had successful foreign direct investment is because of our high standard of education.  Since the onset of austerity, as we call it, resources for universities have been reduced and this would account for the disastrous showings on the rankings.  Although I heard Mr. Tom Boland express the opinion this morning that these rankings are not necessarily the only measurements one can have, their importance is recognised around the world and, therefore, we suffer a great deal from anything that would damage them.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has stated we should not assume that austerity is over but should make sure we get it right.  As a nation, we still are spending more than we are earning and no family, no home and nobody can continue that way.  Consequently, I believe we must consider carefully how we spend and how we earn.  While the figures are very good, and Senator Mullins touched on some of them, we have a long way to go before we relax.</p><p>If I may take one further case, one district in our island is out of control, namely, north Louth and south Armagh.  I refer to the amount of smuggling, including the smuggling of cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol, and diesel laundering that is going on there, which is so out of control that it appears to me as though there is a Mafia up there, running it on both sides of the Border.  To a large extent, Members know how this must be solved.  Something similar was experienced in Dublin some years ago and it was not until the death of Veronica Guerin that suddenly the Government and the Garda decided to do something about it and to move on it.  I believe the death of Adrian Donohoe in Lordship, County Louth, should have been the point, as was the death of Veronica Guerin, when it was decided that something must be done about this.  Apparently, it was known who killed Veronica Guerin but the State had difficulty in bringing him to court.  Similarly, I believe there is strong knowledge as to who were the culprits in the case of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  The Garda and the Minister must move on this as it is something with which we cannot live any longer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-02a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1138" speakername="Terry Brennan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100200005#D00200"><p>Cronyism, favouritism and jobs for the boys and ladies has been a topical issue in both Houses for the past week or so.  I note that like my colleague on the opposite side of the House, Senator Mooney, I took part in a working group in which we examined 129 applications for appointments to the RTE Authority and to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It involved 129 highly qualified people and that working group had the difficult task of reducing the number down to eight, that is, four to RTE and four to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  As Senator Mooney noted, we have been taking part in this exercise for the past two months or more.  Yesterday, we interviewed those whom we had chosen from their curricula vitae and I feel honoured to have been part of this working group, which chose eight highly qualified people, men and women, who will be a major asset.  My point is this is the manner in which appointments to all State boards should take place.  There was no cronyism, no one approached me on behalf of anyone, there was no favouritism or anything but we had a consensus and chose eight great people.  As Senator Mooney also stated, no one knew what politics they had.  They were not jobs for the boys and this is the way it should be.</p><p>I am unsure who called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come into the House urgently, but I also call on him to come into the House to discuss the planning laws in which there is room for improvement and which must be tightened up.

This calls for careful examination of the criteria by which universities are judged.  I am unsure whether the Times Higher Education group actually has the right criteria.  I am unsure whether it has the tools to measure the performance of the universities.  That said, the consistent drop is something and it is substantial in both cases, although Trinity has not dropped quite as disastrously as UCD.  Domestic factors are involved in this regard.  We are operating at approximately 45% of the state funding of the highest universities.  The entire university system has changed since I was an undergraduate in Trinity.  The university community is now seven times what it then was, which is an astonishing figure.  Moreover, in the case of Trinity, it is on the same small island site, generally speaking.  Consequently, the relationship between staff and students has been weakened.  In my day, there were three terms, namely, Trinity, Michaelmas and Hilary, there were seven weeks in each term and six students in each tutorial group.  The first of the seven weeks was used to discuss the course in general and to pick up subjects on which the student was to write essays, and over the next six weeks, the essays were presented and were critiqued by the academic and student colleagues.  I believe this has largely been watered down and I believe it was one of the factors that gave Trinity its pre-eminence.  I express concern, therefore, although I am unsure how much can be done in respect of funding.  Governments tend to operate on fairly short-term strategies, and as for investing in the universities with the intention of making money, it certainly will but it is a long-term prospect.  It is a worrying situation which Members should keep their eye on.  I am glad my colleagues have raised this issue.</p></speech>

The fact there has been an explanation, an apology and, much more important, new structures put in place for the further appointments to State boards means there is a sincere and genuine attempt to ensure good and positive politics will be the norm in the future.</p></speech>

I was greatly moved recently by an interview on Clare FM, as well as some national interviews given by Eugene Hogan on the tragic death of his brother, Dermot, as a result of a farm accident in County Offaly.  I note there have been a couple of tragic farm accidents in County Clare recently.  I believe the Seanad has a role to play in examining farm safety and how the number of these unnecessary deaths can be reduced.  In this context, I propose today that the Seanad should engage in a public consultation process on farm safety.  This would bring in the Health and Safety Authority, those who have found themselves bereaved as a result of farm accidents, as well as the manufacturers of the high-powered machines that are causing many of the farm accidents.</p> <p>This House has a unique role to play in highlighting this area which is causing a lot of grief and loss of life for our citizens.  It would be appropriate for the Seanad public consultation process to be adopted and for the House to hold hearings on this topic.  The House has held very successful hearings in the past, particularly in the area of cancer.  If the House was to do that, it would make a positive contribution to reducing then number of deaths in farm accidents.</p></speech>

That may be the information that the Minister is receiving from the upper echelons of the Defence Forces but I know from members of the Defence Forces in my own community that they are suffering hardship.

I find it hard to see Senator Wilson's eyes across the Chamber.</p><p>Today, I wish to speak about the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the national dementia strategy.  This Government committed, when it took up office in 2011, to publish and carry out a national dementia strategy.  A number of steps have taken place since then, including support from Atlantic Philanthropies Ireland in the form of funding, research into the strategy, a call for public submissions and the setting up of an expert working group.  We are now at the stage where the strategy should be published.  During the summer, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for this area, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announced that Atlantic Philanthropies Ireland were providing &euro;15 million and that the HSE would match this funding to prioritise the rolling out of the strategy which would include GP training, public awareness and intensive home care.  As recently as 17 September, the Minister of State announced that the strategy publication date was imminent.  I met representatives of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland this week and they are very concerned that the clock is still ticking and that the strategy has not been published.</p><p>In view of this I ask the Acting Leader to request the Minister of State to come into the House, preferably with the strategy published or to tell us when it is going to be published and also to outline to us how we are going to roll it out.  Many strategies have been published and shelved.  However, there is a commitment of &euro;30 million for the strategy to be rolled out.  We therefore need to have a discussion and a debate with the Minister of State on this matter. I welcome the opportunity today to call for that. Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

It revealed a very strong year for the tourism industry in Galway and beyond.  The IHF report highlights the fact that 87% of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation proprietors have increased their business this year.  The overall tourism figures are up 10%.  It is also good to hear that 97% of the hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation industry considers the Government's introduction of the 9% VAT rate has had a very positive impact on business. This has resulted in 73% of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation proprietors have now hired an additional member of staff in the last 12 months. The IHF notes that since the Government came to office, 23,000 new jobs have been created in the industry and an additional 10,000 indirect jobs are being supported.  I congratulate Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, who was the former Minister in this area, for his very successful tenure in this brief.  The results of this are now coming to fruition.</p></speech>

However, the members of the public would not forgive us if we decided to take our foot off the accelerator. We must ensure that we refocus and re-energise our efforts to make sure that we get that figure down  to single digits and that the country gets closer to full employment.  I suggest - we have done this before in this House - that we set aside a period of time for a debate on ideas for the forthcoming budget. The budget will be finalised in two weeks' time.  We should take the opportunity to bring in the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform - perhaps all three of them should come in for an hour at a time - to put forward ideas that we can generate between now and then.</p> <p>Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, should come before this House for an hour each to put forward ideas.  I have received e-mails from people and I am putting them to the Minister.  All Senators in this Chamber should come up with ideas for each Minister - a small idea could grow into something bigger that could have a huge impact on our efforts to get people back to work.  This is the only game in town, though political games are being played at the moment.  The irony of the indignation of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues on the other side of the Chamber is not lost on me.</p></speech>

Some 24 lives have been lost so far this year on farms and that is far too many.  I look forward to a discussion in this House on the issue of safety so we can do everything possible to ensure there are no more tragedies affecting farming families.  I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, as at the national ploughing championships last week he introduced safety features and grants for farmers who wish to install or repair slats or manhole covers.  The safety features he introduced will lower the risks facing farming families and they are welcome.  The grants will encourage people to carry out improvements on their farms.</p></speech>

Last week the development board of the national paediatric hospital appointed a new design team from BDT, a world-renowned firm of architects.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said this is a milestone for the hospital, which is proceeding full steam ahead.  We expect planning permission will go through during the summer of 2015 and the first patients will be admitted in 2019.  There will be arguments in the coming year over the location - whether it should be on the M50, in Blanchardstown, in the Midlands and so on - but the website for the national paediatric hospital refers to it as a tri-location for paediatrics, maternity and adult health care.  The website stresses that the hospital is particularly for children, mothers and neonates.</p><p>This is not the first nor second time I have brought this issue to the attention of the Seanad.  I must ask the same question for a third time - this time in reference to the remark by the Minister stating &quot;full steam ahead&quot;.  Will the Minister, the Department and the design team seek planning permission for the maternity hospital at the same time?  The hospital is to open in 2019 but I want 20-20 vision on the subject of neonates.  It is not acceptable for neonates to be driven by ambulance to the new national paediatric hospital.  If planning permission is not sought simultaneously for the maternity hospital it may be too late to seek it when the paediatric hospital is built.  Will the Minister seek planning permission for the new maternity hospital?  If not, why not?</p></speech>

I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on indicating that he will move quickly to close this obscure loophole.  Yesterday in the other House Deputy Pearse Doherty of Sinn F&eacute;in described this section as "sickening".  Perhaps the Leader can ask Sinn F&eacute;in whether it was sickening that the body of a disappeared person turned up in a bog in County Meath after 30 years.  Words like "sickening" should be reserved for such circumstances.  Members of Sinn F&eacute;in are apologists for the murderers of the young man in question so they might be a little more circumspect in their parliamentary language.</p></speech>

I have no comment on his eavesdropping skills but my view on this issue has been expressed consistently on the record on a number of occasions.  I have serious concerns about the manner and timing of the appointment of Mr. McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, but things have moved on.  Mr. McNulty has indicated he does not want people to vote for him and the Taoiseach has advised Fine Gael members not to do so and to respect Mr. McNulty's wishes.  We will have to consider how we vote, in accordance with the secret ballot, and I know the Clerk of the Seanad has sent instruction on this to all Senators.  In the circumstances I will not accede to the amendment sought by Senator O'Donovan.<br/>Yesterday I asked the Leader for a debate on the new mechanisms announced by the Minster, Deputy Howlin, which received Cabinet approval this week.  It is historic that the Government has now agreed to a revised model for ministerial appointments to State boards that will resolve this ongoing issue at last.  As Senator Mooney very fairly acknowledged, it has been an issue that has affected many Governments.  This week's decision ensures there will be a structured approach requiring that all appointments to vacancies on State boards must be advertised openly on the State boards portal, <i>stateboards.ie</i>, operated by the Public Appointments Service.  There will be specified and detailed criteria for the effective performance of a role and these may be determined by a Minister, if necessary.  Applications will be processed through a transparent assessment system designed and implemented by the independent Public Appointments Service.<br/>I welcome these changes and some colleagues gave examples of existing good practice whereby different committees scrutinised appointments and made them in a transparent and objective manner.  The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality scrutinised the membership of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and we found it a very useful exercise.  I hope there will be more of this as it is clear there will be a very different system in all Government appointments.<br/>Senator Paul Coghlan commented on the flogging of a dead horse and referred to the new planning Bill that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is publishing today.  It is an important Bill that will make significant changes and improvements to the planning regime, particularly by allowing for the imposition of vacant site levies by local authorities, which will free land for building.  The focus the Bill is allowing the construction of housing at a swifter rate than heretofore.<br/>Senator Barrett referred to the decline in Irish university rankings evidenced in the publication of <i>The Times</i>higher education rankings.  As others said, like opinion polls, these rankings always come with a health warning.  There are questions about the criteria used and different ranking systems use different criteria.  The staff-student ratio is only one criterion as is the area of academic citation.</p> <p>Everybody who contributed on this did so in a measured fashion, which is appropriate.  While UCD has, unfortunately, fallen in the rankings it is still among the top 200.  Also, it is not true to say there have been dramatic or consistent falls in respect of other institutions.  For example, Trinity College, which was already out of the top 100 has fallen from 129th to 138th in today's ranking, which, while regrettable, is a relatively small fall.  If it was an opinion poll it would be said that it was within the margin of error.  It is important to say that NUI Galway has moved upwards and is now the third ranked university in Ireland.  Also, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland has for the first time entered the top 400.  It should not be forgotten that there are more than 15,000 universities represented in the rankings.  It is important to bear all this in mind when commenting.</p><p>I am happy to support the call by Senator Sean Barrett that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, be asked to come to the House for a debate on the third level sector generally and the many factors that dictate the ranking and status of different universities.  This is not just an issue of resources but the structure of universities and the systems in place and so on.</p><p>Senator Mullins referred to Fianna F&aacute;il's history in terms of the filling of board positions with its supporters.  The figures, in terms of Fianna F&aacute;il's approximately 272 appointments to State boards during its final four months in government from December 2010 to March 2011, speak for themselves.  That is an important figure.</p></speech>

It is genuinely a good news story that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from a crisis peak of 15.1% in 2012.  It is hugely significant that there has been a 9% year-on-year decrease in unemployment, with long-term unemployment having decreased by 5.5% year on year.  I know everyone in the House will welcome this.  It is hoped this pattern of decreases will continue into the future.  As I said, this issue was also fairly noted by Senator Mooney.</p><p>Senator Mullins asked that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, be invited to the House for a debate on jobs and job creation.  Previous debates on this issue in the House have proved very useful.  I will ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate.</p><p>Senator Mullins also referred to the tragic deaths in recent times on farms.  We were all heartbroken to hear about the two little girls involved in the accident on a farm in Cork.  The Senator's suggestion that primary schools educate children about farm and road safety is a good idea.  It might be worthwhile for the Senator to raise that matter with the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>I have responded to some of the questions raised by Senator Mooney in his contribution.  I note the Senator also welcomed the new model launched by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, this week, which marks an historic change in the system of appointments to boards.  We should all applaud the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and Government in this regard.</p><p>Senator Mooney also referred to the appointment of the new US ambassador to Ireland.  Unlike here, ambassadors in the US are political appointees rather than civil servants.  We do not have the same system as the US in terms of the election of judges and prosecutors.  There are many ways in which our system bears much better scrutiny.</p><p>Senator Hayden also spoke about and called for a debate on the third level institution rankings.  As I said, it would be good to have the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, come to the House for such a debate and, in particular, the report on third level funding, publication of which we would all welcome.</p><p>Senator Quinn also spoke about the university rankings and the importance in the context of foreign direct investment of high standards in our universities.  He also referred to Tom Boland's important statement that rankings are not the only measurement and that there are other criteria used, some of which may be flawed.</p><p>Senator Quinn also referred to the issues of cigarette smuggling and diesel laundering in north Louth and south Armagh and spoke of the tragic death of Garda Adrian Donohoe as being a catalyst for change.  I agree with him on that.  Next Tuesday the Minister for Justice and Equality will be in the House for the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014, which might present an appropriate opportunity for the Senator to raise his concerns relating to the particular area of the country mentioned.  It should be possible to introduce measures that might be of assistance, although I suspect what is needed is policing strategies and measures rather than legislative ones.  It is an important issue which was brought home in the context of the tributes paid yesterday in this House to the late former Senator Edward Haughey who as a major employer brought so much prosperity to the south Armagh area.  That is perhaps a better way of dealing with these issues than the vehicle of terrorist legislation.</p><p>Senator Brennan spoke about the appointments to the RTE Authority and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which again are examples of good practice in terms of the nominees having been required to engage in a process of hearings-----</p></speech>

It is important that this House gives credit to good practice regardless of by whom it was instituted or which committee engages in it.  The media does not pay enough attention to the many Ministers who have been utilising this open and transparent system of State board appointments.</p><p>Senator Brennan also expressed the hope that the planning Bill would come before this House soon and called on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to address the unauthorised developments issue.  The Minister will be before the House on the planning Bill at which time issues such as the vacant site levy and Part V social housing issues can be addressed.</p><p>Senator Norris also spoke about the university rankings.  I agree with his comments in regard to the need for careful examination of the criteria being used in that regard.  It is also important to say that in Ireland there have been positive increases in recent years in the numbers of students attending third level education.  Ireland has one of the highest proportions of third level graduates across the EU, which is something of which we should be very proud.  Our universities are doing a very good job in terms of raising educational standards in Ireland generally.  When looking at criteria across other countries, it should be remembered that other countries may have much lower levels of participation in third level than is the case in Ireland.  We have also seen considerable success here in terms of the roll-out of campus companies from different universities through good use of philanthropy and philanthropic funding.</p><p>Senator Conway welcomed the new structures in regard to appointments to State boards as positive politics, with which I agree.  He also put forward important ideas in relation to how we deal with accidents on farms and address the issue of farm safety generally.  The Senator also called for the Seanad to play a role in this regard and for the Seanad Public Consultation Committee in particular to take it on as its next topic for consultation, which I believe is a good idea.  I would advise the Senator to communicate with the Cathaoirleach on the matter and I will undertake to raise it at the next meeting of the Public Consultation Committee that this be the next issue it addresses.  I agree it is an appropriate forum to try to come up with ideas for the better dissemination of the message on farm safety.  The Health and Safety Authority advertising in this regard is very powerful, but clearly more needs to be done.</p><p>Senator Wilson spoke about the McNulty affair and wilfully misquoted Senator Paul Coghlan on the issue of the dead horse, which I do not propose to go over again.</p></speech>

Senator Wilson also raised the plight of Defence Forces personnel.  I am sure all of us, on reading some of the reports from the Defence Forces representatives organisation, would share his concern.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has said that he has not received representations on that matter.  He will be in the House next Wednesday at which time these matters can be raised with him.</p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of the national dementia strategy, in respect of which issue on Tuesday last I asked the Leader for a debate and commended the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland on its work in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be requested to come to the House to update us on that strategy.</p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne also raised the issue of the McNulty affair.  I have responded on that issue.  As I said at the time the Minister of State, Deputy Heather Humphreys was in the House, we should have a general debate with her on the different issues to do with the arts.  We have considerable expertise in this area in the Seanad, in particular, Senator Mac Conghail.  It would be worthwhile having such a debate.</p><p>Senator Naughton spoke about the Irish Hotels Federation quarterly barometer survey which again was a good news story.  The Senator noted that there had been a 10% increase in tourism figures last year and pointed to the success of the 9% VAT rate in this area.  I commend the Senator on raising this important issue less than two weeks out from the budget.  Continuation of the reduced VAT rate is one of the key issues we hope to see addressed in the budget.  I am sure everybody in the House would agree.</p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy also spoke about the good news story of the decrease in the unemployment figures and suggested we have a debate on ideas for the budget and job creation, which debate would be well worth having, even after the budget.</p> <p>We should have that debate on job creation.  I note really creative ideas, for instance, around apprenticeships.  There was good news yesterday, when Waterford Crystal has for the first time in years taken on new apprentices in the high-skilled glass-blowing sector.  That is really positive news for Waterford and the south east to see that recommencing.  We might have a useful debate on that with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  We will also have statements on the budget on 14 October and Deputy Bruton has promised to come into this House shortly after Halloween to a debate, as we might focus on job creation with him.</p><p>Senator Comiskey raised farm safety and I have already spoken on that.</p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan, on the McNulty affair, pointed out the Taoiseach had recommended to his members not to vote for Mr. McNulty to respect his wishes.  The Senator also spoke on the board of the paediatric hospital and the issue of planning for a maternity unit at the same time as planning permission is submitted for the children's hospital.  It is an excellent idea to ask the Minister that.  It might be done as a matter on the Adjournment.  I was personally involved with the submission from the Coombe hospital, which looked to have the sight of the children's hospital co-located with the Coombe.  There is a plan to develop the Coombe hospital, which is a maternity hospital local to the St. James's site that was ultimately chosen.  It is possible to open up a swift corridor between the two sites and that might be something the Senator could pursue directly with the Minister.</p><p>Senator Gilroy pointed out that section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was an obscure anomaly which appeared to allow Ministers to be exempt from certain charges.  I would agree with Senator Gilroy and commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government for closing this loophole swiftly when it became apparent.  Sinn F&eacute;in did attempt to make some political mileage out of it but I would agree with Senator Gilroy that the term sickening is far more appropriate to use about that party's own actions.  That really came home to us all when we saw Brendan Megraw's body discovered finally 36 years after his disappearance, and after his mother had died.  Hearing his family speak about the heartbreak they have been through in the past 36 years brought home to all us what sickening really means.</p></speech>

The Minister rightly pointed out the President's office is subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and an Estimate in the D&aacute;il but not subject, like every other body, to freedom of information.  I do not see how imposing this requirement on the office would impinge in any way on the functions of the President as he carries out his role as head of State.  The debate has nothing to do with him or any other President but rather the running of the office.<br/>Amendment No. 4 relates to Tourism Ireland.  The Minister gave a reason in this regard last week, but it should probably be addressed at cross-Border level at the next talks.  Sinn F&eacute;in speaks about cronyism, but it appointed a failed local election candidate, who then became a Member of the European Parliament, as chairman of Safefood which, as a cross-Border body, is also probably not subject to freedom of information.  The Minister should take up this point with his counterparts on the North-South Ministerial Body.<br/>I will not move amendment No. 13.  We have already had a full debate on the points raised in the other amendments.</p></speech>

The Office of the President should be above this kind of thing.  This is dragging the office, which is the highest office in the land, into the political hurly burly and I do not think it appropriate.  Perhaps the Estimates can be discussed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, but the Office of the President is the one thing which must be kept out of politics and, in particular, party politics.  There is a danger that were this amendment to be carried the Office of the President would be sullied and would become a target for inappropriate discussion in the House.  Under the Standing Orders of the House, discussion of the President and his or her office is excluded.  I do not see how we can reconcile these two things.  I am sure it was tabled by my good friend, Senator Byrne, in good faith but I strongly feel the Office of the President should be totally immune.  There is always tittle-tattle about Presidents.  I remember Mary Robinson being subject to all kinds of attacks.  The current President has had some little bits and pieces said.  We should not encourage this kind of thing at all.  It should be stamped on firmly and I hope the House will, after reflection, unanimously reject the amendment.</p></speech>

It has always been the tradition, and accepted in both Houses, that the President is above politics.  It has been a firm and rooted tradition since the foundation of the State, and accepted in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, that we do not discuss the President.  In keeping with this independence I felt it would not be appropriate to cover the Office of the President under freedom of information.  With regard to the matter raised by Senator Byrne on financial affairs, the Vote is fully scrutinised, presented to the Houses and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and all expenditure is fully exposed and subject to public scrutiny as is right and proper.  This is the appropriate extent.</p><p>With regard to Tourism Ireland, as I have explained, it and other bodies mentioned are part of the North-South institutions.  There will be a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council tomorrow.  I have been formally advised by the Office of the Attorney General that amazingly, it would require a formal reopening of the Good Friday Agreement to include it in the North-South Ministerial Council but that is where we are.</p></speech>

I feel strongly the Bill may be going too far.  The original Bill exempted private communications between two or more members of the Government.  Even political commentators state this would inhibit Cabinet discussion.  It would restrict the capacity of the Government to debate freely, frankly, openly and honestly matters of policy.  I do not see why we should be so craven and give in to the media's demands, suck up to the press and let them have access to information of this nature.  I am very much inclined to go back to the original legislation and exclude private communications between two or more members of the Government.  Including it only means certain matters will be discussed off the table and there will be no record.  We will be deprived of the historical record in 50 years time when the State papers become available.  It does not achieve any positive end.  It inhibits historical discussion and the understanding of the historical perspective.  I appeal to the Minister to exclude private communications between members of the Government.</p></speech>

The Senator is not right to state he wants to revert to the <i>status quo</i>.  This is the <i>status quo</i>, in as much as I am undoing the amendment made by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2003.  The original legislation was not as restricted.  The balance I have struck is about right.  I understand the point made, and there will be occasions when people may not want to commit to paper some of their views for fear it may be covered by freedom of information, but on balance one could make an argument against freedom of information in its totality if one believes this to be the case.  By and large, best practice internationally shows the usefulness and utility of freedom of information.  For this reason I do not propose to accept the amendment tabled by Senators Norris and Barrett.<br/>With regard to amendment No. 10, Senator Byrne made a very strong point on Committee Stage on private papers and a requirement of the Houses of the Oireachtas in their Standing Orders to define what they are.</p> <p>I do not know whether the Senators have made any progress in terms of raising this matter at the CPP of each of the Houses, subsequent to our last discussion.  That is somewhere it could be debated.  <br/>There is a definition of private papers that is referenced in this legislation, a  definition that I forgot to mention on the last occasion.  I inserted it into the Houses of the Oireachtas Inquiries Act. Section 42(k) of this Bill provides that FOI does not apply to:<blockquote>a record relating to any of the private papers (within the meaning of Article 15.10 of the Constitution) of a member of either House of the Oireachtas or an official document of either or both of such Houses that is required by the rules or Standing Orders of either or both of such Houses to be treated as confidential.</blockquote>The definition of private papers in the Oireachtas legislation that is enacted, and without prejudice of course to the powers of both Houses, individually and separately, to make rules and Standing Orders pursuant to the enabling provision of the Constitution in Article 15.10, in the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 contains a definition of &quot;private paper&quot; for the purposes of that Act.  In acknowledgement of that, section 42(l) of this FOI Bill provided that the FOI Act does not apply, &quot;unless consent has been lawfully given for its disclosure, a record relating to any private paper or confidential communication, within the meaning of Part 10 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013&quot;.  There is a definition.  It is reasonably comprehensive because it replicates what we debated on the inquiries Act.  It is still open to the Houses of the Oireachtas to set their own rules on the implementation of the enabling provision of the Constitution.</p></speech>

I am glad that he sees the point of the argument that I am making but I wish he would go a little further.  I would like him to explain to me the meaning of the word "private".  If something is private it means immune to prying eyes.  How can a private correspondence be made accessible to the 4 million citizens on this island?  It is not private.  Where does the notion of privacy go?  Is there no room for privacy in Government?  Is there no discretion allowed?  I find this astonishing.  I almost feel a vote coming on.</p><p>We should be tougher in confronting the pressures that push towards so much disclosure.  If a communication is private, and is intended to be private, other means will be found for making that communication which will leave no trace.  It seems an astonishing contradiction that we should allow general public access to communications that are deemed in the legislation to be private.  What is the point in things being private if they are public?  I do not understand it.</p></speech>

There are countervailing rights such as the right to one's good name and the right to not interfere in the course of justice.  If I discussed knowledge I had about a fundamental misconduct of justice that had somebody incarcerated, should my right to privacy be greater than somebody's incarceration?  All rights are balanced against other people's and other rights.  No right, normally, is absolutely fundamental to the point that it supersedes other's rights, even to live, to not be incarcerated or oppressed, or to be deprived of a range of rights.  In those contexts, we can talk in absolutist terms but these things are not absolute.  On balance, my view is that to corral into an immune space all communications between two members of the Government that they deem to be private so that it becomes an impediment, a debar and an impenetrable wall is an assertion that would undermine the principle.  It has undermined, in my judgment, the proper enactment of FOI since it was amended by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2003.</p></speech>

The section states, on page 73 line 5: &quot;Where an FOI request has been made in respect of a record, a person who without lawful excuse and with intention to deceive destroys or materially alters a record shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a class B fine.&quot;  That is just a slap on the wrist.  There may very well be cases where a slap on the wrist is appropriate because the offence is quite a minor one.  In such circumstances and in terms of defacing or destroying of public records, the fact that one may face merely such a fine will allow for many situations in which officials would find it worth their while to act accordingly and accept the fine.  By contrast, to have a provision allowing for the possibility of a six months prison sentence would strengthen the Government's hand and protect records which need to be protected.  I urge the Minister to look favourably on my amendment.  </p></speech>

It is a serious matter, as Senator Norris has said, to destroy a public record because one is trying to undermine the Minister in the context of the Freedom of Information Act.  It is a form of suppression and merits a penalty that will act as a deterrent for that offence.</p></speech>

As they rightly state, under the Fines Act 2010, a class B fine currently stands at not more than &euro;4,000 on summary conviction.</p><p>By way of explanation of how such matters come about, we take advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the appropriate level of penalty into which each offence falls.  The advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that this category, class B, is the appropriate one in the balancing of fines and penalties in the order of the Bill and in comparison with other legislation.  I am minded to accept the advice of the Office of the Attorney General in that matter where the expertise and the consistency of one office's view is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-02a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100200013#M00200"><p>That is all very well but Attorneys General are frequently wrong.  It would be much more important to take the advice of this House rather than the advice of an Attorney General who may well be wrong.  On a maximum fine of &euro;4,000 for defacing records, Garda records, which were a subject of contention between the British and Irish Government and between various individuals in this State and the Garda, regularly go missing.  I feel strongly on this.  The advice of the Attorney General should be taken into the balance, but I would ask the Minister to think again.  This is no deterrent.  If there is a situation, for example, involving financial irregularities, the kind of practice that went on during the banking crisis, does the Minister seriously think a &euro;4,000 fine will deter anybody from covering up or destroying?  I appeal to him to think again about this.  I am sure the Attorney General is a tough enough bird to survive her advice being ignored for once.  I feel strongly about this.  I will call a vote on it.  I beg the Minister to reconsider this and give some indication that he will think of it again.</p><p>This is a deliberate act.  This is the destruction of records that are the property of the people.  I spoke about privacy earlier and asked why make private communications available to the mass of the people.  Now we have material that is the possession or birthright of the people being treated casually and its defacement and destruction regarded in so light a manner.  I cannot understand this.</p><p>I cannot speculate on the reasons the Attorney General went through it.  Maybe it is merely that she went through a list of penalties, but legislation is often out of date.  In a previous session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the former Minister of State, Mr. Martin Mansergh, when a Senator, introduced a rack of matters going back to the fact that it was a capital offence to omit the words &quot;Crom ab&uacute;&quot;, the Butlers' war cry, and we had immense fun with this kind of stuff.  I would not say it is merely a matter of running a scan to see what was comparable.  Can the Minister give any indication of comparable offences?  I suppose it is an unfair question.  In case he has any access to that information, what are the comparable offences?  I would like to know them because I do not believe they are anything as consequential as this.  This is a very serious matter.  This is the deliberate destruction to avoid the exposure of certain information that may be detrimental to the career of somebody in the Civil Service.  This is a most serious matter.  I beg the Minister to reconsider.</p></speech>

I expect nothing less.  I will explain a few points.  First, this is a new offence.  It was not an offence in the original 1997 Act.  It certainly was not an offence under the amending legislation brought in by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  I regard this as an important issue to create this new offence.</p></speech>

It is the final tranche of statute law revision, and it includes our declaration of war against Denmark, which we are now ceasing, and our declaration of war against France.  I was not aware, but we are, apparently, still at war with both Denmark and France.  Some of these offences carry incredible penalties.  Senator Norris instanced some himself.  That is in the context of historical fact.</p><p>We try to have a common framework for penalties.  That is best determined by one office giving advice across all Departments rather than individual Ministers making decisions on the hoof on the basis of passionate and well-argued speeches.  On balance, I will stick with the advice I have.</p></speech>

Although I have not had time to check, I am certain that if one does not keep records for the Revenue Commissioners as a taxpayer, one may well be subject to a criminal prosecution and maybe more than a fine.</p></speech>

I accept that this is a new offence and I welcome the Minister's innovation in introducing this offence, but why not make it a real offence?  If serious harm is done by the actions of this person, be he or she a civil servant or not, the person certainly should be prosecuted.  Six months in jail is not a heavy sentence for a serious case of deliberately destroying or defacing public records.  The Minister refers to the reputation of the person involved.  What about, for example, where the reputation of a third party is involved in the destruction and the third party has no recourse?  Somebody convicted should be sent to jail.  If persons are sent to jail for not having a television licence, how is that for comparability?</p></speech>

Freedom of information is one of the suite of measures that will be transformative of the way we conduct public affairs and, I hope, rebuild a broken trust with the general public.  Senators have different opinions on how freedom of information impacts, with some more jaundiced than others.

He was on top of his brief and had the information to hand.  Generally speaking, it was a good couple of days' work.  However, I regret some of the Bill's broadening effects.  It is an incitement to the media to pick up on many efforts.  I am glad that the Minister did not accept the inclusion of the President's office.  That was appropriate.  However, I have a suspicion that one of the Minister's reasons for not accepting any of the large number of amendments was that he did not want to take the Bill back to the D&aacute;il.  Let the record show that he is nodding vigorously.  I hope that, in a further revision of this legislation, he will consider matters such as using a prison sentence as a deterrent.</p><p>This is a work in progress.  So far, it is 1-0 to the Civil Service, which has managed to protect itself.  To be honest, Senator Byrne made this point to me.  I want to give him credit.</p></speech>

This Bill has had an interesting passage that was not straightforward.  There was a great deal of commentary from the Opposition, interest groups and some Members on the Government side.  Significant changes have been made to the Bill since its publication.  In light of the changes made in the D&aacute;il, we support the legislation.  In this case, the D&aacute;il rather than the Seanad was the revising Chamber, as the amendments were made on Committee or Report Stage in the Lower House.</p></speech>

Anything that I stated on Committee Stage was meant to strengthen his hand and support him.<br/>I wish to express a concern about section 7 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which is headed, &quot;Refusal of access to certain information&quot;.  To draw the Minister's attention to it, the section states: &quot;Notwithstanding any other enactment [for example, what we have been debating today], the Minister [for Education and Skills] may refuse access to information specified.&quot;  This is a sign that certain people - I am not indicating a ministerial colleague - do not yet share the enthusiasm of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Seanad for freedom of information.<br/>As a member of the banking review body, I am concerned about section 42, specifically line 5 on page 67, which states:<blockquote>(iii) any of the Supervisory Directives,within the meaning of the Central Bank Act 1942,</blockquote>We need to be harder on the Central Bank and the banking community for the immense damage they did to this country.</p></speech>

The Europeans seem to operate central banking in ways that appear strange to the Minister, Senators and me.  Their secrecy has cost countries like Ireland, Greece, Portugal and so on dearly.</p><p>The Minister's philosophy of open access and freedom of information is shared, but could he investigate section 7 of the education Bill and ensure that banking is reformed?  There are fears that the banks could do it all over again.  The presence of people like the Minister in the Cabinet is necessary to prevent that.  Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.</p></speech>

I say well done to the Minister of State.</p><p>On the issue at hand, namely, rural Garda stations that have been closed, some of which have been sold and others that are in limbo, the closure of some of the stations was announced on budget day a couple of years ago.  The Department of Justice and Equality sneaked it in at a time when far more controversial measures were being taken, such as cuts to respite care grants - the Minister of State had some difficulty with the cuts - and cuts to child benefit.  At the time the argument was made by local communities and garda&iacute; that it would cost as much to close the stations as to keep them open.  I do not know if the case has been proven, but I would like to hear the cost of insurance and maintenance of those Garda stations that are now closed and what the plans are for them.  I understand some Garda stations have achieved good prices on the open market but that is dependent on their location and condition.</p><p>I spoke to some departmental officials about community and voluntary groups taking ownership or a temporary lease on Garda stations for use as youth facilities or for the elderly.  Many towns with Garda stations that are now closed lack community halls, for example.  The Minister of State, who is from County Wicklow, will be aware of the situation.  Communities always seem to be raising money to build a new community hall or other facility.  I hope the Department and the Office of Public Works could work together on the matter and that if decent plans are put in place by local communities, they would be considered before the sale of such premises.</p><p>The Garda station in my town was closed.  It is adjacent to the soccer pitch, which is maintained to a high standard by the recently reformed soccer club.  The problem is that the club has no changing facilities or dressing rooms.  At the moment players get changed in their cars and that is not ideal in the winter when the weather can be wet and cold.  The response the club received from the Department is that consideration has been given to the proposal but it is not considered feasible.  The recently reformed soccer club involves a good bunch of young lads like the Minister of State and I who want to keep themselves occupied during the winter.  In fairness, they just want a premises to bring them in from the cold and rain.  They do not need spectacular showering facilities or top-of-the-range dressing rooms; they just want a warm, dry place during the winter.  Would the Minister of State consider offering the building to a club, such as my local football club, on a temporary basis if the cost to the Department would be the same to maintain it?  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate them.  I also appreciate the opportunity afforded by the Adjournment debate raised by him for me to update Seanad &Eacute;ireann on closed Garda stations and what has happened to date, and to respond to the question of the cost of maintaining such premises.</p><p>In relation to the State's property assets, the Government is committed to reforming property asset management in the public service to ensure value to the taxpayer.  The Commissioners of Public Works manage a large and diverse portfolio of property assets, including historic properties, on behalf of the State.  The authority to dispose of State property is conferred on the commissioners by section 10 of the State Property Act 1954.</p><p>The stated policy for closed Garda stations is to identify if other State bodies, including Departments and the wider public sector, have a use for the property.  If no State requirement is identified, the OPW will consider disposing of the property on the open market, in order to generate much needed revenue for the Exchequer.  At a time when we are trying to reduce the rental bill for the State, the first port of call is to see if the closed Garda station could be used for an existing State need, as outlined.  If such is not found, then the option to dispose of the premises on the open market is considered in order to generate revenue.</p><p>If a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW will consider community involvement, subject to the receipt of an appropriate business case.  That must indicate that the community and voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there is no cost to the Exchequer in the short, medium or long term.  We have a responsibility to maintain the building and while we can enter into licensing agreements we cannot do anything that would in any way jeopardise the State&rsquo;s investment in terms of the building.</p><p>To date, eight former Garda stations have been retained for other State uses and 15 stations have been sold at public auction, achieving approximately &euro;1.4 million.  A further 25 are to be sold this year.  Sixteen former Garda stations have been assigned to community groups.  Where Garda stations have been so assigned, those have been generally to community councils that represent a broad range of community and voluntary groups, with links to local SOLAS, community employment and T&uacute;s training and employment schemes.</p><p>Decisions taken by the OPW to licence certain properties are based on the following principles, namely, the benefit to the broader community in terms of local services, activities or employment and training opportunities to be achieved from the use of the property; savings to the State of maintenance, service and other costs; and ownership remaining with the State with a re-entry clause at a time to be decided by State requirements.</p><p>There are other considerations to be taken into account.  For example, properties with telecommunications masts generate an income in excess of &euro;5 million per annum for the State which place contractual obligations on the OPW and it may be more beneficial for the taxpayer to retain these properties in State management rather than dispose of them.  When retaining properties, the OPW continues to explore uses for them through State bodies and local authorities, in addition to considering community use.  The cost of maintaining the closed Garda stations this year, to date, is approximately &euro;136,000.  With regard to insurance, these former stations are covered by the State&rsquo;s indemnity.</p><p>Senator Heffernan has referred to the question of temporary use of the former Garda station in Kilfinane, County Limerick by Kilfinane Forest AFC.  The property was assessed in line with the disposal policy I have outlined and no State use was identified.  The property is now being prepared for disposal on the open market.  In the event that the property does not sell, the OPW could then consider community use.  I will ask my officials to provide the Senator with an update on the timeline in terms of attempting to dispose of the property on the open market.  I will also try to get an indication of how hopeful we are of a disposal.  If the disposal does not go ahead or is not successful, I will ask the OPW to link in with the Senator and the local soccer club to see whether a community use could be identified.</p></speech>

He said 16 Garda stations have been assigned to community groups.  Did all of the 16 properties have to go through the same process whereby, first, the option of disposing it on the open market was considered and in the event of a lack of interest then the community groups were given preference?</p><p>The Minister of State said the cost to date of the maintenance of the closed stations is &euro;136,000.  How many stations are involved?  It is not clear from the response.  What is the average cost per station?  The Minister of State said he would outline the timeline of the disposal of the Garda station in my area.  That is fair enough.  Given the state of the open market, the property could be sold in two weeks or in 12 months.  In the meantime, would it be possible to make the property available for the use of the club?  I do not suggest that a lease would be signed with a community group during the sale process but instead of the property lying idle while waiting to be sold, could the Department come to an agreement with the local club for the use of the building until such time as it is sold?</p></speech>

He asked whether the 16 stations that have been given for community use all went through the same process where consideration was given first to their disposal on the open market.  I will check this out as most of this happened before my appointment, but my understanding is that they did.  The commissioners make an evaluation as to whether there is a financial benefit to the Exchequer in disposing of the properties at this time before considering community use, but I will get a follow up note on that for Senator Heffernan.</p><p>His second question related to the cost of maintaining closed Garda stations.  The cost is &euro;136,000 and that is the only figure I have, but I will see if it is possible to break it down further in terms of individual stations and I will come back to him on that point.</p></speech>
