I gave the example of Fingal County Council, in which area &euro;40 million will be collected from citizens but zero euro will go to the council.  Will the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, come to the House in due course to explain why this is the case and the tax was sold as a local property tax when it is not?</p><p>  There has been criticism, although not of the Leader, of the business we have conducted in the House since the start of the year in terms of legislation.  There has also been a lack of legislation in the D&aacute;il.  It seems the wheels of government have ground to an absolute standstill.  How many items of legislation has the Government introduced in either House or published since we returned in early January?  I hope there will not be a glut of legislation at the end of the session coming up to Easter.  The Leader was very helpful in this regard towards the end of the last session.  It may be useful for a message to go from the Seanad to the D&aacute;il and the Chief Whip's office to examine what has been done so far this year, which is precious little.  Only one item of legislation has been introduced in either House since January.  Will the Leader confirm that this is the case?  If it is, we are obviously not ordering or scheduling business correctly in either House.</p><p>  The <i>Irish Independent</i> carries a report this morning on Irish Water.  Yesterday the Leader responded to the call made by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames for a debate on Irish Water, on which we had a very decent debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, although it was only one hour long and each Senator only had five minutes to speak.  I asked a number of questions. but the question every citizen is asking is how much he or she will pay.  I have learned from the report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today that the Government will receive a consultation paper in April which will outline the proposed structure of the tariffs and the charges per household and apartment and the details of the proposed charges.  The paper will be with the Government in April, but, according to the report in the newspaper, it does not intend to let the people know what the proposed charges will be until June.  Is this true?  I have a conspiratorial mind and it occurs to me that the local and European elections will take place on 23 May.  Is this why the Government will receive a report and know the proposed charges in April but will not let the punters know until June?</p></speech>

A little more information has been forthcoming since we spoke yesterday on the Order of Business, but it is important that we wait to see what is stated today before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  We all hope clarity will be cast on matters.  It is clear that there was no obligation on GSOC to make a report of the matter to the Minister, as has been clearly established by anyone who has read section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  This matter is of much less importance than the key question of whether bugging was carried out and, if so, by whom.  The Minister in his statement yesterday referred in some detail to the three identified issues or anomalies, at least one of which appears to have been ruled out but, according to one member of the ombudsman commission, another was of much more significance and much less likely not to have been as a result of tampering or bugging.  I note that some security experts have pointed out that some of the allegations relate to activities which could have been carried out by individuals not connected with any State security apparatus.  We all know about the very extensive bugging carried out by journalists in Britain from the <i>News of the World</i>.  We need more information on the nature of the bugging.  I would like to see published the report of the private security firm given to GSOC and which has now been furnished to the Minister.  I know that GSOC is concerned about some of the items included in it, but the report could be redacted - we have seen this done before - to ensure it would not disclose any matter which might compromise the security of GSOC.  It is a matter of great public interest to learn exactly what the anomalies were.  It would help in trying to investigate who carried out the bugging, if it was carried out.  It is important to have more detail and I know we will have more this afternoon.  I hope we will have a debate on the matter very soon.</p><p>  I commend the courage of Sharon McCarthy who spoke on &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night about her experience as the mother of a baby who had died in hospital in Portlaoise.  The deaths of a number of babies in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise were exposed on &quot;Prime Time&quot; in recent weeks.  There are still questions to be answered about why reports were not acted on and recommendations not followed up to ensure no further deaths occurred.  It is welcome that HIQA will investigate and I hope we will have a debate on the matter when there are clear findings.</p><p>  I welcome the move forward on the expansion of the university franchise for the six university Seanad seats.  The matter was before the Cabinet yesterday and the heads of the Bill will be published shortly.  I very much hope - I know my colleagues share this hope - we will see retention of the principle that graduates resident outside the jurisdiction who are Irish citizens are allowed to vote.  It is a hugely important principle and it would be a retrograde step if it were to be changed, particularly as the Constitutional Convention has recently recommended expansion of the franchise for citizens resident outside jurisdiction to vote in presidential elections.  We will debate the issue further later, but I welcome the announcement made by the Cabinet yesterday.</p></speech>

This would do serious damage to the country as Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports would be affected.  We are trying to revive tourism and business in the country and we are more dependent on air transport than any other member state of the European Union.  The basis for the strike is a &euro;780 million deficit in the pension funds of the airports and Aer Lingus.  The way out of this is that the trustees should submit a new funding proposal to the pensions regulator.</p><p>The pensions regulator should report to the Oireachtas on how these deficits have arisen, such as added years, early retirement schemes which are not properly funded and excessive administration fees, which has been an issue in the United Kingdom lately.  There are also poor investment policies, where the investment managers are heavily rewarded but invest badly.  Inexplicably, there has been a failure to anticipate increased life expectancy.  It has been no secret for well over 100 years that life expectancy is increasing.  The pensions regulator should report to Parliament and the trustees should submit a new funding proposal, but we should not damage the economy - I support the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in that regard - by having an aviation strike at this vital stage in our economic recovery.</p></speech>

We rarely hear anything about women in sport.  Men always take the limelight.  Caroline Ryan is ranked number 1 in the world track championships and I wish her the best of luck in her pursuits.  She was an accomplished oarswoman with the Garda rowing club and went on to represent Ireland in that sport in 2005 to 2007.  Five years ago she changed to cycling.  Top ranking in the UCI world track championship is no mean accomplishment.  Hopefully, she will get all the help she requires from the Irish Sports Council and, indeed, every other council here.</p><p>We regularly talk in the Chamber about youngsters drinking.  I am a great fan and supporter of the GAA.  It is in every community and does great work.  However, there are children who do not participate in team sports.  Cycling, mountain biking, mountaineering and so forth are also good for them.  We should have a debate, with representatives of Coillte present, about ensuring that we are using our mountains for mountain biking and to facilitate other sports.  There are groups of cyclists who are willing and able to draw up tracks for their sport.  Indeed, they have done it without help from anybody.  In England, the associations of cyclists have come together and volunteered to do this.  Cyclists in Ireland have done it as well without much help.  The idea is to get children interested and assist them in participating in sports that are not discussed as much as football, rugby and so forth-----</p></speech>

That is sad for the 27 workers and their families who will be devastated by this news.  It is also devastating for Waterford city to experience more job losses.  The unemployment crisis in Waterford city and county at present is unsustainable and has reached a dangerous level.  It simply should not be tolerated.  I fully accept that we cannot blame the Government every time there is an announcement of job losses in a company, but we can blame the Government for failing to act on the very high levels of unemployment in Waterford city and county.</p><p>Last year, on behalf of the jobs committee, I published the South East Economic Development Strategy, which set out a vision for the south east.  It called for action on all fronts and a multi-agency response, but that has not happened.  The main priorities in that document have not been implemented.  That is a real worry for people in the south east.  We are still waiting for the establishment of the university.  There is still no joined-up regional plan, regional IDA office, regional director or regional strategy to create and sustain jobs in Waterford city.  We still have a situation where companies that wish to locate in Galway receive far more attractive regional grant aid than is available in Waterford city.  There is no level playing field.  The Leader will share some of my concerns.</p><p>Action by both the Government and its agencies is required across a range of areas.  There is great concern in Waterford city about the very high level of unemployment and I call on the Leader to ensure that every effort is made to create and sustain jobs in the area.  Promises were made to create a level playing field for the people and businesses of Waterford city and county and across the south-east region.  They should be delivered and implemented as quickly as possible, before it is too late.</p></speech>

In 2004, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform provided funding for 21 systems across the country.  That number was increased nationally to 49 and included cities.  A new system was then introduced whereby communities could apply for funding.  A sum of &euro;4 million was made available to 45 communities.  In addition, RAPID - revitalising areas through planning, investment and development - areas throughout the country were able to apply for a maximum of &euro;100,000 in funding.</p><p>The system has been very successful in the towns where CCTV has been installed.  It was installed in my home town of Carrick-on-Suir in 2007 and the town experienced a massive decrease in street violence and vandalism.  However, those who insist on perpetrating damage to people's property, carrying out violent acts and attacking elderly people now know where CCTV is not available, so it is time that towns in rural Ireland are provided with extra funding to install extra cameras to prevent such occurrences.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality so further funding will be provided to upgrade, enhance and improve the existing CCTV systems in rural areas, particularly in Carrick-on-Suir.</p></speech>

I still have concerns.  Were these people bugged or not?  According to the spokesman, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, last night, the chances of these anomalies being benign were remote to zero.  That clearly indicates there is an issue.  There is also the issue that it appears this sweep was not routine.  The GSOC does not routinely check its offices or routinely have such security checks.  There was a series of events or incidents which influenced and determined the GSOC to seek out an independent security firm, Verrimus, from the UK to check this out.</p></speech>

To correct something that was said yesterday, Senator Jim D'Arcy must have misunderstood me when he implied that I was trying to implicate the Garda in some way - far from it.  I am sure the Garda had nothing to do with it and I wish to have the Garda completely vindicated in this regard.  However, clearly there is something here and we must find out about it.  Questions must be answered and I do not believe the Minister is treating it with the level of seriousness it requires.</p><p>Second, I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien regarding a debate on Irish Water.</p> <p>I am very concerned about today's headlines, as Mr. Tierney has indicated that the repair of the network could cost up to &euro;10 billion.  That is hardly surprising with the kind of costings and overheads he seems to think are reasonable to create in a bonus-led culture.  I am concerned that somebody flippantly presiding over these salaries and who gets all his buddies from the local authorities to come in, although they already have pensions from the State, is now saying this will cost &euro;10 billion.  Before we set up Irish Water, the correct action would have been for each local authority to do an audit of what the costs would be in certain locations.  This could have been done with local contractors.  Instead, a major multinational will be engaged to fix the network at a cost of &euro;10 billion or &euro;15 billion, instead of creating employment in national or indigenous companies.</p></speech>

If possible, will the Leader convey to the Minister of State ahead of his presence in the Seanad this afternoon that we would like a breakdown of the &euro;70 million that will be allocated county by county?  There is some uncertainty about that.  There has been a breakdown that details funding for roads and other areas but we need details of county funding.</p><p>To be honest, &euro;70 million is not enough.  I am most disappointed that we have been told that the country will not qualify under the European solidarity fund.  The notion of European solidarity is that others would be with us in a time of crisis but, unfortunately, that is not to be.  The &euro;70 million will only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is required.  Clare has seen the most structural damage of any county and it is estimated by Clare County Council to require &euro;34 million for repairs.  The &euro;70 million is a national fund, meaning Clare will only get a small fraction of that amount.  There will be important questions to be answered this afternoon, and I sincerely hope the Minister of State will have much specific detail to give the Seanad when he comes here.</p></speech>

I am very much prepared to supply further information to the committees in that regard.  I will say no more about the issue at this stage but it is extraordinarily important for this piece of lunacy to be put back in its box.</p><p>Later this evening the Independent Members' time will see a debate about reform of the Seanad and so on.  It strikes me that although people have raised the issue of us not meeting on Thursdays and so on, Senator O'Brien mentioned the number of Bills that are to be heard.  There are 36 Bills on the Order Paper so why are we not dealing with them?</p><p>Could we please have a debate on the banking system and banks, and particularly the relationship with customers?  They do not want ordinary people polluting their nice, clean banks.  They were very happy to pick our pockets when they were caught gambling with money that was not theirs and we all had to cough up and pay for them.  They are now behaving in a cavalier fashion by dispensing with cheque books and directing people to machines.  I have accounts in two branches in the centre of Dublin, one of which has been open for nearly 70 years.  In one branch there are seven machines and two human beings.  Last Friday at No. 2 College Green, the old Parliament house, the queues went right through the entire banking hall into the vestibule and into the colonnade.  There were three queues, and it was the same in a branch of AIB across the road.  That is absolutely intolerable.  On another day last week I tried to cash two cheques.  I tried to cash a small cheque from the prize bonds and although I brought along my passport, the staff in the post office would not cash it.  It had to be lodged to an account.  No bank will cash the cheque; when it is lodged, the banks will sit on it for three or four days so they can get the interest.  That is theft by banks from private individuals.</p></speech>

I would prefer to lodge a complaint and cash a cheque.  I do not want to cash a complaint and lodge a cheque.  I got a cheque for &euro;450 for a recording of Anna Livia Plurabelle by Joyce for Deutscher Rundfunk in Berlin.  It was a beautiful recording.  When I brought the cheque to the bank, not only would they not cash it for me but the staff would not give me the money.  Although it was a euro cheque the bank staff told me they had to buy it because it is drawn on a bank in Berlin.  They wanted to take &euro;17 from it.  I kicked up such hell that a senior staff member whispered to the teller that I should be let off at &euro;10.  They are stealing money from us left, right and centre, and they are as arrogant as hell.  I wanted to see a manager and I told him that I did not blame him and I had the greatest sympathy for him, as by next Tuesday he would be a machine.</p></speech>

There is a report from Savills which indicates that industrial space in Dublin is much sought after, and in the past year the amount of available industrial space has decreased greatly.  Sales figures for retail space in the Dublin market in 2013 were 45% higher than the 2012 total and 87% higher than that of 2011.  This shows that conditions are improving in Dublin with regard to commercial activity.  There are many other industries and sectors which will benefit from this, including logistics and distribution services, as that type of space is much sought after, according to the report.  It is a positive indicator of how things are improving in the economy.</p><p>I have heard from councillors around the country that Dublin seems to be seeing improvement at a greater rate than the rest of the country.  Although Dublin is my area, we should focus on smaller towns and villages around the country.  The idea of a junior Minister responsible for rural development should be considered if there is to be a reshuffle or any changes in ministerial positions or Departments.</p></speech>

A debate on the matter took place in the other House yesterday.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission informed the Minister that after an investigation it concluded that no definitive evidence of unauthorised technical or electrical surveillance of its offices was found and that its databases have not been compromised.  That is what the commission told the Minister in its discussions with him.  He has requested that he be furnished with the report that was mentioned by Senator Bacik, namely, the report that was received by the commission following the security check on its offices.  The Minister awaits the response by GSOC to his request.  I am sure we will hear further on the matter.</p><p>With regard to the tragic circumstances that occurred in Portlaoise hospital, we all welcome the fact that HIQA is now investigating the matter.  I am sure we can debate the matter when the report is complete.</p><p>Senator Barrett mentioned the possibility of a strike at Dublin and Shannon airports.  The workers should listen to the proposals before taking action.  The pension scheme is effectively insolvent and the trustees need to produce a new set of proposals.  I can understand the concern of the workers.  It must be frustrating for them and the companies to pay into an unviable pension scheme.  It is a very serious situation but I do not think that holding a strike at this point in time would serve anybody any good, especially the country as it recovers.      </p><p>Senator Keane called for more co-operation with Coillte regarding the provision of cycleways.  I am sure the matter can be discussed with the Minister responsible.  </p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to the loss of 27 jobs at Honeywell Process Solutions yesterday.  I know how the workers and their families must have felt on hearing such news.  With regard to the points raised by the Senator, certainly Waterford city has been hit more than most where unemployment is concerned.  With regard to his point about having an equal playing field in terms of regional IDA grant aid, I understand the matter will be addressed when the situation is reviewed in July.  We will see a levelling of the playing field at that point in time.</p><p>Senator Cullinane raised a number of other issues.  The IDA is investigating if tenders are complete for the advance factory in Waterford.  The factory is expected to be completed by the end of the year. </p><p>With regard to locating a university in Waterford, there is a need for Waterford and Carlow to get their act together and work together on a merger process that will satisfy the criteria, as a matter of urgency.  The Government is quite willing to upgrade the Waterford institute to university status but there is a need for WIT and Carlow Institute of Technology to get their act together at this point in time.  </p><p>Senator Cullinane alluded to quite a number of issues and I can assure him that the Government is fully aware of them.  There have been 3,000 extra jobs created in the south east since the Government took office.  We need a hell of a lot more jobs in Waterford city and I could not agree more with him in that regard.   </p><p>Senator Landy mentioned using CCTV to combat crime, the need to roll-out further schemes and to enhance the current scheme.  I shall bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p><p>I noted the points that Senator MacSharry made about GSOC.  He also made a number of points about Irish Water.  We have had many debates on the matter in the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il's policy on water over the years left an awful lot to be desired and based the country's water systems on itself - unreformed, costly and wasteful.  That has been the situation where water was concerned while Fianna F&aacute;il was in power.</p><p>Senator Conway mentioned storm damage.  We should await the Minister's response on the matter.  </p><p>I note that Senator Norris referred the matters raised on yesterday's Order of Business to the relevant committees.  He also mentioned that there are a number of Bills on the Order Paper.  It is my wish that we would deal with quite a number of them.  As he can see, many of them only had two minutes to go on Second Stage yet people held them back rather than voting on them.  Perhaps we should get the votes out of the way, deal with the Bills and get them off the Order Paper.  </p></speech>

I express my sincere sympathy to Tom's family, to his wife, Bridie, their children Michelle, Breand&aacute;n and Tom who are present, and also to his brothers and sister and a wide circle of friends, many of whom are present.</p><p>Tom was an excellent public representative who was strongly committed to Kerry and, particularly, to Dingle and the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht.  He was also a custodian of the Irish language and a strong voice for the protection and development of the language.  Tom had many interests but was a noteworthy advocate of rural and maritime affairs.  This was very much reflected in the particular interest and commitment Tom took in the development of Dingle Harbour and the marina.  He was a driving force behind these developments and was also a member of the sailing club where he was a major force in lobbying and fundraising for the marina centre.</p><p>In his later years, I understand Tom enjoyed sitting in the restaurant at the marina while admiring the sight of the marina and the sailing courses and other activities that have been developed as a result of his interest in the harbour.  Tom was a regular companion at the side of former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and was regularly recognised as his confidante.  He often credited the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, for putting Dingle on the map, due to the large amount of time he spent holidaying in Inishvickillane.  Shortly before he death, Mr. Haughey returned with Tom to his much cherished holiday home in Inishvickillane and it must have been a poignant moment for both at that point in time.  Tom was deeply committed to his family and family life and, as such, I again express my sincere sympathy to his family, who are present, and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il. </p><p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I welcome, in particular, his wife Bridie, his children and other members of his family.</p><p>Senators Cummins and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke very eloquently about the career of former Senator Fitzgerald.  He was a Senator, for Fianna F&aacute;il, for a total of 13 years.  He once served as the Government Chief Whip in the Seanad.  We have a Government Chief Whip from Kerry at present so there is some continuity.</p><p>Tom Fitzgerald was strongly committed to his local area, particularly Dingle and the Gaeltacht, as Senator Cummins said.  He had a passion for the Irish language.  It was lovely to hear Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; giving his tribute as Gaeilge.  Tom had a passion for rural and maritime affairs and he worked hard to promote Dingle Harbour and its marina.</p><p>Others have referred to Tom's closeness to former Taoiseach Charles Haughey and his connection with Inishvickillane, the well-known holiday destination of the former Taoiseach.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, Tom could not have fulfilled his political career without the immense support he received from his family.  I pass on our very sincere sympathies and condolences to Tom's family, friends and community in Dingle.</p></speech>

I am sure Tom would have enjoyed being at the event last night to celebrate P&aacute;id&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute;.  It is sad for an area such as Dingle to lose two such characters.  They were famous in their lifetimes throughout the country and the world.</p><p>When I was elected to the Seanad, Tom Fitzgerald was good enough to give me some great advice, much of which one would never see written in any book.  This is the best advice one could ever get.  Tom had a long and prestigious career in Kerry County Council in addition to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  When one walks down the corridors in the premises of Kerry County Council, as Tom did when representing his constituents and as I hope Breand&aacute;n will do, one sees a picture on the wall of Tom smiling down on us, perhaps with knowledge of what needs to be done to get things done.  As a politician, Tom got things done, including through his chairmanship of Dingle Harbour Commissioners.  We have all seen the photograph of Dingle in the 1960s and comparisons between the pier then and now.  The pier today is a world-class facility, thanks to the ability, guile and cunning of Tom Fitzgerald in ensuring his area would get the best of what was available.</p><p>It was Tom's ability to make friends, not only within his own party but across the House, that ensured he was much loved and respected in both this Chamber and his native County Kerry.  He had a tough political career.  When one gets elected to the Seanad, one assumes one's term will be five years.  Famously in the 1980s, no sooner had one got over one gruelling election than one had to face another.  This must have been tough for all concerned, not only Mr. Fitzgerald but also Bridie and the rest of the family.  Tom survived this, however, and prevailed in the end, serving with distinction.  As my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, has pointed out, however, it was not the sum total of his entire contribution.</p><p>One phenomenon that put Dingle on the map, in addition to Tom and P&aacute;id&iacute;, was the famous film &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot;.  There is a great documentary thereon in which Tom features.  He talks about how the film-makers approached him when making the set and asked him whether he had plywood, which was an innovation at the time.  Tom said he had and when asked how much he replied he had three sheets.  He asked how many were needed and the film-makers said 300.  He duly delivered, as he always did, and the set was made.  Not only was the famous Oscar-winning film made but Tom became a stand-in for Robert Mitchum.  The film put Dingle on the map and attracted visitors thereto from all over the world.  Tom made sure there was hospitality and facilities for people to enjoy when they arrived.</p><p>Tom brought Charlie Haughey to Dingle and ensured that when he arrived, he had the greatest of friends.  Tom and Charlie were genuine friends and there was great warmth between them.  I am sure that when former Taoiseach Charles Haughey stepped down, it was a big blow to Tom.  Tom, however, continued to serve his community throughout his political career.  He always focused on Dingle and his native place, as did P&aacute;id&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute;.</p><p>The loss of Tom is huge to his family but it is great to see his son Breand&aacute;n continuing the tradition of public service by putting his name forward for the next election.  I hope Charlie, Tom and P&aacute;id&iacute; are all smiling down on us today.  Please God, they will all be present at the count and the celebrations when Breand&aacute;n gets elected.</p></speech>

It is all very true.  Tom, as has been said, was a man of great wit and humour.  He was a true friend and a man whose smile always led to a very good chat.  He was pleasant and always very easy to get on with.  I served with him here from 1997 until 2002.  One of my greatest honours was being a member of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners from 1991 until 1997, when Tom was the chairman.  He was a very fair chairman and was very good to me.  We differed politically but I was the only Fine Gael man on the board.  Tom was the greatest friend I could have had serving on it.</p><p>  When talking about the loss of Tom, I obviously find it difficult to be humorous.  Everything that has been said about him and the late Charlie Haughey is true.  They were great friends.  Tom was the official, or unofficial, caretaker of the island of Inishvickillaun.  A great story, apocryphal or otherwise, that Senators have probably all heard is about when Charlie's house was being built on the island.  Tom was the chief caretaker or supervisor.  A bad storm like the one we are experiencing at present struck the island and the workmen were marooned.  Apparently the basement had been constructed and the late Taoiseach had installed some very good wines from a famous French <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>.  The workmen decided it would be a shame to see it go to waste and laid into it as they had nothing else to pass the time in the evenings when they were marooned.  Eventually, the storm passed and the boys decided that, when in Dingle, they had better replace the stock.  With this in mind, they purchased some very ordinary plonk in the local supermarket.</p> <p>One can imagine what the Boss thought - I never heard.</p><p>As for the stories Tom used to tell and the advice he gave, as Senator Daly has noted, it was not recorded in any book but probably was the best advice we all received at different times.  I remember the filming of &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot; as a young fellow working in Killarney and I believe we bought some of the stuff, such as chairs and so on, at auction afterwards.  However, as has been said, Tom was a stand-in for Robert Mitchum and no doubt he was suitable because he had the stature and so on.  However, he did a great deal for the Dingle Peninsula.  I can remember the special effects man, Eddie Fowlie, who was one of the guys I got to know on the shoot and the help they received from Tom was simply unbelievable throughout.</p><p>Tom made sure I was appointed to the harbour board.  He led the successful campaign to have a harbourmaster appointed and put me on the interview board with the then Secretary General of the Department of the Marine and another harbourmaster.  I believe Tom was pleased by the outcome and the person was appointed.  Talking about being marooned, I used to love attending those meetings, which took place monthly on Saturdays.  I got marooned myself a few times and was unable to get out of Dingle but that is another story.  Tom was a great and true friend who never let anyone down in this House.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.  I also am delighted to welcome Bridie and the entire family to the House today and we will have a good chat afterwards.</p></speech>

Fitzgerald is a very distinguished name in that part of the country, as there is the Knight of Kerry, the White Knight and the Knight of Glin and in that illustrious panoply, Tom Fitzgerald added a great lustre.  He had various passions, of which the language was one and the marina another.  He was a man of vision who managed to bring that vision to pass.  He was in this House when I was first elected because although he was elected repeatedly, there were gaps in his career when the turbulence of political life meant he was not a Member of this House.  However, he was a Member in my very first term and as I told Tom a number of times, I heard him speak on my very first day.  I did not know much about what the Senate was about and he made the most magnificent speech on a fisheries Bill.  I approached him afterwards and told him his speech was absolutely fascinating, was one of the best I had ever heard and that, having heard his words, I was proud to be part of this Senate.  His reply was to ask why would he not, as he had a trawler.  However, it was of great importance that the House had such people who came from the coalface and who knew exactly what were the problems.  Moreover, had people like Tom Fitzgerald or indeed the Leas-Chathaoirleach been listened to, we might be in a much better position now with regard to the fishing industry, which we betrayed and gave away at the time of Ireland's entry into the European Union.</p><p>However, I am glad to state I became a friend of Tom and always enjoyed a chat with him.  He was one of the great storytellers and that may have something to do with the air, the minerals, the grass, the milk or the whiskey down in County Kerry.  Other examples are Joe O'Toole - it is a pity he is not present because he was a great friend of Tom Fitzgerald and also is from Dingle - Senator Ned O'Sullivan, another great Kerry man, and Senator Paul Coghlan himself, who is a man who both tells and enjoys a great story.</p><p>There was always a great twinkle in Tom's eye and there never was anything nasty about Tom Fitzgerald.  One of his greatest qualities was loyalty and I am glad his friendship with Mr. Haughey has been mentioned very courteously by Senator Cummins.  He shared a friendship with Mr. Haughey that was based in part on a love of the sea and in part on an appreciation of the natural beauty of County Kerry, in particular, of Inishvickillane and so on.  Unlike some others, however, when Mr. Haughey's career hit a patch of turbulence - and believe me, I had my two days with the same Mr. Haughey - he never turned against him.  He never spoke a bitter or derogatory word and I greatly admired that about him because such loyalty and friendship is an admirable thing.  Not so many people retained that kind of loyalty, another being another good friend of mine, Anthony Cronin.</p><p>It is difficult to believe we will not be in that genial presence any more and public life is greatly diminished by the death of our friend, Tom Fitzgerald.  I believe he was a friend of everyone in this House and I extend my sympathy to his family, a family of which he was very proud and whose company he enjoyed thoroughly.  While he enjoyed it here, he enjoyed even more going back home to Kerry, which was his real home.</p></speech>

I did not have the privilege of working in the Seanad with Senator Fitzgerald, who served before my time.  However, I did have occasions to meet him when I worked with my former boss, the former Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin in Kerry South.  Tom's love for the Irish language and his dedication to serving the people of Dingle and further afield was well known by everyone in County Kerry and beyond.  I am delighted to be present today to listen to the lovely tributes and to the stories of the time spent here with Senator Fitzgerald.  I extend my sympathy to his wife, family and friends in the Gallery.</p></speech>

I welcome his wife, Bridie, his children and his many family members and friends who have gathered in the Gallery today.  On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group in the Seanad, I extend my sympathies to them.  I am always conscious that on such occasions, it is a bittersweet event for the family and for those who would have known Tom personally.  It obviously is a joyous occasion when Members take the opportunity and the time to remember the sacrifice made by Tom, as well as the huge level of service he gave to his party first and foremost, to his family and to the people of County Kerry, Dingle and this State.  Members have heard from people who knew Tom very well and even in emotional terms from one Senator.  He obviously was held in high regard and made a huge contribution to public life in County Kerry and to this State.  However, I am sure this also is a sad occasion in many respects for the family and I hope they enjoy the occasion and the rest of the day here.  Again, on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I extend my sympathies to the family and to all his friends.  I am sure he will be sadly missed by the people of Dingle and the people of County Kerry.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of serving with Tom over a number of years.</p> <p>I remember in particular his period as Government Chief Whip, as alluded to by Senator Bacik.  The job of a Whip, as Senator Coghlan will know, is not the easiest job in the world, and one needs a particular type of temperament.  Senator Coghlan follows in the proud tradition of Senator Fitzgerald in that regard.  Temperament is all, and I can never remember a time when Tom would have been in any way insulting or critical of Members on all sides of the House, but particularly in his job as Chief Whip.  He was very easy to get on with.  </p><p>There was a certain star quality about Tom as well, and Senator Daly referred to his time in &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot;.  All of us were very much aware of the central role he played in that regard and I could not help but reflect that it is ironic that in the week we are paying this tribute to former Senator Fitzgerald, one of the stars of that movie, Christopher Jones, whom Tom would have known during that period, passed away in America.  I could not help but reflect also on the impact that film made in the Dingle Peninsula.  Some figures indicate that over &pound;1 million was injected into the local economy, which was an enormous sum of money at the time, particularly in an area that was severely economically disadvantaged, and it was from that background and that environment that Tom came.  It was not surprising, therefore, that he fought tenaciously, and very successfully, to improve and update the facilities in his beloved native Dingle.</p><p>I agree with those who spoke about Tom's loyalty.  It was not easy to be a supporter of Charles Haughey during a particular period of our development in the 1990s, but Tom had a friendship with Charlie Haughey that transcended politics.  While people used to slag him a little about it, he always took it in good part but we all knew that Tom thought the world of Charlie Haughey and that he was a very close friend and confidant to him.  He had great pride in the fact that he was able to have Mr. Haughey visit Dingle, particularly for the regatta, during that period.</p><p>The memories of Tom are happy ones, and I know the same is true for his family.  He was a big loss to this House when he left due to ill-health.  He had his political ups and downs.  I recall the day he lost his seat here, not on the first occasion but in the latter years.  It was a crushing blow to him because he loved this House and he loved being a parliamentarian.  It was with great joy that we all welcomed, within a few weeks, the announcement by the then Taoiseach that he had appointed Tom to the Seanad, where he resumed his role with great efficiency.  I have great affection for and great memories of a great man.  To his wife Bridie and family, ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

In the university Senators' offices we have a fantastic connection with the Kingdom.  These insights into Tom Fitzgerald come from Seamus, D&oacute;nal, Joe, Aoife, Frank and Norah.  They said his character was moulded by two very strong women - his mother, Nell Brien, and his wife, Bridie.  He was a strong republican who was proud of coming from the same town as Tom&aacute;s Ashe, Lispole.  As we have heard, he was an expert on the marine, very popular and a man of great heart.</p><p>The story goes, and n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;or, Bridie, that after he was appointed to the censorship board, somebody called to the house and asked, &quot;An bhfuil Tom istigh?&quot; to which Bridie replied, &quot;T&aacute; s&eacute; ag f&eacute;achaint ar na salacha&iacute;.&quot;  We will have to check whether that story is true.

It is a wonderful tribute to the late Senator Tom Fitzgerald that his family and friends are present in such great numbers.  We have had many tributes in this House over the years but this is one of the biggest groups that has ever come before it.  It shows the loss of Tom to his wife Bridie and his family.  He was a wonderful man.  I knew him on the basis of bringing legislation from the other House to this House.  As Whip he was always courteous, helpful, supportive and a great parliamentarian.</p><p>Tom had a wonderful career.  He was a councillor.  He was very involved in &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot;.  Being a stand-in for Robert Mitchum was a great achievement.  They looked quite alike physically.  I often spoke to him about that.  It was a wonderful period in the life and times of Dingle and the entire peninsula.  The contributions are true in regard to the development of Dingle, the marina, Tom's friendship with the late Charles J. Haughey, and his involvement with the Blasket Islands, the Blasket Islands Bill and Inishvickillane.  </p><p>Tom had a wonderful career and he was a wonderful friend to everyone who served either in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  He had great knowledge of the marine, Irish life and politics.</p><p>When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, on one occasion I was in Jury's Hotel, where I believe Tom stayed at the time.  I was attending an important function and coming from Roscommon, we did not have too many white shirts at that time.  He literally took the shirt off his back and gave me a new white shirt with short sleeves, which I think I still have - it was very good quality.  That was an indication of his generosity.  That is a true story to show he was open, friendly and generous.  I used to have great fun with him after that when I would say he would literally take the shirt off his back for someone.  That is as good a tribute as one can pay to anyone.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

When I was elected to the Seanad in 1993, I knew nothing about politics.  I knew nothing about this House, but the very first person I met when I came in the door was Tom Fitzgerald, who introduced himself to me and said, &quot;I'll show you around.&quot;  He showed me around the entire House, which he knew back to front and inside out.  Not only did he show me around, he was full of anecdotes, stories and humour.  Having spent an hour or two with him I got to know the House, and I enjoyed his company.</p><p>  A week or two later I got a phone call from Gordon Wilson, who had just accepted a nomination to become a Senator.  He did not know anybody in the House except me, so I showed him around this House based on everything I had learned from Tom.  Gordon had not met Tom at that stage, as it was his first visit to the House, and coming from Northern Ireland he did not have quite the same experience or knowledge.  I was a fund of knowledge but credited that to Tom on every occasion during that visit.  I introduced Tom to Gordon Wilson later, and they became good buddies.</p><p>  I am glad to be here today because I have learned much more about Tom.  I served here with him for a number of years.  He was a wonderful speaker as Gaeilge but also as Bearla.  He was also committed to particular issues.  Rather like the Leas-Chathaoirleach, he had a commitment to the sea, to Kerry and to his family.  I look forward to meeting Bridie and the family later.  We have heard so much about Tom's family life and his commitment to his family.  I have learned a great deal more today about the knowledge that he had.</p><p>  The great American short story writer, O. Henry, wrote a lovely story about an invitation to the funeral of an old lady with whom most people had lost contact.  They came to the funeral in her home, and she met them at the door.  They told her they thought this was her funeral, but she said, &quot;Yes, but I would not miss it for anything so I'm having it before I go.  I want to hear what they say about me.&quot;  It is a lovely story but it reminds me that Tom would have enjoyed being here today.  Perhaps we should rethink these things in some way.  <br /><i>Quo Vadis</i>, a book about what Jesus was wearing when he was crucified, made the headlines when it was written many years ago.</p> <p>According to the story, one of the Romans said to a Christian that he was not sure he liked the idea of the Christian's God.  The Romans had a variety of gods but the Christians only had one.  The Roman argued that Jesus should have started as a student before going on to become a soldier, a hero and a senator.  All of his friends would then have gathered around him while he ascended to Heaven.  That did not happen, however.  Perhaps we should think about how we can be reminded of those such as Tom who have done such a good job.  I would love to think that he could have been here for these statements.  However, Bridie and his family and friends are here in large numbers and all of us know Tom a lot better than we did before we came into the Chamber today.  I hope this is a day that Bridie and Tom's family and friends will remember and that they take home with them the memory of how much we appreciated that great man.</p></speech>

As Bridie, Michelle, Breand&aacute;n, Tommy and the rest of the family will be aware, Tom's reputation spread far beyond the Dingle Peninsula and County Kerry.  He was very well known in north County Dublin, where I live, and in the Malahide-Kinsealy area because of Mr. Haughey, who I had the pleasure of meeting.  I see a good friend of mine, Siobhan O'Connor, in the Gallery, along with the O'Connor and Haughey families, who travelled to Kerry on a regular basis.  I never served in this House with Tom but, from the heartfelt and personal tributes that have been paid by Members across the House, Bridie and her children will be aware of the esteem in which their late husband and father was held.  I hope these tributes will go some way towards softening the loss they are feeling.</p><p>Tom was a loyal servant of Fianna F&aacute;il and a proud representative of County Kerry both in the county council and during the 13 years he served in the Seanad.  I am sure all of us would like to be flies on the wall in Heaven while he and Mr. Haughey discuss various events.  This is a sad day but also a proud one for his family given the high esteem in which he was held by his colleagues on all sides of this House.

I first met Tom while I was actively involved in &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il.  He regularly attended our conferences and, like Deputy Coghlan, I was marooned with him on many occasions.  I always enjoyed his stories about rural Ireland and his maritime activities, which he told with a twinkle in his eye.  He was a loyal friend to Charlie Haughey and the more people attacked Charlie, the more Tom took pride in defending him.  Tom was also a film censor, a job he greatly enjoyed.  This role came about as a result of his active involvement in the filming of "Ryan's Daughter" in Dingle.  I offer my sympathies to his wife, family and everybody else who knew him.

If I go with the script I have before me I will lose the real thrust of what I knew about my late friend, Tom Fitzgerald.  He was a friend, colleague and mentor to me for many years.  The first thing he would say to me if he was here is "what in the name of God are you doing in that chair?"  The Cathaoirleach and Senator O'Sullivan, who are currently abroad on Seanad business, would love to be here to pay tribute to Tom.  Senator O'Sullivan rang me to ask whether we could reschedule our statements but, unfortunately, the plans had already been made.</p><p>I was appointed to the Seanad by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, on 27 October 1989 but I knew Tom previously because he canvassed me for a vote in the Seanad election of 1985 while I was a member of Cork County Council.  We got on well from the outset.  He was a mentor to me and was Government Whip.  Coming from Dingle, he had a great knowledge of fishing and, as all those who belonged to me were fishermen, we had a lot in common.  We used to discuss the rising tides and tell seancha&iacute; stories.</p><p>For my sins, I was in Gael Linn in the townland of Fahan, out beyond Ceann Tr&aacute;, with the Long family.  I was only a child then, in 1966 or 1967.  I will not go into the story of how I got there.  The address was Fahan, Tralee, County Kerry.  A neighbour with a transit van picked up my late mother and father and I, along with another fellow, and we ventured off to find the Long family.  We travelled first to Tralee, which is a roundabout way from Bantry, and we went over the Conor Pass and into Dingle at 10.30 p.m. on a Sunday evening.  My father refused to leave Dingle without going into Paddy Bawn Brosnan's pub.  He took down the four all-Ireland medals - I will never forget those memories.  By the time we reached the Long household, the family had gone to bed.  We were lucky that we did not have to return the way we came.  I often regaled Tom with that story.  There is a bit of Dingle blood in me still because I went to school in Chill Mac an Domhnaigh for three months.  One of the girls of the Long family now runs a pub in Dingle.  </p><p>To be a Whip in the Seanad, one must be not only stern and strong but also a mighty rogue.  Tom was a bit of a card in that regard.  Senator Coghlan is the finest rogue Kerry every produced and Senator Wilson is not far behind him.  On one occasion nobody on the Government side was in the Chamber and all hell broke lose.  I had been asked by the then Cathaoirleach, the late Se&aacute;n Doherty, to travel in his stead to a three day meeting in Rome.  I had never been out of the country as a Senator and my bags were all packed.  The aforementioned incident caused huge embarrassment for the Government and the Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, was irate.  He called a special meeting of the Seanad group at 3 p.m. the following Sunday.  As I was just about to travel to Dublin to take the flight, I rang Tom for advice.  I was not happy at what he told me, which was that I would attend the meeting if I had an ounce of sense because it was a critical meeting.</p> <p>He said to forget about the trip to Rome and the Pope or whoever else I was going to see.  I took his advice and I was glad I attended the meeting.  Changes were made and, as a result of that debacle, Tom was appointed as Whip in the Chamber.  There are many more stories but because of the sensitivities of the House and Tom's position on the censorship board, the Clerk and the Seanad officials would not allow me to regale Members with them.  Some of them are of a funny nature and some are set in hostelries outside this establishment.</p><p>We were very good friends.  He was a great family man and he always spoke of his wife Bridie, his two sons, Breand&aacute;n and Tom&aacute;s, and his daughter, Michelle.  I remember the affection and love for Dingle and Kerry.  We would have a rumpus during the Munster final but when it was over we were the best of friends.  He was a proud Kerry man and he had a great interest in rural Ireland and where he came from, Dingle, Kerry, and in the fishing industry.  Many people in this House and in the Lower House believe there is not enough representation of rural communities such as the one I come from in the Sheep's Head peninsula or in Dingle.  There is not enough being said for the support of rural Ireland in either Chamber but Tom was very strong on that issue.</p><p>I will not go through the various elections he stood for, which include standing in council elections in 1979.  He was a Member of this House on many occasions and he stood unsuccessfully for the D&aacute;il on one occasion.  I wish I had only one unsuccessful attempt.  I have fond memories of him.  It was deemed that I am in charge of these proceedings as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I extend my sincere sympathy officially to Bridie, his sons Breand&aacute;n and Tom&aacute;s, his daughter, Michelle, and to his extended family.  I am also proud to see that they have adopted a man from Cahirkeem Urhin in Corca Dhuibne and I am delighted to see him here.  We will rise to say a prayer and I have no doubt Tom is looking down upon us.</p></speech>

These are the primary and secondary purposes set out in the Bill.  Primary purpose means the present, past or future provision of health services to an individual.  Secondary purpose relates to the wider health service matters, such as health service management and patient safety.  This amendment proposes that there be a specific reference in the definition of secondary purpose to the "identification or prevention of a threat to public health" to ensure that this area is expressly captured in the Bill.  Subject to legal advice, the Government may propose other amendments to the definition of "secondary purpose" in due course in the passage of this legislation.</p></speech>

It is necessary and will join up services across hospital care and health care generally.  I am very much in favour of this.  It has been far too long coming.  The previous Government should have done this a long time ago but I welcome this Government's commitment to moving this on.</p><p>  I have tabled this amendment, which is to remove section 5, because in the Bill itself we have a statement that possession of an identifier does not necessarily qualify a person for health services.  We have a lack of clarity in this State about exactly what people are qualified and eligible for and, I would say, entitled to from our health services.</p><p>  We had many promises from previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments to publish the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill.  At the time, we had calls from the Opposition, both from the Minister of State's party and that of the current Minister, Deputy Reilly, for the publication of this Bill along with other Opposition spokespersons.  It has been reported that this issue will be addressed in the Minister's draft White Paper on universal health insurance.  The problem is we have not seen that.  Maybe it is in the White Paper and it will become a reality at some point but because of the statement in this Bill about people not qualifying for health care simply because of having an identifier, I cannot support this section, so I am tabling this amendment.</p><p>  I guess the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I will support the Bill and I am tabling this amendment on a point of principle more than anything.  I hope the Minister will be able to take on board this constructive contribution and that in due course people will have a legal entitlement to health care in this State.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Health Identifiers Bill is to put in place a legislative framework for individual health identifiers.  This is primarily a patient safety issue.  Eligibility for health services is a separate, although important, issue and is provided for in other legislation as the Senator and the House will be aware.  Section 5(3) was included in the Bill to make it clear that the assigning of an IHI to an individual shall not be regarded in any way as indicating an entitlement to or eligibility for the provision of health service to the individual.</p><p>In this context we must bear in mind that the IHI is an identifier which will apply throughout the health service, public and private.  An IHI can also be assigned to anyone receiving a health service, whether or not the person is ordinarily resident in the State.  I do not propose to accept the amendment in view of the purpose of the Bill and the intended use of the IHI across the health service.  I hear what the Senator has said and I thank him for the support he, along with colleagues across the House, expressed for the Bill and its purpose on Second Stage.  Senator Cullinane used the word &quot;entitlement&quot; which does not mean the same thing as eligibility, but I understand where he is coming from.  He will accept that the questions of eligibility for health services, how they should be managed, how a resource should be distributed, and funding the health services through health insurance or by the Exchequer directly are all enormously important issues.  The Senator rightly pointed to these issues in his contribution.</p><p>However, it is wrong to in any way seek to change this Bill, the purpose of which is a narrower objective which has to do with patient safety and which will give us an enormous resource - and I can see this in primary care - regarding the management of the health services properly for the whole population, across the board.  It would be a pity if we were to try to import into this Bill the broader debate about eligibility which is covered in legislation such as the Health Act 1970, which we have discussed several times here regarding eligibility for medical cards.  There is a broader debate to be had here.  There is a draft White Paper on universal health insurance which is being discussed by the Government.  It is intended to publish that White Paper in early course.  It will give us an opportunity to have this broader debate that the Senator regards as important, and on which I agree with him.  It would be a pity if we were to interfere with any of the provisions of this Bill which are somewhat more narrowly focused and which have a particular intent in mind.  I ask the Senator to consider those observations.</p></speech>

I have raised this matter in the House previously.  A 1976 High Court decision decided that nursing home care came under the definition of medical care.</p> <p>As a result people received an entitlement that was not intended when medical cards were introduced.  Likewise, this section states that having an identifier number does not give the person an entitlement.  That is an important clarification in the Bill.  I support fully what the Minister of State says on this matter.  It is an important section. </p></speech>

Have we adequately covered all the problems that might arise?  While the amendment is welcome it is also important that those situations are adequately catered for, particularly enduring power of attorney, and even powers of attorney, because there are circumstances in which a person may not have dementia or a health problem has signed a power of attorney for the management of his or her affairs, following legal advice.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that we have covered all those angles?</p></speech>

To some extent the Senator&rsquo;s concerns are being dealt with, belt and braces, in this amendment.  To the extent that there might be such concerns, it seems to me that this resolves them.  Existing law and provisions in respect of power of attorney, or enduring power of attorney, have their own legal substance and content and would have an impact by their nature.  I do not think that anything in this Bill reduces or undermines that.  This amendment covers whatever residual concerns there might be.  That is one of its purposes.</p><p>As the Senator is aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality is preparing legislation to deal with assisted decision-making which will be dealt with elsewhere. </p></speech>

Authorised disclosees do not have access to the IHI register but they are persons to whom a specified person may disclose an individual health identifier and other identifying particulars for a particular secondary purpose.

This Bill gives us the enabling legal framework for a unique identifier system for individuals and health service providers right across the public and private health system.  It is worth saying again that first and foremost, a unique identifier system is an important component of a safe health service, helping to ensure that the right information is associated with the right individual at the point of care.  An identifier system will also support health service management and delivery systems and facilitate the e-health agenda.</p><p>The Second Stage debate and our discussion today demonstrates that we share a common view of the benefits of an identifier system.  I thank Senators for the positive approach taken across the House and for their useful and productive debate on the issues concerned during the consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>

As I noted on Second Stage, there are some variables to consider with regard to cost and technology required to back this up.  Is what we have sufficient and how much will it cost to run this process?  Will the appropriate resources be available?  There must be a cross-departmental approach to these issues, taking in social welfare, health and justice, as data protection can be a barrier to the success or the aspirations of a Bill like this.  We all agree in principle with the identifier system but there is a question of how best to take it forward.  That does not detract from the amendment forwarded by Sinn F&eacute;in on eligibility and entitlement of people to gain the appropriate treatment, which is an old chestnut of mine.  For now at least, we welcome this as a small step in the right direction.</p></speech>

It is an important step.  We have much catching up to do, as I mentioned in a previous debate on the matter.  In Denmark, the computerisation process began in 1994.  We have 1,700 different computer systems in the health area but in Denmark they have 27 and are working to a target of five or six systems for the entire country.  This is an important step in creating efficiency and saving money and it cannot be taken without having the appropriate legislation in place.  This is the appropriate legislation and it will set up proper structures.</p><p>There is one advantage as we know the mistakes made by other countries and health systems.  It is important that we learn from that and put in place a safe system both in respect of the protection of data and in ensuring data can be accessed in an efficient and proper manner by health care personnel.  It is an important step but we have much work to do.  This is just one of the many areas where we must create efficiency in the health service.</p></speech>

It seeks to make the health services more efficient - which we all want - and make them more effective for patients and patient care.  That is essentially what this is about.  It is a step in the right direction.  We will return to the wider debate about how we fund health services, including matters of entitlement and eligibility and cutbacks in health care.  We have debated those matters several times in this House and we will do so again.  As a step forward, this is a good one, and although it is long overdue, it is more than welcome.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200016#Q00200"><p>Thank you, Acting Chairman, for the opportunity to come to the Upper House to brief colleagues on a very important issue that has affected so many people in this country since the first week of January.  As we speak, it is affecting people in the south west in particular.  There is no doubt that we are going through an unprecedentedly difficult weather period which has affected many homes and businesses across the country.  With that in mind, and given the scale of the storms we have had since the first week in January, the Government yesterday made a substantial announcement on the provision of an additional &euro;70 million for remediation measures.</p><p>On behalf of the Government I join with many Members of this House and the other House in genuinely thanking the emergency services for the work they have done in the past seven weeks or so.  I recently visited Limerick and saw at first hand the extraordinary volunteerism and effort of community groups and emergency services &ndash; the HSE, the Department of Social Protection, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Civil Defence.  We owe those people a great debt of gratitude because they are the ones on the front line who have been helping communities affected by the dreadful storms.</p><p>The Government made an announcement ten days ago concerning the initial additional amount required for humanitarian aid, which is now under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  A total of &euro;25 million has been made available to help people in the most immediate way and also in a long-term way in terms of structural damage to homes where there is no insurance.</p><p>My area of responsibility relates to the Office of Public Works and to repairing the damage to flood defences and coastal protection measures.  From reports received from local authorities we reckon that somewhere south of &euro;20 million of additional moneys will be required to repair flood barriers and the capital schemes that might well have been breached during the recent storms.  The package of money announced yesterday was &euro;70 million across a number of Departments.  Approximately &euro;20 million of the &euro;70 million relates to breaches in flood defences, which are the first port of call and the first emergency.  Given the fact that high tides will emerge again in the first half of March, it is important that we get going to repair those damaged embankments and flood defences.  I especially thank the Office of Public Works.  We have more than 300 staff out in the field, as it were, men and women working hard to make sure that we repair that which is our responsibility and helping the local authorities in terms of capacity they need on small schemes around the country.</p><p>The first port of call of many local authorities is by way of application to the Office of Public Works by means of the minor works and coastal protection scheme.  The scheme was established by the previous Government in 2009.  Applications for funding can be made up to the value of &euro;500,000.  Since 2009 a total of &euro;29 million has been spent on the scheme.  A total of 430 small schemes have been advanced around the country by the Office of Public Works.  It is the key scheme for local authorities which now need to repair damaged flood defences.  My appeal to local authorities that have been affected by the storms is to get their applications in to us as soon as possible.  We have given more flexibility in the scheme this year.  I have given a firm commitment that we will prioritise those applications that come from the counties worst affected and we will turn them around within a matter of a week and no more than a ten-day period.  The funding is given to the local authority, which then procures contractors locally or uses its own staff to do the work.  The task of the OPW is to act as a funding agent on behalf of the State to use the minor works scheme as a means by which we can repair damaged flood defences.  I appeal to local authorities today to get in their applications.  I appreciate the fact that local authorities are under much stress at the moment, given that they are dealing with the emergency, but the way in which the schemes will be administered is by application to the Office of Public Works under the minor works scheme.  We will turn it around and give local authorities the money, and they will get on with the task that is required.</p><p>In my recent visit to County Clare I saw in some cases that Clare County Council had started the works.  That is fine because I gave a commitment that we would recoup the money to local authorities once the works have been completed.  There should be no bickering or lack of clarity about the scheme.  Local authorities should procure the work, get on with it and get it completed as soon as possible and we will pay for it even if there is a difficulty with the local authority.  I wish to make that absolutely clear.</p><p>When people say there is no strategic policy approach I counter that by saying that we are in a very good position when it comes to flood maps in this country.  The previous Government and this Government have signed up to the European-wide directive on flood relief.  That means that by this year, for each of the six catchment river basins in this country, we will have a detailed map setting out the predictability of flood events for a one-in-50-year event, a one-in-100-year event and a one-in-200-year event.  The maps will be published over the summer period, following which we will have a period of consultation on them.</p> <p>These maps cover over 6,500 km of river channels and 90 coastal communities.  Once there is agreement we will submit, by December 2015, a list to the European Commission of areas that require further consideration.  We are talking about approximately 300 areas in the country which are at risk of or prone to significant flood damage.  When I first took up my post with the OPW and met our engineers in Trim, I asked them how many areas we were talking about and they said there were somewhere between 250 and 300 hot spots.  When we lodge our catchment by catchment plans with the European Commission next year, our task will be to set out not only where these 300 areas are but also the prioritisation within them.  There is very clear methodology, in terms of a multi-criteria approach, to cost-benefit analyses.  These 300 areas will be prioritised from one to 300 and the cost of the schemes attached to each of these areas will be worked out.  </p><p>We are spending &euro;250 million over a five year period on flood protection measures.  Despite reductions in the capital budget generally, this is the one area in which we have seen no reduction.  If anything, there has been an increase in capital spending in this area in recent years.  In fairness to the previous Government, it ramped up expenditure on flood defences because there was a recognition that we had not spent, over a generation, the kind of money other EU countries had spent in this area.  Our envelope is &euro;250 million over five years.  If we were able to start work on the 300 areas to which I referred tomorrow, we would be looking at a bill of somewhere between &euro;1.6 billion and &euro;2 billion.  At the current rate of expenditure, it will take us just over of 35 years to have all of the necessary work done.  </p><p>We face a big problem because of poor flood defences and the fact that planning and development took place in such a sporadic way for many years has added to the problem.  We are now paying the price for the bad planning decisions made in the past.  However, we are in a good position in that once we have the CFRAM maps, the catchment plans and the prioritisation of the 300 areas, we can set about, on a case by case basis, rolling out the necessary schemes, as we have done in other parts of the country.  </p><p>The news is not all bad.  Since 1995 the OPW, on behalf of the taxpayer, has spent almost &euro;370 million.  It has developed schemes, both big and small, all over the country.  The problem in Clonmel, for example, which flooded regularly, has now been solved by work completed by the OPW.  Problems in Ennis, Fermoy, Mallow and Dublin have also been addressed.  In 2002 the cost of the damage done in Dublin as a result of the major flooding event was &euro;65 million.  As a result of works undertaken on the River Tolka and the River Dodder, the most recent high tide which was higher than in 2002 in Dublin caused damage along the seafront in Clontarf of approximately &euro;100,000.  We have gone from having a &euro;65 million bill for flood damage in 2002 to one for approximately &euro;100,000 in 2014.  Why has that happened?  It has happened because we invested in flood defences in Dublin.  For every &euro;1 we spend on flood defences, we get &euro;3 back.  I note that Senator Sean D. Barrett is in the Chamber and I expect him to talk about the economics of flood defences.  There is a good economic rationale behind such spending.  For every &euro;1 we spend, the benefit in terms of dealing with potential damage is &euro;3.  Such investment also creates jobs, with 700 people working in the flood defences industry this year, both in the private and the public sector.  Even though we have to wait for the CFRAM process to be completed, we have done a lot of work around the country already.  By our reckoning, approximately 11,000 homes have been protected by way of the ongoing work being done on behalf of the OPW.  </p><p>Coastal protection, it must be said, is more complicated.  Our coastline is a natural phenomenon; the tide comes in and out, sands move and so forth.  Some of what I have seen on my travels around the country in recent weeks and in the past three years has been alarming.  Homes have been built right beside sand spits and along very dangerous parts of the coastline, which is absolutely criminal.  Such developments are an invitation to problems.  We must take a much more holistic view of coastal protection.  We can certainly build up coastal defences by growing marram grass and other plants which help in certain tidal conditions.  However, nothing we do will help in a situation like the one we saw in the Shannon Estuary two weeks ago.  At 6.30 a.m. on a Saturday the poor people of St. Mary's Park and elsewhere were woken by a tidal surge which was 7 ins higher than the highest on record, dating back to 1961.  No one could have predicted such a surge, with a combination of high winds, high tides, storms and prolonged precipitation.  We need to take a holistic approach to coastal protection and decide on our priorities.  The first priority must be to spend money to protect lives.  We have seen examples in the past where lives were lost as a result of a significant flooding event.  The next priority is obviously homes.  We must protect as many as possible in the expending of this money.  Third, we must protect commercial business and, finally, farmland.  I know this is a difficult message for the agricultural community, but where there are limited resources, we must do what we can to protect the maximum number of homes.  That is how we have laid out our priorities in term of the cost-benefit model.  </p><p>I wish to comment on the insurance industry and I am going to be very blunt in my remarks.  I have been sitting down with Insurance Ireland, previously the Irish Insurance Federation, since January 2013 trying to agree a memorandum of understanding, whereby when the OPW or a local authority builds a flood defence, the insurance industry will recognise that work, the capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer and reinsure properties for which it had withdrawn cover.  That is a challenge, but I am confident that in the coming weeks we will get that memorandum over the line.  That will not give protection to people who cannot get insurance right now, but it will certainly give some measure of comfort to those communities where flood defence investments have been made.  There is no reason the insurance industry cannot begin reinsuring again in these communities.  If the State puts in the money by way of capital investment, there is an obligation on the insurance industry to recognise that fact and start reinsuring again.  </p><p>We have committed additional money in the first six weeks of the year.  We recognise the damage done and want to use the resources of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Environment, Community and Local Government, as well as the OPW, to disburse these funds as soon as possible.  We want to help the affected communities to get back on their feet again, especially in parts of the west where tourism is such an essential industry, as I noted in my visits to counties Clare, Limerick, Kerry and Cork.  We need to make sure that by the summer season, a lot of the damaged infrastructure has been put back in place.  I assure the House of the seriousness with which the Government intends to address this issue.  There are short-term measures to be taken, but we must also consider the longer term view.  We will have to live with this issue.  When one looks at the appalling circumstances in the south of England, as well as on the west coast of France, Portugal and Spain, one realises this is a very serious issue with which we are going to have to live, deal and respond to in a comprehensive and sustainable way.</p></speech>

The weather in Cork and Limerick is unbelievably extreme.  Trees are down everywhere; students are being told not to leave buildings, lectures are being cancelled and so forth.  While the damage is storm rather than flood related, it is likely to be extremely severe.  People are really suffering.</p> <p>At least two lorries have overturned on roads, so it is extremely dangerous in the south.  I hope everyone there will be safe and take precautions.</p><p>The flooding of the past several weeks has been very difficult.  Massive damage has been inflicted on homes, commercial property and infrastructure with significant costs.  There is the initial cost of businesses having to close, followed by the subsequent cost of preparing to open again, as well as insurance and the cost to the State in rectifying infrastructure and flood relief projects.  The Minister of State was right to list the projects already completed.  I am glad he referred to the scheme for the River Dodder in Dublin because I heard someone on the radio claim it never have been done and that it was just a stroke by Bertie Ahern.  It has gone that bad.</p></speech>

There were problems along this river but schemes put in place by the Office of Public Works, OPW, have ensured they have been tackled.</p><p>  The Government needs to take climate change seriously and stand up to some of the vested interests which have stopped action being taken on it.  Those vested interests, I will admit in fairness, were relatively influential in the previous Government too when a fairly good climate change Bill was to be put forward.  It is not that we can hold back the tide but that we prevent matters getting worse.</p><p>  My only criticism of how this has been handled is that when a storm or flood occurs, there is not enough of an immediate response from central government and local authorities in directing assistance.  Over the Christmas, people were left swinging in the wind.  I know the approach has changed and the Minister has been very active on this.  I accept he cannot be everywhere either.  A more centralised approach, however, a one-stop shop at national level that councils could feed into is required.  If my home were flooded, I am not sure who I would ring.  Would I ring the Meath County Council emergency line?  More work needs to be done at that level to give people that bit of help.</p><p>  Emergency information on where to go and not to go is also required.  We are relying on tweets from AA Roadwatch, bystanders and politicians.  For example, one night I tweeted that there trees down in my neighbourhood which found its way on to the website <i>journal.ie</i>.  There should be a central information authority in emergency situations giving out this information.  For example, two lorries have been blown on to their sides on a motorway and a national road this afternoon in Limerick.  That information should not just be given out by AA Roadwatch or private individuals.  There needs to be a centralised structure that determines the important information to give to citizens.</p><p>  The weather warnings have been very useful.  Having slept through an orange alert cold weather warning in a tent last summer in France, I am not too worried about them too much personally.  However, today, we had a red warning which has proved to be the case.  Is this just a meteorological matter or should it invoke response from central government?  Someone asked why schools were not closed today.  Lectures at University College Cork were cancelled today and students told to stay indoors.  This is happening after the event when it could have been announced with the warning.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will assist the Government in dealing with the insurance issue.  This is just not an issue when floods occur but one that is ongoing even in areas where relief programmes were introduced.  I have corresponded with the Minister on this matter.  Will the Minister of State also address the issue of the prospect for European funds to alleviate the recent flooding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1158" speakername="Martin Conway" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200018#S00400"><p>I apologise to the Minister of State that, unfortunately, I will not be in the Chamber for his responses later as I have to go down to the west to the wind and the rain.  I acknowledge the fact he was the only one from the Government at the beginning who realised the seriousness of this problem.  He was the only Minister who went on the public airwaves after the disaster inflicted on the west, particular west Clare, on 3 January 2014.  I was disappointed the Government did not call the emergency co-ordinating committee meeting until the Monday, 6 January, when it should have taken place on the Friday or Saturday to pull the various streams together.  It took 24 to 48 hours for some of the damage in isolated rural parts of the west to come to public attention.  There were certain parts of Clare where the seriousness of the damage caused only became known on Sunday morning.</p><p>That said, we are where we are.  It has been a unique set of circumstances and unprecedented change in weather.  We are fortunate that the previous Government and this Government have invested in flood defences.  Where they have been installed, they have worked.  The classic example is Ennis, County Clare.  In Christmas 2009, Ennis was under water.  Thankfully, significant work has been carried out on the town&rsquo;s flood defences in several phases under the auspices of the OPW.  This has resulted in Ennis being protected from flooding now.</p><p>There will have to be a partnership with Europe on flood alleviation.  The Minister of State outlined the long-term strategy and I welcome the engagement is already under way.  Hopefully, within the next several years we will have adequate defence barriers in place.  The Minister rightly pointed out the nature of the western coastline is unique, requiring a certain approach.  We need to retain the best possible advice on how we deal with this.  There is no point in throwing good money after bad.  We must ensure it is spent wisely and properly, having the desired result.</p><p>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;70 million to go towards the repair work in various counties.  Clare could do with 50% of that, as the damage caused there is estimated to be approximately &euro;34 million.  I accept there are many other counties with substantial bills as well.</p><p>As a temporary measure, I would like to see one Minister in charge of pulling the response of various Departments and agencies together.  Unfortunately, there is a multidepartmental approach with the Departments of Transport, Tourism And Sport, the Environment, Community and Local Government, the OPW and Social Protection.  At this stage, it would be appropriate to have one Minister with overall responsibility for one lead Ministry to liaise with local authorities.  In some cases, there is confusion as to whether the OPW or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in charge of coastal protection.  Roads come under the Department of Transport, Tourism And Sport.  Given the unique nature of what has happened, it would be appropriate for the Government to appoint a lead Minister, even a junior Minister with access to the various Departments to pull their responses together.</p> <p>That would mean that when a council or public representative talked to a Minister, he or she would know that Minister was the person who was in a position to pull it all together and make recommendations to the various other Ministers.</p><p> The concept of red and orange alerts is a new phenomenon.  Perhaps there were red alerts during the years, but I have not heard of them.  Thankfully, we were probably in a situation where we did not need to hear them.  I agree with Senator Thomas Byrne - protocols must be introduced.  If there is a red alert in a particular area, certain services will have to be put on stand by.  Where necessary, schools, universities and other public operations would have to be advised to close in advance.  That is very reasonable.  It is unacceptable that students in University College Cork, UCC, are being told to stay indoors.  The red alert has been in place for 24 hours.  I do not know what the lead agency to deal with it is, but it needs to be factored in in our emergency planning.</p><p> We are in a new reality which requires leadership.  The Government has stepped up to the plate in this regard and some &euro;70 million has been made available.  I am looking forward to seeing the breakdown, particularly what will be given to the counties that have been worst affected.  I have not yet been advised of how much will be allocated to County Clare.  I presume it will be at the discretion of the local authority to prioritise where it affects lives and homes, in particular.  I thank the Minister for coming to County Clare a couple of weeks ago and visiting some of the families whose houses have been flooded and who are still out of their homes.  There is a big job of work to be done.  We can talk here <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Everyone has a contribution to make and all contributions need to feed into the process.  We need to learn from the experience.  I would like protocols and a lead ministry to be established.</p></speech>

We have learned much in this crisis which has been handled very well by everybody.  Perhaps the economic problems since 2008 have stiffened our national resolve in these matters.  </p><p>The Minister of State referred to the works done in the past and theoretical work.  A man called Colonel Rydell came to Ireland after the River Shannon floods in the 1950s.  He came from the US army corps of engineers and his solutions were very much the pragmatic ones about which the Minister told us today such as moving houses to higher ground.  The River Shannon will flood agricultural land which during the winter does not cost very much.  We must consider this.  As Mr. Colm McCarthy, the well known economist, said, one could spend a lot of money changing wet rocks into dry rocks, with no impact on national output or production; therefore, there are some dangers in this regard.  That is what we did.  It is no harm that the Minister of State has thrown in all of the suggestions to see what comes out, but Colonel Rydell rejected the suggestion of building a canal from the upper Shannon to drain it into Sligo Bay.  The cost of going through the Ox Mountains would have been huge.  He also rejected the suggestion of diverting the River Suck, which floods, into the River Hind.  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen was here earlier.  Somebody from Roscommon said the River Hind was a much smaller river than the River Suck and that it would not be possible to do it.  Let us have all of these ideas.  People have ideas about what causes these events and how we should deal with them.</p><p>The planning laws were referred to.  The Minister of State is right to resolve that if we know there is a record of flood plains in an area, it is not open for building, even though planning permissions would traditionally have resulted in very large capital gains for the people who bought that land.  I agree with him on the insurance industry.  We need all financial services, banks, insurance and pension companies which we discussed earlier to step up to the mark and deliver a far better service than they have been doing.  That also applies to health insurance.  The insurance industry should reward consumers for the very substantial improvements in road safety.  Let us see this manifest in what people pay.  As the Minister of State said, if we drain a place, sometimes at substantial cost, in Kilkenny, Fermoy, Mallow or Ennis, it should be insured and there should be a substantial reduction to reflect the capital investment made by the State to reduce the risk.  Many financial services organisations have taken the view that they need not worry as they will always land into the Exchequer.  With a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120%, we cannot do this; we need a more efficient performance from the insurance industry all around.</p><p>I agree with the Minister of State's priority on the situation in Cork.  As an outsider, it is incredible to me that in 2009 organisations failed and the city of Cork was flooded, mostly owing to the ESB not talking to Cork City Council or the council not talking to citizens.  Many people are not satisfied with what has been resolved since.  It almost seems to be a case of covering up who was responsible rather than doing something, as the Minister of State said.  There would be a substantial return on measures to stop a major commercial centre such as the city of Cork from flooding.  The Minister of State said that as early as July there would be plans to stop the city of Cork from flooding.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State might take a look at that issue.  He mentioned successes in Clonmel, Kilkenny, Fermoy, Mallow and Ennis.</p><p>The Minister of State has made an important point, that coasts change.  It would take an immense investment to change the Irish coastline to something like the Dutch coastline.  It is a smaller country, with a much larger population and higher GDP per head.  On the east coast of Ireland, Wexford Harbour, Annagassan Harbour in County Louth and Lough Shinny in County Dublin have silted up.  Kilbarrack sailing club in County Dublin shut down owing to a lack of water.  The coastline is changing all the time.  We cannot stop the sea coming in in one place.  The great Mr. William Dargan, one of the greatest railway engineers of his day, had to change the railway line around Bray Head.  One can see the remains of where it ran previously.  There was even talk at one stage of moving it inland.  The danger is that we could spend a lot of money in accomplishing remarkably little in Cork.</p><p>Senator Martin Conway has headed off to County Clare, but I am glad to see that Mr. Donald Trump has given a vote of confidence to the Loop Head Peninsula by making a large investment.  That is a gesture for the future.  In the turlough areas of south Galway we built houses which had to be abandoned because water came up from the ground and flooded areas.  Let us put all of these mistakes into the book and avoid repeating them.  We need a realistic investment.  If we are not growing much on land in the winter, should the investment be in preventing floods in urban areas where economic activities are taking place?  The Minister of State has given priority to Cork where there have been far too many floods in recent times.  We expect it to be a major centre in the revival of the economy.</p><p>The OPW is doing good work.  I thank the Minister of State for being here and, as other speakers said, always obliging the House by coming to discuss major issues with us.  We are moving in the right direction.  It has been a shock to the system that we have had such a winter.  I second what Senator Thomas Byrne said, that the emergency services have worked remarkably well.  The Minister of State was present on the ground.  Careful planning involves Parliament being concerned.  Let us publish all of this and let people come and see if these are good investments for the future.  Let us require a better performance from the insurance industry because an insurance industry that opts out as soon as there is a flood is not serving the country.  I support the Minister of State on that point.</p></speech>

In crises it is always good to see a response from the Government, and the Government has responded to this crisis.  There are also good news stories.  I am from Tipperary and the flood walls in Clonmel were very successful.  Last weekend the mountable pieces that go on top of the walls had to be used and they held the flood.  Last Monday night week the river was within 6 in. of coming over the 5 ft. high walls in my home town of Carrick-on-Suir but it did not do so.  If it had done so, we would have been back to the drawing board.  It was the worst recorded flood in the town, yet the defences held.  It was fantastic and I commend those who stuck out their necks.</p><p>In 1996 the late Minister, Hugh Coveney, visited Carrick-on-Suir in the midst of a similar crisis and committed to sorting out the matter.  Good work has been done, but much more has to be done.  I have been in contact with many local authority members in affected areas.  The Minister of State visited Limerick, and I have spoken to councillor Tom Shortt, who is very active on this issue.  He asked me whether it was a freak situation and whether we would see it again.  On 1 February the amount of water that came in created a saucer effect in the St. Mary's Park area of Limerick and the water could not get out.  The tide did not bring it back out.  How will this be addressed?  Much of the money, amounting to millions of euro, spent on getting the area ready for regeneration has been wasted.  This is a specific issue and I ask the Minister of State to comment on it.</p><p>A particular issue that has arisen in Galway has been brought to my attention.  The Silverstrand area is awaiting rock support armoury, which is in the system, but if it is not done soon the new park will be destroyed and all of the money spent on it will be wasted.  Councillors in Galway raised this issue with me and have also written to the Minister of State.  Local authorities are being offered 90% of the cost, but they do not have the other 10% and are being told the works will not go ahead because of this.  Will the Minister of State address this issue?</p><p>Senator Gilroy, who is from Cork, will speak about what has happened there.  The Minister of State attended a very successful meeting in Cork with the Chamber of Commerce, business people and political groups.  They saw the Minister of State had mapped out a future for relief in Cork city.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that the situation along the coast is different.  Anyone who saw the photograph, which has gone viral, of the seafront and road in Tramore would have been frightened.  It took 14 trucks of cement to fill the gap.  The particular problems there are ongoing and have also been experienced in Dunmore East and Passage East.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, visited the area at the weekend.</p><p>I welcome the effort made by the Minister of State with the insurance companies.  Senator Barrett spoke very well on this issue.  It seems one is insured until one experiences the first flood and then one is out of the system.  My grandparents lived in a house in Mill Street in Carrick-on-Suir in 1912 and were consistently flooded for three or four years before insurance companies existed.  They moved house because of it.  Since then thousands of houses have been allowed to be built on flood plains, but they were accepted by insurance companies in the knowledge of where they were.  However, after a flooding problem first arose the insurance companies no longer insured them.  Insurance companies in the health sector are not allowed cherry-pick in the market and must take what comes in the door.  We had much debate on this when new companies entered the market.  We should tell insurance companies that they cannot cherry-pick in the house insurance market or run away from a problem when it occurs.  Otherwise, there is little point in having insurance companies.  Will the Minister of State address this issue in his response?</p></speech>

My county of Roscommon has been subject to much flooding, particularly near the River Shannon, and the Minister of State is well aware of it.  A company in the area, Global Flood Solutions, specialises in flood protection.  It was founded in 2010 and is headed by Shane Curran, the famous Roscommon goalkeeper.  It sells its product nationally and internationally.  This Irish-made product is a quantum leap forward in leading-edge technology and is versatile and affordable.  It is a proven defence barrier.  As the Minister of State is aware, Foynes in County Limerick flooded in early January.  The port authority employed Global Flood Solutions and it protected Foynes against a higher tide more recently and has been endorsed by Jacobs Engineering Group.  Will the Minister of State meet the company in the very near future?  Every little helps to protect homes.  As Senator Landy stated, we have a problem with insurance companies and the Government must find solutions for these people.</p></speech>

We discussed elements of this issue several weeks ago before the recent bout of storms and I know the Minister of State visited Portrane with regard to coastal erosion.  My invitation must have got lost in the post, as Minister of State was with the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I understand how it works.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State does not operate in that way.</p><p>Everyone has rightly spoken about houses that are deemed uninsurable.  We have a mechanism to deal with this issue in the motor industry through the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland and the Government levies general insurance policies and products.  The idea that people can only be insured once and if they are flooded they are not insured again and the taxpayer picks up the tab is wrong.  I understand why it must be done at present.  We should consider introducing a general insurance bureau for housing whereby insurance companies are levied and a part of the premium paid goes to a separate fund into which the State can reach when dealing with events such as these.  I am examining equivalent measures in several European countries.  We should tell Insurance Ireland this is being done.  Obviously it should be consulted to some degree, but I would not let it lead the Minister of State by the nose.</p><p>The Minister of State has been very active regarding the flooding that has occurred throughout the country.  It is very difficult for the local authorities to get a handle on it.  Some events in specific areas had been forewarned for a number of years and some flood defences have been put in place to deal with coastal erosion.  My colleagues eloquently spoke about their areas and I will speak specifically about Portrane and other coastal communities in which work is hindered because they are EU-designated special areas of conservation.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be fortunate enough to have a new role after 23 May.</p> <p>As I look around, I see many former, future and potential MEPs.  Perhaps the Members who are throwing theirs hat into the ring will, when they go to the European Parlilament, look to the European Union-----</p></speech>

He has been around the country.  However, that is irrelevant in this regard.</p><p>On special areas of conservation, there will be nothing left to conserve.  We have seen one example where approximately 60 dwellings are at risk.  New coastal erosion defences cannot be installed because the European Union has designated the areas as special areas of conservation, but if we do not do something, there will be nothing left to conserve.  This is particularly prevalent on the east coast, where there is a sandy shoreline and people live close to it.  That is not due to previous bad planning, but because these are historical communities.  In the one visited by the Minister of State people have lived in the borough for hundreds of years and some of the families have been there for hundreds of years.</p><p>I asked a question about the original emergency funding.  It appears to be only for the repair of the existing flood protections and infrastructure, not to install new ones.  I realise the funding has been expanded since, but will the Minister of State clarify the position?  I understand we are not applying to the European solidarity fund.  As I said a couple of weeks ago, I did not think we would be after hearing the response given by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, when he came to the House on that occasion.  I accept there are parameters in that regard.</p><p>The Minister of State should not forget about the east coast.  Obviously, the west coast has been heavily affected and people have been put out of their homes because of flooding.  However, will funding be made available for the area the Minister of State visited in north County Dublin in order that coastal protections can be installed?  I also urge him - for what it is worth, he will get all the assistance he requires from us - to bring forward legislation to provide for a levy on the insurance industry to set up a general insurance bureau, which would be a fund on which we could build each year to defray some of the cost and expense to the taxpayer.  I am not aware of a general insurance company that is broke.  These are multinational companies and I believe we could levy a portion of each policy, by way of the premia charged, to be paid towards building up such a fund.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response to that suggestion.</p></speech>

They are effectively getting away with it again.  Big business and its shareholders come first and, unfortunately, on too many occasions people come second.  Aviva Insurance, AXA Insurance and Zurich Insurance are multinational corporations with massive deposits of cash.  As they are getting away with it, a mutual fund is required for people who get caught.  As bad as a person's personal circumstances are, with his or her house flooded and many of his or her belongings lost, if he or she is not out of pocket, it would at least go some way towards dealing with that awful event.</p><p>The softest coastline in the country is in County Wexford.  It has the longest and sandiest beaches and there are more sand shifts there than anywhere else in Ireland.  Unfortunately, monster winter storms are not required for significant coastal erosion to occur.  I have been speaking about this issue for too long, dating back to my time on the local authority in Wexford.  The county is and has been in a bad way for almost 50 years.  When I was a child, there was a beach at Courtown.  It is gone.  There is nothing there now, except the rock armouring.  The beach moves up and down along the coast.  It will cost &euro;1.25 million to bring the pier in Courtown back to a safe standard.</p><p>Another very important point should be made.  I was speaking to a member of the Irish Coast Guard on the pier in Courtown.  The main job he has in these storms is to keep people off the pier.  Any person who goes down the pier, particularly with children, should be tested for the existence of a brain.  It is insanity.  The major message from this debate should be that people must stay away from the coastline at this time.  I attended a funeral this morning in Ballygarrett, which is on the coast.  Big men were being pushed around by the winds.</p><p>I know a little about special areas of conservation.  On the land I farm there is a salmonid river which is a tributary of the River Slaney.  It is a special area of conservation.  The only thing worse than a special area of conservation is a national heritage area, NHA.  It is impossible to get anything done in these areas.  There is no point in trying to pretend anything will occur there because it will not.  It is an amazing scenario.  For 50 or 60 years there were grants available to drain bogs to bring them into agricultural production.  The bog operated as a large sponge which sucked in water, held it at times of flooding and released it over a period of time.  Now, owing to SACs and NHAs, we are not allowed to clean the rivers and take away the debris to let the water run off.  The river is now more narrow, has more force and, with the bogs gone, doing more damage.</p><p>The same applies to the coastline.  When I was a member of the local authority, we were planning a marina in Courtown.  The paperwork was enormous owing to the SACs north of where the works were potentially to occur.  The project was stopped because of the cost of the environmental impact study and the environmental impact statements.  However, there are people whose houses were built along the coastline before these NHAs and SACs were ever envisaged.  Kilpatrick is located in north County Wexford.  Wexford County Council and a private property owner commissioned a report for the protection of these houses and the cost of the report, not the works to protect the houses, was &euro;250,000.  The works would probably have cost less.  The report could not have been clearer - the entire SAC would be gone in 20 years.  There will be no SAC because it will be washed out to sea and nature will have done its work.  Some of the houses and their gardens will also be gone within 20 years.  The report concluded that there was no question about this outcome; it was incontrovertible.  As the application for planning permission was refused, the entire SAC can go out to sea, as no protection works can occur.  This is the Jim Hacker, &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; campaign to save the British sausage from the madness of the European Union.</p><p>We cannot continue to ignore the commonsense approaches.  I am sure that eventually there will be a case in the European courts in which there will be a competition between somebody's right to protect his or her property, which he or she must be allowed to do, and the protection of an SAC or national heritage area.  At some stage we must call a halt to the insanity.  The continuance of this situation is insane.</p></speech>

I am sure it was appreciated by the victims of the flood damage.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government visited County Waterford also.  The coastal areas of the south west, south and south east are taking a battering.  There are trees down everywhere; there is damage to properties and homes; schools have had to close and serious damage has occurred.  Unfortunately, the damage caused by bad weather and floods is ongoing.</p> <p> I will first deal with Waterford and then some of the national issues.  I had a meeting last week with the city and county manager of the newly merged authority in Waterford.  He estimated that the cost of the damage caused to the coastal areas of Waterford and roads is in the region of &euro;8 million.  The council has submitted an application for funding of &euro;8 million.  There was flood damage in a number of private dwellings in Poleberry.  In fairness to the local authority, it was very quick to respond.  It did its best to prevent damage to the properties and on a number of occasions it was successful.  However, some damage was caused and I understand a separate pool of funding is made available to the individuals affected.  The Minister of State might explain how this works and the amount of compensation that will be available.</p><p>There was good news in Waterford in that the flood defence on the quay held up very well.  Ironically, a former Minister who is basking in the sun in Florida would, I am sure, take credit for that.  The investment made in flood defences for Waterford city has certainly paid off, by and large.  When we install infrastructure, be it in Carrick or Waterford city, it does work and, therefore, we need to build similar infrastructure in other areas that are affected.  This is not to say there has not been damage in Waterford, because there has been.  The coast, especially Tramore, Passage and Cheekpoint, has taken a severe battering.  The Minister of State might update us on all the applications for funding that have been made.  What is the total amount made available?  It is important that we have an answer to this.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement that an extra &euro;70 million has been made available to address the problems.  It is obviously very welcome.  In light of the current circumstances in the south, particularly Cork and Kerry, I ask the Government to reassess the already-promised funding.  We will not know the full extent of the damage for some time because the storm is ongoing.  I am sure further damage has been caused that will force the local authorities involved to reassess their applications to the Department.  Even at this point, however, the Minister of State might indicate what the local authorities are seeking and what is available.</p><p>An issue arises with regard to the European Union.  The Minister of State will be looking forward to taking a seat in the European Parliament, subject to his election by the people of Dublin.  We need to make a case at Government and Commission levels for altering the threshold for emergency aid from the European Union.  At present, Ireland receives only &euro;1.33 million for every instance of damage worth &euro;100 million.  With ongoing damage being caused, as we have witnessed today and over recent weeks across the State, we are in a position to make a strong case for a reappraisal of the criteria governing aid at EU level.  Both the Government and Opposition should lobby the European Commission on this.  Obviously, the Government is in a very strong position.</p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate the point I am making because I do not want to be critical of him since he has, by and large, done a good job responding to the floods.  The cutbacks to local government funding have had an impact on the ability of local authorities to meet the challenges and the added costs they face because of flood damage.</p><p>Let us consider the officials and front-line workers at local government level in Waterford and the staff in all the emergency services, including some workers who were pilloried not so long ago.  ESB workers come to mind in this regard.  They are the very people who were out on the front line protecting people and getting electricity working again.  They are protecting people from the worst excesses of the flooding.  Today in this House, we should put on record our appreciation for all the workers who are out in very difficult circumstances doing good work.  Having said that, we must also point out that, when we cut local government funding, it has an impact.</p><p>There will be renewed focus and debate on climate change and the need for a climate change Bill.  Much more could be done on this.  Every local authority should have its own climate change strategy.  There is an environment strategic policy committee in most local authorities.  With the reform of local government, one of the more progressive steps local authorities could take would be to develop a climate change strategy and actions in their areas.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response to the flooding.  I hope that, in the not too distant future, he will be able to commit to further funding for the areas affected.</p></speech>

The Minister of State and I were in Cork during the week and saw at first hand the effect of flooding on residents; it has been devastating for them.  The Minister of State will have seen the damage done to the centre of Cork city, where businesses are in real trouble.  The macro-image people like to paint concerns businesses in real trouble but the micro-image concerns the personal distress, as witnessed also by the Minister of State.  He was speaking to Claire Nash from Nash 19, a restaurant in which she employs 24 people.  There is a real danger that her whole business model will have been undermined by the flooding.  We wish her well and hope it does not come to this.  Along the street in question, Princes Street, there are 84 businesses.  If one did not know the short street, one could hardly conceive that 84 different enterprises could operate there.  Probably 300 people are employed along the street although it is not 150 yd in length.  This is but one side street off Oliver Plunkett Street, which bore the brunt of the flooding.  We pay tribute to the traders and communities in Cork on their resilience.</p><p>We saw the flooding in Limerick, where we saw at first hand that Kings Island was so badly damaged along with several hundred houses.  The resilience of the people there needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to the response at local level by local authority workers, ESB staff and everybody else.  They sometimes get bad press and people sometimes complain about overstaffing in the public service but we must ask whether these are the kinds of people we would be inclined to lay off when we make such complaints.  I, for one, would say they absolutely are not.</p><p>During his visit to Cork, I was glad to hear the Minister of State announce the &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million budget that has been put aside, and that Cork has been prioritised for flood defences.  The problem in Cork is multifaceted because there are different types of flooding in the region at different times.  A combination of geographical and meteorological features caused tidal flooding, which occurred in the city on the last occasion.  In other places, such as Glanmire in June 2012, the sheer volume of rain falling into the valleys across County Cork caused the flooding.  Dunmanway and other places in west Cork were similarly damaged.  Some 56 houses in Meadowbrook Estate in Glanmire were overwhelmed by water that reached a depth of 6 ft.  The residents are just getting back on their feet.  The immediate response to their problem was reasonably good, although it could, perhaps, have been better.  Again, the insurance companies have been dragging their feet.  When people are flooded out of their homes, they become very distressed and vulnerable, and insurance companies tend to play a long game with them, making a derisory first offer.  Owing to the conditions some residents are in, they are inclined to regard this as a final offer and they accept a sum that is way too low.  This occurred constantly among the residents of Meadowbrook who were blackguarded by the insurance companies.  This is the best way to describe it.  This kind of practice must be stopped.  The insurance companies are very mobile because they are multinationals; they can get up and go in the morning.  Therefore, our response to them must be robust but, by its nature, it is rather limited.</p><p>All sorts of issues arise with regard to flooding in Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  With Councillor Robert Ireton in Courtown last week, I saw the damage done to the harbour.  One could not imagine it unless one saw it.  The sheer force of the water that damaged the harbour and surrounding beaches was remarkable.  We can blame bad planning, of course, as it certainly can play a role, but on this occasion the problem was the unprecedented volume of water combined with meteorological factors.</p><p>It is good to see that the flood defences for Cork are the first national priority.  Addressing the problem will require 12 km of walls.  I was in the United Kingdom talking to officials from Somerset County Council in a place called Cockermouth, a small village where some rather innovative flood defence barriers were installed.  In Cork, we are very proud of our river and the ability to gain access thereto from all parts of the city.  There is concern that raising the walls might limit this ability a little.  The people in Somerset have constructed a very innovative and effective response whereby the flood defences actually rise with the tide.  As the river rises, the flood defences, which comprise walls along the riverbanks, rise with it.</p> <p>They are 100% effective and while cost probably would be an issue with that one, in an ideal world it is the kind of defence-----</p></speech>

I was glad to hear Senator Landy pointing to the success of the Clonmel flood defences, which is extremely welcome and shows we are not completely at the mercy of the elements in all circumstances.  I do not wish to say too much more, except to note Senator Byrne's reference to some sort of announcement from the Government as to how to get the message out regarding the amber and red alert system.  He mentioned AA Roadwatch and I believe that is a suitable organisation to use for this purpose, because it has the networks and access to the local radio and television stations.  On a lighter note, even though there is a code red in Cork at present, I note that Bishop Colton, the Protestant Bishop of Cork, tweeted this morning his fear that he might be blown away in the wind.  Hopefully, Members will be assured that Bishop Colton will be all right.</p></speech>

I have called for this debate for some time and while I will not attempt to go over ground that has already been covered, the Minister of State last week visited Cork, west Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  Consequently, he has seen at first hand what has happened and I welcome the financial packages his Department and the Government are putting in place to try to alleviate the serious flooding.  I must also pay tribute to the resilience of the people as in some instances, places such as Skibbereen, Bandon, my home town of Bantry, and Clonakilty have been flooded several times.  In some of these towns, substantial progress is under way for a flood defence scheme, which is welcome and hopefully can happen sooner rather than later.  I wish the Minister of State due speed with those programmes.</p><p>I spoke some time ago by telephone to a friend about the storm that hit the south-west coast this morning, which probably has been the worst for 40 to 50 years.  As I speak, ESB lines, trees and telephone masts have come down.  I tried to call someone on his mobile telephone but after I eventually got through to him on a landline, he told me his telephone system has not been working today.  It demonstrates the tremendous red alert that people in the Cork-Kerry region have been obliged to face this morning.  People elsewhere in Ireland should be grateful they have not been hit by this tremendous storm, with gusts of up to 160 km/h, which is frightening.</p><p>While on my feet, I also wish to express my sympathies to the families of the two unfortunate Dutch nationals who were lost off my native Sheep's Head Peninsula.  Thankfully, one body has been recovered and hopefully the other will also be recovered.  However, in the context of these conditions, the tides and the Atlantic Ocean, I note from historical experience that a good friend of mine was lost at sea quite close to where I come from, on the same side of the Sheep's Head Peninsula, and his body was never recovered.  I wish the recovery operation well and thank all those involved who helped in the rescue, including the Irish Coast Guard and the local community.  It was necessary to call off the search because of the appalling weather in the area.</p><p>Without being parochial, I am somewhat concerned that my home town of Bantry has been left out of the loop as far as a flood relief plan is concerned.  Whereas the flooding over the past three or four years has not been as serious as it was in locations such as Bandon, Clonakilty or Skibbereen, I note that on four recent consecutive occasions with high tides, Bantry town was flooded and some properties were damaged.  My concern is the local authority and Office of Public Works, OPW, plan for the flood relief scheme for Bantry town is dependent on and related to the inner harbour development.  In other words, it is dependent on their ability to do some work on the inner harbour where the river enters the sea.</p><p>My concern is this may be an interdepartmental issue involving the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  He has passed over control of Bantry Harbour to Cork Port but leaving that issue aside - I do not intend to get into that debate today - I do not wish to see one entity pass the buck to the other because much of Bantry is low-lying and historically, the town has been flooded.  In one sense, I am being selfish because given the Minister of State's input to and knowledge of the flood situation, I would prefer him to remain in that Department but that is a matter beyond my control.  However, I urge the Minister of State to ascertain the current status of the Bantry flood relief scheme because over the course of my business life in Bantry comprising approximately 30 years, my old office has been flooded approximately once a year.  Sometimes it happens four times in one year and then one might have no incidents for five or six years.  I am not being selfish about this as there are many other hard-pressed ratepayers, shopkeepers and low-lying houses, as well as some apartments that are subject to flooding.  I hope the Minister of State can take up this issue.</p><p>The most important point I wish to make today concerns the question of insurance.  I have raised this matter numerous times in this Chamber and I believe I tabled notice of a motion two years ago.  In this day and age, it is completely out of the question that someone who gets flooded once, through no fault of his or her own, has the door shut completely against him or her in respect of getting flood relief insurance or house insurance that covers flooding.  Regardless of what the Minister of State must do, be it to legislate or to impose some sort of levy, I note this started a long time ago.  It is perhaps 20 to 25 years since the PMPA got into difficulties and a levy was imposed on every other road user who had motor insurance to pay for that debacle.  In the situations to which I refer, people who have found themselves flooded, as well as commercial businesses that are paying rates and all sorts of water charges, find themselves locked out.</p><p>The question I posed in this Chamber last week on the Order of Business concerns what will happen when the OPW's flood relief schemes are finished.  For example, the schemes in Fermoy, Mallow or Clonmel are well advanced and are almost complete.  Can some form of a guarantee be provided to enable people to approach the insurance companies?  People should be able to tell the insurers that as these schemes are complete, the travesty of a huge flood, which hopefully might be a 50 or 100-year event, is unlikely to happen.  They should be able to force insurance companies back on board without crucifying those property owners with private homes or businesses.  This is something that must be built in because going back to the Minister of State's predecessor in his present role, I acknowledge the amount of work that has been done on flooding by the Office of Public Works for the past eight or ten years.  It is an ongoing process but, unfortunately, there appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel from the perspective of different towns, as different scenarios develop.  The insurance issue will be of huge importance and it pertains to the peace of mind of ordinary people who can state they have been flooded previously with the loss of furniture, carpets and equipment.  It is a crazy situation.</p><p>I understand some money is being made available in respect of flood relief for coastal areas.  I do not ask the Minister of State to perform a Houdini-like trick and if one considers the coastline of Ireland in its entirety, it is a small island with thousands of kilometres of coastline and it will be impossible to defend every area.  However, my message would be to highlight those areas that are vulnerable and try to protect them.  The problem in my native region is that while we have plenty of mountains and peninsulas with rocks and cliffs, it is the safety of the people with which we are concerned.</p><p>I will conclude by making a point in respect of those who come to Ireland as visitors or people coming from Dublin or wherever to places such as west Cork or west Kerry to engage in hill walking or mountain walking.  One must send out a clear signal that in conditions like those which obtain at present, doing so is absolute madness.  I was involved in the Sheep's Head Way committee for years and last Saturday, when this terrible tragedy unfolded, was a day on which, as they say down in west Cork, one would not put a nasty bad dog outside the door.  It was an appalling day.  I appreciate that people who go there as visitors do not understand the gusts of wind that can be encountered when one goes on cliff walks.  However, I hope a message can be sent out that hill walking, cliff walking and mountain climbing are great pastimes but there are times when it should not be done.  I do not know how it can be prohibited, as opposed to sending out warnings, but it is most unfortunate because each year, there are incidents involving people being washed off rocks or off the Cliffs of Moher or down in County Kerry.  It appears to be recurring and an attempt must be made to deal with this because it is an appalling vista for any family to be obliged to face.</p></speech>

It was an extremely constructive meeting.  Moreover, the proposal made at that meeting about the setting up of a forum involving the Office of Public Works, Cork City Council officials and the business community is important.</p> <p>That is a point I continue to make.</p><p> What is missing from local authorities currently are ratepayers.  We do not have enough ratepayers on local authorities.  I was a member of Cork City Council for 12 years and I was one of two ratepayers out of 31 at any one time sitting on local authorities.  In Cork City Council, &euro;65 million is collected from ratepayers in Cork city, which is a huge amount of money.  I welcome, therefore, the consultative process the Minister has set up to ensure that those who are directly affected by the flooding are kept in the loop in terms of what is happening.</p><p> Businesses have been very badly affected in the city, and the situation is devastating.  One person who attended the meeting on Thursday night spent 22 years building up a business only to find suddenly that they have to go back to the drawing board to try to get it operating again.  It is frightening that people have to face into that.</p><p> I called to a number of premises in Cork city on Saturday including the <i>Evening Echo</i>office in Oliver Plunkett Street, which is a new office.  While they had put flood barriers outside the front door, they still found water coming in through the walls from neighbouring premises.  Regardless of the flood protection people put in place, unfortunately it does not always work because of the current structure.  That is something that must be taken into account when planning for the future.</p><p> Local authorities will have to examine this issue in regard to some form of rates rebate for premises and businesses, and businesses have come through tough times in the past four to five years, adversely affected.  If we consider the situation in Blackpool two years ago, there has been too much of a delay in dealing with that issue.  I found also that when businesses looked for a rebate on rates, there was no give by the local authority.  That was unfair and we must be conscious of that because as other speakers have highlighted, these people are employers and they are making sure their employees are looked after in good times and in bad times.  It is important that we do likewise in regard to ratepayers and local authorities taking that into account.  Some concession should be given.</p><p> As a ratepayer I am paying rates to Cork City Council on my own business, and substantial rates are being paid by businesses in Cork to the local authority.  I was talking to people recently who have one of the smallest ground floor units in North Main Street.  They are paying between &euro;9,000 and &euro;10,000 a year in rates.  I would imagine any business with a 1,000 sq. ft. ground floor premises on Oliver Plunkett Street or on Patrick Street is paying anything up to &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 per annum, which is a substantial amount of money.  They are paying, regardless of whether they are making profit.  It is important that issue is taken into account.</p><p> There is another issue we need to examine.  Following on the contribution by Senator Darragh O'Brien, and I have tabled a Private Members' motion this evening on this issue, which I raised previously, namely, a central fund between the insurance companies.  We have the Motor Insurance Bureau dealing with car accident cases where the car driver is not insured.  </p><p> It is interesting to look at the system in place in the United Kingdom.  The net cost in the UK, and we are talking about a far bigger number of insured premises, is ST&pound;10.68 per premises that is insured.  I am not saying we should start exposing businesses or householders to more expensive premiums but we must look at it with a view to putting in place some kind of a structure, perhaps even a central fund, with Government coming on board also to support that central fund in some way.  It has to be considered for premises damaged by flooding whose owners cannot get flood cover insurance.  It must be examined in some way.</p><p> Senator Barrett referred to the flooding of the River Shannon.  My own home place was affected when the Inniscarra dam was built.  My family lost land in that flooding but what was interesting about the people involved in the building of that dam was that they also built new roads.  The amazing aspect about the new road that was built is that it was built by French contractors and we have not seen one pothole on that road since the day it was built.  </p><p> We need to examine the question of getting international advice on flooding to see how other countries have dealt with it, particularly the Netherlands.  We should not be afraid to say we do not have all the answers.  We do not have all the answers, and we should not be afraid to look for international advice on this issue.  It is interesting we did that when we were building the hydroelectric stations.  We did it in regard to building of roads attached to that, and they did a superb job.  This is not a criticism of any contractor that has built roads since, but I am talking about coming up with fresh ideas on how we deal with issues, and we should do that in this context as well.  We should not be afraid to ask for that advice.</p></speech>

Fortunately, those of us in Leitrim escaped the worst excesses of the flooding on this occasion, although in previous years Carrick-on-Shannon had been isolated to some degree, particularly on the relief road, because of its close proximity to the Shannon, although as the Minister already knows, further down the Shannon and around Athlone in particular there is a great deal of flooding.</p><p>I reiterate what has been said by all of us on this side of the House, namely, that we in Fianna F&aacute;il fully support the Government's measures and proposals in addressing this national crisis.  However, we believe there should be more adequate information transfers between the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the insurance industry to help homeowners access home insurance after flood defences have been rectified.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is also looking at fresh legislation to help uninsured people based on measures in the UK, which I will deal with shortly.  The impact of the weather also underlines the need for an enhanced task force and emergency planning to take the lead in setting out our preparation for storms and a rapid response.</p><p>Much of the emphasis has been on the south, the west and the south east, and rightly so, specifically with regard to Cork.  I read in the newspapers last week that one of the reasons Cork is susceptible to frequent flooding is because the location of the city is like a saucer.  Senator Landy made a similar reference in regard to Tipperary, namely, that once the water tips over into the saucer, it cannot get out.</p></speech>

It is essential that our second city should be spared the worst excesses of flooding in the future and I suggest that whatever resources are available should be prioritised in regard to Cork city.  Works carried out here in Dublin on the Dodder and the Tolka have gone a long way to alleviating the problems that arose.</p><p>Regarding the situation in the UK, I am sure the Minister of State is fully aware that they previously used a statement of principles, a voluntary agreement with insurers that informed insurance policy towards at-risk properties.  However, this has now been replaced with a water Bill currently before the Houses of Parliament.  Included in the Bill is Flood Re, the new policy.  Last year the Association of British Insurers, ABI, and the Government agreed a memorandum of understanding on how to develop the model of Flood Re.  The not-for-profit scheme has been built to ensure flood insurance remains widely affordable and available.  It will be run and financed by insurers as a not-for-profit fund that will cover the cost of flood claims from high risk homes.  Insurers will pass the flood risk element from those households deemed at high risk of flooding to the fund.  This equates to a levy of ST&pound;10.50 in annual household premiums and represents the estimated level of cross-subsidy that already exists between lower and higher flood risk premiums.  Flood Re will be designed to fully deal with at least 99.5% of years.  It is a point that has been made.  I am sure the Government is examining some similar legislation in this regard in its dealings with the insurance industry.</p><p>On the EU solidarity fund, I share the views expressed by various people that there is a need to review that fund.  I wish the Minister well in his own aspirations towards a seat in the European Parliament, after our own Fianna F&aacute;il candidate has been elected.</p> <p>I wish him well.  In 2009 the Irish Government secured &euro;13 million under the EU solidarity fund.  The fund was set up in 2002 to respond to natural disasters and has been used to deal with the effects of 59 disasters, including storm damage and flooding.  In light of all that has happened in recent years, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the fund needs to be reappraised. +</p><p>I commend the Department of Social Protection on the important role it is playing to assist households.  The community welfare service's emergency clinics are providing assistance to those who live in the worst affected areas.  A number of stages are followed by the Department in its response to emergency events.  The first stage is to provide emergency income support and payments for food, clothing and personal items in the immediate aftermath of an event.  Stage two involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture and other essential household items.  Stage three involves identifying the longer term financial supports or works required.  I welcome the initiatives by the Department because they are helping to alleviate the difficulties faced by some householders after their horrific experiences.</p><p>The total expenditure under the humanitarian assistance scheme approved by the Government in 2009 was &euro;2.2 million by the end of last year, in respect of approximately 3,500 payments.  Does the Government intend to increase the fund given that the amounts paid out seem small relative to the overall fund?  Last year five households were paid a total of &euro;51,450 for refurbishments.  I wonder whether that ratio should be improved.  I welcome that an initial sum of &euro;15 million has been approved in line with recent Government commitments to provide adequate resources.</p></speech>

I note these funds are intended to cover damage incurred prior to 6 January.  Local authorities and the Government are to be commended on the speed with which they have responded to the storms and the emergency services have done Trojan work on the ground over the last several months.</p><p>  The storms which ravaged the west of Ireland prior to 6 January caused damage estimated at &euro;19 million in Galway county and &euro;1.2 million in the city.  This figure has certainly increased in the aftermath of the more recent storms.  Even today, there are reports that the winds hitting the south and south west are the strongest in living memory.  I am sure many people are living in fear along the west coast. </p><p>  Last weekend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food travelled to Galway.  I accompanied him to Spiddal, where the promenade has been destroyed, as well as many other parts of the Connemara coastline.  The areas that were damaged along the coastline of Galway city include Silver Strand, Blackrock to Southpark and Claddagh, Ballyloughan Beach and the Spanish Arch.  The proposed extension of the promenade in Salthill to Silver Strand will be a critical tourist amenity for Galway city.  Thousands of people walk along the promenade every week.  The damage to the area between Silver Strand and Salthill promenade is estimated at &euro;400,000.  Galwegians have for years been calling for this coastline to be protected with buttresses and rock armour at the Knocknagoneen Drumlin, which has undergone significant erosion.  The Aran Islands and Inishbofin off the west coast of Galway have also suffered severely from the storms.  For the sake of tourism and the wild Atlantic way, it is important these areas are supported.</p><p>  In regard to future proofing our coastline, Dr. Kieran Hickey of NUIG's school of geography has recently stated that the entire promenade in Salthill, which acted as a natural coastal defence for decades, should be raised 0.5 m because of climate change and the associated higher water levels.  Those who are familiar with Salthill will realise what a huge undertaking that would be.  As an island nation, we have a long history of flooding but we have always responded in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, whereby we fixed the immediate problem and moved on.  In these days of climate change, such an approach will no longer suffice.</p><p>  Will the Government consider establishing a body with the relevant expertise to gather the various reports on climate change and analyse its potential impact on our coastline and waterways in order to develop a long-term programme for flood defence?  The Government's national climate change strategy notes that the OPW is pursuing a number of research programmes and has produced regional coastal hazard maps, and a plethora of other bodies are also involved in planning and research.  Notwithstanding the current constraints on the Exchequer, a long-term strategy needs to be put in place whereby one body is charged with mapping future changes and making recommendations to the Government instead of a multitude of agencies reporting at various times and by various means.</p><p>  How does the OPW propose to deal with damage to critical local infrastructure that is not directly in the control of local authorities or in public ownership, for example, access routes to beaches, burial grounds or residential areas?</p></speech>

Schools in the region should not have remained open given that a code red alert had been issued.  In Shannon the schools have closed and children have been sent home.  Their parents have had to collect them.  In one area a row of mature poplars was ripped out of the ground.</p><p>A single Department needs to be made responsible for making decisions on funding applications and, if they have to be moved to other Departments to get funding, that is the way it should be.  I ask the Minister of State to explain how councils and other groups around the country can access funding.  I had a discussion with my local mayor on how funding can be accessed.  I do not think the Government can provide enough funding to solve all the problems but it will have to deal with the major ones.  We cannot deal with many of the problems until the storms are gone.  Limerick has flooded again today and I am sure the entire west coast is getting walloped.  Roads that had been cleared of water are now flooded again.  If the works had already been done, they might have been swept away.  People will have to be patient.  The danger to life should be our first concern, domestic residents come second, industry comes third and farmland comes last.  All of us are getting calls from our colleagues in the county councils.  We will have to develop a long-term solution for our coastal areas, even if that means we must suffer through another winter.</p><p>I saw water coming over the wall at the lagoon beside Shannon Airport.  I have lived in the area for 35 years but I never saw water coming within 3 ft. of that wall, let alone come over the top.  </p> <p>That tells us where we are.  Shannon is 6 ft. below sea level and we have 15 pumps going all day everyday all year round.  The areas need to be protected and if there is a breach in the banks of the Shannon, the whole town gets flooded rather than just one area.  It is all 4 ft., 5 ft. or 6 ft. below sea level.  I have seen the estimates coming in from the councils.  I do not know how they come up with the estimates they submit.  We must get clear costings on what the projects cost and start with the major ones we can deal with now.  Flood barriers in Limerick are an absolute priority because there is a danger to people in their homes.  The situation in Cork is the same.  We can deal with those first and deal with other cases afterwards.  People must be patient.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State can outline the approach and who should make the call when there is a code red alert.  If UCC students have been told to stay in the building because of flying debris and parents must pick up children sent home from schools, there is a danger to life.  There must be a decision taken to close the schools in those areas.  I rang my son a while ago for a damage report on our house, our area and our business and he thinks the winds are 130 mph or 140 mph.  He has never seen anything like it.  The trees were at a 45 degree angle for two or three hours.  I do not know what the wind speed was but it is pretty serious.</p></speech>

While we are talking, many of our emergency personnel are out there fighting this and helping people.  Everyone owes them a debt of gratitude for the work they are doing.  I will deal as best I can with the points made.</p><p>  Senator Thomas Byrne spoke about what happens when an emergency develops.  If it is a transport emergency, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport leads, if it is a weather emergency, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government leads, and if it is a flood defence emergency, the Office of Public Works, OPW, leads.  I attended the first emergency co-ordination meeting in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine where there is a specialised unit set up to deal with this situation.  It is good to see everyone represented around the table, including Met &Eacute;ireann, the HSE and the ESB, and reporting in.  The system has been in place for a number of years and it is working.</p><p>  The website established by the OPW called <i>waterlevels.ie</i> has a lot of information.  It shows the height of the river closest to any point in the country.  It is real-time information and people can see what is going on.  I will report back to the House on the protocol for schools and whether the decision is taken centrally or by each board of management.  The new Met &Eacute;ireann system of codifying upcoming weather events is penetrating through to people about the serious nature of such events.  In circumstances where there is a code red, a fair point has been made by many colleagues on whether schools in the area should close automatically.  Is the decision taken by the Minister for Education and Skills or is it taken locally?  We need clarity on that matter and I will report back to the House.</p><p>  Senators Conway, Naughton and Mulcahy referred to having one Minister in charge.  We set out &euro;70 million in additional funds that can be drawn down by local authorities.  There are existing schemes and this year I have &euro;45 million to spend in the OPW on flood defences.  Some &euro;3.5 million is set aside for the minor works scheme, involving projects of up to &euro;500,000.  I will be inundated with applications in the coming weeks and by April my &euro;3.5 million will be spent.  I was present at the Cabinet discussion on this point yesterday.  Through a Supplementary Estimate, I will have additional funds for drawdown.  We are working through the existing Departments.  Local authorities submit applications and we will provide funding to local authorities.  When our funds dry up, we will return to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at some point in April, May or June and seek Supplementary Estimates to be approved by both Houses to get more money.  Our task is to give the money to the local authority, which procures workers and contractors to get the work done.  That is the approach.  We have not taken the approach of having one lead Department because we already have schemes.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport made an announcement two weeks ago that &euro;350 million is now available to local authorities.  It is up to them to spend the money.  Let them spend the money and come back later for additional moneys.  The system we put in place is to use the existing schemes rather than introducing new bureaucracy.  The existing schemes have a means through which local authorities can be given funds.</p><p>  Senator Barrett made interesting points about flood maps.  There has been a sea change in attitude and I apologise for using the dreadful pun.  When we present maps to a local authority now, the light switch immediately goes on.  If there is talk of a planning application on these plains, it is removed.  There has been a major change and the local authorities have greater regard for flood maps than was the case some years ago.</p><p>  I agree with Senator Barrett that it is intolerable that Cork, the second-largest city and conurbation in the State, should be at risk of flooding every time there is a major weather event.  We must deal with this, which is why I made the announcement last Thursday on behalf of the Government that in July we will have a preferred solution.  There is a lack of understanding in the public debate.  Getting to a solution is a major event and takes many years.  We must hydrologically model the solution.  In the case of Cork, there is a tidal problem and a fluvial problem of significant rainfall amounts.  I have heard people suggest a tidal barrier but that would flood Cork because-----</p></speech>

There must be a hydrometric solution, which is complicated.  In July we will have a preferred solution and it will take a year or a year and a half to get detailed designs in place, including consultation and dealing with the question of who owns the land and whether it must be acquired.  Senator John Gilroy referred to the 12 km of quay walls that must be built.</p><p>When we get to the point of moving on a major capital investment, we need stakeholder involvement.  There is no point in the local authority not having done the homework in getting people onside in saying to the business community that it is not rocket science and that we must build walls, embankments and pumping stations.  It is horrible work and the city will be knocked out for two or three years while we do this work.  The big gain with the capital infrastructure is that there will be certainty about flooding events, as we have seen in other parts of the country.</p><p>Stakeholder involvement is crucial.  In order for us to get going on the Cork scheme, which will be the largest flood defence scheme in the history of the country and involving somewhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million, at the tail end of next year all other timelines must be clear.  The crucial engagement is with stakeholders to get them on board, to see what we are proposing, to comment on it and to support it.  Otherwise, we will lose time and we will not be able to get construction going.  I fully agree with colleagues about Cork, which is crucial.</p><p>Senator Barrett also referred to the turloughs in south Galway, which is the most complicated area of the country for engineers.  Rainfall takes place and the water stays and there is no way we can get it out via turloughs into the sea.  We have had to relocate over 20 families, through the Department of Social Protection, in that area of south Galway because, over the long term, it is cheaper to do so and flood the area then to provide a defence solution.  That is part of the mix.  It is very emotional for people to hear that they must be relocated because there is no solution.  In some parts of the country, there is no solution or the solution costs such an astronomical sum as to be not justifiable in a cost benefit analysis.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy spoke about Limerick and whether this was a freak situation.  It was the first question I asked about Limerick and I was told it was a one in 200 year event.  What happened in the Shannon Estuary is that we knew there was a 7 in surge on top of the tide on Saturday morning.</p> <p>However, we did not have a forecasting system, which would have helped to predict the impact of a 7 in surge in the estuary on homes and businesses in the city. We need to get to that point.  An interesting aspect of the Cork engineering solution is that once we get to that point, we can predict with a much greater degree of accuracy the impact of such events on housing and on commercial areas of the city.  Senator Landy rightly asked if it was a freak incident, but I cannot answer that question.</p><p>Central government will fund 90% of the cost of the scheme and the local authorities will fund the remaining 10%.  If problems arise this year in this context, we will look at it again.  I have seen cases in which we have given funds to local authorities but they have not been drawn down.</p></speech>

We need to get the local contractors working on the plan.  Most of the work will be done by the private sector, notwithstanding the fact that the OPW and local authority staff are doing really important work.</p><p>I agree with the point about insurance companies cherry-picking those whom they will insure.  We need to have a debate on flooding to deal with this specific issue.</p><p>I will meet, at Senator Kelly's request, a gentleman who has come up with a solution to the problem, and we will certainly look at what he is suggesting.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned an insurance levy.  As the Senator will know, the previous Government looked at this issue, and it was reported to the Government in 2010 that a levy was not the solution at that stage.  We announced that we would consider that again in the next four to six weeks.  At present, insurance companies have declined insurance cover to those in areas that have flooded.  That is the current situation for many of the businesses that I visited in Cork last week.  It is intolerable.  A State indemnification scheme would be a major undertaking.  We would have to consider the extent of the funding involved and who would make a contribution to the fund.  My understanding is that from EUROSTAT's perspective this potential liability would go onto the State's debt.  That would have significant economic repercussions, were we to take that route.  The preferred solution would be to have an element of State indemnification, which would give support to everybody.  The present situation is that people have no recourse and no solution.  We must find the middle ground.  I am open to considering the levy proposal or a contribution.  Interestingly, in the case of the UK, as mentioned by my good colleague Senator Mooney, the insurance companies are breaking with Government and are getting out of it now because 95% of the cost to the insurance industry has been borne in the past two years because of the severity of weather conditions in the south of England.  We need to deal with the issue in accordance with our ability.  We cannot pretend there is a quick-fix solution.</p><p>I do not disagree with the Senator about SACs.  I think Europe is being blamed rather than our over-zealous application locally, which is the cause of the problem more so than the actual SACs.  In Portrane, an attempt to improve the growth of marram grass in the dunes is being examined with the aim of creating a better barrier.  Those involved can apply under the minor works scheme, and I expect to receive an application shortly.  I give Senator O'Brien a commitment that I will turn it around, as the sums involved are not significant.  I am aware that Fingal County Council will make an application shortly to the Department, and we will turn it around if it will give us a cost benefit.</p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy, among others, called on the public to keep away from the coastline.  Senator Cullinane raised the issue of applications for minor works.  I hope I have explained that the total cost of minor work carried out by the local authorities comes to &euro;19 million, whereas I have only &euro;3.5 million to spend.  I presume I will have that money spent by the end of March.  I then return to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and put the case for a supplementary estimate, and we will extend it again.  The best way to proceed is by using the local authority minor works scheme.</p><p>The estimated cost of the damage is in the region of &euro;60 million to &euro;70 million currently, notwithstanding what happens today.  The GNI threshold for the EU Solidarity Fund is &euro;770 million for the country.  The damage caused by the weather would need to be worth &euro;770 million and one would need to prove to the Solidarity Fund that a part of the national wealth or GDP had been knocked out as a result of this disaster to be able to get a significant drawdown.  We are looking at whether we can apply on a regional basis, where the thresholds are slightly less, but it is not looking particularly strong at present.  If we were to succeed in drawing down funds from this account, I understand we would be talking about &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  Virtually all the resources will come from the insurance industry or our own national resources.</p><p>I hope I have answered Senator Gilroy, who also spoke about Cork defences.</p></speech>

It is complicated by the harbour issue.  I wish to be fair to the other towns in Senator O'Donovan's constituency.  Last week I was in some of the larger towns in south west Cork.  Works will happen this year in Skibbereen and Bandon, and the following year in Clonakilty.  Those communities have been hit.</p><p>I agree with Senator Colm Burke on the involvement of stakeholders.  Local authorities should look at relief on rates for businesses in areas hit by the weather.  We look for international advice.  Many of the CFRAM contracts involve international engineers who are working with us.  We need to learn from best international advice.  I fully agree with him and we are very conscious of the need to learn from others.  Fresh ideas are crucial in this regard.</p><p>Senator Mooney raised the question of humanitarian aid.  The reason such a small amount has been drawn down, as he rightly points out, was that extensive flooding was quite localised.  I have spoken to the Minister for Social Protection and I know there will be a much more significant drawdown.  Apparently, the income threshold is &euro;70,000 per house.  The people affected have to replace floors and white goods, and if they have no insurance, we will have to help in the structural improvement of the houses.  The local authorities and the OPW have a role in advising the Department of Social Protection about what is being proposed when people have no insurance cover.  I expect significant sums will be drawn down from the &euro;10 million.  Senator Naughton spoke about one body being responsible.  The OPW is the body dealing with CFRAM, which will give us the strategic view and the long-term solution.  Once we have the CFRAM maps in place this year and provide the solutions to the European Commission by December 2015, we will be in a good position to plan for the future.</p><p>I hope I have answered Senator Mulcahy's point about one Minister.  The reason we have chosen to use the existing schemes is that these schemes exist across four or five Departments and there is no point in creating a new bureaucracy.  My message to local authorities and my colleagues who are working with local authorities is to get the applications into the OPW as soon as possible so that the OPW can turn them around and put them in fund to get the repair work done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200028#CC00300"><p>I move:<blockquote><br />&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann requests the Government to outline in detail its proposals and estimated time line for radical reform of the Irish political system including reform of Oireachtas procedures, D&aacute;il reform, full proposals for reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, reform of the nomination procedures for the Presidency and reform of the financing of political parties.&rdquo;</blockquote>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is not, however, an effusive welcome.  The motion that I and my Independent colleagues have put down about political reform is not intended to be definitive or exhaustive but is part of a process.  I suggest that we continue to have these debates on an all-party basis once a month, as we did, at my suggestion, during the Iraq war when we monitored the progress under the aegis of the then Leader of the Seanad, Ms Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  That would help us.  We should also keep the public informed, through press statements, of what is being said here and what ideas are being explored.</p><p>  Is the Government serious about reform?  I do not think so.  I do not believe it for a minute.  I do not think any Government ever has been.  I have been in this House for the guts of 30 years and have sat on many of the groups that considered reform of the Seanad.  I have tabled the results of those all-party agreed motions and they have been voted down by the very people who agreed to them.  That does not suggest any great seriousness.  I recognise that it is a great deal to ask of any Government or any political party to yield power because any real democratic reform, of the nature of which the Government has been speaking recently, entails a yielding of power and a yielding to a new democratic structure.  This Government promised the people of Ireland radical, democratic political reform and so far it has totally failed to deliver on this.</p><p>  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18 January 2014:<blockquote>Taoiseach Enda Kenny went to the Upper House last October &ldquo;to listen to ideas on reform&rdquo;.  On the basis of Government briefings since then, however, it would appear that minimal change is envisaged.  Such an approach gives politics a bad name.  People would welcome effective reform.</blockquote>That is what I believe as well.  I do not believe for one second that people are suffering from referendum fatigue.  That is rubbish.  That is more dishonesty.  They are suffering from rubbish fatigue, from being presented with dishonest, irrelevant referenda.  People demanded throughout that campaign that they be given the opportunity to vote for reform of the Seanad and the Taoiseach resolutely refused to allow that.  That is what they wanted.  If the Government gives it to them they will welcome it.  They would think it is a great thing to have a real, radical reform.  It should be all or nothing.  Tinkering with the university seats is a total and absolute farce.</p><p>  There is an awful lot of farce about this.  During the referendum there was a wonderful situation where we knew the Government and other agencies were deliberately telling lies.  It was perfectly obvious.  Even their spokespeople on radio were forced into admitting it but they would not take down the posters.  I asked about the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and the Referendum Commission.  They were impotent to prevent lies being told to gull the Irish people out of their democratic rights.  Why do we not consider as part of our political reform, abolishing the Referendum Commission and SIPO and putting something that will actually work in place instead?  With regard to SIPO and so on we all have to sign myriad forms saying we did not get money from here, there and everywhere else.  We have to clock in as if we were working in Cadbury&rsquo;s Chocolates.  It is all utter rubbish.  It deceives nobody.  There is paring away with little cuts.  The Irish people do not give a damn.  If we got up naked on the roof here, gave away all our possessions and jumped they would not give a toss.  They are not impressed and neither am I.  It is nitpicking and the dishonest people will get away with it. </p> <p>Since SIPO was introduced, they continue to get away with it, including in this House.  It is only inconveniencing the people who do the work.</p><p>I will tell the House something else that would make things a little more democratic; if the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle were elected by secret ballot of both Houses, they would then be clearly seen to be independent.  That would be very refreshing.  I am old enough to have been in the House when every single named officer failed to be elected to anything and they were all nominated by the Government.  One of them had failed to be elected to the Seanad.  Let us have a little democracy if the Government is serious about it, but I do not believe that is the case for one minute.</p><p>This business of vouching expenses, what a tedious piece of nonsense.  We should get rid of the whole bloody lot.  They are not worth a damn anyway and I am doing it this year.  I am already well over what I sought, but it is not my job to act as an accountant for the State.  It is also not the job of my wonderful parliamentary assistant to do it.  We should not waste time on this penny-pinching theme; we should get an international person or body to give us a reading on what is the rate for the job.  What I want is the rate for the job.</p><p>With regard to the role of Independents, we have a more onerous role because, unlike people who are in parties, either Government or Opposition, we do not spread the load; we each speak on everything.  Perhaps that is irritating for our colleagues, but we do and we have to have a range of expertise on everything.  That also should be recognised.</p><p>We are in the Stone Age in terms of the facilities and assistance we receive compared to other parliaments.  I was in Australia 20 years ago and we still have not caught up with anything like the facilities and services they had available.  What about, for example, giving us some assistance with parliamentary draftsmanship?  Did that ever strike anyone?  This is supposed to be a legislative House, yet we have no assistance.  I put a Bill together and it took me two years to do so.  I know of other colleagues who have put Bills together and they have had legal help, but it is very difficult work.  If the Government wants us to work as we are supposed to do under the Constitution and if we do not want to be just a collection of hypocrites, we must be given the tools to do the job.  The Government has not done this and I do not believe it ever will.  Members, in particular Independent Members, should be given access to draftspersons.</p><p>I have only a few points to make on the D&aacute;il because it is up to its Members to consider their own issues.  From the outside, I find it deeply shocking that Ministers evade questions all the time.  They just refuse to answer them.  They do not give proper or adequate answers.  I well remember when the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, gave the smart-alecky reply in the other House that the right question had not been asked.  That is not showing respect for Parliament.  The Ceann Comhairle should have the right to reprimand and rebuke a Minister or even the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, one cannot torture or force them into it.  One cannot put them on the rack and squeeze the truth out of them, but at least one can embarrass and shame them and that is what should happen.</p><p>I have said the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach should be elected by secret ballot.  The same is true of the Chairmen of committees.  The positions are shared out on the basis of how many members a party has.  It has nothing to do with their qualifications or interests; it is a perk.  That does not get us the best people by any means.  </p><p>This rubbish about Friday sittings, it is like Joe Duffy&rsquo;s Fridays - it is a load of nonsense.  The D&aacute;il shoves Bills through to get them out of the way, but they are never allowed to pass; nothing ever happens - it is all balls.  Why does the D&aacute;il not get rid of them or make them effective?  It should do one or the other, but let us not have this charade.</p><p>At the meeting we had the Taoiseach suggested we might look at Standing Orders.  I would love to do that, for example, look at rulings from the Chair which are complete nonsense most of the time.  They come from the Government; they do not come from the Cathaoirleach.  I remember asking in 1991 that something be considered as a matter of urgency under section 29, but it was ruled out of order, while the former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, was simultaneously declaring a national emergency in the other House.  That is just one example.  I draw attention to the fact that during a Seanad debate 79 amendments were ruled out of order, all except one, which was disposed of quickly, and that was only discussed for the sake of image.  The Chair should be required to give a reason for rulings.  Why should we be bullied in this way?  It is insufficient to say, &ldquo;That is my ruling.&rdquo;  We are not children, for God&rsquo;s sake.  We are experienced parliamentarians and should be treated as such.  It is rubbish to refer to creating a charge on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We should have stood by our record and said what a proud record we had.  We have a proud record, despite the hindrance every Government has been to us.  To date, four Bills have been passed by the House, three of which were initiated in the House and one was a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  They are a mixed bag.  I was accused in <i>The Irish Times </i>of reneging on a commitment to the so-called Quinn-Zappone Bill.  I only saw that Bill on the day I came into the House.  There are things in it with which I do not agree at all.  If anyone thinks I will queue up to work for half the price, he or she has another thing coming.  If anyone thinks I will work for nothing, he or she can hump off.  It is bloody easy for people who float in here, who were nominated without an election and with no expense and they receive &euro;60,000 or whatever it is we get.  They would like to take away half of mine, but I will take half of their&rsquo;s, thank you very much.</p></speech>

I remember the first time he came to the House.  We were talking about the Central Statistics Office and he praised its independence and professionalism, two good yardsticks.  We will try to apply some of these criteria in this debate.</p><p>The Minister of State is sitting beside a reformer.  As the counter-motion shows, the Leader has reformed the Seanad.  We have had Nobel Prize winners, representatives of the Orange Order and every single MEP to link with our activities in the European Union.  Some reform does take place, even if it is not often that people give the House the credit it deserves.  It is capable of reforming itself and it is in capable hands in that regard.</p><p>The problem we faced in 2008 was that the country was bankrupt.  The banks needed serious reform.  One could ask whether the Seanad responded to this.  We did.  Bills Nos. 19, 21 and 24 were on the Order Paper for precisely that reason.  We need much stricter rules on banking, as I fear we will get into trouble again.</p> <p>Let us go back to 2.5 times the main income or 80% of the value of the property as the maximum loan.  Governor Honohan has been before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and expressed his fear that he still does not have adequate powers to deal with reckless banking.  If that is still the case, it is an urgent area for reform because banking was one of the four sectors which bankrupted this country and created the political crisis that we are all here to solve.  The activities of the property sector were allied to that and one must ask if we are still giving too many tax breaks to that sector.  The crisis also has its roots in the activities of accountants, who prepared books for the banks which we ended up buying, at a cost of &euro;64 billion.  We will not know until after certain court cases are concluded if we now have proper regulation of that area of financial services.  We have already debated with various Ministers the adequacy of our current arrangements for policing the accountancy profession.  We also had failures in public administration.  There were banking regulators who, in the main, moved from the Department of Finance into the Central Bank and, as we know now, did not regulate the banks.  Indeed, the whole system came unstuck.  Those four areas, therefore, need urgent reform.  We need to have stricter regulation of banks, the property sector, accountants and financial service providers.  We also need to reform the system under which the Department of Finance and the Central Bank regulate the banks and I am not convinced that we are nearly there on that.  In fact, we have had discussions on various Bills but we seem to be leaving much of this up to Europe, which may not work to our advantage.  Those are the sectors that got us into so much trouble and we must address them.</p><p>I wish to praise the Leader for the reforms he has brought about already.  With reference to the Constitutional Convention, I am not so sure that our Constitution had much to do with the collapse of the country in 2008.  I am also not sure that reducing the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il is appropriate because I believe we face a democratic deficit.  The legislation dealing with political donations is welcome.  Local government still remains heavily dominated by the county managers and we have not reformed that aspect of it very much.  Many of the county managers act like semi-dictators in their own jurisdictions.  We must wait and see the results of expanding the functions of the Ombudsman but there is a list of exempted organisations at the back of the Bill.  Those organisations lobbied successfully to be exempt from the attentions of the Ombudsman which is not satisfactory.  It remains to be seen whether the whistleblower legislation will be effective.  The effectiveness of Oireachtas committees is diminished by the fact that meetings often clash with important meetings of this House which we must attend.  We must wait and see how the reforms that have been implemented to date will work.  We need legislation on lobbying urgently and it is a great pity that it has been delayed.  </p><p>Looking back to the most recent consultation with the electorate with regard to the future of this House, I wish to say a few words as a member of the winning side.  The five independent university Senators took the line against five political parties: Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, People before Profit and the United Left Alliance.  What did we find?  First, young people voted overwhelmingly with us.  They are disillusioned with the way political parties operate in this country.  We won all of the student debates and told students to go home and tell their parents, grandparents and so forth to vote &quot;No&quot;.  Those who are interested in reform should reach out to young people much more than they have done heretofore.  The Dublin working class gave a massive vote to us.  In constituencies where not a single Deputy was in favour of the retention of this House we got between 68% and 70% of the vote.  Again, reform must address why working class people, particularly in Dublin, have become alienated from the political process.  The other issue I discovered among my electorate in Northern Ireland was that they were furious that they were being deprived of a vote for the Oireachtas.  Many of those in the two university constituencies had no vote in the referendum.  </p></speech>

Exactly 100 years ago on Friday, Edward Carson said to John Redmond in the House of Commons that Redmond was never interested in Unionists but was depriving them of their political rights.  That was what was attempted during the recent referendum.  We must also ask why some sectors have not been addressed at all in terms of reform.  We must also ask how the Government managed to alienate so many young people, working class people and so many people in Northern Ireland.  Let us address those together rather than the losing side deciding that it does not want five Independent university Senators anymore.</p></speech>

This Government will continue to introduce political reform which will improve our political system by making it more effective, efficient and economical.  In answer to the main question posed by Senator Norris at the beginning of this debate, I believe that contrary to his doubts, this Government is serious about reform.  Since the foundation of the State in 1922, no political reform of this degree has been embarked upon by any Government.  It is time that we started to use Oireachtas committees, local authorities, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il to their full political potential.  Since this Government came into office in 2011, six referendums have been held, including one on children's rights which had been promised for years.  The Constitutional Convention has been a huge success.  It has been a platform for ideas and political debate.  I welcome the participation of citizens debating issues with politicians as it brings them right to the heart of policy making.</p><p>The Government has not only reformed at national level but also at local level.  The Bill to abolish 80 town councils and to merge six county councils represents the most substantial reform of local government in over 100 years.  The Government is also addressing the imbalance of power between councillors and county managers.  D&aacute;il reform has been a major element of this Government's policies.  So far, the Government has reformed many aspects of the D&aacute;il and over the coming months, more vital reforms will be introduced.  The D&aacute;il now starts earlier in the morning to ensure adequate time for legislative debates.  The T&aacute;naiste now takes Leader's Questions on Thursday which is another positive reform.  Compared to previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have sat 74 more days in their first two and a half years in office.  The Topical Issues debate is a new and welcome framework for raising matters of importance.  I also welcome the new format under which Deputies can bring a Bill before the House.  Since this reform was introduced, there has been an increase in the number of Private Member's Bills brought before the House, from 14 in 2010 to 58 in 2013.  I welcome reform of the D&aacute;il as it is assuring the people that this Government is fully focused on working hard to restore their faith in the Irish political system.</p><p>There have been many Oireachtas committee reforms since the Government came into office in 2011 and involving the public in law making is one of the most important changes.  The pre-legislative stage, which was introduced in 2011 and extended in 2013 will allow for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law making.  This gives the public a voice when it comes to policy making.  The post-legislative stage involves a Minister reporting to the relevant Oireachtas select committee, within 12 months of enactment, on the functioning of the relevant Act.  This will allow committees to consult with civil society groups and individuals with expertise in the relevant area. </p> <p>More recently, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Government Chief Whip, who is present, announced a second phase of D&aacute;il and Oireachtas committees.  I welcome these positive reforms also.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of political reform in all areas of the Irish political system and I have no doubt the Government will implement reform effectively and efficiently.  Now that the Irish people have spoken to preserve the Seanad, reform is the next stage to ensure that this House can be used to its full political potential.  The Members are well aware of the many improvements the House has made under the Leader since the Government took office and, please God, there will be more.</p></speech>

This debate will afford him an opportunity to hear the collective wisdom of the House on both the motion and the amendment.</p><p>There is a historical context to all this talk about reform.  The worldwide economic crash in 2007 and 2008 coupled with the erosion of trust in State institutions and the abuse scandals in the church shook the Irish people's faith in institutions in general.  There was a sea change in attitude about the political establishment from that time and I am the first to concede that the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration, under former Deputy Brian Cowen,  from 2008 to 2011 did not focus at all on political reform.  The reason is that it was in fire brigade mode.  It spent the entire period trying to save the country.  One can argue about what happened before that, but the reality is that the beginnings of what we hope is the end of this economic nightmare came from the initiatives taken by that Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 2008 and later which, of course, cost us electorally.  While this Government boasts about its reform record, all political parties realised that there had to be change.  The Government is holding the ball so, of course, it will initiate its reform proposals, and I broadly welcome them.</p><p>However, when one looks at the body of reform, ultimately power still resides in the Executive.  That is the case even with the reform proposals put forward within this House.  Incidentally, I do not agree with everything in the Fianna F&aacute;il reform paper either, but it is in keeping with the party leader's view, which, although he might not like to be reminded of it-----</p></speech>

In the 2011 general election, having been elected party leader, one of his first commitments was the abolition of the Seanad.  However, there was a caveat, because it was in the context of overall parliamentary reform.  He did not agree that the Seanad alone should be taken out of the equation, but that there should be overall political reform.  Of course, he was a little like St. Paul on the road to Damascus subsequently, helped along by those of us around the country who had a different view.</p></speech>

I appreciate that I only have six minutes so I do not wish to waste much time on that, but I was anxious to outline the historical context.</p><p>Very progressive reforms have been brought forward by the Leader of the House, as outlined in the amendment, but ultimately power still resides in the Executive.  In the reform proposals for this House, even from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, there is retention of the Taoiseach's nominations, which ensures there is a continuing inbuilt majority for the Government of the day.  Therein lies the complexity of attempting to change the role of the Seanad.  It is generally accepted that one cannot have a Seanad that is competing with the other House.  It would not work and would be unconstitutional.  One must therefore try to frame something that will allow the Seanad to expand within the existing constitutional constraints while at the same time not being seen to be in competition with the other House.  The Leader of the House has been attempting to do that.</p><p>I recall it being said by the former President, Mary Robinson, during her election campaign that she would stretch the constitutional constraints of the presidency to its limits - I am paraphrasing her words.  Her successor, Mary McAleese, did the same and President Higgins is doing it now.  They stretched it to its absolute constitutional limits, far more than their predecessors did.  We in these Houses are now doing much more than previous Houses did, so I continue to applaud the initiatives being taken by the Leader of the House.  I believe he should look to the European dimension to a greater extent and how we could play a more useful role in that regard, given that over 80% of our laws come from Europe.  I appreciate that the committees are conducting a certain amount of scrutiny in that context, but I believe we have a role.</p><p>With regard to the committees, I believe another political sea change is taking place before our eyes.  It is not only the changing nature of the committee system in the Oireachtas, and they are joint committees, but their increasing relevance and influence, to the point where the Committee of Public Accounts is now seen as almost a separate government by many of the general public.  People have asked why we do not have more such committees, but other committees are already beginning to flex their muscles in this regard.  I hope the Government will not restrain or constrain the committees and that it will facilitate the evolving nature of these committees, which is taking place before our eyes.  Many more issues of the day are being brought before the committees and the national media are now fully engaged with the work of those committees, to an extent that was never the case previously in my experience.  Previously, the media saw committees as irrelevant but now they see them as very relevant.  In fact, they frame the headlines of the day.  Witnesses are brought forward and very few people from outside this House will refuse to comply with a request to appear before a committee.  Heretofore, in some instances people refused to appear, but it is now very unlikely that a public figure who is involved in a public controversy will refuse to comply with a request from the Houses' committees.  That is what is happening and the Government should harness it.</p><p>Finally, as Senator Norris said, the problem was and remains whether the Government of the day, and I am not referring specifically to this Government, has it within itself to release or concede some of its power within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the nub of what should be involved in reform.  We have the most centralised Executive and democracy in Europe, where the Government of the day uses its majority to get its legislative programme through.  Every Government has done the same and every Government in the future will continue to do it, but there must be some type of give to ensure there is meaningful reform in both Houses.</p></speech>

We had the pleasure of his company two weeks ago for the debate on Seanad and political reform but it is always good to have another opportunity to discuss it, so I commend Senators Norris and Barrett on tabling the motion.</p><p>I second the amendment, which clearly sets out the different steps taken on political reform, beyond simply the issue of Seanad reform.  I am glad the motion tabled by Senators Norris and Barrett covers other aspects of reform.  If we focus too much on Seanad reform it sounds as if it is the only entity within the governance structures of the State that requires reform, and that is patently not the case.</p> <p> It is very good to see that the original motion covers different aspects of political reform and that the Government's counter-motion sets out very clearly a range of political reforms which have taken place.  I will begin by addressing the importance of the political reforms that have been undertaken and their impact which has not yet been experienced.  The first item in the Government's counter-motion is "implementation of a substantial programme of constitutional reform, including the establishment of the Convention on the Constitution".  As we approach the last session of the convention, it is evident that it has grown in stature and gained immense public respect since its establishment.  It is also very positive to see that the Government has committed to holding three referendums on specific recommendations of the convention.  I hope we will see further referendums on foot of further recommendations made by the convention.  I know that the Government is still considering some of its recommendations.  I ask the Minister of State if the Government might commit to holding a referendum on changing the references to the role of women and mothers in Article 41 of the Constitution.  The Convention on the Constitution recommended, by a large and substantial majority, that these provisions be amended.  I was sorry that the Government did not immediately commit to holding a referendum on these recommendations, as it did, rightly, on marriage equality and the lowering of the voting age.  I hope we will see further recommendations being acted upon by the Government and the holding of further referendums.  </p><p>In the context of this debate, I thought it would be good to refer to the recommendations on D&aacute;il reform made at the most recent session of the Convention on the Constitution a number of weeks ago.  There was a clear impetus to make changes to the procedures of the D&aacute;il.  Notably, the members of the convention voted overwhelmingly in favour of giving constitutional status to Oireachtas committees.  Other speakers have referred to the importance of the committee structure.  We are seeing great emphasis in recent weeks being put on the role and power of committees.  There was a very strong view that they should be given constitutional status.  Procedurally, more importance should be given to them by accepting the proposal, made many times in different reform reports, tht one week in four be set aside for committee hearings.  I hope this recommendation of the convention will be given some weight.  Of course, its implementation would not require a constitutional amendment.</p><p>I will touch on some of the issues arising from the Convention on the Constitution raised Senator David Norris.  The convention recommended overwhelmingly that the Ceann Comhairle be elected by secret ballot.  That is a really important recommendation which I personally supported and spoke in favour of, as we need to strive towards enhancing the role of the Legislature as against that of the Executive.  Another recommendation concerned the need to give the Ceann Comhairle greater constitutional status.  We need to examine giving greater power to the Opposition to introduce Bills and removing the restriction on money Bills which has been commented on.  The Government should accept more Bills on Second Stage.  These recommendations would not require a constitutional change, but nonetheless they were supported by clear majorities and will be included in the convention's report to the Government.  I know that the report has not yet gone to the Government, but it is worth flagging these fundamental reforms to D&aacute;il procedure.  I am glad to see in the Government's amendment to the motion a specific reference to the next phase of D&aacute;il reform.  We all welcome the establishment of the Oireachtas inquiry system which is in hand and the further restructuring of Oireachtas committees, but the convention's proposals would give a higher status to the role of committees.  I ask the Minister of State to give us his view on some of these proposals for change.</p><p>Let us consider specific reforms in the Seanad.  We have debated the issue of Seanad reform a number of times recently.  I welcome the announcement that this week the Cabinet considered the extension of the universities panel to include graduates of all third level institutions in the State.  Let me emphasise my own view which I think is shared among all the university Members, that suffrage should continue to include those graduates who are Irish citizens but are resident outside the jurisdiction.  It wold be regrettable if we were to see a rowing back on that right to vote.  Senator Sean D. Barrett mentioned the right of Irish citizens resident abroad, graduates of Trinity College Dublin and NUI colleges who may vote in Seanad elections.  The same principle should be extended to graduates of the other third level institutions.</p><p>I have made this point before to the Minister of State: we need to see a task force established without delay.  I know that the Government has previously committed to doing this, which is very welcome.  I also know that the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, will be bringing forward proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privilege on internal procedural reform.  The task force needs to consider the legislative reforms we could introduce that would improve the democratic mandate of the Seanad in keeping with the will of the people, as expressed in the referendum last October.  We need to look, in particular, at the principle of universal suffrage and how we could introduce a model that would not replicate the D&aacute;il.  I know that there is real concern among some Government Members that the Seanad should not replicate the D&aacute;il.  I do not think there is any real danger of that happening, given that Article 28.4 of the Constitution clearly states that it is to the D&aacute;il to which Ministers are accountable, not the Seanad.  The Seanad's role, as set out in Article 20, is to initiate and amend legislation.  That will remain the case, whatever method of election to the Seanad is put in place.  I personally favour universal suffrage, which clearly would be perfectly possible in line with the Constitution, by amending the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act which provides for the composition of the five electoral panels-----</p></speech>

Again, this could be changed by legislation to hold the election on the same day as the general election, thereby removing the current system under which those who do not win a D&aacute;il seat then run for the Seanad.  I know that there is a great deal of public concern about that system which needs to be tightened by holding the ballots on the same day.  </p><p>We need to look at the secret ballot issue dealt with in Article 18, but there are proposals, notably in Senator John Crown's Bill but equally in the then Senator Mary O'Rourke's report. </p></speech>

I appreciate his being here so soon after our other debate on Seanad reform.  </p><p>I highly commend the university Senators for tabling the motion.  I welcome its breadth, as Senator Ivana Bacik and others have identified, and echo the words of Senator David Norris who opened the debate that the Government promised radical democratic reform.  We are considering whether there has been enough reform for the people; obviously, the amendment to the motion lists a number of things that have been reformed.  I look forward to the Minister of State's speech and hearing what the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, has to say.  The counter-motion lists the reforms made, but I agree with Senator David Norris that they may not have been as substantive as originally envisaged.  I feel privileged to have participated in a number of them.  I hope to bring forward progressive reforms in the context of the Government's record.</p><p>I wish to highlight the issues Senator Ivana Bacik raised, about which I spoke a number of weeks ago when I tabled a motion calling for legislation to be introduced on universal suffrage in Seanad elections.  I called for reform to give every citizen one vote in Seanad elections.  As I understand it, the Government has dismissed the idea of universal suffrage, citing, among other things, the fear that a replica of the D&aacute;il would be created with a reformed Seanad.  It is important that we be absolutely clear that the Constitution leaves it to the Oireachtas to decide on how the Members of the Seanad are to be elected.  The panels remain, but a different method of election could be provided for in legislation; therefore, the only barrier to creating a more democratic Seanad appears to be a lack of political will.  The retention of the current voting structures means - let me remind the people - that a little more than 1,000 politicians will elect 43 Members in the next Seanad in 2016, unless a change is brought about.  If politicians comprise the majority of the electorate for the Seanad, of course, we will see the continued dominance of the political parties.  The opening of the elections to the people would change this in order that civil society organisations, unions, farmers' groups and ordinary citizens would have a chance to gain a Seanad seat.</p> <p>At the time of the referendum the Government argued for the abolition of the Seanad on the basis of our undemocratic nature and now it is seeking to reinforce that undemocratic element by denying a vote to all citizens.  I simply ask that the Government provide a more substantive rationale for denying the people a vote for the Seanad than that it would make it a replica of the D&aacute;il.  Of course, the issue of cost has been cited as well.  It is not correct to state that the cost of direct election to the Seanad would be prohibitive.  Extending the franchise to all third level graduates will of course incur costs.  The process would be more cost effective if it were used to extend the franchise to all voters who are registered for the D&aacute;il and local elections.  </p><p> As Senator Norris said, let us put in place something that will work.  A constructive suggestion about how we can be really efficient around the cost issue is the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  It could dramatically reduce the cost of all elections and could form part of the reform to extend the Seanad vote to everyone.  Let me remind Senators and the Government that a detailed study on the establishment of an electoral commission has already been conducted by UCD on behalf of the last government.  The resultant Sinnott report found that considerable economies of scale could achieved by the merger of the Standards in Public Office Commission, the register of parties, the Constituency Commission and the <i>ad hoc</i>Referendum Commission.  Establishing and appointing a new referendum commission every time we have a referendum is a very unsatisfactory situation.  We have often heard that said on all sides of the House when it comes to a referendum, but I am saying it now when we are not in the process of having a referendum.  </p><p> The establishment of a permanent independent electoral commission would be in line with best international practice.  Out of 156 countries, Ireland is in a minority of 32 whose elections are still managed by government.  International evidence shows that an electoral commission could proactively modernise our electoral registry, develop innovative and cost-effective changes in our methods of voting, improve turnout and, most importantly, contribute to a more accessible and engaging democratic process.  If we did that, and that infrastructure was moved on, the issue of votes for everyone in the Seanad would be less likely to be put forward as not being cost-effective.</p><p> Finally, I look forward to the Leader presenting the Government proposals to the Seanad and CPP as soon as possible.  Perhaps he might say a little bit about the matter this evening.  I note that the original motion called for a timeframe.  Can we have a timeframe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200033#HH00200"><p>I commend all of the Senators who tabled the motion.  They have worked on it for a considerable time.  I have often wondered whether it has been a waste of time, but we must go through the process anyway.</p><p>When Senator David Norris made his powerful speech the Visitors' Gallery was full.  I looked around to see what impression he had made on those present and discovered that they were particularly animated.  It struck me that if a referendum to abolish the D&aacute;il and enhance the Seanad had been held this evening, all of them would have gone home and voted for doing so.  They had the opportunity to come in here and listen to a Member of the House put forward his views in an exceptionally passionate and well-researched way.  </p><p>I often find that when we have a walk-through vote on a specific issue - and I know full well that this applies to people on the Government side, just as it did to us when we were on that side - we must support something we do not believe in.  I do not understand that.  In the past we have given out about the proverbial blow of the crozier, but now we get the blow of the Whip, and in a very big way.  If one goes against the Whip here one will suffer, and we have all suffered at some time.  However, I hope that reform will come in and that we can model it on what is happening in Britain, which we hear about every day.  We had an exercise on it two days ago but the sky has not fallen in and the Parliament has not disappeared.  This is an area for reform, because it is hypocritical for us all to be voting in a way that we do not believe in.  This is something that we should consider. </p><p>I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to discuss the issue of housing in the Traveller community.  The Acting Chairman may have been there that day.  I was absolutely impressed by the four Travellers who attended because they put their case so well and cogently.  The city management people were present as well.  It left us in no doubt about the issue, yet we have never taken any step to give Travellers a voice in a place where we could give them a voice.  We know they will not succeed in the near future in getting a seat in the D&aacute;il.  They certainly should be represented here because there are powerful voices in the Traveller community.</p><p>During St. Patrick's week we will all be in here to talk about the Taoiseach's visit to Washington, the diaspora, etc.  There are 75 million people of Irish extraction throughout the world but they have no voice in the Seanad.  Last week I was in England visiting an Irish community group and people kept raising the issue in discussion.  We keep dangling the carrot but then it disappears again and we have no representative here.</p><p>The debate on Northern Ireland has become calm.  I suggest that the contributions made in the House at the height of the Troubles in the North played a very significant role in the peace process and, by extension, the Good Friday Agreement.  I can remember the well-thought-out contributions that were made here and the fact that there was a diverse gathering in the Chamber so we were able to contribute and hold individual views.  I have no doubt those views were monitored and people saw our attitude.  That was epitomised for me when members of the Orange Order travelled down here to visit the Chamber.  It was an historic occasion, but the reason for its importance was the decorum that existed here.  It was not a patronising attitude.  Here, we have taken away again the opportunity for such people to have a voice.  We have had great people here, such as Maurice Hayes and others before him, who made a major contribution.  Again, all of this is reform.  Therefore, one starts to ask one's self the question of what we mean by reform.  Let us be honest.  One would have to have a powerful imagination to believe that trying to abolish a House of Parliament, as tried with the Seanad, was reform.  Let us think it through.  This was put forward as part of a reform package.  One would need a powerful imagination to think that getting rid of all of the town councils, which have a tradition and history and whose members are working at the coalface, is reform. That was mentioned in the amendment to the motion.  That is not reform; it is quite the opposite.  We must clarify for ourselves what we mean by reform.  There have been many contributions here - not just today but heretofore - that could be assembled and brought together to show what meaningful reform really means.</p><p>Senator Norris put his finger on it very well when he asked that we be given the tools to do the work.  We know when we come in here that our hands are tied behind our backs.  There is no question about that.  There are times when we even start to feel cynical about participating in that type of charade, because that is what it is.  All the Government has to do is to give us the tools to do the work, and, second, give us the opportunity to have a more meaningful input, even if it wants a specialised input - if it wants to say that we cannot deal with matters of finance or whatever.  There are many areas in which we should have an input.  A number of committees in recent times - for example, the Committee of Public Accounts and the committee on which I sit, which has been attended by representatives of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and other groups - have shown what they are capable of doing when the shackles are removed.  It is quite extraordinary.  The only way reform will work is if the Taoiseach comes in here and talks to the leaders of the different parties.  I urge him to sit down and speak to them in a meaningful way, forget the rebuff of the result of the Seanad referendum, and say, &quot;Yes, we are living in a new Ireland, a new society and a new world, and we have to approach it in that way.&quot;  Senator Barrett made the point earlier that we are capable of instituting reform ourselves but we are not capable of implementing it.  If such a discussion led to a meaningful proposal, we would put meat on the bones.  That is what we need.  Today, I feel we are speaking to ourselves and we are speaking in a vacuum, which only adds to the cynicism.  </p><p>When the Taoiseach attended the Seanad, I thought he was very magnanimous.</p> <p>It was not easy to come in to the House and face Members after the defeat, but he was exceptionally magnanimous.  I would go one step further and say, as I said on the day, that we have a Leader - he could not be better - who can lead us along the road I am suggesting.  However, that will only happen if we trust each other, are genuine and expand our vision.  In this debate we must go further than where we are.</p></speech>

I am surprised at the number of reforms mentioned in it.  Senator David Norris has said the argument that there is referendum fatigue is nonsense.  It is nonsense, given that we are going to have at least three referendums in 2015, to which the Government has committed.  The number of Deputies is to be reduced from 166 to 158.  That is a reform people have sought.  The Senator has said people will be like Oliver with the bowl asking for more.  If they were to receive more, they would get an awful shock; certainly many Deputies would get a shock.  We have seen reductions in the salaries and pensions of members of the Government and other office-holders and in the cost of ministerial transport.  These are the reforms about which people were speaking before the last election when they said we should cut the cost of government.  We have seen legislation to require the public disclosure of political donations, another matter about which people talked, and to link the payment of State supports to political parties wtih the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection at general elections.  That is another matter about which many people spoke before the last election.      </p><p>  We have seen extensive reform in local government which many would say only involves cutting numbers.  I suggest the local government Bill did a lot more than just cut numbers, it has made a number of significant changes.  We have seen legislation to restore freedom of information to its pre-2003 state.  Many said no Government would ever do this, but the Government did it.  We have restructured the Oireachtas committee system to provide a framework in which Oireachtas committees can conduct inquiries into matters of public interest.  </p><p>  These are just some of the reforms that have taken place.  The Government Chief Whip has, I hope, many other reforms that he intends to introduce in the next two years.  I do not know if he agrees with me that consideration should be given to having dedicated committee weeks.  This would allow members to give full consideration to their committee duties, when necessary, and to focus on their duties to the Houses by participating in debates and legislative work.  This can and should be done.  It would be good for the committees and each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  People have mentioned the logistics and said there would not be enough committee rooms to hold meetings.  That is nonsense.  It can be done if we wish to do it and it would serve the Oireachtas well.</p><p>  Since we last discussed the specifics of the Seanad, the Taoiseach has been true to his word in progressing the drafting of legislation to enact the result of the 1979 referendum to confer the right on all third level graduates to vote in future Seanad elections.  The Government will shortly send to the House for examination the general scheme of a Bill to implement the 1979 amendment to Article 18.4.2&deg; of the Constitution on the election of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann by institutions of higher education in the State.  Some of the main features of the general scheme will be: a single six Member constituency to replace the current two university constituencies; an extension of the franchise to all holders of a degree or equivalent qualification from an institution of higher education in the State; other technical provisions for the organisation of elections which include, for example, the creation of a register of electors, the appointment of a returning officer and arrangements for taking the poll and counting the votes.  I will make as much time available on the schedule of business as Members wish to have to deliberate on and discuss the proposed Bill and encourage all Members to avail of the opportunity to contribute to the legislative process in a constructive fashion.</p><p>  During the discussions which took place between the Taoiseach and the Oireachtas political group Leaders before Christmas, three possible ways in which reforms could proceed were identified: operational and procedural reform, legislative reform of the Seanad electoral system and implementation of change via<i></i>a constitutional amendment which would require a referendum.  As I have stated previously, procedural<b></b>reform is the most convenient way of making progress in reforming the daily business schedule of this House.  I have submitted my own proposals to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this regard and the Government will submit its proposals next week.  I presume we will have ample opportunity to discuss these proposals at the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in the House, if necessary.  </p><p>  As I have previously stated, the current position on the availability of business in the House cannot continue.  It was stated on the Order of Business this morning that only one piece of Government legislation had been published since the beginning of the year.  It appears that Departments need to improve their systems and ensure they are developing policies, engaging in consultations and planning the drafting of legislation in a much more efficient manner than at present.  We cannot continue with the peaks and troughs, where the elected legislators are presented with Bills towards the end of legislative sessions and told they must be enacted by a specific date and left with nothing to do at the beginning of term.  As is often said, rushed legislation makes for bad legislation.  There are, of course, occasions when emergency legislation is necessary, but we are elected to examine and improve legislation, when necessary, and I personally do not like the use of the guillotine for any reason.</p><p>  While there are visible signs that the wheels are in motion for political reform, a lot more can and should be done.  As I have mentioned, the Seanad has been left in a position where we struggle to fill the schedule, resulting in our sitting only two days this week and last week which could ultimately result in a situation where we will not sit at all if legislation does not come through from Departments.  Departments need to become more organised and have less of a solo mentality, realising a whole of government approach to the legislative process needs to be taken.  For reform of this House and the Oireachtas system as a whole to succeed, the backing of the Government is required.  I am confident that a better way to enable the Seanad to carry out its business can be found and I will keep the House informed of progress on these proposals as they evolve.</p></speech>

One of the things I like about what the Senator does is that he commits himself clearly and mentions a timeline.  That is one of the important elements of the motion.</p> <p>It is not enough simply to state what we should do, because we need a timeline.</p><p> I congratulate the Leader.  In the past, I have always had a feeling that if one side of the House said something, the other side disagreed entirely with it.  In this instance, however, the motion of Senators Barrett and Norris, in making its points, gives credit to the Leader.  The Leader pointed out a number of the areas where action is taking place.  From this point of view, the motion is worthy of consideration.</p><p> Consider how bad we were and the problems that obtained in this country five or six years ago.  When the election took place, three years ago this month, we committed ourselves to saying we must do something about it.  We said we could not allow what happened to recur.  Every political party devoted a substantial section of its general election manifesto to political reform.  Commentators and analysts also led the way in advocating radical change to the way we conduct our business.  I am not sure that is happening nearly as much as is required.  On 12 February 2011, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that one of Ireland's most successful businessmen, Mr. Dermot Desmond, had circulated a detailed plan for political reform among leading figures in business and political life.  I had a look at some points in it.  While I agree with some of the points Mr. Desmond made and disagree with others, I believe the proposal is another example of the extent to which the desire for political reform was dominating public debate.  All of the parties stated they must do something about it.  Let me quote Mr. Desmond: &quot;If Ireland is to prevent itself sleepwalking into another crisis in 20 years' time we must radically reform the political system to a design that puts Ireland first.&quot;  This quotation goes to the heart of what we should be trying to achieve when we talk about political reform.  Put simply, it is incumbent on all of us in public life to ensure we seek to change a political system that failed and that was highly complicit in causing the worst economic crisis in the history of the State.  The broken system was made up of the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the Cabinet, political parties, Departments and regulators.  These have been mentioned by Senator Norris today.  The collective system contributed to the failure that created the economic crisis.  It is in the interest of everybody to ensure this never happens again.</p><p> Three years ago, the people gave Fine Gael and the Labour Party a mandate to govern.  In their programme for Government, the parties pledged:<blockquote>We will radically overhaul the way Irish politics and Government work.  The failures of the political system over the past decade were a key contributor to the financial crisis and the system must now learn those lessons urgently.</blockquote>Almost three years later, the Leader has given us some description of what has taken place but the progress is very slow.  I have criticised in the House how long it takes to get things done.  The debate on the Seanad's future last year distracted from the fundamental need for D&aacute;il reform.  I expressed concern previously about the overuse of the guillotine in the D&aacute;il.  I am delighted that the Leader of the Seanad has seldom used the guillotine.  Let us examine what happens in the D&aacute;il, however.  Figures produced last year show that as many as 57% of Bills passed by it have been guillotined in the lifetime of the Government.  The readiness of the Government to use its majority to curtail debate and short-circuit the time for deliberating on legislation is a recipe for very bad law.  It damages trust in politics and undermines economic renewal.  It negatively affects the way in which we lead our lives.  Reform in this area needs to be achieved urgently.</p><p> Do we live in a republic that will insist on the concept of &quot;one citizen, one vote&quot;?  It was interesting to hear Senator Zappone speak about this.  Are we really going to acquiesce in a divisive proposal that stipulates &quot;one degree, one vote&quot;?  During the upcoming local election campaign, we must ask every candidate weather he or she is in favour of everyone having one vote or whether he or she is anxious to ensure the average citizen does not have a vote while a successful candidates will have five, six or seven.  An elected member has five votes if he does not have a degree, six if he has a degree from one university and seven if he has a degree from two universities.  This seems outrageous.  Citizens should ask local election candidates whether they are in favour of having one vote for every citizen.</p><p> The Bill that Senator Zappone and I introduced and that which Senator Crown introduced go exactly in the direction of having one vote for every citizen.  We debated that but we have not got anywhere with it.  What is required is reform that will give every citizen, not just university graduates, a Seanad vote.  It is a total misnomer to suggest that another costly referendum would be necessary before every citizen could vote in a Seanad election.  By means of simple legislative amendment, this can be achieved.  We have demonstrated this in the various Bills we published.  Simply by amending the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill 1947, the Government could provide for direct elections to all the 43 panel seats and extend the franchise to every citizen.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and Government Senators not to let this opportunity pass.  Senators Zappone and Crown and I have brought forward Bills that would transform the House and give every citizen a stake in the future.  This can be done but it requires commitment.  However, this reform alone is not sufficient, as many other reforms are also required.</p><p> Senator Norris referred today to using the committee system better than we have done, particularly in regard European legislation.  It was interesting to hear the Leader respond in this regard.  So much of our legislation is now coming from Europe but it is not subject to sufficient commitment.  We must do something about this.  We must ensure that reform occurs according to a timeline, and that is why I believe the reference to &quot;time line&quot; is important.  Let us ensure we do not just assume something will happen; let us ensure we actually get around to doing something about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200035#KK00200"><p>I welcome this motion because it gives me an opportunity to set out the very real and significant political reforms initiated by the Government since coming to office in 2011.  The main focus of the Government has rightly been on job creation and economic recovery.  We have used our time in office to set about making our political system more democratic, responsive and accountable.  Our aim is to restore people's faith in politics and rebuild trust in government and the institutions of the State.  To achieve this, we have embarked on what can fairly be described as the biggest programme of political reform since the passing of the Constitution in 1937.</p><p>We have implemented a substantial volume of constitutional reforms in a short time.  We have already put six referendums to the people, including an amendment to insert into the Constitution for the first time an explicit statement on children's rights.  Senators will recall that such an amendment was promised by previous Administrations over many years but never delivered.</p><p>We set up the Constitutional Convention.  Despite the initial scepticism with which it was greeted in some quarters, it has proven to be a considerable success.  In just over a year, it has completed work on a wide range of issues, including the reform of our electoral system and same-sex marriage.  The convention's chairman, Mr. Tom Arnold, his team, and the convention&rsquo;s members, especially the citizen members, deserve the highest praise for their commitment and their attendance.  The Government has already committed to holding three referendums in 2015 arising from recommendations of the convention.  These are to be on same-sex marriage, reducing the voting age to 16 and reducing the age of candidacy for presidential elections.  With regard to presidential elections, the convention made a recommendation that citizens be given a say in nominating candidates to increase public engagement in the nomination process.  The Government agreed to refer the matter to the relevant Oireachtas committee for consideration and so it could produce a report.</p> <p> We have introduced considerable reform to restore people's faith in the political system.  The process of political reform will always be an ongoing one but we have started the process after years of inaction.  For example, the members of the Government took an immediate pay cut on entering office in 2011, and then a cut in 2013 arising from the Haddington Road agreement.  Ministerial pensions are no longer paid to sitting TDs, and we have abolished severance payments to current and future officeholders.  Pensions are no longer paid to newly elected Members until they reach 65.  We have also reduced the cost of ministerial transport, delivering savings of &euro;4 million per annum in this area alone.  The number of TDs will be reduced, from 166 to 158, at the next general election.  Changes were announced in the last budget to the Oireachtas expenses regime, which will reduce costs and enhance accountability.</p><p>We have introduced radical and significant reform in the financing of the political system.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 brought into force restrictions on corporate donations.  It also provided for considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or individual can accept as a political donation.  The Act reduced the donation limit for a political party, from &euro;6,348 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate, it fell from &euro;2,539 to &euro;1,000.  Cash donations above &euro;200 are prohibited and anonymous donations given through a go-between have been banned.  Corporate donations above &euro;200 are prohibited unless the donor meets the most exacting requirements.  The threshold at which political party donations must be reported and published has been reduced, from &euro;5,078 to &euro;1,500.  For individuals, it fell from &euro;635 to &euro;600.  Political parties are now required to prepare audited accounts which are then published.  These actions, which implement the recommendations from the reports of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, demonstrate the seriousness of the Government in acting on the lessons of the past.  I should add that our progress in this area was independently recognised in the report by the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, which observed that the regulation and transparency of political funding in Ireland had greatly improved.</p><p>We are also reforming the party leader's allowance.  It is important that it operates in a transparent and accountable manner so that citizens can see that their money is being spent as was intended.  Under new legislation, the amount payable to leaders of qualifying political parties and to qualifying Independent Members will be reduced by 10%, a measure which will save about &euro;840,000 per annum.  Also, for the first time, Independent TDs and Senators will be subject to the same reporting requirements as those that apply to party leaders.</p><p>The Government has legislated to link the payment of State supports to political parties with the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection at general elections.  To receive their full allocation of State funding, a political party must select a minimum of 30% from each gender at the next general election.  This will then rise to 40% of each gender after a further seven years.</p><p>We are also taking action to ensure that the Government and the institutions of the State act in an open and transparent manner.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has undertaken an extensive public consultation process to assist his preparation of legislation for the introduction of a public register of lobbying.  The Minister is also preparing proposals for an extensive overhaul of the legislative framework for ethics, arising from recommendations from the Mahon tribunal.</p><p>The Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, which legislates for the protection of whistleblowers, will be enacted later this spring.  The Bill reflects best international practice and addresses a significant gap in Ireland's anti-corruption framework.  We are also restoring freedom of information to its pre-2003 state and extending it to almost all public bodies.  Work is also well advanced in developing a code of practice to support the implementation of the new FOI legislation.  We have also extended the jurisdiction and powers of the Ombudsman through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, resulting in the most significant expansion in the role of that office since its establishment.</p><p>Our overall reform of local government is the most radical in over 100 years.  It introduces change across the entire local government system, including its structures, functions, funding, governance and operational arrangements.  There will be much greater local authority involvement in economic and community development than before.  The Government recently agreed a procedure for the local government proofing of all future proposals for public service functions at local level.  This will ensure that the momentum towards devolution will continue to be taken forward.  The changes being introduced are extensive, with the dissolution of the 80 town councils, the merger of six city or county councils in Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary, and an overall reduction of over 190 statutory local bodies.  The resources that have been absorbed as a result of this will in future be more directly and effectively deployed in improving front-line local services, enhancing the quality of life in local communities.  Elected members of local authorities will also have a much more important role in how local authorities are run.  This forms part of a significant re-balancing of the relationship between the policy role of the elected members and the implementation role of the executive.</p><p>I now turn to Oireachtas reform, a topic which I know is of considerable interest to Senators.  No parliament is perfect and the process of parliamentary reform is always an ongoing one.  The Government's ambitious agenda for D&aacute;il reform is being introduced in a phased process over the life of this Administration.  The reforms introduced since we took office in 2011 have significantly improved the working of the D&aacute;il and Oireachtas committees, but they are not the end of the reform process.  Work has already started on the next phase of reform.  In October last, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I met the Opposition leaders and Whips to discuss what should be included in the next phase.</p><p>Reforms introduced to date include an additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste; replacement of Adjournment debates with Topical Issues debates, where the TD raising the issue can now postpone the debate until the Minister from the relevant Department can respond directly; and Friday sittings every second week, where TDs can introduce their own Bills and where Oireachtas committee reports can be discussed - TDs have responded to this opportunity to be active legislators and the number of Private Members' Bills published by TDs has jumped, from 14 in 2010 to 58 in 2013.</p><p>I note the following is a particular issue for Senator Ross.</p></speech>

Almost half moved to the next Stage of the parliamentary system and that has to be welcomed.  This is the first time that Members have been given an opportunity to draft their own Private Members' Bills.  Never before were Members given that opportunity.</p><p>In 2010, the year before we came into Government, there were only ten Private Members' Bills.  Now we are almost having 60 Bills put forward every month.  I take great exception at anyone's comment to the effect that that has not been a success.  The Friday sittings are a great success.  It gives Members an opportunity, if they feel strongly enough about any issue, to draft their own Bills.</p><p>There is an appeal system whereby, for the first time ever, a TD, if unhappy with the reply to a D&aacute;il question, can appeal the matter to the Ceann Comhairle.  No other Government ever came up with that idea.  We have increased the length of the D&aacute;il sitting day to make more time available to debate legislation.</p> <p>Together with new drafting and enactment procedures, this should reduce the use of the guillotine.  I should point out that the number of D&aacute;il sitting days already has been increased significantly by reducing the length of the recess and introducing additional sitting days.  A comparison of sitting days between the present Government's first two and a half years in office, when the Dail sat for 303 days, and the first two and a half years in office of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrat Government, in which the D&aacute;il sat for a mean 229 days, shows an increase of 74 sitting days, which constitutes an increase of 32.3%.</p><p>The Government has undertaken a radical restructuring of the Oireachtas committee system.  It has put in place a comprehensive statutory framework for Oireachtas committees to conduct inquiries into matters of public concern within the current constitutional framework.  In addition, the Government is introducing a new pre-legislative stage for all non-emergency legislation.  The committee examining the legislation can consult with experts and civic society groups, thereby opening up the law-making process to public involvement as never before.  Crucially, this exercise will take place before the legislation is drafted.</p><p>From this year onwards, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will address the Dail each year to set out the Government's annual priorities.  Each Minister then will set out his or her Department's plans.  Moreover, to inform the debate, the Government will publish an economic update, a national risk assessment and a national progress report.  In April the stability programme update is presented by the Government to the EU, and committees will be able to review this information and report before the budget.  The role of Oireachtas committees in the budget process is also being expanded.  The budget and spending Estimates will be published in October each year and committees will, for the first time, have the opportunity to scrutinise the budget proposals and Estimates before the beginning of the financial year and before any money is spent.  A new post-enactment review will allow Oireachtas committees to review the functioning of an Act 12 months after it is has been passed.  The Constitutional Convention recently discussed the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  The Government looks forward to receiving the convention's report, which will be taken into account in preparing the next round of reform proposals.</p><p>I will now turn to Seanad reform.  The debate on reforming the Seanad is not new.  Following the October referendum, the challenge now facing all public representatives is to produce proposals for practical, implementable reform of the second House.  The Government has prepared a set of proposals for operational reform that can be implemented in the lifetime of this Seanad, and will provide these to the Leader of the Seanad for the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to discuss.  These proposals focus on the Seanad's legislative and vocational roles while also acknowledging its role in respect of EU scrutiny.  The proposals also will suggest ways in which the Seanad can engage with the Government, as well as work jointly with the D&aacute;il through the Oireachtas committee system.  I am conscious that under the leadership of one of the most progressive Leaders of the Seanad, Senator Cummins, many innovations have taken place.  I have no doubt that under his leadership and with the support of all his colleagues on both sides of the House, much more can be done.</p></speech>

He mentioned how the Taoiseach came into this House after the referendum and commended him on so doing.  I commend a Member of the Opposition on his commendation of the Taoiseach on the way in which he was able to come into the House after the referendum on the Seanad, having had the courage to put the question to the people.  I urge the other parties and groupings in the House to submit their proposals for operational reform to the Seanad CPP in order that discussion on the implementation of practical, workable reform can commence at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>With regard to electoral reform of the Seanad, the Government has approved and will shortly publish for consultation the general scheme of a Bill to implement the 1979 amendment to Article 18.4.2&deg; of the Constitution on the election of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann by institutions of higher education in the State.  The main features of the general scheme will be a single six-Member constituency to replace the present two university constituencies and an extension of the franchise to all holders of a degree or equivalent qualification from an institution of higher education in the State.  Other technical provisions for the organisation of elections will include, for example, the creation of a register of electors and the appointment of a returning officer, as well as arrangements for taking the poll and counting the votes.  There will be ample opportunity for input into the preparation of the legislation, and the feedback from the consultation process, which is to follow publication of the general scheme, will inform the further development and preparation of the Bill.  The general scheme will be circulated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and forwarded to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for consideration.  Copies also are being sent to other stakeholders, including the institutions of higher education in the State.  As part of the consultation process, written submissions will be invited from citizens, elected representatives, the institutions of higher education and any other individuals or groups that have views.  Implementation of this constitutional provision could have been done at any point since 1979 but it is the present Government that now is taking action to implement the will of the people.</p><p>I trust Senators will agree the extensive list of reforms I have outlined represents an impressive and radical programme of reform in less than three years.  However, more is required and it is the Government's aim to deliver this over the remainder of its term of office.</p></speech>

I am interested in the actual success of the Private Members' Bills, many of which do not appear to get as far as they should.  Senator Crown pointed out yesterday that his Bill to ban smoking in cars in which children are present has been waiting for two years.  I acknowledge that the Leader gave assurances yesterday in this regard, but this two-year wait should be contrasted with the four weeks it took for a similar measure to go through the British House of Commons and House of Lords.  This is happening for no other reason than that civil servants are not processing the legislation or bringing forward the amendments on which all sides are agreed.  Despite this, it is clogged up.</p></speech>

In the context of political reform, if legislation that everyone agrees should be passed and is in the public interest does not happen, one cannot then state that political reform has genuinely taken place.  There is no point in having 60 Bills per month coming through the D&aacute;il if, when amendments are required, there is no impetus for civil servants actually to prepare those amendments.  Even in the case of Senator Quinn's Bill on subcontractors, it took two successive Governments for it to be processed.  That would be real reform, and I will cite the Chief Whip back to himself on a matter of which I know he is aware.  He stated that in respect of statutory instruments which are laid before the House, he does not believe Members even read what statutory instruments are laid.  An enormous amount of statutory instruments are laid before the House.  In a given year, there could be 594 statutory instruments, 164 EU directives and 129 EU regulations, versus 47 Acts of the Oireachtas.  This is where the problem is - that is, all those European Union directives and regulations and statutory instruments that simply are signed in.  I refer to the example from August 2013 when this House was recalled in respect of a statutory instrument that was the first legislative item in the history of the State pertaining to organ donation.  It was signed into Irish law, the amendments having been made by the Minister and the civil servants.  Those amendments were not seen by the Whip himself, the Government or the health committee, yet there it was.  It was the first legislation in the history of the State on organ donation but no one in this House or the D&aacute;il or any committee saw it.  Moreover, this happens nearly 600 times per year, in contrast to Acts of the Oireachtas, on which Members spend huge amounts of time.  For those who proposed in the referendum that the Seanad should be abolished and that this House was beyond reform, the reform being proposed in respect of the electorate is an absolute insult to the Republic.  As has been pointed out, in a reformed Seanad it is a disgrace to say "one degree, one vote".  It is absolutely appalling that only those who went to third level may be allowed to vote in elections to a reformed Seanad.</p> <p>The EU has highlighted Ireland, the United Kingdom, Malta, Greece and Cyprus as the only five countries out of the 33 member states of the Council of Europe which do not afford votes to their citizens living abroad.  We are addressing that issue by accident in that if a citizen who lives in Australia happens to have a degree from Trinity, he or she will be able to vote.  An Irish electrician who lives in Australia will not have a vote, however.</p></speech>

We are proposing to give a vote to those who hold degrees from third level institutions, thereby including members of the diaspora by accident.  Of the 196 countries in the world, 120 allow citizens living abroad to vote.  The constitutional convention recommended that citizens living outside the State would only be allowed to vote in presidential elections.  Only eight of the aforementioned 120 countries confine the overseas franchise to presidential elections.   However, the presidents of these eight states have executive powers similar to those of the President of the United States.  We would be the only country in the world to provide a vote in elections for a largely ceremonial presidency.</p><p>As Senator Coghlan has pointed out, this House needs to focus on EU scrutiny given the wide range of legislation and statutory instruments that are produced.  Ministers are given powers through primary legislation to draft statutory instruments.  Under legislation dating from 1972, Ministers also have powers to change existing Irish law to comply with EU legislation.  It is extraordinary that a Minister can change legislation enacted by this House with the stroke of a pen.  Of the 28,000 statutory instruments introduced since the foundation of the State, 7,300 have been introduced in the past ten years.  On the significant issue of real scrutiny of legislation and debating Bills, I can give no better example than Senator Crown, whose legislation has been stuck in an official logjam for the last two years.  Everyone agrees with it but it is going nowhere.  That is where political reform is needed.</p></speech>

I salute the reforms that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and the Leader have clearly and eloquently outlined but, as Senator Quinn pointed out, we have a long way to go.  Our citizens are more disenchanted with politics than ever.  They believe nothing will ever change here.  I am embarrassed when I go to dinners or parties because people ask me what I am doing in this House and whether I have managed to achieve anything.  Although I was comforted by the reforms outlined this evening we have much yet to do.</p><p>  If only the Government could loosen the Whip, which I would describe as a noose around the neck of democracy.  In the two and a half years I have been in this House I was lucky to get to know a considerable number of people.  There are wonderful minds in this House from all sorts of backgrounds, whether legal, medical, business or academic, and they have much to offer.  I am probably idealistic to believe that the Whip system prevents good Deputies and Senators from speaking about what they know.</p><p>  The voting system in Seanad elections is another noose.  I will be depressed if we do not grant a vote to all our citizens and instead continue with the present system for the next election.  I salute all the Senators who are in the Chamber this evening but our citizens should be able to elect who they think should be in the Seanad.</p><p>  At the end of January, Elaine Byrne wrote an article for <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on sections 86 and 89 of the Electoral Act 1997.  Much good has come from the Government's programme of reform in terms of dealing with corruption, donations and freedom of information.  However, sections 86 and 89 of the 1997 Act empowered the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a decision, before the 31 December 2013, on implementing the recommendation by the Standards in Public Office Commission that all parties be required to publish detailed accounts.  I do not think he made such a decision, however.</p><p>  We are hypocritical to be having this debate given that the events in the CRC happened before our eyes.  That is a totally different conversation but a huge amount of taxpayers' money goes into the charity sector.  We had a good debate on this issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality recently and we welcomed that he proposes to appoint a regulator and introduce complete transparency in the charity sector, whereby moneys spent on advertising, marketing and administration, as well as the salaries of all those earning more than &euro;60,000, would be published.  We need to do the same in respect of our political parties, quangos and NGOs.  Why has the Minister, Deputy Hogan, not implemented the recommendations of the Standards in Public Office Commission?  Elaine Byrne's article indicates that we will not see parties' accounts before 2016.  We should see them in 2014.</p></speech>

We can criticise the Whip system as much as we like but it is the Whips' duty to deliver the Government's programme.  That is the bottom line.  It is up to individual members of political parties to decide, on balance, whether they think there is more good or bad in the Government's programme and vote accordingly.  I accept of course that we should have a more relaxed Whip on matters such as Private Members' time, as we are having at the moment.</p><p>While I always welcome debates on reform, and it is important for this House to prioritise a reform agenda, the motion before us is premature.  We had a meeting of the Constitutional Convention fewer than two weeks ago, at which D&aacute;il reform was discussed.  It would have been preferable to have allowed the convention to finish its business and produce its report.  As was discussed with Mr. Tom Arnold, the final report of the convention would have been placed before this House for debate in the way that other reports of the convention have been placed before the D&aacute;il.  I believe that is the way we should proceed.</p></speech>

That is why I am emphasising that the Constitutional Convention has debated many issues that relate to the Irish political system in broad measure.  Some of the convention's recommendations are exciting and will have a positive impact on the wider political system.  For example, the Government's commitment to have a referendum on lowering the voting age could potentially revolutionise the political system.</p><p>The Government has achieved other matters in its brief period in office.  For example, legislation on the public disclosure of political donations is ground-breaking.  When one considers the abuse of the political system that occurred in this country over the last two decades, I do not think we can say that this is any small measure of political reform.  </p><p>Linking State support for political parties to the recognition of a need for gender balance in Irish politics is an innovative and ground-breaking measure.  It is easy to forget that in the general debate on Seanad reform.  </p><p>I am interested in local government reform and if I were to be critical of this Government in any way, it might be in that area.  I believe in strong, self-funded local government and I think that in time the local property tax will revolutionise local government here.  I would, however, like us to have considered far more regional change along the lines of many other countries.  I am thinking, for example, of Wales where a much smaller number of regional authorities have power over police and educational services.  They have genuine regional government in Wales.  </p><p>I would also like us to have examined the issue of plebiscites, as some north European countries have.  In such countries, people have many opportunities to vote on local issues that most affect them.  We need to examine more closely how to get the political system down to its most local level and stop focusing on the Oireachtas in particular.</p><p>I welcome moves to restore freedom of information legislation to its pre-2003 status.  Such accountability is critical to any successful political system, as is the proposed legislation to protect whistleblowers.</p><p>As anyone who attended the Constitutional Convention will be aware, some of the debate on D&aacute;il reform concerned clear operational measures that could easily be taken within the political system, including this House.  To some extent, we need to look into our own hearts.  There was much criticism about using the guillotine, for example, but very little talk about stopping people talking repeatedly on Committee Stage on amendments.  Such people then complain bitterly when we do not get beyond amendment No. 3.  Let us get real.  If we are going to talk about reaching the maximum amount of amendments, we must be realistic about not allowing people to filibuster.  That is the bottom line.</p><p>I welcome the Chief Whip's statement on Seanad reform.  I was somewhat concerned that with all the talk about D&aacute;il and committee reform, as well as pre-legislative supervision, the Seanad was being written out of the system and would not feature in the debate at all.  I therefore welcome what has been said here about operational reform.  </p></speech>

The Leader sits there and says he is in favour of reform, but will not extend the debate by five or ten minutes.  It does not make any sense, unless he does not want to listen to all shades of opinion in this House.</p><p>I have no difficulty in sharing time with Senator Crown because he has been innovative in using the Seanad effectively to bring forward legislation here.

The reality is, however, that as long as central government and the Executive refuse to cede power to the D&aacute;il, Seanad or local government, we will always have only piecemeal reform.  We will only be ameliorating the system around the edges, but will not have the reform we need.</p><p>The core problem in this State is that we have a centralised system of government.  The Executive has far too much power and will not give it to local government, the Seanad or the D&aacute;il.  This Government has dressed up its failures as political reform.  It has cut numbers.</p></speech>

The Government tried to abolish the Seanad while cutting the number of Deputies and councillors, but there has been no real reform or devolution of power.  When we debated the Local Government Bill, I challenged the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to indicate one power that has been devolved by any Department to local government.  He was unable to point out even one single power.</p><p>We saw, of course, that he transferred power over water services to a quango that ended up being an absolute disaster.  Even the Bill that gave effect to that was guillotined through the D&aacute;il, so we had to come back and deal with the mess afterwards.</p></speech>

This afternoon's proceedings, including the Government's amendment to the substantive motion, constitute a powerful argument in favour of emigration.</p> <p>This country desperately needs political reform.  The disaster we faced over the last five years was not primarily due to bankers, builders or bureaucrats.  Bankers and builders acted understandably, albeit in a self-defeating manner, in what they perceived to be their self-interest in a wild and unregulated environment because the Government had failed to act on behalf of the people by reining in the self-interest of those who were always going to build houses that were not needed if they could get money for doing so or offer loans that could not be repaid if they were going to get short-term bonuses for doing so.  The people who failed the country were the elected politicians.</p><p>I hold my dear Leader - not in the North Korean sense - in high esteem and I understand why he proposes amendments which I suspect he does not fully support in his heart and soul.  However, which of the reforms set out in the amendment would have prevented our catastrophe?  Reducing the number of Deputies from 166 to 158 gives us an even shallower talent pool from which to pick Ministers.  The reform of local government has had the effect of diminishing local government.  In a country with one of the lowest proportions of elected representatives per head of population in the world, we are increasing the ratio even further.  Instead of improving access to freedom of information, we are increasing the cost and making it more cumbersome.  Having sat through the pre-legislative deliberations on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, I would argue that most of what we did was optics.  I hate to say this, but when we consider the alleged reforms to the Oireachtas committee system I begin to think we are expected to pretend black is white.  Committees are more politicised than ever and they have been systematically stripped of the people who might have brought non-partisan, dispassionate and technical expertise because they were politically inconvenient.</p><p>Under our system of elections, we elect people to D&aacute;il constituencies primarily on the basis of local interests.  The bitterest rivals for these local politicians are not those at the opposite end of the political spectrum but other candidates from their own parties who are looking for the same pool of core votes.  Deputies are silenced and whipped into submission.  We could in truth replace many of our elections with sheepdog trials because we elect people who will never introduce a novel idea or challenge their parties' orthodoxies.  These individuals are simply channelled submissively into their voting lobbies through fear-----</p></speech>

Beidh l&aacute; eile againn to get at that heap of crap.  Certain things have been have established, however, such as that the Government and the Oireachtas should be accountable to the Irish people rather than to international financial institutions and that it is the duty of the Government to protect the interests and welfare of the Irish people rather than preserve the system.  We need integrity in government - I am referring also to this Government.  National resources should be invested where they are most needed rather than used to serve the interests of constituents of Ministers or members of a particular political party.  That has been happening in the other House and we all know about it.  Do not speak to me about reform and integrity.  The overuse of the Whip is grotesque.  I have been in the Oireachtas for nearly 30 years and I have never seen the Whip used as regularly in the other House.  The majority of Bills have been guillotined through D&aacute;il.</p><p>There has been an attempt to stop Sinn F&eacute;in because people are afraid of that party.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in members are on the ground doing work.  I do not agree with a lot of what they do, but those who want to compete with Sinn F&eacute;in should get up off their arses and do the work.  Sinn F&eacute;in should of course be represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It has three elected Members in this House while a group with no elected Members is represented on the committee.  That is ridiculous.</p><p>People who are elected on the university franchise should be disbarred from taking the party whip.  Every Government has had the university seats in its targets.  They will be taken over by the political parties.  I estimated modestly that we would have approximately 500,000 voters, but the Government has estimated the figure at 800,000.  How many people will be on the lists?  I recall one occasion on which there were 18 candidates on the Trinity College list.  Will there be 200 or 250 candidates?  I guarantee the Government will make a 24 carat bags of it.  I do not believe it will be able to get the register right.  I note the Chief Whip has taken his pen out.  Perhaps he will take note of my suggestion that we should be able to access the e-mail addresses of these people, because otherwise it will be impossible to contact them.  After campaigning on this issue for many years, I am delighted to report that I recently received a letter from the Provost of Trinity College informing me that efforts would be made to obtain the e-mail addresses of electors.  If the Government wants to be democratic, it will need to give up some power.  The Taoiseach should not be allowed to nominate Members.  It is a ridiculous abuse of democracy.  Six Members will be elected by 800,000 people, a further 43 Members will be elected by 1,000 people and the remaining 11 Members will be elected by one lucky possessor of a golden ticket.  Is that the Chief Whip's idea of democracy?  It sure as hell is not mine.</p><p>More than 20 years ago I suggested that the nominating bodies should be expanded to include all of the people of Ireland, with three seats set aside for anybody who does not fit into the bodies.  The system of Taoiseach's nominees should be abandoned and the seats distributed among the diaspora and Northern Ireland, as well as an additional three seats for the universities, so that they are manageable, and three seats for people who do not fit in elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is largely thanks to Senator Crown that my time is not up.  It is not up in this joint either because I will be running in the next election even if 1.5 million voters are added to dilute us to sweet damn-all.  The Government should not pretend that is reform, however.</p><p>The Chief Whip's reference to the Constitutional Convention is laughable.  The Seanad was kept out of its remit.  I managed to squeak in a proposal on the Presidency and it was forced to examine it.  We hear that the recommendations are to be referred to the appropriate committee.  If the Chief Whip is not too shy to let us know, it would not damage us intellectually if we knew what committee that was.  Ninety-five percent of the people at the convention voted in support of the recommendation.  The Chief Whip's party voted on it and it produced a Bill on the matter.  The party politics started when Fianna F&aacute;il axed the Bill, but it then went back to a committee, which made the same suggestions.  But the Government still will not touch it.  Why?  Because it wants to hold onto it for itself.</p><p>With regard to financial arrangements, the Chief Whip must have been joking.  I am surprised he was not ashamed to show the disparity between what the political parties can garner and what Independent Members are allowed to get.  It is even more disgraceful in presidential elections.  Senators can relax, however, because I would not take the Presidency if, as Sean O'Casey would say, they went down on their bended knees.</p></speech>

People appreciate it is a full Cabinet portfolio and they respect the fine job she is doing despite the limited resources at the disposal of the Government.  It is an important area to have designated within the Cabinet.</p><p>Recently, I had the privilege and pleasure of attending a Monasterevin youth action presentation on the need for youth services and facilities in the area.  It was a compelling, convincing and credible presentation from the young people in Monasterevin, south Kildare.  It was all the more poignant and important to me as I grew up in Monasterevin and went to school in St. Paul's secondary school.  I was a member of the first ever leaving certificate class from St. Paul's secondary school.  It was convincing to see young people taking ownership of, and responsibility for, the issue and carrying the campaign directly into the public domain and to public representatives and leaders in the community.  They have the assistance of the principal of the school, Mr. Brian Bergin, and Paul Marron and other people involved in the Kildare youth services such as Mr. Pat Balfe.  It was definitely an organic presentation.  It was in the ownership of people like Jenny Byrne, who did a fine job hosting the evening, Patricia Downey, Moses Eribo and Savannah Muller to mention but a few of the people who took part in the presentation.</p><p>It was also a sad occasion, which is why I tabled a matter on the Adjournment, because the young people said their abiding memory of growing up in the town was one of boredom.  That was disturbing and it is terrible to think that an entire generation of young people will go through the same experience, seeing themselves as having nothing to do, nowhere to go and nowhere to congregate or hang out.  The town has grown in population fivefold but the level of facilities and amenities is lower than when I was growing up and going to school in the town.  The CYMS hall where we used to play pool, snooker and darts and hang out is boarded up, the tennis courts are overgrown and the sports hall has been demolished.  This is disturbing and is a retrograde step in a town with a DEIS school.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to ensure towns like Monasterevin get their fair share of resources to enhance and improve badly-needed facilities.  We cannot condemn and criticise young people hanging around the streets and street corners or gravitating towards pub culture when we do not provide proper facilities for them.  The town is crying out for a youth cafe and a place where people can have ownership of a dedicated youth space.</p><p>I know how the youth cafe system has been a success around the country.  In Portlaoise, I see the work of people like Joe Thompson and Serena Donovan coming to fruition in the success that is the Portlaoise youth cafe.  Young people have ownership of the space, the facility and the amenity and it is thriving and prospering.  It is doing good and it is a holistic and healthy experience for young people, who look out for and assist each other in constructive ways.  I am not happy that Kildare, Laois and Offaly come off poorly per capita in terms of Government investment and funding for youth services, facilities and resources.  In some cases, they receive ten times less than other counties and other centres.  We must address that in the next round of funding for youth services and facilities.  I hope we can redress the imbalance so that towns like Monasterevin can finally have the youth services, facilities and dedicated space for young people it requires and deserves.  It will be money well spent.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  The youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.  These schemes include: the youth service grant scheme; the special projects for youth scheme; rounds 1 and 2 of the young people's facilities and services fund; the local drug task force projects; and certain other programmes including the local youth club grant scheme, youth information centres, the European youth in action programme administered by L&eacute;argas and Gaisce, the President's award.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>In 2013, &euro;1.75 million was provided for capital projects in the provision of services for young people, made up of an allocation of &euro;1.5 million for new youth cafes and &euro;250,000 for the provision of play and recreation facilities.  Pobal assisted the Department with the application and the evaluation process for the youth cafe scheme.  Some 95 applications were received.  To be eligible, applications were required to demonstrate that the proposed new youth cafe would be developed in line with my Department's &quot;Youth caf&eacute;s in Ireland: a best practice guide&quot;, that the facility would target 12 to 25 year olds and aim to meet the needs of the local youth population, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Criteria also included the extent to which the proposed new youth cafe would add value to existing provision for young people in a locality, the capacity of the organisers to effectively manage the project, the involvement of youth in the development of project, how the project would be sustainable and the strength of the overall proposal.</p> <p>Eligible applications were then appraised on the basis of a detailed assessment of the extent to which the criteria were met.  The applications were further evaluated taking account of youth population, existing youth service provision and geographic considerations.  Following the completion of the assessment and evaluation process, 30 proposals for new youth caf&eacute; projects were approved for funding.  This included funding towards the cost of setting up a new youth caf&eacute; facility in Kildare town.  While an application was received in respect of a new facility in Monasterevin, this application was unsuccessful on this occasion as it did not achieve a sufficiently high score when assessed against the programme criteria.</p><p>Some &euro;49.78 million is being made available to support the provision of youth services in 2014.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in line with Government policy, has been required to achieve significant savings on schemes and services as indicated in the comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE.  The final allocations for 2014 take account of the &euro;1 million allocated in budget 2014 to offset the impact of the CRE on youth services and other identified efficiencies.  The funding allocations for 2014 will involve a reduction of 3.75 % on the allocations provided in 2013 for each of the schemes as follows: youth service grant scheme; special projects for youth; young people's facilities and services fund, rounds 1 and 2; youth information centres; and local drugs task force projects.</p><p>The youth affairs unit of the Department issued notification of funding for individual youth projects and organisations last week to the relevant grant administering agencies and national youth organisations.  In order to ensure that the maximum use is made of the available resources, the Department has in previous years afforded flexibility to youth services and grant administering agencies, mainly education and training boards, to reconfigure the funding allocations made by the Department on the basis of their knowledge of the needs in their respective areas.  For 2014, it is open to grant administering agencies and youth services to submit proposals for reconfiguration of the allocations to individual projects, provided the overall financial allocations for the area remain within the allocated funding for the year.  This approach will help ensure that we respond to local needs and that the services being provided are relevant to the challenges young people are experiencing and target those most in need.  Proposals for reconfiguration of allocations will be subject to the approval of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>The new capital funding programme for 2014 involves &euro;750,000 for the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country.  It comprises &euro;250,000 for play and recreation initiatives and &euro;500,000 for staff-led youth projects under the various schemes funded by the youth affairs unit of the Department.  Details of the youth projects capital scheme, including the application process, are being finalised at present.  Pobal will assist the Department with the application and appraisal process.  Detailed information and guidelines for applying for the funding will be available in the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that the Government reinstated the sports capital programme last year under the guidance and direction of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring.  Last year there was in the order of &euro;30 million available for dispersal to sports groups across the country.  This year the figure will be close to &euro;40 million.  A significant amount of the scoring attributed to applications under that programme will be directed towards facilities that serve young people, particularly disadvantaged young people in their own areas. </p></speech>

It does set out a clear roadmap for qualification under the various headings.  The Government is to be commended on ring-fencing the funding in this sector.  I am a little surprised that the Monasterevin application did not meet the required standard for the appraisal criteria because I am certain that the people behind the project are excellent and the need is well defined.  There is no question but that Monasterevin is crying out for these facilities and amenities.  The amenities and facilities for young people are worse now than when I was growing up over 30 or 40 years ago, hard as that is to believe, given the expansion of the town.</p><p>The young people and those involved in the Monastrevin Youth Action Group in the town need to face up to the challenge of renewing their application this year, ensuring it meets the criteria and that they tick all the boxes for the appraisal and succeed in getting a dedicated space, a youth caf&eacute; and facility.  This would provide a base from which this disadvantaged area could move forward.  It would be money well spent.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  I know the Minister of State agrees with that sentiment.  We must assist them in going forward so that they are not bewildered and bored in their teenage years which can only lead to other problems and social difficulties later in life.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200044#TT00500"><p>This matter was already discussed today with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes.  I submitted this matter on the Adjournment last week when I was not aware that a debate on flooding would be on the Order of Business today.  I have said three or four times in the past week that the Motor Insurance Bureau Fund is available to compensate an uninsured person involved in a road traffic accident but unfortunately we do not have a similar facility for people who have insurance for a residence or commercial premises but cannot get insurance cover for flooding.  We will have to deal with this problem.  I have studied the UK structure which costs approximately &pound;10.68 per insurance policy to create the fund.  There are at least 1.6 million premises insured in this country which could contribute &euro;5 each.</p><p>The money should not all come from the insurance industry but Government should work with the industry to create and build up that fund.  We do not get severe weather conditions every year but if there is a gap of three years the fund would be quite substantial.  We should consider this and plan for the long term.  I would like the Government to engage with the insurance industry.  It is engaging in respect of other matters.  This is an extremely important matter.  I have come across some extremely difficult cases, for example, one in which there was subsidence and the people had not renewed the insurance policy because they were away on holidays.  When they came back the insurance company said it could not renew the policy and the people are left with no insurance on their house.  We should consider this.  The insurance industry is making good money out of building and household insurance.  We should work with it to make long-term plans.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200044#TT00600"><p>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I thank Senator Burke for raising the issue.  I am more than familiar with the challenges he has described.  My own area of south Galway was devastated by flooding in 2009 and is well on its way to being equally devastated now.  I have met many families who, since 2009, have found it impossible to secure insurance for their property.</p><p>The Government is fully briefed on a daily basis on the effects of the current severe weather and only yesterday agreed to make up to &euro;70 million available for a programme of repair and remediation works.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for coordination of the response.  Funding for storm damage repairs has been agreed via that Department, together with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The local authorities affected will prepare and deliver programmes and schemes in their areas.</p><p>The Office of Public Works has a major role in overseeing flood relief works and the Department of Finance has, among other things, overall responsibility for insurance policy.  As part of this, the Minister for State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, has taken the lead role in continuing discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and the OPW has put in place a regular and structured communication process with the Irish insurance industry to ensure a regular flow of information to insurance companies assessing the risks of flooding to homes and businesses.</p><p>The Government is familiar with the question of availability of flood cover for households and commercial premises in flood prone areas and Government policy in relation to this involves prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities to address those areas of greatest need including areas where industry finds it most difficult to provide cover so that flood relief programmes can have maximum impact, where economically feasible.</p> <p>It is about improving channels of communication between the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the insurance industry, with the objective of ensuring that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  It is also about providing humanitarian assistance under a new Department of Social Protection humanitarian assistance scheme, which has been allocated of up to &euro;25 million to provide means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes as a result of the flooding.  This is a co-ordinated whole-of-Government approach led by the OPW, with relevant local authorities and other bodies, to maximise the level of resources available to address flood relief works.  As a result of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, it is an approach which will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p><p>The House will be aware that the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on an assessment of the risks they are accepting.  Flood cover claims are generally significant and in order to provide such cover, insurance companies would indicate that they must be satisfied that the potential for such floods arising is low.  If, for example, an insurance company believes that flooding is likely to happen on a regular basis, such as every ten years, the company will reasonably argue that we are moving out of the realm of insurance, the purpose of which is to provide protection against the possibility of an event arising, into the area of certainty, where there is little doubt because of local geographic circumstances that flooding would happen on a regular basis.  The recent discussions referred to earlier between the OPW and Insurance Ireland to agree on a sustainable system of information-sharing for completed flood alleviation schemes are nearly complete and should make more information available to the insurance companies.</p><p>I will turn to the question of setting up an insurance fund to pay for households and businesses which cannot currently get insurance for flood damage.  The Minister for Finance considered this and a number of issues arise, particularly who would fund such a scheme.  Unlike motor insurance, flood cover is not a compulsory insurance and there would be no basis for compelling the insurance industry to contribute to an equivalent scheme for flood cover.  In these circumstances, the State may have to fund such an arrangement and it could in effect create a State indemnification scheme with major costs for the Exchequer.  The House will be aware that in assessing options such as this, care needs to be taken that the proposed solution does not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.  Any option that requires the State to make a significant contribution, given the current economic and financial position, would not be pursued without extensive examination, including cost-benefit analysis.  Such a scheme would also need to be legally sound and proportionate and in line with prudential and solvency rules which govern how insurance companies should be run.</p><p>As part of the response to the recent flooding events, the Department of Finance is undertaking a review of the availability of flood insurance cover.  It is also looking at developments elsewhere.  When the review is complete it will be examined by the Minister who will report to his colleagues on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.</p></speech>

I am not trying to impose an obligation on the State but rather more co-operation between the insurance industry and the State, which has happened in the UK.  Could we consider what happens in the UK and see if we can implement similar measures?  Comprehensive cover is not provided for everybody but there are particular cases where it is clear there must be some kind of security in place.</p></speech>

That engagement between the State and insurance companies is ongoing and as the Senator suggested, we are considering development elsewhere, such as in the UK and other jurisdictions where similar schemes have been put in place.  I hope to employ every option and opportunity available to us to address the challenge in future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200045#UU00400"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House, as he is a frequent visitor when taking Adjournment motions relating to Waterford Regional Hospital.  I have tabled this matter on the back of a parliamentary question asked by my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, a couple of weeks ago regarding staffing levels at Waterford Regional Hospital from 2007 to 2014.  The HSE provided those figures in tabular form, and over the seven years, only in 2008 was there an increase in overall staff levels.</p><p>There were 1,903 people working at Waterford Regional Hospital in 2007 and there are now 1,597 people working there, which is a drop of 306 people.  The Minister is aware that Waterford city, in particular, has been very badly hit by high levels of unemployment, and even this week there was the announcement of another company closing, with 27 jobs gone.  The city is really in trouble because of dangerously high levels of unemployment.  The State is adding to that problem, and with 300 fewer people working at the hospital, it is like losing a small or even a big factory.  There is a concern about the jobs lost, although I accept that the Minister will argue that we had to make savings and cut our cloth to measure because of the economic crisis.</p><p>We can look at the overall figures, although the headings were far too vague in general for us to draw conclusions.  The nursing figures jump out, as the hospital had 753 whole-time equivalent nurses in 2007 but that figure has reduced to 623, equating to a loss of 130 nurses working at Waterford Regional Hospital.  From speaking with people working in the hospital, I know two surgical theatres have been closed, along with a ward and a number of beds have been lost.  One of the main reasons for the closures or decreased capacity is a lack of staff and particularly nurses to take that capacity.  Overcrowding in the accident and emergency ward has a knock-on effect on the ability of the hospital to carry out elective surgeries, and we have seen them cancelled far too often.  I have also asked my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, to table parliamentary questions with regard to waiting times for treatment.  Some pressure points in the hospital still have not been resolved in departments like ophthalmology, orthopaedics and the ear, nose and throat specialty.  I am very concerned about the overall reduction in numbers in the hospital and specifically the nursing staff.</p><p>We have to protect and defend services in our local area.  I am sure when the Minister was in opposition, he did the same thing.  Our instincts are to protect services as best we can in our localities for the people we represent.  Figures like this are alarming and cause concern, and so is the closure of surgical theatres and wards.  If we speak to people working in the hospital who tell us it is very difficult to continue providing the level of service required because of repeated cutbacks, we are also concerned about that.  The hospital budget allocation for the hospital was cut again this year, as it was for all hospitals.  We are eating into the bone and although we simply cannot cut any more, there will be other cuts this year because of the HSE service plan.</p><p>I will briefly move away from the numbers of people working in the Waterford hospital.  A couple of weeks ago we discussed the implementation of the Higgins report, and we were promised five academic posts.  We were promised that Waterford Regional Hospital would become a university hospital but when will that happen?  Will there be a name change?  How will that process be realised and when will the five academic consultant posts become a reality?  When will a 24/7 cardiology service be delivered for the people of Waterford?  I have raised this issue and will continue to do so until I get satisfactory answers.  When I see cuts to services in the hospital in my locality, I will continue to raise Adjournment matters like this.  It is wrong to cut hospital provisions and front-line care when there is so much waste of public money in this State in a variety of areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200046#VV00100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which is of concern to the people of Waterford.  Any loss of a job is upsetting for the Government.  We want to create jobs and we have been very successful in doing so in areas such as Waterford.  It might not have been as quickly as people would like, but none the less, more than 70,000 jobs have been created overall in recent years.  That is in comparison to a time when we were losing 1,500 jobs a week.  We have had a huge turnaround in that regard.</p><p>Senator Cullinane said the State was adding to unemployment, but if we do not have an efficient public service then people will have to pay more taxes unnecessarily and that is a disincentive to people to become employed or for them to employ others.  The reduction in the size of the public service has been an essential component of the approach to addressing the State's fiscal difficulties.  That has been combined with a firm focus on improving public service efficiency and effectiveness.  The Croke Park agreement and now the Haddington Road agreement have enabled health services to be sustained and indeed improved despite a staffing reduction of 11,000 whole-time equivalents, or 10%, since 2007.</p><p>I acknowledge the major contribution staff have made to meeting the unprecedented challenges of recent years and putting the State's finances on a sustainable footing for the future.  The Haddington Road agreement provides for some five million additional working hours annually and for the appointment of 1,000 nurses and midwives as well as 1,000 intern support staff under targeted employment initiatives.  These measures will enable the health service to substantially reduce levels of agency employment and overtime and continue to reduce overall numbers while maintaining services and service levels to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>While both the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements have resulted in a decrease in staff numbers, the roll-out of the Haddington Road agreement has also extended the working day by an average of two hours per staff member.  That represents greater flexibility and enhances service provision.  The HSE continues to support efficiencies in how services are managed and delivered.</p><p>As Senator Cullinane pointed out, the staffing level in Waterford Regional Hospital has been reduced.  However, recruitment initiatives are ongoing across a number of health care grades to address staffing deficits and to reduce overtime costs and reliance on agency staff.  Recruitment is in progress for nurses, NCHDs, hospital consultants and health and social care professionals, and there is an intern scheme for health support staff.</p><p>The Senator will be aware that public hospitals are being reorganised into more accountable hospital groups.  Waterford Regional Hospital is now in the south/south west group along with Cork University Hospital and Cork University Maternity Hospital, Kerry General Hospital, Mercy University Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, Bantry General Hospital, Mallow General Hospital and the Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene.  The group structure being put in place will allow for more efficient deployment of human resources, facilitating effective and flexible use of staff, thus allowing a better response to service needs.  I officially met and spent time with Professor Geraldine McCarthy, the chair of the group.  She is anxious to move things on, as am I.  Hospital groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area.  These strategic plans will determine the way services are provided within each group, and their successful implementation will be required before groups can advance to become hospital trusts when the necessary legislation is put in place.</p><p>Waterford Regional Hospital can now look forward to a new and expanding role within the south/south west hospital group as well as developing a new relationship with its primary academic partner, UCC.  In particular, the research opportunities presenting through close collaboration with UCC will make for an attractive working environment and will assist Waterford Regional Hospital in being able to compete for and recruit the best clinical talent available.  By being in such a group with an academic partner the hospital will be able to buddy up with industry in areas such as IT, medical devices and pharmaceutical companies to produce jobs through research and innovation.  That is another goal of creating the hospital groups as well as improving outcomes for patients, which must be our central concern.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with the new CEO and chairperson of the group in the south west and the south east.  I welcome the announcement of recruitment in a number of areas, including for nurses, NCHDs, hospital consultants and health and social care professionals, and intern places for health support staff.  I do not expect the Minister to have the figures, but perhaps he could ask the HSE to forward details to me on the number of vacancies in each area, as that would be helpful.  New or additional posts in the hospital would be most welcome.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is easy to look at the headline figures on how many doctors or nurses there are and how many millions or billions of euro are spent, but that is no longer our focus, nor can it be.  We must change the model of care.  It must now be about outcomes for patients &ndash; how many are seen, how many are treated and how quickly, and how many had to be seen a second time because they were not treated properly the first time.</p><p>I wish to put some facts on the record.  Notwithstanding all the brouhaha about emergency departments in the first six weeks of this year &ndash; there is no doubt there has been pressure &ndash; the numbers are still 3% lower than this time last year.  From 2011 to 2013 there was a 34% drop in the number of people in emergency departments who had to endure long waits on trolleys.  Last year, 99% of people received inpatient treatment within eight months.  That compares to a time before we were in government, when nobody knew how long they would have to wait.  Very often it was a case of years.  For the first time ever we did count the outpatient waiting list.  More than 103,000 would have been waiting for longer than a year by the end of the year, but only 4,500 are still waiting.  That is still 4,500 too many.  It is a hardship for people to have to wait that long.  We are addressing the issue as well.  We are making real changes and at the same time we are continuing the reforms.</p><p>I must point out that there are more GPs now in the GMS than three years ago.  There are also more consultants.  Last year, notwithstanding the moratorium, we recruited more than 700 nurses.  We are changing the model of care.  We want to move away from a situation in which consultants are seeing patients that GPs or advanced nurse practitioners could be looking after, GPs are looking after patients that nurses could be looking after or nurses are looking after patients that health care assistants could be looking after.  We are also focusing on the role of allied health care professionals, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, who can do much work if they are allowed.  The role of the community pharmacist is also being considered.  All of the current models must change.  The model of care must change from episodic treatment to more prevention and secondary prevention through chronic illness care and preventing people from getting the complications that result in their being in hospital, which causes them much pain and distress and costs the taxpayer so much money.  I will endeavour to get the Senator the information he sought.  I thank him for raising the issue.  The future for Waterford Regional Hospital will be extremely bright.</p></speech>

I live very close to the camp and know many of the people who work there.  Various family members are regularly in touch with me about the camp.  It has been put to me that the Army bomb disposal team, which is based there for convenience and because of the facilities available there, as the camp is close to the airport and is also in a suitable location in terms of the Border region, will be removed on 28 February.  I am not making a statement.  The issue was raised with me this week and I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to use the Seanad to put the question.  The question is whether the bomb disposal unit is moving from Gormanston on 28 February.</p><p>It has also been put to me that there are serious moves afoot to move the B Company 27th Battalion, which is the heart and soul of Gormanston, to Dundalk in the near future.  No date has been given in that regard.  If both of those moves were to be made there would be practically nothing left at Gormanston Camp.  They are my questions.  I hope the Minister will give me an answer that will allay the concerns I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-02-12a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1098" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014021200046#VV00500"><p>There are two elements to the Senator&rsquo;s question - the future position of the B Company 27th Battalion at Gormanston Camp, County Meath, and the future position of the Army explosive ordnance disposal teams, and I will respond to the questions in that order.</p> <p>A major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, took place in 2012.  This was in response to the Government decision to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  At this revised strength ceiling, the existing organisational structures that had been in place for a strength ceiling of 11,500 personnel were no longer viable.  The purpose of the reorganisation was to ensure that within the reduced strength the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force was prioritised.</p><p>In July 2012, the Minister and I accepted the reorganisation proposals submitted to us by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  These proposals had due regard to Defence Forces operational requirements and outlined a PDF Army structure based on two brigades, with the brigade headquarters located in Cork and Dublin.  Other key aspects of this reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength units and the disestablishment of certain units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and a redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.  As part of this process, the number of Army infantry battalions decreased from nine under-strength infantry battalions to seven full-strength infantry battalions.</p><p>In Dublin, two under-strength infantry battalions were consolidated into one full-strength battalion.  B Company of the 5th Battalion, based in Gormanston Camp, was re-designated B Company of the 27th Battalion and remains situated in Gormanston.  There are no plans to relocate this unit.  The 27th Infantry Battalion has two PDF garrison posts, at Aiken Barracks in County Louth and Gormanston Camp in County Meath.  The battalion also occupies two reserve posts in Navan and Cavan towns.</p><p>The Defence Forces, in their role of supporting the civil power, provide assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  Such requests may entail the calling out of the Defence Forces Ordnance Corps.  In support of this aid to the civil power role, the Defence Forces have a number of explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, teams located strategically throughout the State.  In addition, the Defence Forces maintain the capacity to stand up additional teams if required.  The deployment of EOD teams is kept under regular review by the Defence Forces.  Their location is determined by operational demands, with the imperative being the ability to provide an immediate response to requests for EOD assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  From time to time, EOD teams can be redeployed to counter increased EOD threat activity throughout the country.  Teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to respond to call-outs.  Gormanston Camp is used as a secondary location for an EOD response in the Leinster area.  There are no plans to reduce the number of EOD teams in the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister of State's statement that there are no plans to relocate B Company 27th Battalion.  We have heard this before, but I have been hearing otherwise and I feel it is important to raise the issue.</p><p>The Minister of State has not said the same with regard to the bomb disposal team.  In that regard, all he has said is that there are no plans to reduce the number of such teams in the Defence Forces.  I believe that moving the bomb disposal team would be a retrograde step.  I presume that from an operational point of view the team is located in Gormanston because it is so easy to get to the airport from there, and I believe it was moved to Gormanston originally to make it easier for it to do so in case of emergency.  Gormanston is also a suitable location for dealing with the dissident threat along the Border area as it is conveniently located at a major motorway interchange.</p><p>Moving the team would also be a downgrading of the camp.  The last Air Corps team was moved from Gormanston last year, an issue I raised here also.  The Minister of State has not countered any of the rumours regarding the bomb disposal team moving on 28 February, although he countered the rumour regarding B Company 27th Battalion, which comprises more than 100 troops.  These do fantastic work and most of them live between Balbriggan and Drogheda.  They like the work they do in Gormanston and the atmosphere of the camp.  Their family members tell me they are deeply concerned about proposed changes.</p><p>The Minister of State has said there is no change planned for the battalion, so we will take things as they come.  I will be deeply disappointed if the bomb disposal team is moved.  I have met the team in Gormanston and am highly impressed with its work.  It would be a huge loss to east Meath and the area if the team was moved.  It is a source of prestige in the area.  Gormanston Camp is of major historical significance, both in the recent past and in our history.  It has played a key role in protecting the State and the people at times of terrible strife in this country.  For the mandarins and chiefs who may be listening, it would be a wrong and retrograde move for this to happen.</p></speech>

These people do extremely good work in difficult circumstances and in the difficult financial circumstances the country has been in over the past number of years.</p><p>As I stated in my response, the deployment of any EOD team is kept under regular review by the Defence Forces and their location is determined by operational demands, with the imperative being the ability to provide an immediate response to requests for EOD assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand Gormanston's strategic location and that it is very close to Dublin Airport and Dublin City.  However, the Department must keep under review the location of EOD teams.  The location of other EOD teams cannot be disclosed for operational reasons and on security grounds.  I understand the personnel based in the Gormanston Camp are very important to the local area.  </p><p>I assure the Senator there are no plans to move B Company 5th Battalion, now B Company 27th Battalion, which is based in Gormanston.  The location of EOD teams is kept under constant review by the Department.  These teams are specifically for operational and security duties.  I compliment the work that is done by all of the EOD teams and members of the Defence Forces who work on the ground and protect the State and its citizens on a daily basis.</p></speech>
