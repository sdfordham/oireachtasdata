Senator David Cullinane may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Mark Daly as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p></speech>

Last evening, Ms Lisa Fennessy and her husband Michael, and Ms Marie Hunt, representing the Russian-Irish Adoption Group, met with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to seek the Minister's help in resolving the Irish-Russian adoption crisis.  Sadly, however, no progress was made towards resolving this crisis at the meeting with the Minister.  Some of the Irish couples have already travelled to Russia, have bonded and fallen in love with the babies and were in the process of completing the adoptions when they were informed that the Russian Government had changed the rules of engagement for adoption.  For the Irish families involved, time is running out and they are devastated at the lack of movement on the appropriate legislative amendment.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for immediate legal clarity on the delay in this amendment.</p><p>As I said yesterday, the devil is in the detail of budget 2014.  All the hurt and crisis and pain that this budget will cause everybody is surfacing today in the newspapers.  Members on the other side of the House glowed with contentment yesterday because they felt this was a very special, soft budget.  As the hours pass and the budget is exposed to the cold light of day, its illusions, I regret to say, become more transparent.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the much-trumpeted &euro;500 million tax package with 25 new measures to support entrepreneurs and create jobs.  It appears that the bulk of the &euro;500 million comes from the continuation of the 9% VAT rate, which over the past few weeks I so valiantly and continuously pushed to retain, rather than being a new provision.  The way to create a brilliant tax boost is to threaten an end to an existing tax benefit and then retain it and count it as a new tax incentive in the next budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700003#B00400"><p>That is a good trick.</p></speech>

The Government initiative is that discussions are taking place with the European Investment Bank to consider the feasibility of support being granted by the bank.  That is beautiful bureaucratic language.  How about that for a classic piece of non-action and gobbledygook?</p><p>  I am greatly concerned by the measures in the budget that specifically affect the most vulnerable of older people, the house-bound and those living alone.  The sickest and poorest of older people will be hardest hit.  The abolition of the telephone allowance as part of the household benefits package will hit those who are most dependent on the telephone to remain in contact with neighbours and friends.  It hits the house-bound, those living alone and those in remote areas who already feel so vulnerable to crime and break-ins.  The telephone allowance played a huge role in keeping older people safe and in touch with friends and family.  Many older people now live in fear that the alarm system linked to their telephones will be cut off.  The cut to the telephone allowance will leave many older people unable to communicate with anyone.  It will have a very detrimental effect, leaving many completely isolated and forced to fend for themselves.  </p><p>  On a good note, I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Joe Costello, on his newly-launched initiative to assist Irish people to volunteer in the developing world.  The initiative enables a greater number of skilled Irish volunteers to work overseas.  According to an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>two or three weeks ago the Minister of State was looking for people up to the age of 65 years.  I spoke to him about this yesterday and he said absolutely not.  We in this Chamber are for the abolition of mandatory retirement and the Minister of State is giving great example by saying that any age group can travel and join the voluntary service. </p></speech>

I admire that and that is important.  None of us said this was a soft budget.  There are measures in it that we all regret deeply, particularly, as Senator White said, the cuts in the household benefits package.  Personally, I find the cut in the top rate of maternity benefit most regrettable.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it was a very difficult decision for the Government to make and I do not see any other political parties offering any alternative way to achieve the focus on jobs.  I do not think that any of us should apologise for this budget being focused on job creation.</p><p>I take issue with any criticism of the retention of the 9% VAT rate.  This is a job creation measure.  It has been proved that the reduction of the VAT rate in the hospitality and tourism sector creates jobs.  We were lobbied very hard and very justifiably for that retention.  I do not think anyone should criticise the retention of that rate or say that in some way it is not a job creation measure. </p></speech>

As Senator White recalls, we have long had issues with this, not just with Russia but some years ago there were delays in the conclusion of an agreement between Ireland and Vietnam.  Many families who were halfway through concluding adoption agreements in Vietnam were left in a very difficult, sad and traumatic position.  That matter was resolved eventually but we do need now to consider resolving the issue with the Russian-Irish adoption agreements.  I very much support Senator White's call to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to speak to us about that.</p><p>I would like also to ask for a debate on positive action for the promotion of women in business and in public life.  We have a proud history in this House.  We commenced the Bill which brought in gender quotas in political parties for the next general election, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  Senator White and others have led the way on the terms for promotion of women in business and in public life.  This would be an appropriate time to have this debate given that two more women judges have just been appointed to the Supreme Court, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy and Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne.  I commend their appointment and would like to see a broad debate on that issue. </p><p>I think we all welcome the apparent resolution of the crisis in the US and of the stand-off between the Government and Legislature there because that would have been a very serious issue, with a very serious knock-on effect for international recovery generally. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700003#B01900"><p>I would like to bring to the attention of the Seanad the wonderful announcement yesterday of the creation of the Walsh distillery.  The next Baileys or Guinness has hopefully been born.  A total of &euro;25 million has been attracted, mainly in Italian investment, to build this distillery in the Royal Oak region near Leighlinbridge in Carlow, a very rural area.  Forty jobs in construction have been created and 55 permanent jobs will be created.  If one thinks of the tourism in Midleton one can see that this will bring a wonderful boost to the local economy, and add value to Carlow.</p> <p>Most of the sales coming from the new Irishman malt will be in the form of exports.  In fact, the <i>Financial Times</i>this morning has a wonderful picture celebrating the launch of the new product yesterday.</p><p> It is often observed that it is not the job of parliament to create jobs but rather to create an environment in which entrepreneurs, like Bernard Walsh, can create new employment.  Enterprise Ireland has done a wonderful job in assisting Mr. Walsh in building his enterprise, providing a grant of &euro;25,000 per job created.  It is instructive to note, however, that in the case of the last five distilleries opened in Scotland, the British Government provided grant assistance of &pound;133,000 per job.  Will the Leader bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton?  I am sure colleagues will join me in welcoming this announcement as a cause for celebration.  I am confident that the new Guinness or Baileys has arrived.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700004#C00200"><p>I previously welcomed the extension of the Living City initiative to Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of the eligibility criteria to include all buildings constructed prior to 1915.  This is an important initiative which is relevant to a subject we have discussed on numerous occasions in this House, namely, the decline of town and city centres throughout the country.  It will assist in the regeneration of commercial districts and encourage families back to living in the centres of towns and cities.</p><p>In that context, I very much welcome the clarification last night by the T&aacute;naiste that the scheme is to be extended to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  That town, despite its beautiful heartland of Georgian buildings, has suffered greatly in recent years through the loss of businesses to the peripheral shopping centres.  I support calls by colleagues that other towns, including Drogheda and Dundalk, be considered for inclusion in the initiative.  There are many beautiful buildings in towns throughout Ireland, but many of those towns are dying on their feet.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this and other initiatives relating to the construction sector that were announced in Tuesday's budget?  It would be very helpful to have the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in the House for that discussion.</p></speech>

Mr. Rodger is a partner in Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, one of Canada's largest law firms.  As we all know, there are strong connections between Ireland and Canada, going back as far as the founding father Thomas D'Arcy McGee.  The Leader will know that Newfoundland is merely a suburb of Waterford.  Our guest is most welcome.</p><p>In the recent campaign to abolish this House we all stood shoulder to shoulder with the Leader.  I am delighted the people decided in our favour.  One of the main campaigners on the other side was a leading figure in the industrial relations sector.  An bord snip nua, in its examination of that sector, found it had a 2009 allocation of &euro;51 million and 517 staff.  That is almost nine times the size of the Seanad.  In fact, an bord snip nua found that the sector was overmanned by 58 people, which is almost equivalent to the membership of this House.  On page 83 of volume II of its report, an bord snip nua recommends the merger of the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission, transfer of activities such as the administration of joint labour committees and the functions of rights commissioners to the National Employment Rights Authority, a review of the role of other bodies such as the National Implementation Body, a consideration of the merits of merging the Equality Tribunal into a rationalised industrial relations structure in a context where many of the cases it deals with occur in a workplace setting, and a discontinuation of functions such as the industrial relations advisory service, workplace mediation service, industrial relations research, public relations and so on.</p><p>I wish the gentleman concerned success in reducing the size of the public sector, most especially in his own area, as recommended by an bord snip nua.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to the House to report on progress in this area?  A retained and reinvigorated Seanad would welcome progress in rationalising the State's complicated and unduly expensive industrial relations structures.</p></speech>

The proposed reforms of our local government system are an issue about which many colleagues have called for a discussion in recent times.  I hope the Bill will come before the House as soon as possible.</p><p>The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 was debated in the House on 11 October last year.  Will the Leader indicate when it will return to the House so that we can see it on its way to completion?  Delays in the valuation process are causing problems for businesses, particularly small businesses, throughout the country.  The sooner the legislation is debated, enacted and implemented the better.</p><p>Continuing Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's good news theme, the Taoiseach is in Limerick today to launch a &euro;55 million project at the University of Limerick which is the first of its type in the world.  It brings together philanthropy, education and government and will avail of the expertise of ten leading professors in the biomedical, pharmaceutical and research fields from all over the world.  I congratulate the university on its success in creating such an impressive hub for education, research and product development.</p></speech>

In recent days we had a commitment by the Minister to savings and cuts of &euro;666 million in the budget for health services provision next year.  At the same time, however, he is not in a position to tell us the deficit for this year.  That does not inspire confidence.  It is particularly worrying in a context where, as I have pointed out many times in recent weeks, increasing numbers of people are losing their medical cards following review.  The Minister's Department is expected to find &euro;113 million in savings according to the budget data of recent days, yet nobody is prepared to explain how that figure was reached.  Yesterday on radio the Minister gave a vague indication that he got the figure from the Government.  It seems to be somewhere in the middle of the &euro;60 million to &euro;200 million predicted by PricewaterhouseCoopers as being the required saving.</p><p>The Minister must indicate what impact the required saving of &euro;113 million will have on medical card provision, with specific reference to eligibility criteria.  If that saving is not achieved over the course of the year, what is the budget deficit likely to be at the end of next year?  We know very little other than the number of the beast - 666 - in terms of the bottom-line figure for savings in 2014.  We do not know where those savings will come from or which services will be cut.  In fact, we do not even know whether this year's deficit is &euro;100 million, &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million.  If the shortfall is larger than currently projected, could we potentially be looking at a savings requirement of up to &euro;1 billion next year?  If so, where will the cuts be focused?</p><p>Despite the positive editorials and the view that this was a fairly soft budget, the reality is something very uncertain indeed.  Even as a relatively healthy person, I am not looking forward to the year ahead in terms of the cuts that will have to be made.  There has been clear mismanagement by this Minister, who, by his own admission on radio yesterday, does not know where the figures are coming from other than that he got them from the Government.  Is it any wonder the Taoiseach is getting all his other Ministers to look over this particular Minister's shoulder and help him out with his budget?</p></speech>

The investment in research will be extremely important and valuable, particularly as it is targeted in very specific areas.  The provision for additional teachers and resource teachers is also very welcome, as is the retention of the pupil-teacher ratio.  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way, which will stretch from Donegal to Kerry, is an excellent way of tying together the wonderful assets we have on our Atlantic coast and offering a more attractive proposition to the international market.</p> <p>There is much confusion, fear, anger and hardship with the medical card situation we are facing.  Can we ask the Minister for Health for some clarification?  I listened to the remarks of the Ministers, Deputies Howlin, Noonan and Reilly, as well as those of the Minister of State, Deputy White, and the message seems to be that the people who are entitled to a medical card will have one.  Despite this, fear, confusion and anger are being created within the media and the Opposition.  We need clarity.  It cannot be given on the health budget because it is a 24-7 service and there are months of the year left to run.  Perhaps somebody needs to be put in charge over the next month to figure out why certain people appear to have lost their medical cards when they had them until last week or last month.  Such clarity would bring comfort to those who need a medical card and who appear to be eligible.  Mistakes can be made in a system in which more people than ever have medical cards.  Bringing some clarity would take away the fear, confusion and anger.  It would help if that could be done as soon as possible for the medical card system.</p></speech>

Many elderly people are very worried about some of the cuts that were introduced in this budget.  One of the particularly cynical cuts has been the cut to the telephone allowance, which in itself is not going to make a massive saving for the Government.  It needs to be examined and reversed.  It will affect 390,000 people and is part of a composite picture where elderly people are seeing an increase in prescription charges and some are losing medical cards.  An issue in rural areas has been the huge cutback in rural transport.  We need to think about the fact that the telephone line is almost like a lifeline.  People use their pendants for personal security, and the line also connects people to their families, friends, health services, communities and so on.  In rural areas in particular, the telephone line is essential if people want to have broadband, so it is not just telephone lines that are being taken away from the people who need them, but also their connection to their communities.  It is a draconian cut.</p><p>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate not just on this specific issue, but also on the impact of austerity cuts on the elderly.  It is important we hear how this will affect them.   The composite nature of these cuts, with small cuts here, there and everywhere, will come together to make them fearful for the future, worried about how they will connect with their families and how they will cope on their diminishing means.</p></speech>

None the less, the Government will create the environment in which jobs can be provided.   The County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Bill 2013 was before the House yesterday, and the Senator was part of those discussions.  This Bill will bring great value, with the expertise of Enterprise Ireland and the knowledge of the county and city enterprise boards being made available in a one-stop-shop to would-be entrepreneurs and individuals who want to start their own business.  That is where the focus is being placed and that is why this budget is about jobs.  It encourages those who are in business and those who wish to start their business.</p></speech>

Charles Haughey told me this in 2003.  He resisted that pleading and it was one of the best decisions ever made by a Minister for Finance.  It is regrettable that this Government and this Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is withdrawing the free telephone service.  That service is a major boost to the elderly, especially those living alone.  I ask the Government to reverse what is a very mean cut.</p></speech>

This will cost more to the safety and security of the elderly than anything that is saved.  I recommend strongly what Senator White said in her very good contribution.

Below-cost selling of drink in supermarkets is causing a significant competition problem for the trade.  Supermarkets are buying alcohol at a lower cost than the publicans are buying it from major suppliers such as Irish Distillers.  That is a serious blow to any industry and is creating considerable difficulties.  There should be a ban on below-cost selling of alcohol in supermarkets.  That would ease the pressure on the industry.</p></speech>

Those companies did quite well in the past because they were able to draw down this money in respect of telephone services they provided to older people.  They should now put a package in place for those individuals who depend on their telephones in order to remain in contact with family and friends.

I will, however, discuss the case of a young man who could not obtain employment here and who was obliged to emigrate.  He worked abroad for three years before deciding to return in order to pursue a degree in engineering, only to discover that he is now deemed to be a foreigner and will be charged &euro;12,000 in fees by the Dublin Institute of Technology as a result.  There cannot be too many cases of this nature.  However, that does not take away from the fact that there is still an anomaly whereby young people who have no choice but to go abroad in search of work and who return here to study after a short period are treated as foreigners.  I am sure that if his attention is drawn to this anomaly, the Minister for Education and Skills will be able to take action in respect of it.</p><p>There have been news reports in recent days regarding the ongoing negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme.  Iran is claiming that this programme is only being pursued for peaceful purposes.  However, it has been in train for 20 years and it is being used to produce uranium and plutonium.  The latter are not needed for the generation of energy.  Indonesia and Canada have nuclear programmes but they do not produce nuclear weapons.  Neither country produces plutonium or uranium.  On that basis, there is a need to ensure that pressure continues to be exerted on Iran.  The situation in the Middle East is extremely dangerous and if one of the countries there develops a nuclear weapons programme, then in my view others will be encouraged to do the same.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that the pressure being exerted on Iran to only use its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes is maintained.</p></speech>

I welcome the commitment in respect of this extremely serious issue, on which I have campaigning.</p><p>I also welcome the announcement by Ryanair, which is very positive in nature and which represents an immediate response to the abolition of the travel tax.  I understand that there will be an announcement in the next two weeks in respect of the specifics involved, namely, in the context of the provision of additional routes or on how extra passengers will be coming into and leaving the country.

This is a very confusing and complex matter.  I understand that people who are entitled to medical cards generally receive them.  However, one does hear about certain high-profile cases which attract the attention of the media.  I am of the view that there are certain anomalies which exist and to which the Taoiseach alluded in recent days.  We do not want to be paying GPs in respect of people whose names are on lists but who may be out of the country, who may not longer be availing of their medical cards or who may be deceased.  The HSE is responsible for issuing death certificates and medical certificates.  Consequently, the HSE must engage in joined-up thinking in respect of this matter.  When a death certificate is being issued, surely it must be possible to strike the name of the deceased person off the medical card list.  This would be a sensible step to take in the short term in order to make the system somewhat more transparent.  I am sure the Minister would be willing to come before the House in the coming weeks in order to engage in a debate on this matter.</p></speech>

Will there be a timescale involved?  Will the Seanad have an opportunity to debate and, perhaps, put its weight behind some of these recommendations?  The House could play a very important role in this regard.</p><p>There is one issue to which very keen consideration must be given.  On many previous occasions the Seanad has discussed matters relating to the diaspora and the fact that there are 70 million people of Irish extraction throughout the world.  Most of us believe that the Irish abroad should have some input into elections here.  The understanding is that this may now happen in the context of presidential elections.  This should be a very joyful occasion for the Irish in Britain and it should encourage unity and cohesion.  There is, however, immense hurt among the members of the Irish community in Britain regarding the suggestion that if our citizens abroad are given a vote in presidential elections, that vote will be confined to those who emigrated in the past 15 years.  One can imagine how divisive this could prove to be among the Irish in Britain.  Imagine the position with regard to two people living next door to one another in some part of Britain, one of whom emigrated 14 years ago and the other who went 25, 30 or 50 years ago.  One could state that a policy of apartheid is being introduced in respect of this matter.  Those Irish people who have been living in Britain for a longer period must be given the same recognition as those who only emigrated in the past 15 years.  They went during the most difficult of times and they often sent money back to their families in Ireland.  The money to which I refer was often used to help in the running of small businesses.  I do not know how much credence has been given to this recommendation but I am of the view that it does not give the correct recognition to those who emigrated from Ireland. </p><p>I request that the Leader pursue this matter with the Government as a matter of urgency.  If possible, perhaps the recommendation in question could be discussed in the Seanad.  I have in my possession a file of correspondence which is filled with people's expressions of hurt and stained with their tears.  Those who wrote the correspondence in question are very disappointed by the fact that what I have outlined may actually prove to be the case.</p></speech>

It beggars believe that there could be such inaccuracies in the system.  Unfortunately, however, these inaccuracies are indicative of the difficulties which arise in the context of schemes operated by the State.  In many instances, benefits and allowances continue to be paid long after people have exited the system.  I look forward to a time when some of the cuts that have been made in recent years can be reversed.  However, this will only happen if the economy grows and if we create sufficient numbers of jobs.  We have made a good start in this regard in the three most recent budgets.  We must not forget the position from which we started out two years ago.  The Government has brought the country back from the verge of bankruptcy.  When it came to power in 2011, some 7,000 jobs were being lost each week.  People cannot be allowed to forget this fact when they call for all sorts of things to happen now and which are just not possible to achieve in light of what we have been obliged to do to clean up the financial mess we inherited.</p><p>One good measure contained in the budget - and to which reference has not been made since its introduction - relates to the area of justice.  I refer to the fact that the number of garda&iacute; will be maintained at 13,000 and that &euro;9 million is to be made available in respect of the force's fleet of vehicles.  Some &euro;5 million of the latter will be spent this year.  It was also announced in the budget that Garda recruitment will recommence in 2014, that &euro;26 million will be made available for prison refurbishment and the construction of a new prison in Cork and that the allowance paid to members of the Garda reserve will be exempt from tax.  These are significant issues which must be highlighted.  These are tough times and the Government has been obliged to make some difficult decisions.</p></speech>

The most valuable resource any child has at school is teacher contact time.  As those teachers voted against the Haddington Road agreement, which they had a right to do, they will now have parent-teacher meetings and perhaps CAO information sessions during school hours.  This will rob our children of a great deal of important school time.  I have talked to some of those teachers and I was surprised by what I learned - other Members may have known this but I did not.  The capitation grant per child in a VEC school is &euro;140 higher than in a second level school and it is &euro;90 higher in a community school than in a second level, or ASTI, school.</p><p>My question to the Leader is why there is not an equalising capitation system across all State schools given that everyone is paid by the taxpayer.  What I have heard from those ASTI members is that they are willing to take pay cuts but not condition cuts, and I believe there is something in that.  That is a reasonable point.  If the conditions under which education is delivered are lower in a second level school, ultimately that affects the quality of the education delivered to my child, other Members' children and everyone else's child.  We are looking down the barrel of a gun here if we do not move.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, wants to bring in a reformed junior cycle in September 2014, which I support.  How will he do that without the goodwill of the teachers?  I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister engages because I do not want my child or anyone else's child losing any more teacher contact time.  Let us grab this one by the scruff of the neck and sort it out.</p></speech>

This Chamber could do a service to the people of the country by asking the Minister to come in here for a non-partisan debate on medical cards where we could put information into the public domain in order that people would realise the circumstances and the criteria on which medical cards are or are not allocated.  There is a great deal of misinformation and a lack of knowledge and by putting such information into the public domain, we could do the public a service.  There is no point having such a debate if we are all going to have a go at the Minister.  I have major concern about the savings figure that has been given to the Minister by the Government, which, as we note from reports, is &euro;113 million.  It will become obvious early in the analysis whether that &euro;113 million in savings will be achieved.  If it will not be achieved, it should be recognised and that figure taken off the page.  In terms of whatever savings figure is achieved in the analysis, account must taken of people who will not have medical cards who should have them and those who do not meet the criteria but are very close to doing so.  The discretion that was available to grant cards on what were described as "humanitarian grounds" should be used.  I refer to people who are sick or unwell who are close to but just exceed the income thresholds.  If we go down the route of being cold and objective in determining that an applicant either meets or does not meet the criteria, it would be a retrograde step for the delivery of health care in our society.</p></speech>

We have heard contributions on all sides regarding the cutbacks.  If one takes them in isolation, they do not seem like much but they are when one examines their cumulative effect under the budget.  For example, elderly people in general are savers.  DIRT has been increased which will make it almost a disincentive to hold on to savings.  The telephone allowance is being abolished.  As Senator Leyden said, there is a security dimension to that measure, particularly in rural areas, of which I do not believe the Government has taken account.  People over the age of 70 will find they will not have a medical card.  It is heartrending to read some of the stories in today's media coverage of the impact of increasing the prescription charge from &euro;1.50 to &euro;2.50, or increasing the monthly cap for prescription charges by almost another &euro;6 from &euro;19.50 up to &euro;25.  Those increases may not seem much to those of us in this Chamber or in the other House, but they are when we hear from people on the ground who are on a fixed income that the loss of &euro;1, &euro;2 or &euro;3 makes a difference and the loss of &euro;7 or &euro;8 makes a significant difference.   It is all very well to say, and for the Labour Party in particular to point out, that there has been no change in the basic social welfare payments, but all these little hidden stealth taxes, when accumulated and borne by an individual, have a real effect - I am not talking about the collective.  When the reduction in the fuel allowance is also taken into consideration, coming into the winter, when all those cuts are accumulated-----</p></speech>

A stop has been put to that, which is important.  In the early years of this State there was a lack of trust among the Protestant community regarding their future within this State.  We protected that and that needs to continue.  The Protestant ethos in schools needs to be recognised and respected.

The new visa arrangement will attract more visitors to the UK from China and the Far East.  As a consequence, it is likely that more visitors will come to this country from those areas.  This announcement complements the Irish visa initiative, which was announced last year by the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  This pro-tourism and pro-business initiative has already proven to be a tremendous success and has led to an increase of 30% in the number of Chinese visitors to Ireland in the last year.  The announcement made by the UK Government is most welcome.  I believe this initiative will help to attract many thousands of Chinese visitors to this country.  It will also help to cement our global position as a top tourism and business destination.  It is good news all round.</p></speech>

It appears that electronic panic buttons are connected through landlines.  If this is the case, perhaps the Leader might suggest to the Minister for Finance that the forthcoming Finance Bill should provide for some sort of financial assistance to be given to older people who live alone to enable them to retain their landlines.  Given that the vast majority of Irish people now have mobile phones and are able to get very good deals on them, I believe it was correct to look at consolidating the household packages.  If it is the case that landlines are necessary for panic buttons to be installed, perhaps something can be done in the Finance Bill to assist old people who live alone.</p><p>I warmly welcome the announcement by Ryanair that it intends to bring an additional 1 million passengers into Ireland and to create 1,000 jobs.  I hope many of those passengers will come through Shannon Airport.  The fantastic facility at Shannon is probably one of the best airports in the world.  I expect we will see further growth in the tourism sector next year, following on from the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the success of The Gathering and the dropping of the passenger travel tax.  I look forward to the detail of the announcement.  Michael O'Leary is putting his money where his mouth is.  He said he would bring in an additional 1 million passengers if the tax was scrapped.  He is moving very quickly to deliver on that.</p></speech>

She suggested that the 25 new measures we are introducing to support entrepreneurs are practically non-existent.  I tried yesterday to outline some of those supports to businesses, but I was shouted down by Senators on the other side of the House.  I will try to do so again now.  The 9% VAT rate that applies to the tourism and hospitality sectors has created jobs and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

It will provide meaningful support to small businesses, hotels and those involved in the hospitality sector.  As has been mentioned, the air travel tax rate has been reduced to 0%.  We have heard that Ryanair plans to increase the number of passengers who come to Ireland.  We have also heard about the wonderful airports in Shannon, Cork and Knock.  I hope my own little regional airport in Waterford will gain some business as a result of this measure.</p><p>Under the other home renovation schemes, incentives of up to &euro;4,050 will be made available in respect of renovation and maintenance work.  The Living City initiative has been mentioned by several Members this morning.  The capital gains exemption on commercial property has been extended to 2014.  The trade finance initiative will support Irish exporters.  The farmers' flat rate addition is being increased to 5%.  The farmers' retirement relief is also being extended.  It has been decided to include non-EU talent in the film relief scheme.  Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from a mentoring programme and from seven anti-fraud measures.</p></speech>

She spoke about the differences between the financial grant arrangements offered by Enterprise Ireland and its counterpart in Scotland.  We are coming up against such difficulties with regard to grant aid, etc., as we fight with other countries to get jobs here.  That is why it is of paramount importance that we maintain our corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</p><p>Senator Hayden called for a debate on the Living City initiative.

People on this side of the House would have preferred it if we had not been required to make such decisions.  We must get the economy back working and we must deal with the deficit that exists.

Recognising that fuel poverty is a big issue for the elderly, the fuel allowance has not been changed.  The excise rate on fuel has also been left unchanged.  The tax treatment of the elderly remains unchanged with no change in net income for pensioners as a result of this budget.  Those aged 65 and over will continue to be treated more favourably under the tax system than all other taxpayers.  This favourable treatment of pensioners has been protected in the budget.  While there have been negatives such as the withdrawal of the free telephone allowance, all these matters still remain the same.  One would think that it was all one-way traffic in that regard.  It is not.</p></speech>

We have asked the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to debate this.</p><p>  Senator Leyden spoke about the withdrawal of the free telephone allowance.  When one sees what Fianna F&aacute;il had planned in respect of social protection - the &euro;1.5 billion in cuts - far more than the telephone allowance would have been deducted if that had come to pass.  He also spoke about the plight of the vintners, as did Senator Henry yesterday.  We note those points.  </p><p>  Senator Comiskey spoke about the seniors alert scheme.  Senator Conway also addressed the problems <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> landlines.  I hope they will be addressed as a result of the seniors alert scheme that will be announced.

He also outlined the dangers of the nuclear programme in Iran and the need to keep pressure on that country.</p><p>  Senator Noone spoke about below-cost selling of alcohol and pointed out that the Minister for Finance will take action on this as soon as the Scottish case is dealt with in the EU.  She pointed out the lack of joined-up thinking in the HSE, which was a very good point.  The HSE has people who deal with death certificates and registration of deaths.  Surely it should be in a position to marry those with medical cards.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the Constitutional Convention.  The convention held a session on votes for Irish citizens outside the State on the last weekend in September and recommended by a large majority that votes be extended to all such citizens in presidential elections.  A report is being submitted to Government.  I hope that we would have a debate here on the question of the convention.  Perhaps we might be able to get the chairman of the convention to update us on the report.</p><p>  Senator Mullins spoke about the importance of growing the economy and jobs and pointed out the money allocated for the Garda fleet and recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the money for Cork Prison.  </p><p>  Senator Healy Eames spoke about action by members of the ASTI and capitation grants for schools.  I am sure we will have a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on that matter.</p><p>  Senator Michael D'Arcy spoke about the need for an informed debate on medical cards.  A figure of &euro;113 million that has been mentioned.  At a time of increasing demand for medical cards, it is the responsibility of the HSE to ensure that all those who need medical cards receive and retain them and that those who are no longer within thresholds allow their cards to be passed on to somebody in need.  Let me set out what the review of the 365,200 cards in 2013 concluded.  This must be set in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report published last month.  Of the 365,200 cases that were reviewed, over 301,100 or 82% of all the reviews confirmed existing eligibility or upgraded the person from the GP visit card to a full medical card so 301,100 people kept their medical cards or were upgraded.  In the cases of 7,100 cases, death notices were received.  A total of 5,400 of all cases had eligibility downgraded to GP visit cards,12,700 people lost eligibility and 38,900 or 10.6% did not respond.  What this demonstrates is that the vast majority of people in receipt of medical cards keep them.  It also showed that there are medical cards not in use when the HSE is paying approximately &euro;1,000 per card.</p></speech>

This is not a long Bill.  However, the proposals contained in it are both important and significant.  It will implement the Government decision of February 2012 on the sale of State assets by ensuring the retention of the strategic gas networks in State ownership, while also facilitating the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's, BGE, competitive energy business.</p><p>  Our island status at the end of a gas pipeline makes us acutely aware of the importance of a secure gas supply.  We are heavily reliant on gas supply from Great Britain and also heavily reliant on gas for the generation of electricity.  This reliance is set to remain for some time.  I have on previous occasions stated that the proposal by Shannon LNG to develop a liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal in Tarbert is welcomed by the Government.  Such a facility, together with the bringing on shore of Corrib gas, would provide important security of supply for Ireland.  The employment boost from the construction of the LNG plant would also be welcome.  In this context, the Government fully recognises the strategic importance of retaining the gas network in State ownership.</p><p>  The Government has committed to retain the gas network business in State ownership as critical national infrastructure.  There is no intention now or in the future to dispose of it or its assets.  The Government endorses the importance of investing in Ireland's gas transmission infrastructure.  It is also incumbent on us to ensure that this important business remains well-funded so that it can continue to provide dividends to the State as shareholder.  We have a reliable, modern gas system which is the result of significant investment over the years by BGE.  This investment was funded by a well run, profitable State-owned company that has been instrumental in the economic development of the country.</p><p>  Turning to the decision to sell the BGE's energy business, the programme for Government committed to a sale of State assets in order to fund investments for jobs and growth.  As part of our EU-IMF-ECB programme, the Government has also committed to an ambitious State asset disposal process.  Initially the troika was not disposed to allow us retain any proceeds from State asset disposals and it insisted that all the proceeds from any such disposals be used for debt reduction.  However, following lengthy and tough negotiations a satisfactory outcome was reached wherein, in return for increasing the level of ambition of our asset disposal programme to a target of &euro;3 billion, the troika agreed that half of the proceeds from State asset disposals could be retained to fund additional employment projects of a commercial nature.  It was also agreed that the other half of the proceeds, while earmarked eventually to pay down Government debt, could also be retained, and in the first instance constituted as a fund to underpin additional lending into Ireland in support of further investment in job creating initiatives.  It is important to note that it was also agreed with the troika that there would be no fire sales.  State assets are to be sold on acceptable terms and at a price that achieves fair value for the Exchequer.  Key strategic assets, such as our electricity and gas transmission and distribution systems, will be retained in State ownership.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the financial and policy issues, in February 2012 the Government agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, to retain the strategic gas networks in State ownership and to sell the competitive energy business of BGE, namely, Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy comprises the following businesses: leading energy supply business in Ireland, servicing over 700,000 customers in the gas and electricity markets; a 445 MW gas fired power station at Whitegate, County Cork; a large scale portfolio of onshore wind assets; and firmus energy, a growing energy supply and distribution business in Northern Ireland.  All of the businesses making up Bord G&aacute;is Energy operate within a competitive market structure competing against other market participants.  Indeed, Bord G&aacute;is Energy's entry into the domestic electricity market, with its highly successful big switch campaign, had a galvanising effect on competition in the all-island energy market.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy can deliver positive outcomes for Ireland's energy markets and for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and its employees.</p><p>  The sale process, which was formally launched in May, is well under way.  It is important to maintain the momentum on the Bord G&aacute;is Energy sale process so that proceeds can be reinvested promptly, once available, to ensure an immediate impact on the economy and jobs.  The enactment of the Gas Regulation Bill will ensure there is no unnecessary delay in the transaction process.</p><p>  The Bill was broadly welcomed by the D&aacute;il.  A Government amendment was proposed and accepted on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I proposed the amendment following concerns raised by Deputies on Committee Stage and in the interests of accountability and alignment with the new D&aacute;il reform package.  The reform package provides for a post legislative report, whereby a Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas select committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of an Act.  The amendment agreed in committee provides that within 12 months of the commencement of Part 2 of the Act, I will arrange for a wide ranging report on the operation of the Act to be prepared and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This amendment is to be found at section 4 of the Bill.</p><p>  I now propose to briefly outline the provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and this provides a synopsis of the provisions contained in the Bill which has 45 sections.  Part 1 of the Bill contains four sections and provides for the Short Title of the Bill, commencement, interpretation, expenses and the laying of a once off report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a gas network subsidiary of BGE.  This company will have responsibility for the ownership and operation of the gas network business.  The subsidiary will be compliant with EU requirements and will ring-fence and protect the strategic gas network assets.  This Part of the Bill contains provisions concerning the memorandum and articles of association of the company, the appointment of directors and the drafting and approval of network transfer plans.  The transfer plans will specify the assets, liabilities and staff to be transferred by BGE to the network subsidiary.  There is also a provision that information on the activities of the network subsidiary must be separately identified in the BGE annual report and accounts.  Section 5 provides that BGE cannot sell this strategic network subsidiary.</p><p>  Part 3 of the Bill deals with the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  The provisions in this Part provide for the transfer of the energy business to an energy company or companies for the purpose of facilitating the transaction.  These provisions provide legal certainty as regards the assets, licences, rights, liabilities and staff to be transferred to the energy company and subsequently sold.  As in the case of the establishment of the networks company, there are provisions in Part 3 relating to the preparation by BGE of a transfer plan, or plans, which will set out the assets, contracts, rights and liabilities and staff to be transferred to the energy company.  As Minister with responsibility for approval of the plan, I must be satisfied that the plan provides only for the transfer of those assets and staff that are relevant to the energy business.  Provision is also made for the drawing up of a memorandum and articles of association of the energy company and for ministerial oversight of their content.  The memorandum and articles must be consistent with this Act and with the EU gas directive.  This provision will cease to apply from the date of disposal of the energy company.</p><p>  Other provisions relate to the appointment of directors to the energy company.  After the disposal date, board appointments to the energy company become a matter for the new owner.  Provision is also made for an energy company transfer date.  This date will be set by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources following the approval of the transfer plan.  Notification of the transfer date is required to be placed in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il. </i></p> <p>With effect from the transfer date, the specific provisions of Schedules 3 and 4 to the Bill apply and the energy company becomes responsible for the assets, contracts, rights and liabilities transferred to it.  A provision is also included that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, may, up to the date of disposal, enter into further agreements with the energy company for the transfer of additional assets, licences, rights, liabilities and staff to the energy company.  This section is intended to provide for flexibility in the event that, following the transfer date, it is found that additional assets and so forth need to be transferred.  Such an agreement is subject to ministerial approval.  It is worth highlighting that the Bill provides that disposal of an energy company by BGE is subject to my approval as Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The amendments in Part 4 provide for a range of amendments to gas legislation.  Aside from providing background to the House in regard to the designation of a majority shareholding Minister to whom will be transferred the majority shareholding in BGE, I do not propose to go into detail on the various amendments to legislation unless the House wishes to pursue a particular point.  Explanations are provided in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill.</p><p>The designation of the majority shareholding Minister in BGE is proposed on the basis that the current shareholding arrangements are not compliant with EU gas market Directive 2009/73/EC.  The directive requires significant restructuring of European gas transmission operators in line with one of three unbundling options.  Unbundling is intended to create a level playing field for gas suppliers and enhance competition and transparency in the gas market by removing the ability or incentive for monopoly gas transmission companies to discriminate in favour of related gas suppliers.</p><p>In determining the optimum unbundling model for BGE in line with the directive, the independent transmission operator, ITO, option was initially adopted with a view to BGE retaining both the energy and networks businesses within State ownership.  However, under the directive, the only unbundling option which allows for the sale by BGE of the energy business and the retention of the networks business in State ownership is the full ownership unbundling option, which Ireland is obliged to transpose and implement.</p><p>The full ownership unbundling rules mean that, as shareholders in other State companies that are active in power generation or electricity and gas supply, such as ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, neither the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources nor the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may retain a decisive or controlling role in the BGE network business.  Consequently, the amendments to the Gas Act 1976 in this Part of the Bill relate to the powers of Ministers in regard to the activities of BGE.  The Bill also includes technical amendments to other legislation to ensure that BGE may not engage in any business activity relating to energy supply or generation that would contravene the full ownership unbundling requirements.</p><p>I ask the House to note that I am considering further amendments to the Bill to be introduced on Committee Stage, primarily to clarify certain matters, including pension matters, to facilitate the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy assets and business and to ensure maximum returns to the Exchequer from this sale.  I look forward to early consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I ask Senators to table their proposed amendments as early as possible to allow full and fair consideration to be given to them.  I will consider all amendments tabled by Senators and I look forward to a constructive and meaningful debate.</p></speech>

The issue of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is to repay our debts is disturbing when one considers that, depending on who performs the valuation, the asset is worth between &euro;800 million and &euro;1 billion.  As the Minister knows, these figures account for approximately four weeks of borrowing.  It does not seem to be a wise move, particularly given the fact that Bord G&aacute;is contributes more than &euro;121 million to the taxpayer in dividends.  Fine Gael wanted to use the sale of State assets to raise funds.  Its five-point plan claimed that the &euro;7 billion to be raised would create 100,000 new jobs over five years under NewERA.  So far, 3,800 have been created, which is slightly short.</p><p>The Labour Party general election manifesto referred to the one Ireland concept of public enterprise, determining that semi-State companies should play a full role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  According to that manifesto, Labour was opposed to the short-termism of privatisation of key State assets such as Coillte and the energy networks, under which classification Bord G&aacute;is falls.</p><p>My main concern is that we are selling an asset that is providing a dividend.  While we are not replicating the mistake of selling the infrastructure as we did with the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann, there is no clear determination of how the &euro;1.9 billion debt held by Bord G&aacute;is will be divided between the part that is due to be privatised and the infrastructure, which the State will retain.  Will the State keep all of the debt or will it be divided equally?  If one attaches debt to the part that is to be privatised, the amount gained from the sale will be severely reduced and one must wonder whether it is worth selling in the first place.  All that the public purse will get amounts to one month's borrowing, approximately &euro;1 billion.  We are selling an asset that will this year produce &euro;121 million in dividends, or more than &euro;1 billion since its founding in the 1970s.</p><p>The Government claims that it will not carry out a fire sale.  It has referred to &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1 billion.  Recently, Davy Stockbrokers suggested that it might only be &euro;800 million.  We are seeking a more effective energy company.  As my colleague opposite, Senator Kelly, knows, Bord G&aacute;is is investing in wind farm energy and other areas.  It has also made investments in the North.  We are concerned by the lack of clarity regarding the price, which is a critical issue, and the employees' future.  Will employees be transferred to the privatised company under their existing terms and conditions?  We are also concerned about the debt transfer.  On a grander scale, the debt is why the company is being sold in the first place, yet there appears to be no clarity on this issue.  These are our three main objections.  Too much is unclear.  With a bit of clarity, we might be able to further discussions on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

This is covered under the third gas directive, which was passed into law on 3 September 2009 by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.</p> <p>It aims to progress the liberalisation of European markets for gas and electricity.  Transposition of the EU's third package of gas and electricity directives in 2009 has been slow and often achieved only through legal action by the Commission against infringement.  Does the Opposition want another set of fines to be imposed on this country, similar to those imposed following the European Court of Justice ruling in 2009<b></b>which<b></b>found Ireland in breach of the water framework directive?  Does it have to take a massive bailout by the EU, IMF and ECB for those now in opposition to do what has always been EU law?  </p><p> The gas directive was established by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas, ENTSOG.  One such operator is Bord G&aacute;is, which currently has 427,000 gas customers and 348,000 electricity domestic and commercial customers nationally.  As part of this liberalisation, competition was opened up in the Irish market.  This resulted in the Big Switch campaign by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to supply gas and electricity to the Irish consumer.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is a large semi-State company set up by a previous Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition Government in 1976.  It is very successful, with more than 1,000 employees.  In 2012, it raised &euro;500 million in a bond issue, which makes it fully funded until 2016.  It has many assets in the country, including a wind farm portfolio and a 445 MW gas-fired power station in County Cork.  Additionally, as mentioned, it has distribution and energy supply businesses in Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, it was the successful bidder for the new Uisce &Eacute;ireann-lrish Water company.  </p><p> I do not wish to rehash what the Minister has already said in his introductory speech on this Bill.  I support the Government in terms of what it aims to do with the proceeds of the sale of part of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  This follows tough renegotiation of the original bailout agreement, which we were told by Fianna F&aacute;il when in government could not happen.  It has happened.  We can now invest 50% of the money raised from the sale of some assets in job creation and the remaining 50% can be used to secure funding for this job creation.  Once these jobs are created and tax revenues are flowing again we can then start to pay down that debt.</p><p> Under Part 2 of the Bill, Bord G&aacute;is is allowed to form a new network company.  However, Bord G&aacute;is will not be allowed to transfer ownership of this company, thus keeping this important piece of infrastructure in State hands.  Sections 5 to 10 deal with the number of directors to be appointed to the board.  These provisions will ensure only fit persons can be appointed and that their every action will be accountable.  We need full disclosure of our directors and members of staff.  These are State assets that need to be exploited for the maximum benefit of the taxpayer and not run as private empires for the few.  The provisions of this Bill will ensure this.  I believe that we should provide for lengthy quarantine periods during which time directors and staff of semi-State bodies are prohibited from working in the private sector for companies with whom they had dealings prior to leaving the State body.</p><p> Part 3 of the Bill deals with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's need to prepare a transfer plan for the energy assets, licences, staff and liabilities to an energy company.  As per section 19, Bord G&aacute;is will have to include a report on the network company in it's annual report.  The Bill provides for checks and balances in regard to how the various provisions therein will be overseen by the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance and, ultimately, the Oireachtas, to whom they are all accountable.</p><p> Nothing will be sold until such time as Ministers give their approval.  This will ensure that we do not sell at the worst time.  Economically things are improving.  No one wants a fire sale as this would not be good for the taxpayer.  This will not happen.  In this regard, we need only look to the privatisation of the Royal Mail, in respect of which the share price of &pound;3.30 at the time of placement was too low.  Yesterday, the share price for Royal Mail was &pound;4.75.  It must be recognised<b></b>that when the time and the price is right we will need to be able to move quickly.<b></b>There are those who say we are selling the family silverware at the wrong time for the wrong amount.  However, one must at times cash in some chips to gather money to invest in other areas of wealth creation for the State.  We need to ensure that the staff that transfer to the new company and those who will be part of the elements sold on are consulted.  I firmly believe that the Minister will ensure that this happens.</p><p> I welcome that under Part 4 of the Bill and the amendments to the Act of 1976, employees or their trustees will own up to 5% of the capital stock in the company.  This will incentivise employees, in that the better the company performs the better their return.  To those who oppose some of the aims of this Bill, I point out that they have very short memories in relation to the sale of State assets given they sold off Aer Lingus in 2006, Telecom &Eacute;ireann in 1999 and Irish Sugar in 1991.  There is a history of Governments creating State assets, developing them and selling them off in time.  I support and welcome this Bill.</p><p> To Senator Daly I say, we are where his party put us.</p></speech>

On a positive note, I welcome the amendment provided for in Part 2 of this Bill in regard to the requirement on the Minister to report to a committee on progress of the legislation within 12 months of it coming into force.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, may be the first to have inserted such a provision into legislation.  It is a very positive move.  It is case of walking the walk with regard to political reform.  I am encouraged by the inclusion of that provision in the Bill and compliment the Minister on doing so.</p><p>Although the debate on the abolition of the Seanad is over, it is important to note the number of additional amendments inserted into this Bill following its passage through the D&aacute;il.  The Minister has indicated that he also proposes to introduce a number of other technical amendments.  As such, the Seanad provides, at worst, a nice speed bump and time for reflection for legislators, in particular Government, prior to enactment of legislation.</p><p>It is always a momentous occasion, one that unnerves me, when we discuss the sale of State assets.  The ghost of the Telecom &Eacute;ireann debacle is clearly on my mind.  What unnerves me even more is the proposed sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is already profitable.  My colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, has been highly critical of the sale of the national lottery licence.  Also under consideration some time ago was the sale of the profitable part of Coillte.  I was proud to be publicly associated with the campaign for the retention of Coillte in State ownership.  I congratulate the Minister on ensuring this is the case.</p><p>I am genuinely surprised that there has not been any major kerfuffle about this Bill in the public arena.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is a major energy provider, supplying gas and electricity to homes and businesses throughout the island of Ireland.  As stated by the Minister, it was established in 1976 and is majority owned by the Government.  It is a dual fuel all-island business that serves more than 800,000 gas and electricity customers.  The Bill addresses legislative amendments to allow and facilitate the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is the retail arm of Bord G&aacute;is and sells gas and electricity to all market segments and performs related activities.  It is on this basis that I express anxiety about this Bill, which anxiety will, perhaps, be alleviated during the Second and Committee Stage debates.  </p><p>The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy forms part of the Government's State asset disposal programme and is being pursued as a commitment under the EU-IMF programme.  Surely, given that Bord G&aacute;is Energy is profitable, we could renegotiate this differently.  Reports anticipate that the sale could generate in the region of &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, although more recent estimates are towards the lower end of that scale.  Does the Minister know the real figure?  I am not against the sale of State assets generally or the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, and my anxiety may relate to my not having the expertise of other Members of this House.  Surely, we can make a better financial fist of it by retaining Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann in State ownership.</p><p>I am concerned not only about the 450 employees of the company but the impact of privatisation on the consumer.  In 2012, operating profits before depreciation and amortisation had increased year-on-year by 11%.  The net debt of the company has also begun to decrease.  Is it a coincidence that the healthy financial performance would trigger a better sale of the company?  Why can it not be retained in State ownership and allowed to continue to generate profits for the State?  Bord G&aacute;is is by far the biggest player in the domestic gas market, with 66% market share.  I am not sure about the long-term impact or benefit of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy on our society or economy.  I am aware of the imposed agreement to sell it but, as in other cases, is there not a different argument to be made in terms of its likely benefits and returns for the economy over a longer period of time?</p> <p>As far as I can discern, no consideration was given to the implications of the Bill for consumer protection, nor has a published regulatory impact analysis been provided.  There is, therefore, sufficient evidence to show that Bord G&aacute;is Energy could stay in public ownership and use its profitability to protect jobs, increase profit and offer protection and choice to commercial and residential consumers.</p></speech>

I propose to deviate slightly in saying a few words and asking some questions.  I welcomed the Corrib gas project when it commenced some years ago on the basis that it provided an opportunity for development in a rural area.  Despite my best efforts and the endeavours of others, Bord G&aacute;is has not been convinced of the case for bringing natural gas to towns such as Charlestown, Swinford, Ballaghaderreen, Castlerea, Boyle, Roscommon and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Although we made a very good business case to the company, it took the view that population numbers were the issue.  When we argued that Bord G&aacute;is was overlooking the fact that Shannonside co-operative in my home town of Ballaghaderreen uses more electricity than the town of Castlebar, the company refused to accept the logic of providing natural gas to the town.  </p><p>I was recently informed by business owners in Carrick-on-Shannon that a natural gas supply to the town would save businesses &euro;7 million per annum.  As the Minister is aware, businesses in rural areas are dying and need a lift.  Addressing energy costs would change their financial position.  While I appreciate that 50% of the revenue generated from the sale of State assets will be directed towards job creation, jobs would also be created by establishing a natural gas supply in the towns to which I referred.  </p><p>Does the Minister have the power or is he able to influence Bord G&aacute;is Energy to the extent that the company would revisit some of the decisions it has made and consider providing natural gas to the towns to which I referred, in particular, Ballaghaderreen where the Shannonside co-operative is located.  I fear that Bord G&aacute;is Energy and EirGrid are similar companies in that they will engage in consultation processes that are little more than tick-boxing exercises and do not heed submissions.  They certainly do not appear to take on board any of the submissions they receive.</p><p>We have discussed wind energy and the public consultation process in which companies in that sector engaged.  Their consultation is done and dusted and deals have been made with farmers.  It is too late to address the issue.  Notwithstanding that, I welcome the Minister's recent statement on wind energy and I hope the wind energy companies and EirGrid will pay greater heed to people who have genuine concerns.</p></speech>

For this reason, the sale of State assets must be done under scrutiny and with due diligence.  The departure from office of the previous Administration brought to mind the last days of Saigon.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government acceded to every demand made by the troika because the country was in such dire straits that it not have any bargaining power.  In fairness to the current Government, it put up a much better fight on the troika's demand that all proceeds from the sale of State assets be used to pay down national debt.  The decision to use much of the revenue from such sales for investment and job creation purposes is an important step.  This means the money from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy will not only be used to pay down debt but to create employment.  It would have been a bad deal if we had been required to agree to the troika demand to use all the proceeds from the sale of assets to pay off debt.  The Government has decided to use half of such proceeds for job creation purposes and the other half to be retained for future investment.</p><p>While the price paid for Bord G&aacute;is Energy will obviously be a matter for the markets, it is important to note the economy is picking up.  I learned this morning that China is to invest in five or six nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom.   This indicates there is significant potential to tap investment from other countries and funds in the Irish energy market.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy will be sold at the right price and, more important, the proceeds from the sale will generate additional employment.  We can discuss the rights and wrongs of selling State assets all day but this sale is taking place in the best interests of citizens.  Those who are in college or school and those who are not yet born will see the benefits of this measure.  I commend the Bill.  As Senator Mac Conghail stated, the review of the legislation within 12 months of it entering into force will be important and I am sure the Minister will return to the House to report on progress at that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700013#M00400"><p>As always, I extend a warm welcome to the Minister who attends the House more regularly than any other senior Minister, for which I thank him.</p><p>  I do not have any problems with privatisation.  One does not have much choice in the matter when one reaches a debt to GDP ratio of 120%.  This step had to be taken.  Sometimes privatisation works out for the better, not only in terms of helping the public finances.  An bord snip nua estimated that sales of assets have generated approximately &euro;10 billion thus far, which is &euro;10 billion less misery on days such as Tuesday last. </p><p>  Some privatisation measures work out extremely well.   The Dairy Disposal Company, which Mark Clinton privatised before the word &quot;privatisation&quot; was even invented, is now the Kerry Group, a model of entrepreneurship in the Irish economy.  Aer Lingus is in much better shape than it was when it had a fraction of its current passenger numbers and approximately 7,000 staff.  I do not share the nostalgia for the East German type telephone service we used to have when one had to obtain a letter from the Minister to secure a telephone.  </p><p>   The proposed privatisation of Bord G&aacute;is Energy could benefit the wider economy.  I note from a Forf&aacute;s report of December 2011 that industrial gas prices in Ireland in the first half of 2011 were the seventh most expensive of 23 EU member states.  Will the commercial impetus created by this legislation reduce gas prices?  In developing the economy, we must set a target of securing a better energy performance.</p><p>  A Deloitte report of 2005 estimated that the ESB had excess costs of approximately &euro;100 million.  This issue must also be tackled.</p><p>  The OECD economic survey of Ireland of 2011 recommended the discontinuation of supports for offshore wave and tidal energy.  Sometimes the Department appears to operate in what one would describe as almost in a Walter Mitty style economy, one in which one hears clich&eacute;s such as security of supply and defending the network.  Such matters must be evaluated rigorously and I have no doubt the Minister will do so.  In that context, I am pleased to note the following statement in his contribution:<blockquote>I have on previous occasions stated that the proposal by Shannon LNG to develop a liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal in Tarbert is welcomed by the Government.  Such a facility, together with the bringing on shore of Corrib gas, would provide important security of supply for Ireland.  The employment boost from the construction of the LNG plant would also be welcome.  In this context, the Government fully recognises the strategic importance of retaining the gas network in State ownership.</blockquote></p> <p>In the D&aacute;il on 29 November 2011 the Minister saw things somewhat differently from how he does today.  He was afraid that the interconnectors would be underutilised and become a stranded asset.  As he knows, Professor Colm McCarthy, our mutual friend, investigated this and found that the apparent preference of the Commission for Energy Regulation for full remuneration of the BGE interconnector assets despite the absence of any formal underwriting of interconnector II by either customers or Government, was not consistent with a cost-reducing remit for energy policy.  If we retain the network in public ownership, it cannot have that kind of holy-grail-type of status.  A network might be built in the wrong place or new suppliers could come on stream.  The major claim by those involved in the Shannon project is that they can pick up gas internationally at a much lower price.  Therefore there is a price for artificially maintaining wind energy, tidal energy and a pipeline established when a different energy market existed.</p><p>I am sceptical as to whether taking the networks into public ownership really represents an asset.  As Senator Mac Conghail said, I would welcome any thoughts the Minister might have on the regulatory impact assessment of it.  It would be possible to get caught with almost a CIE-type inheritance which is then protected against all developments.  On the next Stage the Minister might wish to respond to that.  The energy must serve the wider economy and should not be an end in itself.  I am a sceptic about taking historical networks and saying they must be defended forever at the cost of the consumer.  Doing so results in another sector of the economy sheltered from competition and interferes with our overall economic competitiveness.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's commitment and energy in his participation in debates in this House.  I assure him of any support I can give from these benches to the development of a low-cost and effective energy sector.  The privatisation will be good for the national finances and will not do any harm for competitiveness.  However, some of the other policies should continually be kept under review given the concerns of Forf&aacute;s and the National Competitiveness Council that we still have an excessively high-cost energy sector.</p></speech>

I fully agree with the separation of the network from the energy-supply sector.  I congratulate the Government on negotiating with the EU-IMF troika to ensure that 50% of the proceeds of such sales would be retained for job-creation initiatives.  Following the sale of the national lottery licence, &euro;200 million is to be ring-fenced for the national children's hospital.  On Tuesday the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced a number of capital projects to be facilitated by a further &euro;200 million from the sale of the national lottery licence.  We have seen how funding from the sale of non-strategic assets can be used to facilitate job creation and specific capital projects.</p><p>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is the only semi-State company with its headquarters outside Dublin.  Its move to Cork has been very successful.  From talking to some who were involved at the time, I know there were objections and there was a no great desire to move outside the capital and establish a headquarters in Cork.  However, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has always maintained a strong presence in the Cork area.  It has never used its Cork base as an outreach office, and has worked with local communities and supported events across the city and county.</p><p>The Minister outlined the various Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann businesses, including its supply business, the power station at Whitegate, onshore wind assets and energy supply and distribution business in Northern Ireland.  One third of households and many commercial premises, including schools, hospitals and industries, rely on gas for heating.  We have a mix of coal, oil and gas-powered plants.  For many people gas is preferable from a cost point of view.  It also has lower carbon emissions - 40% to 50% less than coal or peat, and 25% less than diesel.  From that point of view it is a very important fuel.</p><p>Gas infrastructure meets some of the best international standards, which is a tribute to the success of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The interconnector linking Scotland to Ireland, the pipeline to the west, the Galway-Mayo pipeline, and the North-South pipeline all have the potential to build up a distribution network around those gas lines.  Senator Kelly spoke about the potential to develop the gas network to other towns and cities.  In 2011 the Western Development Commission produced a report indicating that extending the gas network to 11 towns in the north west could result in an annual saving of &euro;20.6 million in fuel costs that region.  There is potential to extend the low-pressure network beyond the main pipeline routes.</p><p>It is very important to bring the Corrib gas field on stream and the Shannon LNG plant is strategically important.  We also need to consider storage facilities.  We have only one facility off the south coast with a capacity of 3.5% of our needs.  However, other countries in Europe have storage facilities with capacities of 20% of their needs.  Does it make sense for a country at the end of a pipeline not to have additional storage capacity?</p><p>I may get a further opportunity to contribute on Committee Stage.  The Bill is an important step forward in identifying what is strategically needed.</p></speech>

It is encouraging that the Bill proposes to sell Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's supply business while retaining the network.  That is a wise move by the Government and shows we learned much from the experience with Aer Lingus of the strategic ownership of the terminal versus selling the business.</p><p>I understand the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has completed a feasibility study to bring gas to Ballinasloe, Claregalway, Craughwell, Galway city, Gort, Headford, Loughrea and Oranmore in the proximity of the Mayo-Galway pipeline.  I live in Oranmore and checked out where this is going.  It is going part of the way up the Maree Road in Oranmore and stopping there.  In addition, the proposal leaves out Clarinbridge.  While this may seem very parochial, these homes are paying the same property taxes and development charges.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the area is fully covered.  It will be very valuable for any home that can have it, as it results in an annual saving of about &euro;485 per house.  We know it is much cleaner than oil and is better for the environment.</p><p>Shop Street, the main shopping street in Galway city will not be connected even though the network will serve Galway city.  I ask the Minister to investigate those anomalies.  Why would the gas network line not finish out complete areas?</p> <p>Sometimes people feel hard done by and issues like this point to that.  It is almost like discrimination or apartheid halfway down a road.  I put it to the Minister that it is a big deal to sell off what some call the family silver.  Therefore, when we do it, let us do it right and let us be fair to all the people in an area.  For example, in the west coast of Galway, to which I have referred, considerable areas are being covered and that is welcome but other areas are being left out.  What is the Government policy?  Why is that happening?</p><p>I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

Cuireann s&aacute; alltacht orm go bhfuil Aire de chuid an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt Bille den chine&aacute;l seo os &aacute;r gcomhair - go bhfuiltear ag d&iacute;ol chomhlacht St&aacute;it at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh brabaigh ag am a dteasta&iacute;onn infheisti&uacute; sa St&aacute;t seo.  It is not without irony that the Gas Regulation Bill is being introduced by a Labour Party Minister.  A little over one year ago at a Labour Party conference the members gave a resounding message to their party leadership to the effect that they would not accept the sale of State assets.  Yet we find ourselves in 2013 with a Labour Party Minister introducing a Bill to sell off Bord G&aacute;is Energy.</p><p>The troika promotion of privatisation is clearly an ideological approach that benefits a small group of transnational corporations.  Its insistence on entrenching neoliberalism is also profoundly anti-democratic.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy forms another part in the long list of attacks on public goods.</p><p>Bord G&aacute;is Energy is a dual fuel all island business which serves more than 825,000 customers with gas and electricity North and South.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy is by any standards a successful company.  In 2012 it had a gross operating profit of &euro;79.4 million compared it to &euro;44.3 million in 2011.  It is by far the biggest player in the domestic gas market at present with a 60.97% market share in June 2013.  Why is the Government selling off such a successful company?  Bord G&aacute;is Energy is hardly a millstone around the neck of taxpayers; in fact it is returning a profit to the State.  Thus, the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy can only be described as an ideological move, one fuelled by the austerity agenda of the Troika.  Reports anticipate that the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy could raise between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion.  However, recent estimates have predicted the price to be at the lower end of that scale.  Half the proceeds will be available to fund employment-enhancing projects of a commercial nature with the other half destined to pay down debt.</p><p>The Minister has given assurances that jobs at Bord G&aacute;is Energy will be protected.  However, under a policy of deregulation and privatisation jobs are never as secure as they are under State control.  Can the Minister guarantee that the current employees of Bord G&aacute;is Energy will have their jobs and livelihoods protected?  In the greater scheme of things, Ireland is a small country.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy currently controls 60.97% of the domestic gas market and a significant portion of the electricity market.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy to a private operator will likely be handing a monopoly into private hands, especially in respect of the gas market.</p><p>The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy also has a direct impact on an important debate that is taking place in Ireland at the moment.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy is involved in the development of wind energy projects.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the idea of wind energy development.  However, we prefer the Scottish model.  Ireland has a target of 20% renewable energy production by 2020 and we have consistently called for a national strategy to be laid out for this target to be reached.  The matter has been debated in the House many times.  What we are seeing is a proliferation of wind farms being developed but questions are being raised about the related planning processes and there is no national strategy on the development of wind energy.  It is like bolting the stable door after the horse has bolted.</p><p>We believe it is imperative that State and semi-state companies play a major role in the development of wind energy projects.  What we have seen far too much of in Ireland is private companies taking the lead on the development of wind energy projects without proper planning or consultation with the local community.  Local communities in Connemara are absolutely up at arms.  They are trying to raise questions about the way some planning applications were granted.  They are being given the run-around completely by the local authorities on the issues.  They are angry at the way this is being done.  There is a sense among people that local authorities, the Government and these private operators worked in cahoots to hoodwink the local communities in the development of wind farm projects which they do not want in their communities in the way they are being developed.</p><p>If Bord G&aacute;is Energy is to be sold it would remove the option of such initiatives being taken through that semi-state company.  The Sinn F&eacute;in pre-budget submission outlined several proposals on how to deal adequately with semi-state companies.  We want to see NewERA replaced with a semi-state strategy group.  The group would report directly to an Taoiseach and would be responsible for delivering a strategic job creation and training project.  We believe that all annual dividends paid to the State by commercial semi-state companies should be reinvested into employment activation and training measures as identified by the semi-state strategy group and signed off by an Taoiseach.  All salaries of chief executives of semi-state companies should be capped at &euro;100,000, saving &euro;3 million.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government must take full responsibility for this sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.</p><p>Since the Minister is in the House it would be remiss of me if I did not ask him to comment on the recent activities relating to the Corrib pipeline and the fact that the associated licence has been quashed.  The local community has raised serious issues over the years on how some of those planning applications have been granted.  We do not find the relevant detail in the judicial review challenge.  When issuing the revised licence. the Environmental Protection Agency failed to carry out an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the requirements of various EU directives, including the habitats directive.  Does the Minister have full confidence in the planning process in regard to the likes of the Corrib pipeline but also in regard to the planning of wind farms?  I realise the environmental impact assessment issue has been raised with regard to the development of many wind farms throughout the State.  Serious questions must be asked about the way the planning process has allowed these energy projects to go forward.  I believe it is better to use the natural resources of the country for the good of all the people in the country and that they should be developed through the State arms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700015#O00400"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I am concerned that this is an ill-conceived Bill proposing to sell the competitive energy business that is Bord G&aacute;is Energy to the highest bidder.  I note the Minister's reassurances, sincerely given no doubt, that we are retaining the strategic gas networks.  However, I wonder at the same time whether we are not trading certainty for risk in this situation with a strategic asset.</p><p>Currently, Bord G&aacute;is Energy has an estimated value of between &euro;1 billion and 1.5 billion.  The Bill provides for the retention in State ownership of strategic gas networks but would allow for the sale of the company.  As we know, this is as a result of the November 2010 agreement with the Troika.  There is no binding provision in the bailout agreement with the troika stipulating that State assets should be sold at an undervalue or sold at a time when there is no robust demand from the market.  We are concerned rightly about any firesale, although the Minister reassures us this is not the case.  The Minister has informed the House that a new subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann would be established to own and operate the gas network business and that this would ring-fence and protect strategic gas network assets, something to which I will return.</p><p>I understand there are only two suitors left the bidding process or in contention for the semi-state firm, a consortium led by Viridian and a British power firm, Centrica.  Original estimates circulated by market watchers for the value of Bord G&aacute;is Energy pegged it as &euro;1.4 billion, including debt.  Last week, it was reported that Centrica had bid less than &euro;1 billion with the Viridian-led group offering more than &euro;1 billion.  Considering that the offers appear to be far lower than anticipated, I have a real concern that the Government might move to sell Bord G&aacute;is Energy with less debt and thereby leave some of the significant debt on the network side of the business.  I call on the Minister to reassure the House that this will not be the case.  Why might that happen?  It would be to increase the sale price of the company.</p><p>It has also been reported that Bord G&aacute;is Energy would face an immediate break-up under plans being advanced by Viridian.  The Northern Irish power company has assembled a consortium of financial investors to mount the &euro;1 billion bid and the plans would involve each member taking over a distinct part of the business.  There is a tangled web of financial arrangements which involves several companies.  Among these are Macquarie, an Australian investment bank and corporate financial adviser, which is expected to take over the substantial development plan for wind farm assets; Allianz Capital Partners, part of a giant German insurance company, which would take over the operation of the wind farms; and Hermes GPE, another partner in the consortium, lined up to take over Firmus Energy, Bord G&aacute;is Energy's Northern Ireland natural gas supply company.</p> <p>Viridian would then take over the retail gas supply business, the largest in the country, thereby giving it increased market share in the Irish market, as it already operates the Energia business here.  I ask the Minister whether consideration has been given to whether any competition or market distortion issues could be created by such a sale.  The other leading bidder, Centrica, is understood to have launched its bid with the Canadian renewable energy group, Brookfield, and that strategy also might result in Bord G&aacute;is Energy being carved up, with Brookfield taking over the wind energy assets and Centrica holding onto the retail business.  The point I am getting at concerns what I believe could be a dismal picture, with various investors looking to turn a quick buck, garner profit and perhaps exit the market while losing the company with debt.  This was Ireland's previous experience with Eircom when that company was passed from one international investor to another with every penny being squeezed from it and debt being loaded onto its balance sheet.  In the meantime, as a result of all that, Ireland has one of the worst broadband networks in the developed world as no investor is capable of investing into the physical infrastructure that is necessary.</p><p>Furthermore, the undershooting of the expected &euro;1.5 billion price for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy will have a significant impact on Ireland's budgetary position.  What do the expensive Canadian bankers, RBC Capital Markets and NewERA, which are handling the sale process for the State, have to say about that?  I am asking whether this is the right time for this sale or whether consideration has been given to postponing such a sale into the future.  While one has heard the phrase &quot;selling the family silver&quot; many times, it seems this is a case of selling the family boiler.  Although one is being assured that Ireland gets to keep the pipes and the wall of the house, I wonder whether one is dealing with phoney economics in this regard.  The concern to which I referred earlier that the debt might be retained at the network end of the business arises from my fear that the Government will do whatever it deems necessary to increase the sale price.  However, retaining the debt in the new network business would lead to the question as to what the State and the consumer would be left with after the sale process.  Were the boiler to be sold and all the debt from the boiler put onto the pipes, the consumer would end up being obliged to pay for the pleasure of helping the bidders buy a company with no debt.</p><p>While the Minister should reassure Members this will not happen, were it to do so it would raise the question as to whether we ever learn from our mistakes.  One cannot sell what is a strategic asset to venture capitalists and international financial vultures, to be frank, if so doing departs from investing in Ireland's future and instead focuses on their profitability.  That would be a short-sighted way to go about trying to create a cost-effective energy market.  When one considers that energy prices here for consumers and small businesses are among the highest in Europe, one must ask how much higher they will be after profiteers get their hands on Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  More than &euro;1 billion has been invested by Bord G&aacute;is in energy projects in Ireland, which is to be welcomed.  However, rather than a long-term investment in Ireland's energy security, I am worried that we are giving in to bidders that seek to create a quick buck.  In such a case, who is left?  The squeezed customer, perhaps unaware of the financial wizardry being proposed, could be left with higher bills to pay off debt on investments while at the same time profits flow out of Ireland.  Has an analysis of the possible impact of this process on energy and gas bills been carried out by the Minister?  I certainly intend to write to the Commission for Energy Regulation to ask that this sale be forestalled until such an impact analysis has been undertaken into costs for the consumer.</p><p>Finally, what will happen to the employees who have worked in Bord G&aacute;is to build up the company?  It certainly is not true to suggest they all will become wealthy shareholders because the employee share option scheme closed in 2008 and therefore, most current employees do not qualify.  I am concerned that despite the Minister's best intentions, this could be a fire sale of a strategic State asset with little thought given to how it will affect the energy market, employees of the company or customers.  The leading bidders have stated they wish to break up the company post sale, which appears to be a matter of concern.  Will, as I outlined earlier, this valuable asset be broken up and asset stripped?  That certainly would be greatly to be regretted but I would be grateful for the Minister's views on what will happen in respect of the debt on the company and who will be left with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700016#P00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and will cut to the chase regarding representations that have been made by me and many others in the north west on the extension of the gas network into Sligo town and of which the Minister will be aware.  I understand the response has not been favourable because it has been pointed out there must be a large manufacturing or commercial entity operating in Sligo to provide critical mass.  This particular argument has been disputed by Sligo Chamber of Commerce, representing all the businesses in the Sligo area, and I concur with that view because the lack of availability of a sufficient energy resource will act as a disincentive to companies, and larger companies in particular, locating in the north west.  As someone who comes from the west of Ireland, the Minister will be aware one is fighting an uphill battle anyway to attract inward investment into the north west or the west because of their geographical location, peripherality and some misconceptions that these are isolated parts of the country, which of course is completely untrue because of infrastructural developments over the past decade or decade and a half.</p><p>  As the Minister himself pointed out in his opening remarks, our island status makes us acutely aware of the importance of a secure gas supply.  Are there implications in the future for the commercial extraction of gas under the fracking process?  If this happens on the Minister's watch, which apparently will be the case, he undoubtedly will be under enormous pressure to facilitate possible drilling in the Bundoran Basin in the north west, particularly were the Northern side to proceed with drilling, although the position on what will happen there remains uncertain.  The Minister might have a view on this issue.  For example, will the commercial company that will take over and be running the new gas landscape in Ireland have a role in that regard?  Will it be given <i>carte blanche</i> to seek out exploratory potential in the Irish context?  This naturally is an issue that is of particular concern.</p><p>  Another aspect in which I am interested pertains to the Minister's statement, &quot;Initially the troika was not disposed to allow us retain any proceeds from State asset disposals and it insisted that all the proceeds from any such disposals be used for debt reduction.&quot;  He went on to state, &quot;In return for increasing the level of ambition of our asset disposal programme to a target of &euro;3 billion, the troika agreed that half of the proceeds from State asset disposals could be retained to fund additional employment projects of a commercial nature&quot;.  Can the Minister point out what is the Government's view as to what are projects of a commercial nature?  Is there any sort of plan B in this regard?  My initial reaction would have been that all the money should have gone towards debt reduction as the entire purpose of the fiscal policy of the Government is to try to reduce the debt.  The Minister is aware that as a result of the most recent budget and its recent predecessors, people are suffering.  While I do not wish to go down the road of trying to open up the budget debate, it is because of the large debt overhang that many decisions on fiscal policy that are being taken by the present Administration are hurting people severely and will continue to so do in the coming years.  Consequently, I would have thought the Government would have been tempted not to choose the option of arguing with the troika about the disposal of the assets but to seek to reduce the national debt.  After all, &euro;3 billion is a fair whack of money and to put it in context, that is what is being taken out of the economy this year.</p><p>  While I am loth to go down the road of talking about the previous Government's activities, I recall that in 2006, a budget surplus in excess of &euro;3 billion was recorded and the then Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, put more than &euro;2 billion of that surplus into reducing the national debt.  This sometimes is long forgotten but it was at a time when there was so much largesse around that another Minister for Finance might have decided to have spent the money, rather than reducing the national debt.  It was in this context that I was curious to ascertain what informed the Government in this regard, particularly as it has not outlined or been specific about how it will spend the money on what it referred to as &quot;additional employment projects of a commercial nature&quot;.</p></speech>

However, a great deal of the debate has focused on two or three key areas.</p><p>I shall commence by responding to Senator Daly.  He is not the only Member of the House to question whether, as he put it, this is a wise move and said he finds it disturbing.  The truth is that I probably would not have brought the Bill before the House were it not for the extraordinary circumstances in which the country finds itself.  Senator Mulcahy traced its origins in terms of the strictures by the troika and so on.  In reply to Senator Mooney, I do not think it so much about the contribution that it makes to writing down debt that was in their minds.  Rather, it is a standard precept where the IMF, but in this case it was the ECB and the EU, intrude into a country and they insist on that country making a contribution.  I recall meeting my opposite number from Greece, it may have been during the Irish Presidency, and she said that her country did not have the extraordinary figure of &euro;50 billion required in terms of the disposal of state assets and to do so it would need to sell islands.  I do not think the process from the sale would make a great contribution to writing down debt.  Senator Mooney's colleague, Senator Daly, reckons from what he has seen in the public domain, that it would only pay back four weeks of the debt.  I do not think that is the motivation behind the initiative.  The motivation is that the troika insisted, in the bailout programme in 2010, that we would embark on a programme to dispose of State assets.  I traced the events in the other House so there is no point going back over them.  When the new Government first met the troika, the latter put a figure of &euro;5 billion on the measure plus a requirement that the sum would go towards writing down debt.</p><p>The ensuing negotiations lasted more than six months and the troika eventually conceded that the figure would be &euro;3 billion with 50% of that sum being made available for reinvestment purposes in, as Senator Mooney observed, projects of commercial value.  By that I think the troika meant that there must be a manifest commercial return and the projects must be worthwhile in terms of contributing to economic activity and generating employment.  There is an arrangement for the remaining 50% that will, ultimately, go towards writing down debt but can be used for approved projects, in the first instance.</p><p>I cannot get into the business of commenting on what is in the public domain in newspapers.  The information did not come from me and it did not come from my Department.  This arrangement is being handled at an arms length from me and I would have thought that I need not explain to the House why that is the case.  I really cannot go there but can reassure Senators that the notion of Bord G&aacute;is Energy being sold off at a bargain basement price, or anything like it, will not happen.  It has not happened in the case of Irish Life.  Was Irish Life not pulled back from the market because the price at the time was deemed not adequate?  There is no intention on the part of the Government to engage in a fire sale in this instance.  There are good reasons for the way that the matter is being handled.  Lord knows, sufficient funding has been made available to experts working on all sides in order to guide the sale properly.</p><p>I have not heard Senator Mullen verge into economics before and I am a bit surprised that he was so revolted by what he called the machinations and financial wizardry of the vultures out there.  We live in a market economy and these guys are not in it in order to bestow some munificence on Ireland.  I hope they are in it to run a profitable company that will generate employment in this country.  Let us remember that Senator Clune made reference to the history of the company and so on.  The company has a proud history and a proud record and it will continue to grow and thrive.  It will do so because, apart from the retention of the networks and the crucial transmission system, this company will also administer the evolution of Irish Water.  In fact the company will have more employees than it has ever had under its direction.  The company has laid out, engineering wise, technical wise, managerial wise and financial wise, a most impressive programme for the evolution of Irish Water.  I can tell Senators Mullen, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others who asked me that 464 people, or something like that number, work in the energy business but their jobs are assured.  There are 450 people currently employed in the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business and they will transfer to the energy company.</p><p>I think the following distinction is important regarding comparisons with previous privatisations.  Apart from the fact that the sale has been forced on us, it is still not like the privatisation of Irish Sugar and the lamentable negotiations that followed in terms of the sugar quota and all of that.  It is also not like the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  However, I do not challenge what Senators have said about the experience that we were left with as a result of selling it lock, stock and barrel.  Indeed, I remember the robust exchanges between myself and the then Minister and distinguished former Leader of this House.  At the time I accused her of walking up and down Moore Street like Molly Malone selling shares in Telecom &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The company has now made a tremendous revival and is engaged on a very significant programme in the economy regarding the roll-out of fibre, an immensely valuable initiative.</p><p>Senator Mullen is fair to question whether we have learned anything from the past.  I think that we have learned the merit of retaining networks in State ownership.</p><p>I shall comment on some of the other contributions.  Senator Mac Conghail raised a number of questions that, as he said, were provoked by the ghost of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  There is no point in my coming to the House and seeking to nuance what we are doing.  We are doing what we are doing because we do not have any choice.  I would like the Members of the House to tell me what they would sell.  If they accept that there is a stricture on us to come up with a quantum, as a result of the disposal of State assets, I urge them to tell me what they would sell.  To be honest, the State portfolio is much exaggerated.  A great deal of what is left in State ownership does not amount to a hill of beans in the context of, as Senator Daly said, the scale of the debt.  If we are obliged to make a contribution, where do we make it?  It seems to me that this arrangement has a very good chance of producing a win-win for Ireland Incorporated. </p> <p>I cannot imagine why a company would want to buy into the energy sector here and not seek to gain market share, run a profitable company and employ more people.  Meanwhile, we have a very technically professional networks company that will, as a separate subsidiary, oversee and supervise the evolution of Irish Water which will employ a great many more people than in the energy business of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  In that sense, one is looking at something which is not damaging to the country's public interest and has the prospect of growth and development in the future.  The more competition we have in the energy market, the better.</p><p>Senator Barrett raises a more difficult question about the remuneration of the gas pipeline.  That is a more difficult question because it fundamentally questions the regulatory model we have.  Everybody understands why we should have the interconnector.  As a somewhat remote western island, we are at the end of the pipeline and security of supply must be my first consideration.  We saw the pipeline turned off in the recent past, so we must have an interconnector.  If we must have an interconnector, we must have some model to remunerate the investment which went into creating it and, therefore, we must ensure all players are treated equally.</p><p>Maybe, with the wisdom of hindsight, there are Members of the House who hold a point of view which says that in good times, the State should have paid for it and not engaged in the structuring done in terms of the remuneration of the pipeline and the arrangement with Bord G&aacute;is.  Maybe, with the benefit of hindsight, there is some validity in making that point but the fact is that we now have to remunerate it.  Whether it is gas from the Corrib field coming ashore or LNG coming into Tarbert, we must ensure they are all treated equally.</p><p>Senator Barrett will have the opportunity to read a High Court judgment on this in the not too distant future and he may want to re-engage with me.  We may have different views at that time because there is a challenge in the High Court and I expect that, within the next four to six weeks, we will have a decision and the court will rule.  We will deal with that when it happens.</p><p>One of the things of which I am proud is that there is a new east-west interconnector between Ireland and Wales for electricity supply to this island, which is a very positive development.  The whole thrust of European policy is towards integration.  Integration initially will be a matter for this island, the neighbouring island and France.  Again, the hope is that it would put downward pressure on prices and would guarantee security of supply in times of difficulty or interruptions for whatever reason.  The interconnector is a very important limb of it.</p><p>I knew Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh before he became a Member of the House, and I regret he is not present in the Chamber.  He is a particularly intelligent Member of the House for whom I have a lot of regard, but whoever wrote his script is living in cloud cuckoo land.  He ranted on about neoliberalism and the fact this is being sold only for reasons of ideological motivation, but I am afraid that is not the case.  I wish it were that it only had to do with ideology.  Ideological motivation has nothing to do with this.  It is the pragmatics of the only people in the world prepared to lend us money saying that if they are going to do so, we must comply with the following strictures and that if we do not, they will not sign the cheque.  There is no other ideological motivation behind it.</p><p>There is nothing I can say to my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, and I had this debate in the other House.  When I set out the elements of the strategy on wind energy and policy statements, they just ignored them and continued to assert there is no policy.  I have no idea what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh means when he says Sinn F&eacute;in is in favour of wind energy along the lines of the Scottish model.  I would like to hear what he means and maybe I can meet him half-way.</p><p>Capping the salaries of chief executives of State companies at &euro;100,000 may be good populist politics but it is not part of the real world and is not something I can contemplate.  The last thing we want in the running of State companies, which are crucial in a number of areas, is people who are not up to doing the job and of competing with the best.</p></speech>

They are capped at the Taoiseach's salary of &euro;200,000, but his salary nowadays is &euro;100,000 less than what it was when his predecessor was in office.</p><p>I refer to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's query about the Corrib gasfield.  The company will have to make a new application to the Environmental Protection Agency for an integrated pollution prevention control licence.  Neither side sees much of an issue in this and the EPA has put up its hands, so to speak.  However, it will not help in meeting the deadline.  It was hoped 12 months ago that gas would begin to come ashore at the end of 2014, but I do not see that happening.  This will mean it will go into 2015 and, as some Members said, that is to be regretted in the sense that the Corrib field at peak will guarantee 60% of our need.  That is a very valuable contribution.  Realistically, we are talking about it going into 2015.  Again, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is a bit of a Tadhg an d&aacute; thaobh on this issue.  He is taking both sides of the road with him on it.  It would help me if he told me whether he was in favour of the bloody thing coming ashore.  There is no point carping about what is or is not going on.  The State has bent over backwards to deal with issues raised.  In terms of the national interest, the sooner the gas comes ashore, the better.</p><p>That connects into the point my colleague, Senator Kelly, raised about gas supply.  This is always an issue and I know what he is talking about in the context of the report of the Western Development Commission and the contribution the network could make if it were extended to certain towns.</p> <p>Senator Kelly will know it is not entirely separate from the Corrib issue.  The fact that the transmission line was constructed from Galway to the Corrib has enabled adjacent towns to be linked up.</p><p>I understand why public representatives representing their own area would want to have the option of gas but there is a regulatory model that judges whether a particular application passes an economic viability test.  That is a dynamic phenomenon that changes according to the circumstances in the given town.  In Macroom and Nenagh, for example, it was reviewed on the basis of additional information made available.  Senator Kelly raises the point of Shannonside and the particular situation regarding Ballaghaderreen.  Ballaghaderreen is not one of the adjacent towns in terms of the pipeline but it does have a significant employer, Shannonside, which is located in Roscommon, not in Mayo; it is on the road out.  However, I am all the more favourably disposed towards it for that.</p><p>Arrabawn in Nenagh was a major factor, as I understand it, in the review of the decision in respect of Nenagh.  Nenagh and Macroom are now being connected.  There is nothing that prevents a town like Ballaghaderreen re-entering its case but there is an economic viability test in that where it is estimated that the effect of the construction of the pipeline to a more distant town or urban location would result in the prices increasing generally to consumers of gas, that is not permitted.  That is the situation we would have to confront there but it seems to me that in the constant review that goes on, there is a serious case to be made there.  </p><p>I accept the argument being advanced by Senator Kelly that in terms of savings it could mean a great deal to business in a given town.  Senator Mooney raises the same point about Sligo.  In terms of economic activity and savings to companies generating employment, there is no doubt but that the extension of the network would be very helpful.</p></speech>

I am calling for action to be taken to ensure roll-over protective structures, ROPS, also known as roll bars, are installed in all vintage tractors.  The phenomenon of vintage tractor runs is increasing in popularity and is a pastime enjoyed by many people in this country.  Many tens of thousands of euro are raised for charity on a weekly basis by the holding of runs such as the one that will take place in Meath this coming weekend.  I compliment those involved in this activity for their efforts in supporting charities throughout the country.</p><p>  I was contacted recently by Mrs. Carmel Gilsenan from Kilmainhamwood in County Meath whose daughter Gr&aacute;inne, aged 22, died in a tragic accident during a vintage tractor run in June last year.  Gr&aacute;inne was a respected member of her community, very active in charity fund-raising and took great pleasure in participating in vintage tractor runs.  In the aftermath of her death, Gr&aacute;inne's mother has, very generously, voiced her support for the continuation of vintage runs, while also calling for the enforcement of more effective safety precautions in respect of older vehicles.  She asks specifically for legislation to be amended to ensure the installation of safety features such as roll bars are made mandatory for vintage tractors.</p><p>  Mrs. Gilsenan recently told the <i>Meath Chronicle and Cavan and Westmeath Herald</i>:<blockquote>I do think that Gr&aacute;inne died doing what she always wanted to do and was happy in herself.  But I would like to see her memory honoured, to have legislation amended so that roll bars and safety features are made mandatory on these vehicles.  If it would save another person going through this loss it would be worth it.</blockquote>Her words are extremely generous in light of the severe grief she has suffered.  I met Mrs. Gilsenan this week along with members of a vintage club and others who regularly take part in vintage runs, raising significant sums for charity in the process.  They fully support her call.  In fact, many have already voluntarily taken it upon themselves to increase the safety features of their own vehicles.  I understand this can be done at a relatively modest cost.</p><p>  I expect the Minister will point to legislation from a long time ago in arguing that regulations in this regard already exist.  Even if that is the case, the issue must be given more prominence by the Road Safety Authority.  I cannot find any reference to it on the authority's website, which suggests a lack of awareness of the potential dangers.  We must ensure that growing numbers of people who participate in this excellent pastime are doing so safely.  This is particularly pressing in the case of vintage tractors that are used on the road, as opposed to those that are simply for display purposes, such as vehicles show-cased in the Moynalty steam threshing festival.</p><p>  We would all like to see the charity fund-raising facilitated by these events continue and develop.  Indeed, many recipients of the organisers' efforts say that they depend on the funds raised by the vintage runs.  At the same time, however, everybody would like to be confident that safety is a top priority.

As a road safety matter relating to vehicle standards, I have accepted the transfer of the matter from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>It is generally accepted that tractors operated unsafely are potentially lethal, and accidents involving agricultural tractors account for a very high proportion of all farm accidents each year.  In fact, statistics compiled by the Health and Safety Authority show that farm vehicles and machinery account for the highest proportion of farm deaths and accidents.  In the period 2000 to 2010, 19% of fatalities involving vehicles were as a direct result of the vehicle overturning while being driven by the operator.</p><p>It is important to address any perception that there are no safety standards in place for vintage tractors.  On the contrary, the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1969 require all tractors used in a public place, irrespective of age, to have roll-over protective structures of an appropriate standard fitted.  These generally take the form of a cab or frame that provides a safe environment for the tractor operator in the event of a roll-over.  Also known as anti-roll bars or cabs, they are designed to prevent death, minimise injury and protect the driver from being crushed if the tractor overturns.  The regulations, which have been in effect since 1 September 1977, mean that all vintage tractors - that is, tractors which are more than 30 years old - which are driven in a public place for whatever reason, whether taking part in a vintage run or otherwise, must, by law, have the safety structures referred to by the Senator.  A public place is defined in road traffic legislation as &quot;any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge&quot;.</p><p>Enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Regulations provide that the penalty for a breach is a direct summons to court and, on conviction, a class C fine, namely, up to &euro;2,500, or a prison sentence or both.  This relates to the person who commits the offence and the owner of the vehicle.  I am advised that the protection structures must pass a series of static or dynamic crush tests.  These tests examine the ability of the structures to withstand various loads in order to ascertain whether the protective zone around the operator station remains intact in an overturn.  The tests are extensive and destroy the roll-over protective structure.</p><p>A homemade bar attached to the tractor axle cannot protect the operator if the tractor overturns.  Vintage tractor owners should not, therefore, add their own roll-over protection devices to tractors which were manufactured without such protections.  Without proper design and testing, homemade devices offer a false sense of security which can be more dangerous than operating a tractor without ROPS.  The Organisation for Economic Co­operation and Development, OECD, has standards for the design of roll-over protective structures, and these are the appropriate standards referenced in the road traffic regulations.</p><p>There are several ways to reduce the possibility of tractor roll-overs, but it is important to remember that they are not a substitute for ROPS.  Operators of tractors equipped with ROPS are advised to avoid sharp turns and reduce speed when turning because, unlike cars, tractors have a high centre of gravity and can tip or overturn more easily.  Drivers are also advised to avoid driving on steep embankments, near ditches and around holes.  These areas are more likely to lead to a roll-over because the ground can give way and the tractor lose support.  When conditions require operation on steep slopes, operators should travel in the forward direction down the slope and in the reverse direction back up the slope.  This will place the tractor in a more stable position and reduce roll-over risks.  Older tractors can be retrofitted with roll-over protections systems, for which vehicle owners are advised to engage the services of a dealer for their particular brand of tractor.  The services of an automotive engineer may also be required in instances where a particular brand or marque of tractor is no longer in production.</p><p>In short, in the interests of safety for both driver and other road users, owners and operators of vintage agricultural tractors are obliged to mount roll-over protection on their vehicles when in use in a public place.  The age of the vehicle has no bearing on this requirement.</p></speech>

A review of the regulations, which were introduced in 1969, might well be timely.  Will the Minister ask the Road Safety Authority to give more priority to raising awareness of this issue?

Senator Averil Power could not believe my excitement at the prospect.</p><p>Last July the Minister said in the D&aacute;il during Leaders' Questions that dealing with the issue of youth unemployment is what gets him and his Government colleagues up in the morning.</p> <p>However, after the call for submissions for the jobs action plan went out, I question whether he might be a bit of a late starter in the mornings.  When the budget cuts on young people were introduced earlier this week, I had a lot of questions about that.  Not only is youth unemployment not included in one of the seven priorities named in the call for submissions for the action plan, there has been no indication that there will be any specific jobs strategy for young people in the plan, as was called for by the USI, the ISSU or ICTU, or even our own Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs.  If we take that in tandem with the cuts to the jobseeker's allowance this week, I would be very fearful that we are not prioritising youth unemployment and that we might actually be brushing the problem under the carpet.</p><p> On today's edition of <i>www.thejournal.ie</i>, two former presidents of the students' union in Trinity College Dublin and UCD, Andrew Bryne and Dan Hayden, sum up brilliantly the plight of young people and what the budget has done for them.<blockquote>The cuts to jobseeker's allowance for those under 26 will have the effect of pushing a significant number of young people below the poverty line and out of the country...The best that can be said about the impact of the policies towards young people pursued by this Government since it took power is that they are consistent.  Consistent in imposing the costs of adjustment on those least able to resist them.  And consistent in pushing them towards leaving this country. </blockquote>In the same publication, Dan O'Neill and Fiona Dunkin state the following.<blockquote>The government are seizing the independence of an entire group, increasing their dependence on their already hard-pressed parents and forcing many into poverty.<br />The considerably widely-held notion of &quot;getting on your bike&quot; and finding a job is utterly ridiculous.  With one report from , it is quite clear that we cannot cycle along a route to nowhere.</blockquote>These are just some of the contributions in the media from a number of observers.</p><p> Funding was made available this week for the youth guarantee, which was supposed to be the cornerstone of a policy to help young people who were not in employment, education or training, but only &euro;14 million was allocated.  Only a number of months ago, the European Union affairs committee put together a report on the youth guarantee.  It was a cross-party report that was built on consensus, with a lot of input from youth organisations like the National Youth Council of Ireland, the European Youth Forum and previous board members of Youthreach.  They called for the Swedish model of the youth guarantee to be implemented.  That is supposed to be best practice and under that model, &euro;6,600 per participant would be allocated, but the allocations announced here the other day came to &euro;260.22 per young person who is officially unemployed under the Quarterly National Household Survey.</p><p> When the Minister was questioned earlier this year about youth unemployment, the TD involved said that he should stay in bed if that was the best he could do.  I would not say that myself, but I would agree that if youth unemployment was such a pressing concern, there should be a national jobs strategy for young people included in the action plan for jobs for next year, and that he would take submissions from the relevant groups on this.  If possible, he would also meet the Minister, Deputy Burton, and examine the cuts to the youth jobseeker's allowance and how that affects young people in looking for employment, and how it could actually restrict them from actively seeking work.</p></speech>

Her comments may be based on a misunderstanding.  What she describes as seven priorities actually referred to what we had in the 2013 action plan, which were described as disruptive reforms.  They were catalysts in particular areas that had a cross-sectoral potential to impact jobs.  They included things like "Big Data", ICT skills, trading on-line and so on.  They were not categories of need or sectors.  They looked at opportunities that could drive change across a range of sectors.</p><p>The action plan for jobs had a substantial section dealing with Pathways to Work, which is the scheme run primarily by the Minister for Social Protection.  That is a very substantial programme which seeks to reduce unemployment right across the board.  Very substantial investments in that programme are already in place.  JobBridge has 6,000 participants, 3,000 of which are under 25.  Among those under 25, there are 12,000 on F&Aacute;S courses, 6,500 on Back to Education and VTOS courses, 6,000 on Youthreach courses and 1,250 on Momentum.  There are 28,000 special provisions being made to deal with youth unemployment before yesterday's budget announcement.  The Minister indicated that she plans to increase that in the context of the youth guarantee, and I saw a figure of 4,500 additional places quoted in her comments.</p><p>The philosophy of this Government is to see young people under 25 on the dole as a bridging period, where the thrust of what are seeking to do is to develop opportunities for young people.  That is why if people take up courses like Momentum or Back to Education, they will get additional payment but more importantly, they will get a really valuable opportunity.  We are in the fortunate position compared to the last five years in that our economy is now creating employment.  Last year, 39,000 jobs were created in the private sector.  Our ambition is to make sure that young people get access to more of them.</p><p>The Senator is absolutely right to say that one of the big casualties of this recession has been young people.  The traditional catch-22 of not having experience has often meant that where jobs have been created, they are not getting opportunities.  That is why JobBridge and Springboard course are such important programmes, as they provide practical on-the-job experience which breaks that catch-22.  Their placement rates are very impressive, with over 60% from JobBridge.</p><p>We are open for submissions at the moment in the action plan for 2014.  We have received a substantial number of submissions.  It is correct to say that one of the things we need to examine is to build a bridge between the activity around the youth guarantee and the enterprise sector.  One of the issues that we will be examining is how to make sure that the schemes we have put in place - the most recent is the &euro;72 per week subsidy for any employer who takes on a person who is a year out of work, be they young or old - get a strong take up and are relevant to industries.  It is a similar case with the Momentum and Springboard courses.  I work very closely with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to make sure that there is a fit between the emerging sectors that are doing well in the economy and the training and work experience that they are providing.  I think we can look to build stronger bridges in that area.  We are not as fortunate as countries like Germany, where there is a strong tradition of  companies having traineeship places which they maintain in good times and in bad times.  That tradition is not as strong in Ireland, but we need to build those bridges between people who are out of work and enterprise.  The other area we are really excited about is entrepreneurship and the potential for more enterprise.   Mr. Sean O'Sullivan is working on an entrepreneurship strategy and within that, we will be looking at the at the scope for initiatives specifically targeted at youth start-ups for 2014.</p><p>While I understand that there will always be a certain amount of political overplay in the comments being made, the Senator raises a very important issue and there are bridges to be built here.  There is real potential and if the Senator wishes to make submissions for the 2014 plan, we will look seriously at any comments, through Forf&aacute;s.  There is a certain division of labour between what I do, which is essentially related to enterprise, and what the Minister for Social Protection does, which is essentially about Pathways to Work.  We are trying to make sure that the bridges between those two are forged in a strong fashion.</p></speech>

If I was a member of a youth organisation or an advocacy group like ICTU or USI and had put together a document on the youth sector and on youth unemployment, it does not make it easy for me to make that submission.</p> <p>All I ask today is that the Minister issue a press release so that these groups know that the submission process is open.  It is a targeted need and I do not want to make a political point about it because it is important to me and it affects my peer group.  Could the Minister meet these groups or make sure that they are aware of the submission process because it is a big issue in the economy and society?</p></speech>

It will come as a huge relief to people who have not been able to repair their homes and have waited a long time for a solution to be agreed at a national level.  I am disappointed that the Government has not been able to secure a levy on the industry yet.  I hope the issue will be revisited after the various court cases conclude.  It is only right that the industry pays its fair share rather than the burden's falling on the taxpayer.</p><p>  I commend the Government on moving to put the remediation scheme in place and acknowledge the work the Minister and the former Minister of State, the late Deputy Shane McEntee, did on this issue over the past couple of years to bring about a solution.  I am, however, very concerned that the scheme will not provide any compensation for people who have had to repair their homes themselves before now.  While some developers carried out pyrite remediation works on the properties that they built, others have refused to do so.  Many families have had to pay for the work themselves.  Some have spent over &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 on tests to identify the extent of the problem, on the physical repair works, on temporary accommodation and on storage while their homes were uninhabitable.  That is a huge sum of money for any family to have to pay.  As Sandra Lewis of the Pyrite Action Group pointed out yesterday, homeowners in their thirties could do this only by re-mortgaging or borrowing to pay for that work.  Older couples had to dip into their life savings to fix their homes.  It was not that these people could afford to pay for that work.  In many cases it was that they simply could not afford not to do it because their homes would have been uninhabitable otherwise.  It has taken many years, as the Minister knows, to bring about a solution. </p><p>  I know that when the Minister was asked yesterday why these homes were not covered by the scheme he said people should take cases against developers to get the money back but for many that is not realistic because many developers have gone out of business and been declared bankrupt, and it would be futile for those families to chase somebody from whom they have no realistic opportunity of recovering money.</p><p>  While I welcome the scheme I think it is unfair that those families have been excluded.  The same families were denied an exemption from the local property tax.  I communicated earlier this year with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on behalf of several families who, because they had paid for the remediation work themselves before the property tax exemption came in had to pay the full property tax.  They pointed out to me that other families who had the work done a couple of months later would not have to pay the property tax and will now have the works paid for too.</p><p>  Will the Minister extend the scheme to provide compensation for people who really had no choice but to carry out the work themselves before now?  Will there be enough money over the next couple of years to pay for this work?  I understand that the Minister indicated yesterday that the &euro;10 million is initial funding and that more is expected over the next two or three years but I did not see a figure for what exactly the Minister intends to be put in place, or indeed, if there is any agreement in the Department of Finance about funding for the following years.  The Minister is aware that there are some indications that it could cost up to &euro;50 million.  The funding announced yesterday seems to be just for the 1,000 homes in the red category, those which are worst affected.  It has been estimated that up to 12,500 homes could be affected by pyrite.  Will there be enough money to cover everybody who has been affected?  When will the necessary legislation to establish the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, be brought before the Oireachtas?</p><p>  The Leader of the House indicated yesterday that he had spoken to the Minister and that the Minister had indicated that he might bring the Bill first to the Seanad.  Can he indicate when that might occur because I understand that the board needs to be put on a statutory footing before it can start to make payments?  Finally, have plans to levy the industry been shelved altogether or do the Minister and the Government intend to revisit the issue after the relevant court cases have concluded? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-10-17a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013101700023#W00900"><p>If I had known that all those questions would be asked I would have been better prepared to answer them.  I will try my best.</p><p>  The Government has approved initial funding of &euro;10 million for a pyrite remediation scheme, with additional funding to be allocated over the next two years from the capital stimulus programme which will be announced in early 2014.  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with circa 1,000 houses which it is estimated are in need of immediate repair, and will be delivered under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The legislation to put this into effect will be enacted before the end of the year and will commence in the Seanad.  The post-2015 funding position will be dealt with having regard to the position at that time and developments in the meantime.</p><p>  This is not a compensation scheme; it is a scheme to remediate homes which have significant pyritic damage and where the homeowner has no other viable means of redress and can establish this to the satisfaction of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  The terms of the scheme require prior approval and the scope of the scheme is limited to dwellings which have significant pyritic damage as defined in the Irish Standard 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hard-core material.  As it is a targeted scheme and requires prior approval, it follows that the terms of the scheme cannot be retrospectively applied and this is in line with how schemes generally operate.  There is always a cut-off point for new schemes.</p><p>  While I have stated on many occasions that the State is neither culpable nor liable for the pyrite problem, nonetheless the Government has, in the public interest, decided that solutions should be provided for that group of homeowners whose homes have been significantly damaged by pyritic heave and who have been left with no viable means of redress.  The terms of the pyrite remediation scheme, already published in outline by the PRB, will not be affected by the new funding arrangements which will have other advantages and enable the PRB to have the programme implemented in a more direct and efficient manner, now that the taxpayer is funding it directly.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the long delay that many affected homeowners have had to endure waiting for solutions to the pyrite problems in their homes.  The purchase of a home is likely to be the largest single investment most people will make in their lifetime and they have a justifiable expectation that their home will be a place of enjoyment for themselves and their families for many years.  I am reforming the building control regime which has left a Celtic tiger scar on many people with problems in their homes, not least in Priory Hall but also with pyrite and in unfinished estates.  However, for homeowners affected by pyrite, living in their homes has not turned out to be the enjoyable experience they had hoped for.</p><p>  I understand how these situations have developed and I will pursue, once the court cases are finished opportunities and solutions to see how we can extract some financial assistance and redress from the builders and developers who caused this problem.  Much remediation of homes has already happened because people had insurance or the developers and builders who were involved in the scheme and raised the possibility of assistance with them personally have dealt directly with certain homeowners in order to reduce the impact.  Hundreds of homes have been remediated in this fashion.  The new pyrite remediation scheme will help 1,000 householders over the next two years.  I am implementing a scheme where my predecessors looked on and did nothing.</p></speech>

Some families that have been in touch with me told me how the insurance covered the building works but would not cover the testing which costs &euro;3,000 and they were left to pay that bill.  Nobody suggests that the State should reimburse people for work that has already been covered by a builder or insurance policy.</p> <p>The problem is that there are families who are in extra debt because they had to do the work, not because they could afford to do it or because it was easy for them.  They had to remortgage their home or take out other loans to pay for it.  It is unfair that such families will not be covered by the scheme.  I urge the Minister to revisit the issue in advance of the legislation being drawn up.  I will make the point, as will colleagues on all sides, when the legislation comes before the House.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to revisit the levy when court cases are concluded.  That is important.  If there is any way of recovering some of the money for the taxpayer it should be done.  The other issues I raised are all questions that have been asked publicly in the past 24 hours since the scheme was announced.  If the Minister is not in a position to answer them now he might correspond with me in writing.</p></speech>
