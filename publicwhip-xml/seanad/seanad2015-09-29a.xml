On a side issue, I compliment him on his appearance on "The Late Late Show".  It looked like a very enjoyable one for him.</p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, the background to this debate is the withdrawal by HIQA of the registration of St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon.  This decision, which was made amid great controversy, received a negative reaction from the staff and supporters of St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital, particularly regarding the manner in which it happened.  However, my understanding now is that steps are afoot to improve the situation at the hospital to comply with HIQA regulations.  I also understand that the imminent opening of a new 20-bed primary care centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, which will result in the transfer of 20 patients from St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital to Ballinamore, will go a long way towards compliance.  The view of the HSE north west is that St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital will be re-registered in a short space of time.  That is the background and context to this debate.</p> <p>The HSE has made an application for funding for the construction of a new 90-bed state-of-the-art unit on lands adjacent to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital that have been acquired.  My understanding is that plans and proposals are at a very advanced stage and that a commitment from the Minister and the Department to fund the new facility is all that is required now.  I am sure the Minister will confirm that or clarify the situation.</p> <p>I might put it on the record that St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital was originally a Famine workhouse.  As it has been there since 1841, plainly it is not fit for purpose.  While I appreciate that there are similar establishments across the country with a similar history, I would like to think that the St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital facility is rather unique in this regard.  It is a great tribute to the doctors, nurses and general staff of the hospital that they have maintained it to the highest possible standard.</p> <p>Despite the conclusions of the HIQA report, the general view of the public and particularly of family relatives of those who are cared for at St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital is that it is a facility of the highest standard and that the commitment of the nursing staff and doctors is unrivalled.  It is for that reason that the HIQA decision caused a great deal of local anger and was seen as an unfair portrayal of an institution that has struggled to maintain those high standards in the face of serious difficulties for a long period of time.</p> <p>As I said at the outset, it looks like this particular situation is going to be resolved in the short term.  I hope that will happen.  The main purpose of my contribution is to plead with the Minister to provide the necessary funding so that the new state-of-the-art facility in the capital town of County Leitrim can go ahead forthwith.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is vitally important that such a facility be located in the county and I would hate to think anything would endanger the future of such a facility and that it would be due to lack of funding, given that all the t's have been crossed and the i's dotted in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-09-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015092900002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Mooney for reporting this important issue.  I am taking the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is at another event.  The Government's policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  If it becomes necessary for an older person to move to a nursing home, appropriate accommodation must be available that meets his or her care needs and matches his or her wishes.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.  The hospital was built in 1841 and has been used as a care facility since 1928.  The centre has an occupancy of 85 beds, comprising 63 continuing care beds and 22 short-term care beds used for rehabilitation, convalescence, respite or palliative care.</p> <p>Since 2009, all nursing homes - public, private and voluntary - have been registered and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The most recent HIQA report on the hospital was published last July.  Although the report acknowledged that progress had been made and improvements were evident since previous inspections, some concerns were reported, including the physical infrastructure of the facility.  I have been informed by the HSE that a substantial action plan has been submitted to HIQA.  This sets out what has already been achieved since the inspection and provides identified dates for the actions required by HIQA to be completed.  Part of the HSE longer-term plan for County Leitrim includes the opening of a newly-built, 20-bed community nursing unit in Ballinamore.  The HSE has applied to HIQA to register this facility and is in the process of recruiting staff.  It is expected that the unit will open before the end of this year.  This will allow patients from the area who are currently resident in St. Patrick's to transfer to Ballinamore.  As a result, there will be some reduction in bed numbers at St. Patrick's, allowing more space, privacy and dignity for the remaining residents, so addressing HIQA's concerns about lack of privacy for some residents in St. Patrick's.  The opening of Ballinamore will ensure overall bed numbers are maintained in the south Leitrim area.  The new unit will be operated and run by the HSE.</p> <p>A number of community nursing units, CNUs, similar to St. Patrick's hospital are very old and it can be very difficult or costly to adapt them to modern standards.  Discussions are ongoing between HIQA and the HSE about the conditions that will apply to public facilities across the country.  Later today, I will announce the total funding that will be available for capital investments in the health sector over the coming years.  This will allow the HSE to frame a capital plan that balances priorities across the health service with the available funding.  The overriding objective will be to ensure, in so far as possible, that when older people need care in public and residential facilities, it is available for them.  Although many public facilities are not in line with how modern residential units are designed and configured, the standard of care provided to residents is generally of a very high standard.  Residents and their families frequently express their appreciation of the care they receive and continue to choose such facilities even when alternatives are available.  My Department will work with the HSE to allocate whatever funds are available in the most effective way possible, with the safety and welfare of residents being our top priority.</p> <p>The Senator is probably aware that the capital plan for 2016 to 2021 was published in the last hour or so.  It allocated an additional &euro;300 million to the Department of Health for community nursing units and disability facilities over the next six years, and this is in addition to what was already in the budget.  Although I cannot say at this stage how it will break down and which projects will be funded when, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is working with the HSE on it with a view to making an announcement on a national basis during the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

It begs the obvious question, which he has partially answered, as to whether, as a result of the increased allocation in the community service sector, which is welcome, the new unit in St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon will go ahead.  I understand it is not necessarily directly in the Minister's brief and that the Minister of State will make the allocations.  When the Minister said it would be a matter of weeks, will it be before or after the budget?</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and am pleased to be able to raise the critical issue of the rolling out of the free BreastCheck screening for women between the ages of 65 and 69.  Since the introduction and publication of my first policy paper, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, in 2006 I have been passionately campaigning for the abolition of the 64 year age limit on BreastCheck as one in ten of all breast cancers occur in women between the ages of 65 and 69.</p> <p>On 15 October 2014, the Minister announced that free BreastCheck screening would be rolled out to women between the ages of 65 and 69.  I spoke to the Minister that day and was absolutely thrilled because I had been campaigning for that for a long time.  Everyone at the announcement on 15 October was beaming with delight.  The Irish Cancer Society welcomed the decision to make the necessary investment to ensure BreastCheck is extended to women aged 65 to 69, saying it was the right decision, which would save a minimum of 87 women's lives per year.</p> <p>Some time later, in response to a parliamentary question submitted by Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on health, Deputy Billy Kelleher, I learned that the free BreastCheck for women aged 65-69 will not commence until the fourth quarter of 2015.  I could not believe it.  The Minister announced it on 15 October and I was sure something was going to happen quickly.  I also learned that the screening of women in the 65-69 age group will only be fully implemented by 2021.  In the meantime, 609 Irish women will lose their lives before any real progress is made by the Government's 2021 target.  The day the Minister launched it, on 15 October last year, I was genuinely thrilled and so impressed with him.  We then found out a couple of months later that it would not be rolled out until the fourth quarter of this year.</p> <p>I am very disappointed.  I felt I was led astray when the public announcement was made outside the gate of Leinster House.  It was said it would commence in the fourth quarter of this year, 2015.  I do not want to hear about any administrative difficulties or lack of radiographers.  We were not told anything about that on the day of the launch.  I am a very straight person and this is business, not personal.  Given that the Minister launched it that day, I felt I was deceived to hear that this would take so long and that we would have to wait until the first quarter of 2015 for this free BreastCheck screening to be rolled out.</p> <p>It is ageism that women are not getting a free BreastCheck.  It is Irish ageism.  There is more ageism in Ireland than in any other country in the world, from my experience.  I do not notice it myself - I am very lucky - but it is endemic in society.  This is typical.  Women in this age group are more prone to breast cancer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-09-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015092900002#D00400"><p>I thank Senator White for raising this issue again in the Seanad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->BreastCheck is now in its 16th year and currently offers a free mammogram every two years to women aged 50 to 64.  Under BreastCheck, more than 1.3 million mammograms have been provided to more than 478,000 women, and more than 8,300 cancers have been detected.  Last November, I announced the extension of BreastCheck to the 65 to 69 age group, in keeping with EU guidelines.  The age extension will be complete by 2021.  The additional eligible population is approximately 100,000 and, when the programme is fully implemented, 540,000 women will be included in the BreastCheck programme.  Due to the number of people who will be added to the breast screening service and the fact that women are screened on a two-year cycle, the task of extending the age cohort is a major logistical and operational undertaking.  This is why the age extension will be implemented on an incremental basis in line with the capacity of the service to manage the additional screening and follow-up workload.</p><p>The National Screening Service will need to recruit and train additional radiographers, medical consultants and administrative support to accommodate the increased demand for the BreastCheck programme.  Funding for this and for additional mobile units and medical equipment will be made available across the implementation period.  A provision of &euro;100,000 was made to commence implementation in the final quarter of 2015.</p><p>Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years, with the five-year survival rate now estimated at 81% for women diagnosed between 2006 and 2011.  This is an increase from 72% for women diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.  The increase is due to a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.</p><p>The national cancer control programme has focused on improving the quality of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion and by applying best practice in areas such as prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment.  Surgery has been reorganised into the eight designated cancer centres, and full breast cancer services are also provided at Letterkenny General Hospital as a satellite of University Hospital Galway.  Referral guidelines for GPs have also been developed to achieve a more effective and integrated service.  In June 2015, I launched the national clinical guidelines on the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with breast cancer.  Clinical effectiveness is fundamental to our health service, and implementing good-quality clinical guidelines and audit can improve health outcomes for patients, reduce variations in practice and improve the quality of clinical decisions.</p><p>In conclusion, I am committed to extending BreastCheck to those aged 65 to 69 on a phased basis between now and 2021.  It is necessary to do this on an incremental basis in line with the capacity of the service to manage the additional screening of approximately 100,000 women and then to follow them up properly.  If BreastCheck managers believe the process can be done more quickly, they will have my support, but I will not rush them.  If the process is rushed, the standards may fall.  I regret that the Senator felt led astray or deceived in any way but I was very clear in my budget statement that week as to what was happening.  It was also made very clear in the service plan published in November.  I certainly would encourage the Senator to inform herself fully by reading those speeches and the service plan before coming to conclusions.  It may be the case that she was not led astray or deceived but rather that she was not fully informed.</p></speech>

I believed that he would roll it out quickly.  I will ask one question before pointing out another issue relating to BreastCheck.  How many women in the final quarter will be able to avail of the free BreastCheck exam?</p> <p>A serious matter was drawn to my attention by a woman at the weekend.

Today, we will announce the Government's capital spending plans for the remainder of the decade and our spending plans for education are vital.  It is important that we continue to invest in education, expand choice and end the era of Fianna F&aacute;il flat-pack prefab schools.  It is also important that we get the future development of the sector right and ensure such mistakes are not made again.  Will the Minister provide an update on the review of the post-primary school places that will be required from 2017 onwards?

I welcome the opportunity to set out the position on the Minister's behalf with regard to the Department's review of the post-primary school places that will be required from 2017 onwards.</p> <p>Due to unprecedented demographic growth, 27 new primary schools and 26 new post-primary schools will be established, or will be in the process of being established, between the years 2011 and 2016.  The purpose of each of these schools is to meet a specific demographic need within a defined geographic area, that is, to ensure that every child and young person living in a particular area can have access to a physical school place within that area.</p> <p>The Department uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where the pressure for school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection in addition to the Department&rsquo;s own databases.  It also uses data from the local authorities.  With this information the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p> <p>The Department is in the process of concluding a report on the outcome of an exercise to determine where additional post-primary school accommodation will be needed from 2017 onwards.  The demographic exercise encompassed all areas of the country, including Newbridge and Kildare.  The Minister will shortly announce the details of the new post-primary schools to be provided nationwide arising from this exercise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Alex White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2219"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2219&amp;amp;pid=AlexWhite&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Arrangements will also be made to provide additional post-primary accommodation to existing schools where the demographic demand warrants this.</p><p>Where new schools are to be established, the Department runs an open patronage determination process to decide who will operate the schools.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply under this process.</p><p>More than &euro;2.2 billion in funding is being invested by my Department under its five year school capital investment plan 2012-2016.  In excess of &euro;1.5 billion of this is being allocated for the funding of major school building projects.  The balance is being used for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the emergency works scheme and the acquisition of sites.  Full details of all projects both planned and ongoing are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Earlier this year the Minister announced that seven new primary schools will be established in the next two years to meet demographic needs in different areas of the country.  Nine new post-primary schools will open over the same period.  This includes a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school, Celbridge community school, which opened in interim accommodation this September 2015.  A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school, Maynooth community college, opened in 2014.  Both of these projects are on the five-year plan, as is a replacement school building for the existing Maynooth post-primary school.  Planning is also under way on the next five-year school capital investment plan.</p></speech>

It is a sort of term of art in Government, but I understand from the Minister that this work is ongoing, as I stated in the response, and that she intends expediting this as soon as possible.  There is no question of it amounting to a period of years.  I would hope it will be in the coming period.  Obviously, the announcements to be made today in the context of the capital programme are relevant also in terms of the funding that will be available for this critically important agenda.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  If I can assist her in any way, in contact with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, I will certainly do that.</p></speech>

As he is aware, I am not a fan of wind energy, which I believe is a folly.  When we do a cost-benefit analysis subsequently we will discover that.  However, that is not the essence of the matter I raise, which is to discuss the community fund these wind farm developers put in place.  When communities fight against these developments and lose, and these unsightly turbines are imposed upon them, there should be certainty as to how much the community will benefit from the wind farm developments.  They need to be set by the Minister and not the way it is being done currently, which is that the more one objects, the more one will get and if one does not object to a wind farm development, one will get nothing.</p> <p>I will give the Minister an example.  In Sliabh B&aacute;n, in County Roscommon, there are 20 wind turbines which stand 130 m high into the sky.  They will destroy the landscape of Sliabh B&aacute;n.  On initial consultation the wind farm developers were offering &euro;57,000 a year to the local community.  Following further consultation and discussion they increased that to &euro;87,000 per year.  The first problem with that is that in the United Kingdom, and we always say we follow the UK model because that is the way they do their business, they decide how much the community gets based on a certain amount of money per megawatt produced.  That is &pound;5,000 per annum per megawatt being produced.  If that were to apply to Sliabh B&aacute;n, in County Roscommon, the community would be getting &euro;420,000 per annum.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Kelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It appears that, through negotiation, the Sliabh B&aacute;n group has managed to get &euro;1,500 per megawatt produced, while in the UK the amount would be &euro;7,500 per megawatt produced.  A fair fee needs to be set by the Minister.  What is not fair is the negotiated amount in place.  Second, the wind farm developers need to deal with a local community group to decide where the money is spent.  What is happening in this particular case is that the developers are handing the money over to the Leader programme.  The Leader programme will accept applications from football clubs and so on but many local people will not benefit.  Farmers who are adjacent to these developments, perhaps 500 m away, have their land devalued as a result and get nothing.  Many of the local people will end up with nothing.  Basically, we are buying off community groups with a set of jerseys every year.  It is not fair on most of the people who lose out as a result of these developments.</p></speech>

Following its publication, the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of more than 1,200 written submissions and 13 stakeholder seminars, held in Dublin, Westmeath, Sligo, Cork and Wexford, on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper.</p><p>A recurring message coming from the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems.  The views submitted are being considered in the formation and finalisation of the energy White Paper, which will be published before the end of the year, and which will, <i>inter alia</i>, address community energy projects and how best to facilitate communities in playing their part in the energy transition.</p><p>My Department is also preparing to publish a draft renewable electricity policy and development framework.  The framework, which addresses the matters of early consultation, community engagement, and building community gain considerations into energy infrastructure planning and budgeting, will be published for public consultation in the coming weeks.  I look forward to receiving submissions, which will be considered in the context of the strategic environmental assessment, the appropriate assessment under the habitats directive and the subsequent finalisation of the framework.</p><p>I should also highlight the various community-level initiatives administered on behalf of the Department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  These include the development of community energy projects through the Better Energy Communities programme, which allows community- and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities.  It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost employment.</p><p>On the specific issue the Senator has raised, the notion that community engagement and citizen engagement could be reduced to - as he rightly put it - the idea of a set of jerseys for the local team is completely unacceptable and inadequate in terms of constituting any kind of community engagement policy.  Despite the impression conveyed by the Senator's question, the community benefit fund was established by the developers.  It is not something they do in agreement with me.  As matters currently stand, I do not have any legal or other means to intercede or to involve myself in the community benefit fund.  However, what we have done as a Government, and what my predecessors have done, is to set a policy directive in relation to community engagement.  That community engagement has to be real and robust and in many cases it has been neither.  Certainly, that has to be greatly improved, and I think the White Paper will help us to do that.  I should also clarify for the Senator and the House that the Minister of the day does not have an involvement with wind farm developers in that way; in other words, it is not a question of me as Minister, or my predecessors or successors, entering into agreements or contracts with wind farm operators.  That is not the way the system works.  We have a price support system through REFIT.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Alex White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2219"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2219&amp;amp;pid=AlexWhite&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When project promoters are successful in terms of gaining access to REFIT funds, that is administered by the regulator.  There is not this kind of close nexus, that may be suggested, between the Minister, whoever the Minister is, and particular wind farm developers.</p><p>It is not possible under current arrangements to do the sort of thing that the Senator has advocated.  I agree with his basic point that we do not currently have in place a sufficiently robust regime of community engagement.  We must do an awful lot to improve it and the White Paper will help us to do so.</p></speech>

I read in my local newspaper this week that the ESB has launched a scheme called community fund 2015 for another development in County Roscommon.  At least it has advertised that it is willing to sit down with communities to talk to people and agree a set figure.</p> <p>I shall return to the point I made earlier.  In Sliabh B&aacute;n people were originally offered &euro;1,000 per MW produced but that offer was increased to &euro;1,500 after negotiations.  A Minister in the UK, and that is why I suggest that the Minister here should analyse how the calculation came about, introduced a rate that is five times greater than what wind farm developers get away with here.  The final rate is purely down to the Minister here.  I would appreciate if he would examine what mechanisms were brought into place in the UK that have given greater security to communities there.  People know what they are going to get when they learn what size of wind farm development is going ahead.</p></speech>

I will carefully consider what he has said.  I have looked at the models adopted in other countries.  It is not just in the UK but in northern Europe where a regime has been developed whereby communities, local groups, sometimes co-operatives have equity in wind farms comprised of one or two turbines and, in some cases, larger enterprises.  The Senator has made a very helpful and useful point which I shall carefully consider.</p></speech>

One hopes that the litany of broken promises does not follow if the Government is returned to power.  One of the details that has emerged is that there will be approximately &euro;18 million for the refurbishment of Garda stations.  It has not been missed by the public that the closure by the Government of 139 Garda stations throughout the country has saved just &euro;500,000.  I am sure the Leader would agree that the value of rural Ireland far outweighs the price or cost of &euro;500,000 and I wonder if the capital plan will adequately address the contempt with which the Government has pursued the facilitation of rural decline over the past four years.  I very much hope it does because the &euro;30 million announced at the National Ploughing Championships last week was nothing short of an insult to the people of rural and regional Ireland.</p> <p>I would like to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, comes to the House and explains to Members and to the people of Ireland who is driving the bus in the Department of Health.  It seems that, reminiscent of the Fennelly report, he intends to threaten the sacking of individuals if improvements are not made in the numbers on trolleys throughout the country.  Indeed, August, traditionally a quiet month, saw the largest number of patients on trolleys throughout the country.  One wonders how many there will be in January unless the Government takes the reins, stops being a commentator on the Department of Health and realises that it is the Minister who is supposed to be driving that bus.  There has been a 400% increase in those waiting for more than a year and a 65% increase in my county of Sligo.  The Minister, instead of threatening to fire people who are on his staff, should consider his own position and perhaps resign because the buck stops with him.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wished him well on the day he took over here because I felt he had the ability and the direct speaking style to get to the bottom of the problem.

I do not think there is any way to portray this as anything other than good news, no matter how the Opposition may try.  A significant investment of &euro;27 billion will be made over a six-year period.  We are seeing really positive plans under a whole range of headings.  In the transport area, the metro north project, which includes a link to the airport, and the cross-city Luas project will be developed.  The importance of cross-Border co-operation is evident in the allocation of &euro;31 million for heritage and cultural investment.  We are seeing significant provision being made for demographic increases in the education sector, with 19,000 additional primary school places to be provided by 2018.  Major investments are to be made in justice, housing and health as well.  I do not think there is any way to portray this as anything other than good news.  It is extremely welcome.  I do not doubt that over the coming weeks, we will be in a position to tease out some of the detail of the capital investment plan and debate it further.  This morning's announcement was accompanied by further good news on unemployment.  It was announced today that the unemployment figure has decreased to 9.4%.  As colleagues of mine have pointed out, there are 30,000 more people at work this year than there were this time last year.  It is a very significant reduction.  Of course we hope that trend will continue.</p> <p>I would like to speak about commemoration, which is a theme to which we will return this afternoon when we debate the 1916 centenary commemorations.  I commend Trinity College on the moving ceremony it held on Saturday - it was also attended by my colleague, Senator Barrett - at which a memorial stone commemorating the Trinity staff, students and alumni who died in the First World War was unveiled.  The stone in question, which honours the memories of nearly 500 men and - I understand - one woman, is in the Front Square of Trinity, which means anyone can go to see it.  While their names are etched on a hall of honour in the 1937 reading room, as it is known, for a long time many people did not know it was there as it was not advertised by the college and it was perhaps neglected in the way that we neglected so much of the history of the many thousands of Irish men and women who died in the First World War.  It was very moving to hear pen profiles of some of the deceased being read by the presidents of the graduate students union and the students union at this really important event.</p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate when we get time, but in advance of the general election, on the issue of the eighth amendment.  I was delighted to participate last Saturday in a demonstration organised by the Abortion Rights Campaign and the Coalition to Repeal the 8th Amendment.  I was one of many thousands of people who took to the streets to call for the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I think there is a growing momentum of people, individually and in groups,  who have come out recently in favour of repealing the eighth amendment.</p></speech>

As I was listening to RTE on the wireless this morning, I thought it was quite unusual that there was a degree of accord between financial commentators and political pundits in welcoming the plan and finding very little indeed they could cavil about.  I particularly welcome the introduction of metro north in a modified form.  I hope this will go through.  Many years ago, Senator Quinn and I introduced measures here to facilitate the development of a metro.  After considerable consideration and discussion, the then Government agreed to introduce a metro, but it became a casualty of the financial difficulties in which the country found itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, it became a casualty of the financial difficulties in which the country found itself.  I very much welcome the fact that it may go ahead in some limited form.  The person who briefed Senator Quinn and me most extensively on this matter was Mr. Cormac Rabbitte, a very brilliant transport engineer, and he has not given up.  In the past few days, I received an update on metro Dublin development, and they are making a pre-application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Railways Act.  I very much hope the Government will examine it, given that it seems to fit in very well with the partial plan the Government already has and would provide Dublin with an extensive and comprehensive metro service, which would be very welcome.</p><p>We are the only European capital that has no underground, and it would be the answer to so many of our transport problems.  Dublin is messing around with cycle lanes and banning cars.  I had to go all the way around the world to get here today because College Green is closed except to buses.  It is lunatic.  Shortly, I will be imprisoned in my house in North Great George's Street unable to get out with the car.  An underground which would bring me here would be a great personal benefit to me but also to the city and the country.</p><p>I was somewhat amused to read about the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy and his taxi.  It is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard in my life.  A Minister of State was driving in a car to the airport to make a political appointment in Brussels, or wherever it was.  The car broke down, and he talked to a taxi driver.  There is some kind of confusion about it, and the fare was very large - &euro;350, which I would not be mad about paying.  Garda&iacute; were contacted about the failure of the car and they offered to drive him to the airport.  Perfectly right.  They are servants of the State, and if there was no demand for their services in the local area it was appropriate for them to ensure the Minister of State got to his appointment on time.  I salute the garda&iacute; for their correct action and I deplore the tittle tattle in the media about it.  It was a perfectly appropriate use of State resources.</p></speech>

It is advance planning over five years.  Some &euro;46 million was allocated for Garda vehicles and &euro;205 million for Garda technology.  In this country, we still display paper tax, insurance and NCT discs on our cars.  That was all right when we did not have the major technology or the facility to photocopy and make fraudulent tax and insurance discs to display.  The torches garda&iacute; flash on a car to verify that tax and insurance discs are in order are gone out.  The UK and many countries have moved on towards the modern system of automatic numberplate recognition and I ask the Minister to consider it, and not only for financial and cost-saving reasons.  A conservative estimate of the cost of procuring, posting and administering of discs is &euro;10 million per year.  It is also estimated that fraud adds a minimum of &euro;40 to the cost of the average insurance policy.</p> <p>There are 136 Garda traffic corps vehicles on the road, of which 80% are already equipped with automatic number plate recognition, which means we are 80% of the way there.  Could we go the whole hog and enable garda&iacute; to use smartphones to check tax and NCT compliance?  The general trend in every country is that way.  Mr. Conor Faughnan of the Automobile Association, AA, has already called for this.  Will the Minister equip each garda with a hand-held device?  It would be not only for number plate recognition.  Another Senator spoke about Garda stations and rural post offices closing down.  One can have an office in one's car with a hand-held phone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every garda should have in their possession automatic number plate recognition plus modern technology to do their reports online.

This was not about the political situation, as such.  It was primarily because there was no tradition in Catholic churches of such tablets being put up, whereas they were quite abundant in Protestant churches.  In both the Church of Ireland and the Methodist churches in my home town of Drumshanbo, there are several tablets commemorating local soldiers who died in the First World War.  While I do not know the name of the lady in Trinity College, the reference in the article to Catholic churches having commemorative tablets is a specific reference to St. Mary's on Haddington Road, which has a memorial to 92 Irish men who died in the First World War and one woman, Iza Mahony, who was a volunteer nurse.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam agus na hanamacha eile.</p> <p>My main reason in rising, apart from that slight diversion, is to ask the Leader whether we could have some debate on homelessness, which has now come centre stage.  It looks like the Government is kicking to touch on it.  I agree with Fr. McVerry's proposal that a national emergency be declared.  Everybody who is involved in helping the homeless has been pointing out increasingly that this crisis is unprecedented.  While I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is going to fly the flag and fight the good fight, there is an obvious need to pull together the various State agencies involved and that the public, rather than the political family, sees that something practical is being done that will work.</p> <p>Fr. McVerry made a comparison with the case of foot and mouth disease, where we moved very quickly to address the issue by bringing the various State agencies together.  We have also, in this House and the other House, passed emergency legislation from both this Government and the previous one in respect of the banking system.  The Government of the day can do it if it wants.  It seems that the will is not there and that there is just public relations going on.  As this Government gets closer to the election, it is upping the PR machine.  I am asking for a debate on this, even if it means the Minister coming before the House to outline what he is doing or not doing, because he made a comment last night on television that there was no difficulty-----</p></speech>

In my county of Roscommon, most of the established bus operators lost their runs this summer following a tender process.  These operators had a relationship built up with the special needs students they were bringing to school and now the students are being asked to get to know the new bus operators.  They might have great difficulty with this.</p> <p>The tender process involves the price, the route, and how the bus is cleaned both outside and inside.  I am aware of one bus operator who lost his run because he was 1 cent per mile more expensive than the next man.  Another bus operator, with whom I am well acquainted, was told he had the best price but he lost the run because he did not score 100% on how he cleans his bus outside and inside or whatever.  Last year he gave the exact same explanation of how he cleans his bus inside and outside and he scored 100%.  He copied it from last year and they downgraded him to 66% and he lost the run.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Kelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There seems to be no transparency as to how bus operators are selected.  The very notion that a special relationship is built between the operator and the student is not even a consideration.

I would like the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills so that we can see what kind of transparency can be brought to these issues.</p></speech>

I see a headline today, &quot;Revealed: The 19-Minute Journey from Dublin City to the Airport by Metro.&quot;  Buses, without subsidy, can currently go from the airport to Lucan or Sandymount in 20 minutes, so I do not know what this is supposed to serve.  These projects tend to be dominated by engineers who spend all the money.  The country was bankrupted before, and we would want to be pretty careful; the devil will be in the detail.  What has been published so far seems to be a reheated version of a plan that was not much good when we saw it the first time approximately ten years ago.</p><p>I note the proposal by Ernst &amp;amp; Young in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>that it will drop degree requirements for people studying to be auditors and accountants.  The rest of us have a rather different view of auditors and accountants.  Next year, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority takes over the supervision of standards in accountancy and auditing from Chartered Accountants Ireland.  That transfer will take place in June.  It would be ill-advised, given the problems we have had with auditing in the financial and building society sector, as well as in banking, to have any changes to reduce the qualifications of auditors before the transfer to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  It is a matter of a regret that it has taken so long since the financial crisis to transfer the supervision of accountants from their own body to an independent statutory body, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.</p></speech>

The overall winner was Letterkenny in County Donegal, and I happened to be there yesterday when the announcement was made.  The town has participated in the competition for 57 years, culminating in yesterday's marvellous achievement, which arose from a consistent effort from the local community.  Clonegal in County Carlow is Ireland's tidiest village, while Listowel in County Kerry is Ireland's tidiest small town.  Westport in County Mayo won the category of Ireland's tidiest large town.  I congratulate everybody in the many towns and villages that have participated on an annual basis but have not won.  I come from Carlingford, which was an overall winner 20 years ago but is still participating.  The people are trying to improve the lives of the community and our towns and villages for the many visitors who come to us.</p> <p>We speak about volunteerism in this Chamber fairly often, and there are not many greater examples of it than this competition.  We can think of communities doing their best to improve facilities - for themselves, primarily, but for visitors as well - for more than 50 years, or five generations.  These people love their towns and villages.  We must also acknowledge what this has done for tourism in the four corners of this country.  People like to visit, stand, stare and admire these towns and villages, so I congratulate one and all for participating.

I wish him and his family the very best for the future.  He was a very gentle, quietly-spoken man, but he got his message across on many occasions.  He will be truly missed by us all.</p> <p>Rural Ireland has been in the national media in recent weeks.  The attack on rural Ireland not only by the Government but by criminal gangs has been raised in every council chamber in the country and in this Chamber for many years.  I am sad to report that not a lot of action has taken place to address these concerns.  We learned in today's media of the statement by the Minister of Justice and Equality that the closure of more than 100 rural Garda stations has saved a mere &euro;500,000.  This is on top of the closure of many post offices.  In my county town of Cavan, the most modern army barracks in Europe and the only purpose-built army barracks in the State was closed.  It is costing more to maintain the building now than it was to run it when it was at full capacity.  This is a terrible indictment of the Government.</p> <p>To my amazement, I find myself in total agreement with Senator C&aacute;it Keane regarding her proposal on number plate identification.  I will go one step further: in an effort to combat and crack down on rural crime, if investment were made in smart technology on every rural road in Ireland, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be in a position to pick up number plates that were not valid.  A signal could be sent to the garda&iacute; in close proximity and they could apprehend such vehicles.  This is where investment should be made.  Unfortunately, the Garda stations that are now closed will never be opened regardless of who is in government.  This is my firm belief.  We should invest in this technology.  Senator Feargal Quinn has mentioned in the past that such camera technology is in existence in rural parts of countries such as France, as well as on main highways, and it can record the speed at which a car is travelling.  Surely it is not beyond the realm of possibility to put this infrastructure in rural Ireland to assist the Garda in identifying the criminal gangs coming down from major cities to rob our vulnerable people.</p></speech>

Obviously, this will restore, I hope, all of the jobs lost during the recession and address many of the infrastructural deficits we have.  To pick up on the arguments made by Senators Diarmuid Wilson and C&aacute;it Keane, the only way we will beat the criminals in today's world, who are very sophisticated, is with technology.  I welcome the fact more than &euro;200 million is in the plan for investment in technology.  Good technology and Garda vehicles will go a long way towards tackling the problem of rural crime.  We must ensure Garda stations have technology and facilities.  Recently I visited the Garda station in Ballinasloe and I was horrified to see how primitive the conditions were and the poor facilities for the detention of prisoners.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that is replicated throughout the country, we need significant investment in existing Garda stations.</p><p>I welcome the fact that during the lifetime of this capital plan, 45,000 jobs will be created in construction.  That will get the construction sector off its knees, so to speak, and give it a badly-needed boost.</p><p>The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government is to be applauded on the progress made over the past four and a half years.  Having got the country up off its knees, it now has an ambitious programme to drive forward the recovery and ensure that we never again get ourselves into the position we have been in for the past seven or eight years.</p><p>I welcome the announcement today of the rural economic development zones and the allocation of funding for same.  In County Galway alone, &euro;207,500 was allocated, with &euro;60,000 being allocated to Ballinasloe Area Community Development, which submitted a fantastic application.  That &euro;60,000 will help it put together a plan that will drive economic recovery, particularly in the retail sector in towns like Ballinasloe and others towns in east Galway.</p></speech>

Senator Norris referred to the underground railway that was proclaimed at least ten years ago.  Senator Barrett asked us to consider the development taking place in terms of privatising transport from the airport.  There is little doubt that that has worked very well.  It is a debate we should be having, and when I hear Senator Norris expressing concern about what is happening in College Green, it is a debate that needs to take place because we have not had that debate.  Those decisions are being made without understanding that.</p></speech>

I am not sure it is the job of the Garda to check tax and insurance.  Modern technology enables us to do that in a much more efficient way.</p> <p>I saw a huge traffic jam recently where garda&iacute; had stopped traffic on the north side of the city.  It must have gone back 2 km or 3 km while they checked insurance and the tax discs.  That can be done readily nowadays, and it is being done, with a smartphone.  We should investigate the possibility of doing something like that because there is little doubt that it does not make sense for the Garda to be doing it.</p> <p>Two figures were published today.  First, the number of burglaries has increased by 8.4% this year on last year and, second, incidents of stealing from shops have increased by 11.2%.  I do not know if that is related to Garda stations being closed but it is the sort of topic we should be debating in this House.  I ask the Leader to find time for a debate on that in the near future.</p> <p>The ploughing championships last week were a wonderful success.  I spoke yesterday to a group of young students in Trinity College about entrepreneurship.  The ploughing championships came about from an idea Anna May McHugh had 52 years ago.  That lady is not a young entrepreneur, although she may have been at that time.  The ploughing championships were a wonderful success.  I was delighted to see that the French Government gave her an award last week because of that success, and I would like to congratulate her.</p></speech>

One is allowed a little poetic licence.  I too welcome the superb capital plan and genuinely feel that people will pay much more attention to Senator David Norris's welcome of it than they will to Senator Marc MacSharry's false criticism.  I do not want to go on about the capital plan; it speaks for itself, and others have referred to it.  Today, I would like to mention briefly three items concerning our farming community on which we may be able to have some discussion in due course, when time permits.  I believe increased funding must be allocated for agri-environment schemes with full payments to all GLAS and AEOS participants; there must be an extra allocation for areas of cultural constraint to reverse the cuts of previous budgets and support farming in marginal areas; and finally, there should be a modest increase to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to pay farmers for restrictions resulting from land designation where such restrictions are not covered by GLAS.  Perhaps these matters can be covered in a pre-budget statement or, if not, perhaps the Leader would allow for a debate on agricultural matters.</p></speech>

I cannot for the life of me understand, particularly in the context of students, the reason the international office in each college cannot be called upon to administer visas.  If they collect the relevant information, surely the visas can be administered in a one-stop shop within the universities that the students are attending.  Last week a deputation from China, which included the secretary from the department of education in China, visited the Oireachtas.  One of their grave concerns was that their citizens who come to Ireland as students have to queue up for hours, and sometimes overnight, in order to get their visas renewed.  This is wrong.</p> <p>I draw attention to the few miserable shillings saved by closing half the Garda stations in the country.  In Stepaside, where I live, which is not exactly rural Ireland, we are inundated with burglaries.  The loss of that Garda station has been of massive import.  I am sure that much more than &euro;500,000 worth of Garda time has been spent on investigating the burglaries that have taken place.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality whether there is a case to be made for reviewing the closure of some of the Garda stations with a view to reopening them.</p></speech>

It is an indictment of Government policy.  We have heard in recent days about the plans to revitalise rural Ireland and investment to refurbish our towns and so on.  It is important that significant detail is provided and that there is significant investment.  In March, a journalist, Richard Curran, hosted an excellent documentary on the battle for rural Ireland.  It showed the stark reality of the challenges our small towns and villages are facing.</p> <p>I am glad we are going to have a debate on the migrant crisis on Thursday.  I am not sure the Government is firing on all cylinders on this issue.  It is right and proper that the Minister for Justice and Equality take that debate, but there are related issues that need to be dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, such as whether safe havens will be established in the Middle East for persecuted minorities - not just Christian minorities, but other minorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The challenges faced by particular groups must be looked at now as well.  It cannot be separated from the question of or absorption into the country of very hard pressed people who are fleeing war.  They need to be helped and supported.  At the same time we must look at what is going to be done to assist persecuted minorities and what our policy is, for example, on Syria and on regime change or otherwise in Syria.  I would like to be hearing much more from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Ireland's policy on these matters.</p><p>I would also like to hear about the recent attendance by the Minister for Justice and Equality at a conference in Paris on the persecuted groups and the challenges facing particular ethnic communities.  As far as I am aware there was no media coverage of her participation at the conference.  We do not know what she said and we do not know what the Irish Government's policy is.  I would like to hear about that matter on Thursday but we need to hear from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well.</p><p>I note Senator Bacik's attempt to interpret there being some kind of a momentum to secure further legalised abortion in Ireland.  This is largely a media swell rather than a groundswell as the rather modest turnout at last weekend's protest showed.  It is time that she told us what she and fellow abortion supporters think about the absolutely grisly realities being pursued.</p></speech>

The measure will remove the last set of traffic lights from Cork to Belfast when completed which is a good thing and can only be welcomed.  The location is a real bottleneck and holds up the full development of the city and port of Cork.  The measure is very welcome.</p></speech>

It would be good if we could discuss the report and other health insurance costs which all add to the pressure on the health service and the cost of private health insurance.  We have had the announcement, over the past day or so, by VHI of another increase in the cost of providing health insurance.  We should not be surprised by it because the price of health care increases almost on a monthly basis.</p> <p>Now that the great hopes for universal health care and Dutch health models, Australian models and Canadian models have all been consigned to the dustbin of manifestos, we have to recognise that we are left with a tweaking of the current health system.  With proper structural change and investment the system certainly can work.  It is the cost of the provision of that service, the cost of not just insurance but of consultancy and so much more, which needs to be tackled.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On more than an annual basis the insurance providers seek an increase, it is acceded to and the taxpayer and citizen has to foot the bill.  We need to look into the reason health insurance is costing so much.  No. 69 could form part of that debate.  It is clear we are not going to move to any new model of health care provision in the medium or distant future.  We are stuck with the model we have and we must try to make it work and affordable.  We must also tackle the cost issue.  It would be helpful if the Leader could arrange a debate in this regard in respect of which, as I said, No. 69 could be a helpful introduction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-09-29a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015092900002#X00200"><p>Many Members have raised the issue of the capital plan, the aim of which is to secure recovery and ensure all regions share in the benefits.  The &euro;27 billion investment plan for Ireland is essential to the restoration by 2018 of all the jobs lost during the recession and a reduction in the unemployment rate to 6% by 2020.  This is affordable, achievable and consistent with the Government's plan to eliminate Government borrowing by 2018.  It was necessary throughout the financial crisis to keep spending under control.  To restore our national finances to stability we used every innovative way we could to raise additional capital to invest in Ireland's recovery.  The proposed new investment in roads, public transport, education, health care, flood risk, enterprise and policing is designed to alleviate growing pressures in the economy which hold back recovery.  The recovery is not yet complete and we must continue to manage the national finances carefully or risk falling back.  The Government could not afford to include everything we wanted in this plan but it represents the best of what can be delivered with the available resources.  As a Government we have no intention of going back to the bad old days of boom and bust.  The days of blank cheques are well gone.  </p> <p>This capital investment plan provides approximately &euro;42 billion of State-backed investment in capital projects.  As I mentioned, the Exchequer is providing &euro;27 billion for investment in national projects.  Support will also be provided from the ERDF and Europe.  Under the plan, more than 45,000 construction-related jobs will be created in projects throughout the country, including new road infrastructure, new schools and a new modern metro system in Dublin, as referred to on the Order of Business by several Members.  It also provides more investment in enterprise support services, which were also mentioned on the Order of Business.  </p> <p>Garda technology was also mentioned by several Members, including Senator MacSharry.  In addition to the investment already made available in this area over the past year, further investment in Garda vehicles and technology to address the many issues raised today by Members is being provided.  Senator MacSharry also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business seeking that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, come to the House today.  I do not propose to accede to the Senator's request as the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, was in the House only half an hour ago to address two items raised by his colleagues.  I am sure that if the Senator seeks to address the issue by way of Commencement debate the Minister will be willing to come to the House to respond to it.</p> <p>Senator Bacik also spoke of the benefits of investment in the capital plan and noted that the unemployment rate is down to 9.4%.  Who would have believed when unemployment was up in excess of 15% that it would be down to 9.4% in such a short time?  Senator Bacik also complimented Trinity College, Dublin, on its recent remembrance ceremony in respect of over 500 former staff and students who died in the First World War.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Bacik also called for a debate on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  This obviously will be a subject during the election campaign and I do not wish to have that campaign started in the House any time soon, considering that the election still is a number of months away.  Senator Norris welcomed the metro scheme, and I note his comments in that regard, as well as his comments about the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  Senator Keane welcomed investment in Garda technology and noted the importance of the elimination of the paper trail where insurance and tax discs are concerned and how smart technology could be used to detect defaulters.  Senator Mooney called for a debate on the homeless, while noting the comments of the Minister, as well as those of his own party spokesperson, on last evening's television debate.  I agree with him on the need for a debate in this House and will try to arrange it with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  Senator Kelly raised the tendering process for various bus routes and the need for greater transparency in this regard.  Senator Barrett questioned the value for money of the metro to the airport, which probably was contrary to what Senator Norris mentioned.  Senator Barrett also highlighted the supervision of standards in accountancy and the need to maintain qualifications.  I could not agree more with the Senator; there is a need to maintain standards in this area, especially in view of what the country has gone through over the past decade.  Senator Brennan spoke about the national Tidy Towns day and congratulated the overall winner, Letterkenny, as well as all the winners in this great competition, and complimented the voluntary effort of all concerned.  I also wish to compliment RTE's "Nationwide" programme on its excellent coverage of the event and to give due recognition to everyone involved in this competition.</p><p>Senator Wilson raised the issue of rural Ireland and the marauding gangs that are plundering it, while welcoming the new resources for the Garda and noting the need for smart technology and additional Garda vehicles, which will be addressed in the capital plan.  Senator Mullins spoke on the ambitious plan for recovery and welcomed the funding of development moneys for towns such as Ballinasloe.  Senator Quinn also spoke on the theme of smart technology for the Garda and noted that burglaries have increased by 8%.  He is quite correct in this regard, and that is the reason the Minister will come to the House soon to introduce a new burglary Bill.  Members will have an opportunity to discuss this issue with the Minister at that time.  Senator Quinn also lauded the organisers of the National Ploughing Championship, which was an absolutely wonderful success and has been for many years.  I join with the Senator in complimenting all involved.  Senator Paul Coghlan called for greater funding for agricultural investment, particularly in the agri-environment services and for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I am sure many of these issues will be referred to in the budget.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the administration of visas and the delays and the inconvenience that are caused to so many people in Burgh Quay in particular.  I agree with him that something radical must be done to address it, because what is happening there at present should not be allowed to continue.  I certainly will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  As for Garda stations, I note that more than 90% of the stations that were closed were one-man operated stations in which garda&iacute; were present for a maximum of one to two hours per day.  However, I agree with the Senator that in the case of Stepaside, it is a different ball game.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Mullen discussed the challenges for small towns, which I am sure will be addressed in the budget.  He also called for a debate on Syria.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade attended the House some months ago on that topic, but I agree that he should return.  I am sure that he would be willing to have a further debate on Syria, particularly regarding the persecution of minorities and the political situation.</p><p>Senator Gilroy welcomed the capital plan and its benefits for Cork and many other areas.  In Waterford, the combination of funding contained in this plan and other funding from the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and local authorities will help to underpin a &euro;35 million investment plan that includes the regeneration of Tramore and Waterford city and further development of the Deise greenway.  The money will be welcome in my county.</p><p>Senator Bradford mentioned an item on the Order Paper, the report on the cost of medical indemnity insurance.  Rather than noting the report, he has called for a debate.  I will try to arrange for one with the Minister in early course.</p></speech>
