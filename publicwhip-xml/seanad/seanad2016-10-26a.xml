I know that he is no stranger to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  He was there recently when the Irish Olympian Annalise Murphy returned to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which was a great and joyous celebration for the town and the nation.</p> <p>I am concerned about the future corporate governance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council because it has been debated for a hell of a long time and there seems to be very little progress and there may be a very good reason why that is the case but I want to hear why from the Minister.  There is 250 acres of water in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour making it an amazing international maritime resource.  It is a massive piece of real estate operated and run on behalf of the state by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, of which I was a director for two terms, or ten years.  There was a suggestion as a result of the national ports policy that D&uacute;n Laoghaire among other ports that have regional significance would be transferred to the local authority, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.  There is huge uncertainty about the future of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, its direction, long-term plans and governance.  That is why it is important to hear from the Minister what are the plan and vision.  A due diligence was commissioned and co-funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I do not know where that is today.  Who owns that due diligence report?  When will it be published?  When will it be put into the public domain?  When will it be given to the county council, the elected representatives of the people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire?</p> <p>I cannot comment on the uncertainties although I understand this week An Bord Plean&aacute;la is due to decide on a cruise terminal, a very controversial piece of infrastructure before the board.  We must await the outcome of that.  That is another important facet in the complexity of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour's future.  There has been an acting harbour master for several years.  The legislation clearly sets down the requirements of a harbour master.  That needs to be considered.  There are huge issues regarding the pensions fund, which I will not go into except to say that the Minister needs to be aware of them.  I am sure he already is.  There are also human resource, legal and real estate issues.  There are several vacancies on the board for which the Minister is responsible and has the power to fill.  Does he intend to do this in advance of or after the transfer?  Would the Minister consider advertising and seeking expressions of interest from stakeholders and the public to be considered?  It is important to have people of calibre but also with skills in maritime, leisure, finance and legal matters to bring an extra layer of support to the harbour company, whatever its governance and whatever plans the Minister has for it.</p> <p>On another occasion, I would like to meet the Minister, who comes from a business background, to discuss the dividend.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, like all State companies, was supposed to issue a dividend.  It is my understanding that this company has never issued a dividend to the state.  Is that acceptable for a company that is supposed to be successful, commercial and viable?  What is the situation and status of that dividend?  I would like to see a copy of any dividends issued by this company.  All is not plain sailing at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour and I think the Minister knows that.  We need answers.  It would be great to get clarification from the Minister about how he plans to transfer the corporate governance of this harbour company from his Department to the council, or not and if there remains an impasse and a dispute as to the views of the harbour company versus the views of the local authority, how will he address that and how will he make that decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  The national ports policy, published in March 2013, provides that the five designated ports of regional significance - Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow - will be transferred to more appropriate local authority-led governance structures.  These five ports of regional significance retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities.  However, the scale and nature of these activities were not adjudged such as to warrant continued central Government involvement.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, as a port of regional significance, is designated under the national ports policy for transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  As Senators will be aware, it was necessary to enact primary legislation, namely the Harbours Act 2015, to provide the necessary primary legislative framework to allow for the transfer of the ports of regional significance, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, to local authority control.  The relevant legislation was enacted in December 2015.  The Act is not prescriptive in respect of the model for transfer for each port.  That is deliberately done to facilitate each port because this involves more than D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Rather, the Act is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility by providing for two possible models of transfer: one, retention of the existing company structure and transfer of the ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority and two, dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures.</p> <p>The intention was that, in the case of each port, the local authority and the port will agree the more appropriate model of transfer in respect of that port.  The best model of transfer will be the one which finds broad consensus and agreement between the parties.  This answers one of Senator Boyhan's questions, if there is disagreement between the port company and the local authority in relation to the model of transfer, then the final decision will be taken by the Minister.  The Minister will not become involved in the day-to-day negotiations about this but if there is a disagreement, I - if I am in office - or someone else will make a decision on the matter.</p> <p>The process of transferring governance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to the council is ongoing and, as I said, the future governance and operational structures of the port are primarily matters for agreement between the council and the port company.  In the case of each port transferred to a local authority, the decision on the model of transfer is informed by a due diligence carried out by the local authority, with funding support from my Department.  I think that is &euro;30,000.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has procured consultants to conduct the due diligence of the port company.  While the procurement and management of the due diligence process is a matter for the council, I understand that the completion is imminent.  I also understand that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have established two transitional teams which are working on the practical issues associated with the transfer.  Officials from my Department have also met with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a number of occasions to assist in the process.  I have also met with many local groups.  Deputy Boyd Barrett brought in a group from the local community to meet me a couple of weeks ago which was extremely useful and gave me an insight I had not had before into what many of the people on the ground and the users of the harbour felt.</p> <p>As Senator Boyhan will be aware, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company faces a challenging financial and operating environment as it moves from commercial shipping activities towards a different operating model which Is more focussed on marine leisure and marine-related tourism.  The departure of the Stena Line from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour adds to the future challenges for the company.  The financial impact on the port is significant and it is very clear that the company faces a very different operating environment than it faced In the past.  The company has been restructuring its business in order to remain on a sustainable financial footing and to enable the harbour to develop and operate on a commercial basis into the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The company has been pursuing a twin strategy of developing alternative income streams from marine leisure and tourism-related business while also reducing its high cost base.</p><p>Finally, I can inform the Seanad that the transfer of the other ports of regional significance, including Drogheda, Galway and New Ross, to local authority control is progressing.

The Minister might bring that to the attention of his secretarial assistant.  It is not spelt "Boylan".</p> <p>I am none the wiser.  Last week, I took the trouble to look at several responses from the current Minister and previous Ministers, including Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Leo Varadkar.  It is always the same old response.  The line is that it is about to happen and that due diligence is about to be completed.  The fact is we are none the wiser.  None of this is new.</p> <p>Currently, the company is under the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There has been no transfer.  A range of issues arise.  I am aware of the Minister's meeting with Deputy Boyd Barrett and a number of my colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I am aware of various items of correspondence as well.</p> <p>I shared some information on the matter in the House previously and I will say what I have already said again.  There are legal issues, human resources issues and pension issues in respect of this company.  I furnished some information to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport last week and I received a letter from the Department in reply.  Indeed, the Minister's signature may be on the letter, although I am not 100% certain - I will check it when I go downstairs.  In any event, I furnished information in respect of two High Court proceedings in respect of this company and this was acknowledged by the Department.  All is not well in this company.  All is not sailing well out there.</p> <p>I appeal to the Minister to look at all the current issues in respect of the governance of the company that are under his watch.  I will write to the Minister in this regard.  We are none the wiser.  I would appreciate if the Minister would keep the House informed.  I have spoken to a number of my colleagues and, if necessary, I will arrange for a number of parliamentary questions to be put to the Minister in the D&aacute;il next week.</p></speech>

I know that is important to him.  It was a misprint, which can happen from time to time.  The name is spelt correctly at the top of the document before me.  Elsewhere in the document there are references to the Senator as "Boylan", but it is not an insult or a matter of great importance.</p> <p>I am well aware of the difficulties attached to this.  Some of the questions raised by Senator Boyhan are already well catered for in the public arena.  On the question of board vacancies, it was made absolutely clear by my predecessor that he had no intention of appointing any new members to the board while this transfer was ongoing.  Senator Boyhan would know that if he had done the slightest bit of research.  I have no intention of appointing any new members to the board while that is going on either.  There has to be a quorum.  That is important and I may have to make appointments to fulfil that requirement, but otherwise I am not going to appoint members to the board while it is a state of transition.  This is the same position as my predecessor.</p> <p>The Senator referred to the cruise terminal.  I am not going to interfere in any way with the planning process.</p></speech>

It is a difficult problem.  Senator Boyhan may not be aware of it, but this problem has caused extraordinary difficulties in the local area.  This is something which I have to listen to as well and it is something of which am acutely conscious.  That is why I agreed to meet representatives of the local area in a situation which is controversial.  I will continue to do so.  I will continue to be aware of those sensitivities as well as those of officialdom.</p></speech>

St. Paul's School in Montenotte, Cork, has 95 students.  Some have moderate learning disabilities and some have severe and profound learning disabilities.  As I understand it, there are 15 class teachers and 35 special needs assistants.</p> <p>There is a problem in the school.  I spent two hours there recently.  I put it to any public representative that it is well worth visiting these facilities from time to time to see the dedication and commitment of the staff.  They do a fantastic job and provide a fantastic service.  They provide learning opportunities for people with disabilities.</p> <p>I met the principal and many of the staff for a period of two hours.  A number of issues arise.  One child in the school at the moment requires two people to be with him at all times.  This is putting extraordinary strain on the staff.  They have a choice to make in the coming week or two weeks and may have to suspend the child from coming to the school unless they can get more resources.  They are seeking an administrative deputy.  The school had one previously, but unfortunately that is no longer the position.  They have a teaching deputy and another post.  However, the view of the staff there is that if they had an administrative deputy, it would ease many of the difficulties they are facing.</p> <p>The staff provide a fantastic service.  The facility is close to the Cope Foundation, which provides care for over 1,200 people in residential settings and over 1,500 people on a day-care basis.  The school is doing a very good job.  It needs more support and that is why I have tabled the commencement matter today.  I call on the Minister to provide a favourable response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#C01200"><p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this issue.  It needs consideration.  Senator Burke has set out his case.  The school has 95 pupils, 16 classroom teachers and 35 special needs assistants.  The staff numbers come to over 50.</p> <p>Under the current arrangements for the appointment of administrative deputy principals, the criteria is based on the number of pupils.  It is uniform across the school system.  The relevant number is 637 pupils, which is the equivalent of a principal and 24 classroom teachers.  I gather the point Senator Burke is making is that a large number of staff are involved, including 35 special needs assistants, and, as a result, there is a considerable management workload, even though the pupil numbers are nowhere near the 637 figure.</p> <p>At the moment there are no plans to deviate from the current arrangements, which requires greater pupil numbers for the appointment of an administrative deputy principal.  A request has been received from the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, in respect of a number of larger special schools.  As recently as Monday, my Department received updated submissions on the matter.</p> <p>Accordingly, my Department is currently considering the matters relating to the administrative burden on administrative principals in these schools and is considering the case made in respect of the appointment of administrative deputy principals.  My Department will further engage with relevant management bodies and unions in this regard and will submit proposals for my consideration when the consultation has concluded.  The Senator has raised a valid concern and we will give it more careful scrutiny in consultation with the key bodies involved.</p></speech>

I will send on the letter I received from the principal.  One of the major issues is that because of the severe or profound learning disabilities of some of the students, extraordinary pressure is coming on staff.  For example, when I was there one pupil required two staff members at all times.  The school has a serious challenge in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This pupil travels approximately 30 miles every day.

The school needs an administrative principal that would allow it to better deal with this particular pupil and with others who have profound learning disabilities.  </p><p>I will pass on the correspondence I have received from the principal to the Minister to assist him in his consideration of this issue.  On the next occasion the Minister is in Cork he should visit the facility.  The dedication and commitment of the staff there is tremendous and that must be given some recognition.</p></speech>

That is why my Department is dealing with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education so that we can get a broad perspective on the range of challenges and consider whether there is a case for the appointment of administrative principals on the basis of different criteria to those which currently apply.  The current criteria apply on the same basis across all primary schools.  While I welcome the submission from the individual school, my Department will have to consider this in the context of the broader issue.</p></speech>

I say that because information was given to me and to other public representatives, both verbally and in writing, regarding the potential closure of mental health day centres and hostels in County Roscommon.  The people who use mental health services within the county deserve to have facts and honesty but we do not have either at the moment.  </p> <p>I have listened to a wide range of individuals over the past number of weeks who are involved in mental health services in County Roscommon.  All of these people are very clear and definite in their view that the HSE is publicly stating a message that is very different to what is being implemented on the ground.  The statements are not matching up and I am very concerned.  It is very important that we get facts and honesty.</p> <p>To put this in context, I have spoken at length with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee, and the chief health officer of community services covering County Roscommon.  I was advised that the HSE has no active plans to close the various day centres and hostels referenced, namely, those at Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Strokestown, Castlerea and Athleague.  I was also informed that the HSE has no plans to close the community nursing unit in Aras Naomh Chaolain or to relocate residents to private nursing homes.  I was advised that the HSE is currently consulting with residents, families and staff on the transfer of a small number of residents from Knockroe House in Castlerea to more appropriate settings.</p> <p>This information was provided by the HSE to me and to other public representatives in writing.  However, the minutes of recent HSE meetings suggest something very different.  They suggest that Strokestown, Ballaghaderreen and Boyle day care centres could close over the next 12 to 18 months and be amalgamated with other centres.  These minutes indicate that as part of its proposals, the HSE is to reduce the number of day centres from five to one or two, to be located in north and mid-Roscommon.  The minutes also indicate that the HSE has established a group of senior staff to oversee the transition plan for day and training centres in the county.</p> <p>The HSE confirmed on Monday morning last that it is currently exploring the reconfiguration of existing day centres.  It added that if it is identified that day centres are no longer required, staff will be redeployed to strengthen other day centres.  I emphasise again that I have been in contact with the chief health officer of community services, including mental health services, in County Roscommon several times over the past number of weeks and never once during those conversations was I told that plans were in train regarding potential closures and the amalgamation of mental health services.  Quite frankly, it is absolutely appalling that the HSE would mislead us so blatantly.  I am not willing to accept this type of conduct from this organisation, or any other organisation for that matter.  People using mental health services and their families deserve the truth and the facts.  </p> <p>Finally, we know that an external review of mental health services in County Roscommon is currently under way.  That review was commissioned last year and is really important that it is made available as quickly as possible.  The review should assist in terms of identifying the challenges throughout the county.  It should also serve to assist us in making improvements.  Any improvements, however, must be made in consultation with the people using the mental health services and their families.  I ask that the truth and the facts are given to us.</p></speech>

The Senator has asked when the external review of mental health services in Roscommon will be completed and made available.</p> <p>The development of all aspects of mental health services remains a priority for the Government and the HSE.  The latter, as the Senator knows, is responsible for the delivery of health services in this country and it secured a budget of &euro;14.6 billion for 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This applies particularly in terms of promoting quality and safety and enhancing a recovery focus via local services for individuals and their families.  This approach reflects the continued need to implement the key principles and objectives of A Vision for Change by modernising our mental health services and maximising resources to best meet various increasing demands.</p><p>In the context of concerns raised some time ago regarding mental health services in Roscommon, I have been advised that the HSE's national director of mental health commissioned an external independent review of the quality, safety and governance of these local services.  The review commenced on 28 August 2015 and is being conducted by a team external to the executive.  The terms of reference of the review, which is being undertaken in a manner that is respectful of the rights of all to privacy, confidentiality and procedural due process, includes assessing the systems and processes in place to ensure the quality, safety and appropriateness of care for mental health service users in Roscommon; reviewing governance arrangements for high-quality, safe and reliable services, covering issues such as multidisciplinary working, staffing levels and management; compliance with relevant national and HSE regulations, standards or protocols; and examining risk management processes and protocols within the Roscommon service and adherence to them in practice, including arrangements to ensure that incidents are appropriately reported and acted upon.</p><p>I understand also that, if it becomes apparent that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there are serious risks to the health or welfare of any person receiving services or that further investigation is necessary, the HSE may, in the interests of obtaining a complete report, extend the review's scope or recommend that a separate investigation be commenced as appropriate.</p><p>The HSE has told me that the report will be published in a format deemed appropriate to promote the safety and quality of mental health services in Roscommon for the ultimate benefit of the health and welfare of the public.  It was initially envisaged that the review would be completed by March 2016.  However, given its scale, the complexities involved and the need for the review team to meet as many people as possible, the team sought extensions to the timeframe.  A public consultation exercise was also undertaken as part of the review process.  At this juncture, the review is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.</p><p>The HSE will not have sight of the final report until it has been signed off by the review team and submitted to the HSE's national director for mental health in accordance with agreed and due processes.  All of the review team's recommendations will be examined in detail by the executive and considered in the context of any potential to improve high-quality and safe care within the resources available to the Roscommon mental health service.  The Minister and all of the Ministers of State in the Department of Health will continue to monitor developments on this important service issue closely.</p><p>The Senator raised specific queries regarding local issues and the manner in which they had been handled.  As I do not speak for the HSE and am merely conveying information, I am not in a position to give the Senator information on the local issues.  However, I will undertake to ensure that the HSE provides an explanation as to what has happened with communication.  Communication is crucial if we are to have a good, healthy and functional service.  Our local representatives are always the touchstone when things go wrong and they need to be given proper and accurate information so that they are in a position to disseminate it to those who may contact them.  I would have thought this to be a key priority for the people involved in the HSE.</p></speech>

It is difficult to have confidence and trust in County Roscommon's mental health services when there is a complete disconnect between what we are hearing on the ground and what we are being told publicly by higher levels within the HSE.  It is not acceptable.  I have spoken at length with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in recent weeks.  I understand that it is an operational matter for the HSE, but we are discussing people and their families having confidence, trust, certainty and support within the county's mental health services.  We do not have those currently.  As a public representative in County Roscommon, I do not have confidence or trust in the HSE.</p> <p>It is important that the external review, which was anticipated to conclude earlier than it will, is done properly and forms the basis for improvements.  Mental health services continue to evolve and need to be improved.  Changes may be necessary, but they need to be made in light of the review and in consultation with service users and their families.</p></speech>

I raised it with her at the UNFPA launch last Friday.  In light of recent media reports that an act of female genital mutilation, FGM, was reported to the HSE and the Garda in September, will the Minister of State say how many cases of FGM have been reported to the Garda since the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012?  What supports are provided to agencies such as AkiDwA that are working to prevent the incidence of FGM in the community and will the Government sign up to the second national action plan on FGM?</p> <p>I will give a brief background.  As the Minister of State is aware, FGM is the horrific practice of the cutting or removing of female genitalia, usually carried out on very young girls aged between four and ten years.  It leads to appalling health consequences for those girls, and in some cases death.  It is widespread in some countries and communities worldwide.  It is estimated that 200 million women and girls across 30 countries have been subjected to this appalling mutilation.  Girls in communities from those countries living in other countries are also at risk.  The school holidays are a time when girls are at particular risk.  It is sometimes known as the cutting season, when girls are taken abroad from developed countries to their countries of origin, including Somalia, Nigeria, Malaysia, Kenya and Egypt.</p> <p>In Ireland, this matter was brought to my attention by AkiDwA, an NGO of women working with women from other communities, particularly African communities, in Ireland.  It estimates that between 3,000 and 5,000 girls and women in Ireland have been subjected to FGM and that more are at risk.  In April 2010, and at its insistence, I introduced the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill, which was subsequently accepted by the Government and became law in September 2012.  It carries significant criminal penalties not only for the act of FGM in Ireland, but for taking girls abroad for FGM.  We were always conscious of the importance of the Act being used as an advocacy tool, one that would enable and support organisations like AkiDwA to work with communities to raise awareness about the horrific nature of the practice and to prevent its incidence.  AkiDwA and ActionAid are working on an interesting project in Cork to raise awareness among particular communities.</p> <p>We were all concerned to hear in September of an awful case that was reported in the media apparently involving a baby girl of only 21 months on whom FGM had been carried out in Dublin.  A man has been arrested and I understand from information in the public domain that the file is with the DPP.  I also understand that the HSE is involved.</p> <p>In light of this awful revelation, AkiDwA and ActionAid have asked me to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality how many cases have been reported to the Garda and what supports will be provided to organisations like AkiDwA, which is working hard to ensure that this does not happen.  AkiDwA is concerned that there is little awareness among particular communities of the existence of the offence, the nature of the legislation and the powers of the Garda and HSE under same.  It is positive that a case was reported to the Garda, but it is awful and distressing to learn that this practice is still being carried out in 2016 on girls living in Ireland.  It is appalling for babies.  As a mother, and just as anyone else would, I find it an horrific matter of deep concern.  What can we do about this in practical terms?</p></speech>

As the Senator is aware and has referred to in her statement, the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 provides for the creation of an offence of female genital mutilation and other offences relating to female genital mutilation.  The Act explicitly prohibits FGM along with related offences, some of which apply to certain extra-territorial jurisdictions.  The Act also makes it an offence to remove a girl from the State for the purpose of FGM.  The legislation takes a human rights perspective and stipulates that the right to practise one's cultural traditions and beliefs cannot be used to justify FGM.  A defence of custom or ritual in proceedings is not permitted nor is a defence that the girl or woman or her parent or guardian consented to FGM.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office records crime statistics.  The Irish crime classification system is based on the Garda PULSE incident types.  Statistics on the offence of FGM are not identifiable in the Central Statistics Office data as the offence specified may be classified as one of several serious incident types, such as assault causing harm or sexual offences.</p><p>The HSE's national social inclusion office provides annual funding of approximately &euro;70,000 to the non-governmental organisation, AkiDwA, towards the provision of information and awareness activities on FGM.  AkiDwA works closely with at risk communities.  It also has a role in identifying and alerting the relevant authorities when suspected persons may possibly be seeking FGM procedures.</p><p>Additional input and funding has been provided to AkiDwA by the HSE in respect of the development and printing of the first and second editions of a resource for health professionals and relevant staff in maternity and associated settings.  This pack, entitled Female Genital Mutilation: Information for Health Professionals working in Ireland, has proved to be a very useful resource.  It has been circulated across a range of settings.  The HSE also funds a specialist clinic operated by the Irish Family Planning Association for girls and women who have undergone FGM.</p><p>Although there is no specific training related to dealing with FGM, there is a widening knowledge base on the issue, and health professionals are responding.  Victims of FGM will receive medical attention once a situation comes to the attention of the authorities.  I can also inform the Senator that the HSE is committed to the development of a second national intercultural health strategy.  Addressing FGM will be clearly referenced in the strategy.</p><p>While reported incidents of FGM in Ireland are rare, even one such incident is a matter of grave concern.  The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work with other relevant Government agencies and AkiDwA to improve health outcomes for vulnerable groups and to respond to this form of gender-based violence which we never thought we would have to deal with in our society.</p></speech>

I was at the launch of the specialist clinic, which was very important.</p> <p>I wish to make three brief points in response.  First, I am aware of the difficulty with crime statistics, and AkiDwA has raised the matter with me.  We need to change the way crime statistics are reported to ensure we can identify how many instances of FGM are reported in any one year.  I ask the Minister of State to follow up the matter with the Central Statistics Office and the Garda and I will do so as well.  It is unacceptable that we do not know how many cases of FGM there are and that we are reliant on media reports.</p> <p>Second, the funding the Minister of State pointed out is provided to AkiDwA is a very small amount.  Given that, as the Minister of State acknowledged, there is no specific training relating to dealing with FGM, there is a real need for more resources to be provided to organisations like AkiDwA, particularly to enable them to engage not only in community education but also the education and training of health professionals and front-line workers, especially in the HSE and Garda to which reports of FGM will be made.  I ask that the Minister of State might consider further resourcing AkiDwA.</p> <p>Third, I am glad that the HSE will develop a second national intercultural health strategy that will include a reference to FGM.  We also need a second national action plan on FGM.  That is the sort of focus we need to ensure this practice does not happen again in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is recognised that the HSE has a good relationship with AkiDwA because it has the expertise to assist in dealing with this horrific practice.</p> <p>The way crime statistics are reported is certainly something that will have to be explored.  As I outlined earlier, if incidents occur, they are classified under other specific titles.  We will have to examine how FGM is recorded.  Is it because of legislation from the Department of Justice and Equality?  Is it through the way An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na report it?  Is it the way the Central Statistics Office records the offence?  We must establish where change needs to be made.  I concur with the Senator about the matter.  She can rest assured that I will pursue the matter and see what we can achieve in terms of ensuring this awful and horrendous crime is accurately reported.</p></speech>

Approximately 2,000 garda&iacute; are embarking on an administrative strike.  They will not be processing files or interacting with senior management.  It is also understood that they will not be attending court as witnesses in prosecution cases and this will have a savage impact on our criminal justice system.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 17,000 teachers who are members of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, will go on strike.  This will affect two thirds of the secondary schools in our country.  It may not be felt so much this Thursday but after the mid-term break it will have a serious impact on parents of younger children, particularly those in first and second year, who will have to engage child minders at great expense.  Non-consultant hospital doctors are also threatening to strike and nurses' unions are also considering balloting their members on the issue of bed to staff ratios.  </p> <p>What is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform doing about all of this?  He should come into this House and explain what is being done about industrial action in the public sector.  The Lansdowne Road agreement is in place but I heard the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on "Morning Ireland" this morning saying that it should be collapsed, even though it was one of his initiatives.  I do not think anyone has a solution at this stage but we must take this more seriously or the country will be at an absolute standstill.</p></speech>

I was in Portlaoise last weekend with the TechnoTeachers Association, a voluntary group of woodwork and mechanical drawing teachers.  It was wonderful to see the project work produced by 15 year old children under their tutelage and to see those teachers meeting on their own time in order to progress their subjects.  We must take our hats off to them.  Not everything about teaching is bad.</p> <p>I also attended a parade at the weekend in Collins Barracks organised by ex-Sergeant Paul Clarke to commemorate the heroes of Jadotville.  It is a sad reflection on this country that we did not do those heroes proud.  We have not issued them with a medal for the service they have given to this country.</p></speech>

Right now, it is running off the rails and we must do something about that.  Yesterday, Mr. Eoin Ronayne of the Civil Public and Services Union was on the "Today with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke" programme, calling for the reopening of the Lansdowne Road agreement in order to bring in all of the unions.  If this does not happen, we run the risk of the entire agreement collapsing.  I agree with my colleague that the Minister needs to come into the House.  I urge the Leader to invite him so that we can have a proper debate on this issue.  We do not want to see schools closed from 7 November onwards.</p></speech>

I commend the efforts of the Not On Our Watch organisation, backed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other civil society bodies, on its work on a campaign to relocate 200 unaccompanied minors from the camp in Calais to this State.  These are children fleeing persecution and horror.  They did not start the wars or provide the ammunition to continue them.  They could be any of our children.  Children as young as eight have arrived at Calais on their own and they know that people do not want them.  Imagine what that feels like.  As a nation, we know what is was like when the signs in the doorways of our once unfriendly neighbours bore the words "No dogs and no Irish".  How quickly we forget.  It is no longer good enough for us to say that this is a complex problem and to wring our hands.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Leadership on this issue must come from those in government and Members of the Oireachtas.  I commend Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and her calls for a national effort.  Like most others, I want the Ireland of the future to be a multicultural and dynamic society where we embrace difference and diversity.  We should never allow unfounded fears to fester and rot the minds of individuals and communities.  Today, I call on the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, to lead the way by doing two very simple things.  First, he should contact Karen Moynihan from Terenure who has been doing wonderful work with the Refugee Youth Service, which works with unaccompanied children in this refugee camp.  Second, he should pick up the phone to his French counterpart, President Hollande, and offer this State as a place where these 200 children can be relocated and placed within families where they will know that they are loved and wanted.  After all, we like to wear the badge that we are a kind and friendly nation that truly cares about humankind.  It is now our time to show the world that we truly deserve this badge of honour.  </p></speech>

We see the impact of plastic waste on our marine ecosystems in the rivers and oceans of the world.  This plastic is filling habitats and demonstrates a careless disposal of waste.  Most shocking of all, these little plastic beads, which are contained in face washes and shower gels, are intended to go into the water system.  From there, they make their way into the marine food chain.  Our EU membership involves obligations to look after our marine environment.  The marine strategy framework directive obliges Ireland to ensure its seas and coasts have a good environmental status by 2030.  Yesterday, the Italian Parliament passed a bill to ban microbeads following the path set by the US, the UK, France and several other countries.  I hope this Bill will go some way towards addressing the challenge of pollution in the marine ecosystem.</p></speech>

It is a very important Bill.  These microbeads stay in the environment for decades, if not centuries, so I congratulate the Senator on bringing forward the Bill.</p> <p>Industrial relations in this country are disastrous at this stage.  I thought it was quite hypocritical of Fianna F&aacute;il to raise this issue considering it crashed and burned the economy.  The effects on the public sector are in direct relation to the way the economy was run during 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il rule.  However, Fine Gael must take responsibility for the length of time and inaction involved.  Deputy Howlin showed leadership when he collapsed the Haddington Road agreement into the Lansdowne Road agreement to reflect the changing circumstances of the economy.  Unfortunately, we have seen inaction and lack of engagement, negotiations and leadership in this area since the formation of the Government.  One group cannot be treated differently from another.  There is a need to look again at the Lansdowne Road agreement and collapse it into a new agreement that would encompass the entire public sector.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il should have gone into a coalition Government instead of this myth that it is not in power or has no control and that if anything goes wrong, it is Fine Gael's fault and if anything goes right, it is Fianna F&aacute;il's doing.  We need leadership in this area.  Otherwise, we will go into a year of strikes and industrial unrest.  I second Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's proposal when he rose in this House asking for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to come to the House and have a discussion.  Even at this late hour, the Minister should come to the House and reassure us that at least there is a plan because nobody else thinks there is a plan.  There is plan of no engagement or discussion and the thinking is that everything will go well and the Government will face it down.  That will lead to an economic crash.  We talk about what happened in the referendum in the UK where the people decided to leave the EU.  The industrial unrest we are facing into could destroy all the good work of the past five years in trying to rebuild our economic independence.  It could all be lost for the lack of a plan and a lack of engagement.  I ask that the Minister comes to the House as soon as possible to discuss what his plan is in respect of industrial peace for our nation.  </p></speech>

The question of how we can deliver an electric car programme that can work within our economic means is a key issue for our society.  We need to promote electric cars as much as possible.  The benefits are well known in terms of the carbon footprint but also in terms of their cost.  There have been major changes regarding how long an electric car will last on a motorway in terms of kilometres.  It could be the key driver in our economy in terms of reducing our carbon footprint.  I have seen initiatives such as Drive4Zero in Cork, which gave electric cars free parking and free access to bus lanes.  We need to roll this out nationally.  We need a national drive to make sure people can move over to electric cars for the benefit of society.  Could the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the Chamber so we can discuss this issue and put together a plan for the next decade, as every other country in Europe has, so we can ensure we can move from the petrol and diesel regime to an electric car regime?</p></speech>

In 2015, it received 1.8 million calls, an average of 5,100 per day.  The reason I raise this issue today is because Hallowe'en night is only days away and, unfortunately, has become a byword for stories about attacks on our emergency services.  I ask the Leader to consider scheduling a debate on our emergency services and how they are protected in carrying out their work on our behalf.  It is not just a Hallowe'en problem.  In May, a gang of around 15 youths attacked fire-fighters in Limerick city.  One fire-fighter was struck over the head with a pool cue.  In April, a fire-fighter in Dundalk was hospitalised after his crew was attacked with missiles.  Nationally, there are hundreds of incidences of assaults on garda&iacute; every year.  Nurses are regularly victims of unprovoked assaults, prison officers are routinely hospitalised and fire officers and paramedics are often more in danger from the thugs who attack them than from the incident or fire to which they are responding.  A couple of years ago, my colleague in Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Dara Calleary, proposed the Assaults on Emergency Workers Bill 2012, which is designed to crack down on assaulting or threatening an emergency worker in the line of duty.  A central part of this Bill was a proposed minimum jail term of five years for anybody convicted of assaulting or threatening the life of a member of the front-line emergency services while they are on duty.  We need to get real about this type of behaviour.  Anyone who goes out of their way to assault, harm or threaten an on-duty emergency responder should know that the law will come down heavily on them.  Throwing rocks at an ambulance and its crew as it brings a sick man to hospital, as happened last Hallowe'en night, is the behaviour of thugs.  We now have a crazy situation in many accident and emergency departments whereby there are as many security guards as there are consultants or doctors on duty.  This is farcical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This thuggish behaviour requires the Oireachtas to act.

The first is motion No. 9 on the Order Paper, which criticises the Bank of Ireland for undemocratically stopping the bank accounts of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.  There was general support for this motion, including significant support from the Government, and many Senators' names are attached to it.  When can Government time be allocated for the motion be taken?  If it is not taken soon, the urgency will be lost.</p> <p>The other issue is the Confucius Institutes.  UCD has accepted one of these.  They are centres for the teaching of the Chinese language, apparently, but they have also been described by China's former Vice Premier Li Changchun as an important part of China's propaganda set up.  That is very interesting.  The institutes have been used across the United States to stop visits by the Dalai Lama, for example, and to stop discussions in universities about the situation in Taiwan.  Where universities allow such discussions, they must subscribe to the One-China Policy, so it is clearly a propaganda arm.  A sum of &euro;3 million was provided by the Chinese Government for the institute in UCD, another &euro;3 million was provided by the Irish Government and UCD put in &euro;1.4 million.  That was a total of &euro;7.4 million, but the bill has risen to &euro;10.2 million and it is now seeking extra cash.  I am glad the Department of Education and Skills has refused to give any more.  It is right, because I believe we must look into this institute.</p> <p>American and Canadian academics have expressed considerable concern about this.  Confucius Institutes have been established on 465 campuses in 123 countries, so they are a significant part of China's soft power approach.  In December 2014, the Canadian Association of University Teachers called on all universities currently hosting Confucius Institutes to stop doing so.  In other words, it called for a halt to this development.  The American Association of University Professors made the same call to universities in the United States.  Its statement said the Confucius Institutes "function as an arm of the Chinese state... and advance a state agenda in the recruitment and control of academic staff, in the choice of curriculum, and in the restriction of debate".  I have spoken on academic freedom and freedom of conscience on many occasions.  In fact, I and a very distinguished representative of UCD tabled amendments to the Universities (Amendment) Bill relating to the question of academic freedom.  The amendments were so significant that they were taken up wholesale by the Swedish Government, so I am not speaking from a background of anti-Chinese prejudice.  I am not prejudiced against the Chinese, but questions must be asked when a country funds a propaganda arm of another state with which there might be serious disagreements.</p> <p>I will conclude by putting this in context.  Quite recently, Members of this Parliament were warned by the Government not to attend celebrations of the Taiwanese Government.  I believe we must draw a line in the sand where China is interfering in-----</p></speech>

This is a very critical time in the economy's recovery and we are in real danger of unwinding the solid progress that has been made.  In addition, our economy is seriously exposed to Brexit and other outside influences that can affect the recovery currently under way.  The public sector pay agreements were agreed by the majority of the public sector unions in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  What they signed up to in terms of restoring incremental pay must be respected.  I urge caution and restraint, and I ask all politicians, both independent and members of parties, to adopt a responsible approach to what is a very sensitive issue at present.  I agree with other Members that we should invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the House for a debate not only on public sector pay, but also on the services that the public sector unions provide for our citizens.  If we are upright and honest about this and if we are calling for pay increases, it behoves all of us as policy makers to show where savings can be made in services so pay can be restored to the levels that people are claiming.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House for such a debate.  It is important that we identify the services we need and how we will fund them.  It is also important that we understand the reality of the current economic circumstances and that financial resources are finite and must be distributed in a fair and equitable manner.</p> <p>I also ask the Leader to establish when the boards of the various hospital groups will be appointed.  Over three years ago the previous Government set out a vision for the reform of acute hospital services and the hospital groups were the main plank of that reform.  The hospital boards must be appointed to have a proper governance structure with full accountability and autonomy.  To date, I have found it difficult to establish when those boards will be appointed.  The groups and the chief executive officers are in place, but the boards are still not in place.  The structure will not be complete until they are appointed.  Will the Leader establish the position in that regard for the House?</p></speech>

Indeed, we are facing a winter of discontent.  I am also a little wary of Fine Gael and its privatisation policy for public services.  We need investment, not disinvestment.</p> <p>I wish to bring to the attention of the House the data released by the Child Care Law Reporting Project last week.  The data concern the number of care order applications which were made in courts throughout the country with regard to children where there is deemed to be a serious or immediate risk to the health and welfare of the child.  In 2004, there were 9,864 care order applications.  By 2015, the number had increased to 14,124.  The main reason put forward for the significant increase is care order applications, applications for extensions and reviews of current care orders.  The data reveal that there is a significant increase in care order applications from 1,800 to 3,413.  A large amount of information is contained in the figures and they should be explored further.  We can surmise as a result of the figures that Tusla is doing more intensive work, which is to be welcomed.  We can also surmise that more children are at risk around the country.  There are many regional variations in terms of applications, orders and orders rejected.  For example, in one county there were 1,400 applications last year while in another county there were only 14.  There must be more research to examine the reasons for this imbalance.  I suggest that the Minister be invited to the House for a debate on the work of Tusla with regard to care orders.</p></speech>

The media has covered the draft rail report which was carried out by the National Transport Authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann which painted a very bleak picture of the finances of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, citing annual losses in the running of the operation and the requirement of capital investment.  One of the propositions that is very alarming is that it might be better if we have fewer railway lines and reduce rail services to those between Dublin and Cork, Dublin and Limerick and Dublin and Belfast.  The Minister needs to clarify there is no agenda and no destruction of railway lines in this country.  I ask him to endorse the Government policy that we are to invest in public transport.  Public transport does not mean just public transport in the three or four cities I mentioned.  We have a requirement for public transport in the west as well.</p> <p>An annual census is carried out by the National Transport Authority which looks at the number of passengers on every railway line on a given day of the year.  On the given day of the most recent census, there were 1,100 passengers on the western rail corridor between Galway and Limerick, which by hook or by crook, they are determined should not grow and should not continue.  Compare these figures with the passenger numbers on the Limerick to Dublin line, which offers four extra services in each direction and which had only 130 additional passengers.</p> <p>The general line that people in the west get is the numbers using the service, the critical mass and that we do not have the population and so on.  The truth is that all public passenger rail services are subsidised by the taxpayer and none more so than the DART service, which one would think should be commercially viable in its own right.  Given that the figures for passenger numbers in the headcount conducted by the western rail corridor exceed the target numbers, we need a reality check about the future of the public transport system and the future of our rail lines, which should not be that they are going to be turned into cycle tracks.</p> <p>If we are to have balanced regional development, which is at the core of the issue, we need to invest in railways and roads or else we will always be coming with the poor mouth.  One of the key aspects of balanced regional development is investment in infrastructure, and transport infrastructure and connectivity is very important.  A debate on transport infrastructure is long overdue.  The Minister needs to come to the House to provide reassurance and tell us what is in store for us.</p></speech>

Central to the ethos of the Minister is a universal health care system free at the point of delivery.  The plan, Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together, came about after consideration of the report of an expert panel led by Professor Rafael Bengoa, entitled Systems, Not Structures - Changing Health and Social Care.  This report set out the need for radical and fundamental change in the health care system.  It identified that a system designed for the 20th century was no longer fit for purpose in the 21st century.  There was uniform support, endorsement and ratification from the Executive yesterday for the Minister's report.  She presented the initial outline plan and aspirations of the report to the Assembly yesterday.  It has been welcomed by the health care sector and, by and large, by the trade unions who represent the vast array of workers within the health care sector in the North.</p> <p>One of the key issues that the Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, has been working on with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has been greater harmonisation and co-operation at a cross-Border level on the issue of health, which is of such critical and fundamental importance.  We have seen and can all acknowledge and appreciate the very real benefits that come about as a result of the cross-Border co-operation planning, strategising and work, not least in the role of the children's health care and congenital heart disease network that has been very warmly and positively received throughout the country.</p> <p>I propose today and through our leader Senator Conway-Walsh at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that we invite both Ministers to the House after the Christmas break.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We should extend an invitation to both Ministers for Health to come to the Seanad to address us not only on the emerging issues from the very far-sighted plan of the Minister, Michelle O'Neill, but also to discuss the existing cross-Border co-operation around health care, what they believe are the benefits of that and what they can do to improve and build on it in the time ahead.</p></speech>

I worked on behalf of one of those men over the summer and I do not know if it came out of my work but I was delighted about the ceremony to commemorate those men on 17 September in Custume Barracks, which I attended.  There was an issue regarding medals and I understand a certificate was allocated.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that something further could be done related to a military tradition.  The awarding of a certificate was a compromise.  Many of the men seemed to be satisfied with it but I agree with the Senator that we might be able to go a little further in recognising the bravery of those men and the fact that they represented our State in what were difficult times.  I urge anybody to look up Netflix or to go to the cinema to see "The Seize of Jadotville".  It is an inspiring film that tells about life at war and also about the political machinations that went on behind the scenes.  Those men were caught in a situation that was not of their making.  They were very brave and I am delighted the State has recognised their bravery.</p> <p>The Vatican has issued new guidelines not to scatter ashes after a cremation.  That is something of which I was not aware.  The guidance is that ashes should not be kept at home and should be kept in a place approved by the church.

The number of children waiting more than 18 months to see an expert in juvenile arthritis has increased from 22 to 110 between January and the end of August this year.  That is a 400% increase in the number of children and teenagers waiting at least 18 months.  Figures released up to the end of August reveal that a total of 565 children are still waiting to be seen by one of only two specialists in this area.  If left untreated, juvenile arthritis can quickly lead to permanent joint damage, muscle wastage and the deformity, not to mention the trauma a child and his or her family experience as a result.  With this condition, it is vital that children are seen as soon as possible by a rheumatologist.  Irreparable damage can be caused to joints while this waiting continues, in addition to damage of an emotional nature.</p> <p>Two consultants are based in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin, and they provide care to more than 1,200 children aged between three and 16 suffering with this condition.  Ireland has only two paediatric rheumatology consultants and we are ranked as having one of the lowest number of paediatric rheumatologists in Europe.  I join Arthritis Ireland in calling on the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to appoint a third consultant to this area.  Allowing children to continue to suffer is simply not acceptable.  I plead with the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris.</p></speech>

We have had eight deaths on our roads in the past four days.  In the year to date, there have been 157 road deaths while there were 162 road fatalities for the entire year in 2015.  We are now only five off the number of people who were killed on the roads last year; 31 more people have been killed on our roads than at this time last year.  There has been a 25% increase in the number of road deaths, from 126, which in itself was not an acceptable figure, to 157.  Will the Leader ask Moyagh Murdoch, chief executive officer, and Liz O'Donnell, chairman, of the Road Safety Authority to come to this House prior to the Minister coming in to speak on those figures?</p> <p>People were killed on the roads in Limerick recently.  One factor involved is the huge build up of traffic.  I travelled to this House this morning by train and it took me nearly three quarters of an hour to get from my home to the railway station, which is only a distance of a mile and half.  The profile of traffic has changed.  During the recession, many people did not have jobs and those who had work were able to find accommodation nearby.  Now people are commuting.  There is a need for a national debate on the way the structures and demographics have changed.  It is now two months prior to the end of the year and with a figure of 157 road deaths, we have nearly the same number as for last year in total.  I ask for a debate on this issue in the House with the chairman and the chief executive office of the Road Safety Authority.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is the new children's hospital in Dublin.</p></speech>

People will arrive at the Red Cow roundabout on time but it will take more time to get to the hospital and I ask that they be looked after.  I am told the reason the hospital is on the site of St. James's Hospital is because it needs to be near adult services.  However, there is a human dimension for parents bringing children up to the hospital.</p> <p>These two issues are very important.</p></speech>

We could have an interesting debate with the Minister on those issues.  Recently, we have seen a huge increase in the volume of lorry traffic on our roads.  Previously, lorries could carry 44 tonnes in weight but as a result of a derogation in place for 2 tonnes, lorries may now carry 42 tonnes.  That means there will be extra lorries on our roads.  It is appropriate that we would have the Minister in the House to debate traffic management with respect to our roads and railways.</p></speech>

On the industrial relations issue raised by Senators Ardagh, Humphreys, Coffey, Craughwell and Devine, it is important that we all speak with one voice in calling on the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, to engage and reach a meaningful conclusion.  I disagree with Senator Humphreys because the Government is available and willing in this regard and as he knows well, under the previous Government the Lansdowne Road agreement was the umbrella all the unions came under.</p></speech>

I do not intend to engage in a public war of words here because as a member of the ASTI and somebody who wants to see this issue resolved, I am aware there are young people in the Public Gallery, some of whom are doing examinations, but as Senator Craughwell rightly said, there is a multiplicity of schoolteachers across the country doing a huge amount of voluntary work, whether it is projects, plays, musicals, training teams and so on.  We must recognise the importance of the work they do both outside and inside the classroom but what the Government has committed to is pay restoration, whether it is for the new entrants or the existing teachers.  In that regard I will not be lectured to by some of the Members opposite because it was their policies that resulted in the need for us to bring in the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, and they should reflect upon that.  We must ensure that we have a sustainable public service that is not based on privatisation, as Senator Devine said.  I certainly do not want to see the public sector privatised and nor do I see many in Fine Gael who want to do that, so that is a misrepresentation but we must have an efficient, well-resourced, well-managed public service.  I appeal to those on all sides to come back to the table and engage because it is vitally important that a resolution is achieved.  Nobody wants to see members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, schoolteachers or any public sector workers on strike, and we all recognise the hardship that resulted from the cuts that were inflicted but the fundamental point is that this Government, as did the previous Government, have started to restore pay.</p> <p>I thank Senators Craughwell and Feighan for raising the issue of the men from the 35th Battalion who fought in Jadotville.

It is important, and I have always said this in the House, that we recognise the sacrifice and the heroism of former members of our Defence Forces, who are celebrated across the world, whether it is the Congo, Lebanon or wherever.  To be fair to Senator McFadden, she has been very involved in this issue also because of the importance of the Army in her area.  We will continue to work with the Minister to see if we can bring about a resolution to this matter.  I cannot promise that we will but I am happy to take up the matter further.</p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh and Wilson spoke about unaccompanied minors and the refugee crisis that is engulfing parts of the work, in particular in the so-called jungle, in Calais.  It behoves all of us to play a role in ending the misfortune taking place there.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has agreed to come to the House to address the issue of unaccompanied minors.  She stated in the United Nations that Ireland is willing to play its part to address the issue.  A global response and co-operation to end the suffering must be forthcoming.</p> <p>On the matter raised by Senator Grace O'Sullivan, I have offered the Senator a date for the Bill.  It is not one that is conducive to her schedule but I am happy to sit down with the Senator and agree a timetable at the group meeting at 2 p.m.  I have it on the calendar for the month of November but I am happy to discuss that with the Senator with a view to reaching an accommodation on the Bill.  I appreciate the importance of it.</p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of electric cars.  We will have the Minister, Deputy Naughten, come to the House to address that issue.</p> <p>Senator Swanick raised the issue of attacks on emergency first responders.  It is deplorable that any member of the emergency services is attacked under any guise.  Regardless of who they are, we must always show respect for the role played by emergency services personnel.  They do tremendous work.  They put their own lives at risk in the protection and safety of others and we should stand united in the condemnation of these attacks.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to address the issue the Senator raised.</p> <p>Senator Norris referenced the motion in his name and those of the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators in the main.

I am sure it would be nice to have one for former President Cearbhall &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh in Cahirciveen, a beautiful setting.  The centre the Senator refers to is a living institution.  The president he refers to has spent time in the National University of Ireland, Galway dealing with human rights.  There has been some newspaper commentary on this recently.  Rather than criticise it, we should find out how former American presidents set up their presidential libraries.  I am glad that Senator Norris is not at the end of his road.

They are people who die.  They leave loved ones who have to grieve and there are huge implications for the lives of many who are left behind.  We are approaching the bank holiday weekend.  It is crucial that people slow down and do not drink.  The clocks will go back and people will be out late.  Tiredness, speed, the odd second on the phone sending a text or whatever can jeopardise the lives of others on the roads.  It is important we do not do that, not just this weekend but in general.  I would be happy to invite the Minister to the House.  Bringing in people from the Road Safety Authority is a matter for the CPP.</p> <p>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell rightly raised the changing demographic on our roads now that more people are back at work.  It is important that education in road behaviour increases because people are commuting further and taking risks.  I see it in the mornings when people are taking kids to school, going to work, leaving a bit later or getting caught in traffic and taking shortcuts.  It is crucial to re-educate people, along with enforcement and engineering.</p> <p>The Senator also mentioned the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the importance of people being able to gain access to it.  I would be happy to invite the Minister for Health to the House to deal with that subject.</p> <p>Senator Wilson raised the very important issue of Brexit and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  He is scheduled to come to the House but the Government is recruiting in the Defence Forces.  In the White Paper it commits to recruiting 9,500.  There are 400 being recruited this year.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#P00500"><p>I am pleased to be in the Seanad for the Committee Stage debate on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  As all Senators are aware, alcohol is causing significant damage across the population, in workplaces and to children.  It carries a substantial burden to everyone in Irish society.</p> <p>I would like to outline some of the forms of harm caused by or attributable to alcohol.  In 2013, an average of three people died every day as a result of drinking alcohol.  On average, one alcohol-related death each day is due to poisoning or trauma and two alcohol-related deaths are due to chronic conditions.  Alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm.  In 2014, one in three self-harm presentations was related to alcohol.  Alcohol is associated with a risk of developing health problems such as alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancer and injury.  The rate of alcohol liver disease discharges trebled between 1995 and 2013.  The highest rate of increase was observed among those between the ages of 15 and 34.  It is estimated that the incidence of alcohol-related cancers will more than double for females and will increase by 81% for males up to 2020.  Alcohol is a factor in many cases of assault, including sexual assault, rape, domestic violence and manslaughter.  It is estimated that 167,170 people suffered an alcohol-related assault in 2013.</p> <p>The cost of alcohol misuse also has a significant impact on the economy and the taxpayer.  For example, the annual cost to the taxpayer of alcohol-related discharges from hospital is &euro;1.5 billion.  In addition, approximately &euro;1 of every &euro;10 spent on public health in 2012 was assigned to alcohol-related discharges.  This excludes emergency care, general practice and alcohol treatment services.  It is estimated that 5,315 people who were on the unemployment register in November 2013 had lost their jobs due to alcohol use.  The estimated cost of alcohol-related absenteeism was &euro;41 million in 2013.</p> <p>The Government is committed to tackling alcohol misuse in Ireland and the widespread harm it causes.  It is working to reduce alcohol consumption and to address the underlying causes of alcohol misuse, which are affordability, availability and attractiveness.  The Bill before the House is the most far-reaching proposal ever to have been made in this area by an Irish Government.  For the first time, alcohol is being addressed legislatively as a public health measure.  This legislation is a measured and evidence-based response to the need to deal with the very real harm caused by alcohol.  The aim of the Bill is to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum, which is the OECD average, by 2020 and to reduce the overall harms associated with alcohol.  The legislative measures contained in the Bill are required if we are to achieve this aim and to alter our relationship with alcohol.</p></speech>

As this Bill was introduced before her appointment, I expect she has had to catch up with the situation.  I would like to speak about the provisions in the amendment before the House with regard to broadcasting.  I accept that the procedures regarding the whole question of broadcasting, advertising and sponsorship are complex.  That is a currently a matter for consultation.  Has the Minister of State considered the question of newspaper advertisements in addition to that of broadcasting?  All the Sunday newspapers - I am referring particularly to the Sunday Independent - carry approximately six pages of advertisements.  I will give an example.  One advertisement said that people could purchase a bottle of gin for &euro;20 even though it would cost a publican between &euro;22 and &euro;25 to buy the same bottle.  According to the same advertisement, a bottle of brandy can be bought for &euro;30 even though it would cost a publican &euro;35 to buy it.  I checked these prices yesterday at various cash-and-carry outlets.  After the publican has bought the bottle of brandy for &euro;35, he or she has to add the additional percentage of VAT that applies to the sale of that drink.  The point I am making is that the under-cost selling of alcohol in supermarkets is one of the biggest dangers in relation to drink, as far as I can see.</p></speech>

When one picks up the newspaper on a Sunday, one says "Oh my goodness" when one reads that one can buy a whole case of Carlsberg, Budweiser or Canadian for &euro;15.  The cheapest price for which a publican could buy the same case would be approximately &euro;17.50.  Slabs can be bought at a very cheap price.  How can supermarkets sell these products at such low prices unless they are loss leaders?  The same thing applies to vodka advertised by Eurospar.  Captain Morgan Spiced Gold, which sounds very attractive, is retailing at &euro;23, but the cheapest a publican can buy it for at a wholesale outlet is &euro;22.50.  Slabs of Carlsberg, Corona, Heineken and Budweiser are advertised for sale in SuperValu for &euro;15 each, but the cheapest a publican can buy such a slab for is &euro;17.38.</p> <p>I thank the Chair for giving me a certain latitude in the points I am making at the outset of Committee Stage.  I appreciate that very welcome restrictions in relation to minimum volume sales are introduced later in the Bill, but there are ways of getting around that.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that drink should be separate from groceries.  Alcohol should not be part of the grocery trade.  I can get a &euro;10 voucher from one of the big supermarkets - Dunnes Stores, Tesco, SuperValu or Londis - if I buy over &euro;50 worth of groceries.  That is a regular marketing tool.  If I buy a bottle of vodka, a bottle of gin and a bottle of wine, I will get &euro;10 back if that comes to more than &euro;50, so the actual cost will be closer to &euro;40.  It is a form of subsidisation.  I am reasonable in my point of view.  I understand the complications.  I am not being simplistic.  It will not be easy to solve this.</p> <p>The point I am making is that this amendment basically relates to television advertising of alcohol, but I wonder whether the Minister of State should consider the whole question of newspaper advertising of under-priced alcohol.  I refer to loss leaders that are aimed at bringing customers in on the day in question.  It is strange that as we approach Christmas, bottles of Jameson whiskey will be sold for &euro;25, even though the lowest amount for which a publican can buy the same bottle is approximately &euro;29.  What is happening?  It is quite demeaning for those involved in this business to have to go to the local supermarket to buy drink for their pubs.  Pubs are under pressure in rural Ireland.  I suppose I had better give a declaration of interest.  I am involved in the Castlecoote Lodge Bar and replica D&aacute;il and Seanad lounge in Castlecoote, County Roscommon.  I hope I have made that declaration in case anyone says I have a vested interest in this matter.  I have a knowledge of the pub trade.  When I served as a D&aacute;il Deputy for 15 and a half years, most of my clinics took place in pubs.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Harris, holds clinics in pubs.  I am sure that is also part and parcel of the Minister of State's work.  I want to be fair and reasonable about this important Bill.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is in favour of the principle of this Bill from a health point of view.  We have certain reservations about the technical side of it.  I am expressing my personal view on this whole area.  Members of this House should express their personal opinions on the whole industry.  In summary, has the Minister of State considered the possibility of imposing restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic products that are being sold below cost?  I welcome very much the proposal for a minimum unit cost.  I hope it will be implemented.  The question of the separation of alcohol from groceries is an important one.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Alcohol is not a grocery item.

Those are my views and I would like to hear those of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for bringing forward the Bill.  There is overall agreement that we need to tackle the drink problem.  We have major problems in our health service and regarding many issues surrounding drink.  The University of Sheffield, which was contracted by the Northern Ireland Executive, made a presentation to the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on how we can deal with this growing problem.  It produced some interesting results.  The Minister of State mentioned the knock-on difficulties we are having outside of health.  Reducing the level of alcohol consumption would reduce the number of deaths associated with the abuse of alcohol, crime and work absenteeism, which is a major issue.  People staying away from work due to excessive drinking is a great loss to employers.  The latter is an issue which we do not debate.</p><p>Medical practitioners in accident and emergency departments tell me the numbers of cases involving excessive drinking of alcohol coming in continues to increase, especially in the hours after 10 p.m.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 hospital beds are occupied at any one time by people with health difficulties directly related to excessive drinking.  It is interesting to read the University of Sheffield report.  It is important that we realise the difficulties we face.  The report states:</p><blockquote>The evidence estimates that within the overall population aged 18+, the proportion of people who don&rsquo;t drink, drink at low risk (less than 16.8 std. drinks per week for men and 11.2 for women), increasing risk (16.8 - 40 std. drinks per week for men and 11.2 - 28 for women), and high risk (more than 40 std. drinks per week for men and 28 for women) levels are 22.1%, 56.3% and 16.4% and 5.2%, respectively.</blockquote> <p>While the number of high risk drinkers is small, we also need to deal with the 16.4% who drink more than the recommended limit for low-risk consumption.  They are also at risk.  The report also states:</p><blockquote>Low risk drinkers consume on average 4.5 standard drinks per week, spending &euro;508 per annum on alcohol.  Increasing risk drinkers consume 21.9 standard drinks per week, spending &euro;2,218 per annum and high risk drinkers consume on average 62.5 standard drinks per week, spending &euro;5,120 per annum.</blockquote> <p>The number going into the high-risk category, above the recommended consumption limit, is continuing to increase.  Our alcohol consumption per head of population is one of the highest among OECD countries.  We need to start dealing with it.  Nobody has any objection to people drinking socially.  It is the health difficulties we need to address.</p><p>The Bill sets out minimum unit pricing.  I fully understand that it must be a co-ordinated approach with the Northern Ireland authorities.  In the provinces of Canada, the introduction of minimum unit pricing has created a benefit for the community, health service and general population.  We cannot continue to ignore the trend whereby young people start binge drinking at a very early age.  It is open season, particularly in our colleges between September and Christmas.  I have seen it during recent weeks.  I do not live far from University College Cork, where it is dangerous to drive.  Even at 8 p.m., I have seen people who have been drinking all day.  We need to deal with the issue.  We need to do a huge amount of work in education.  We have done it for smoking.  We should not take just one approach.  The Bill is not the only action we need to consider.</p><p>People may not like some elements of the Bill.  We may have to compromise on some of the elements it contains.</p></speech>

I am a little confused.  I take it we are on Amendment No. 1.  Other colleagues have ranged widely, and I will not be able to resist the temptation, although I will keep it to a minimum.  It seems that Amendment No. 1 would not insert something but delete something.  There is a great similarity between section 1 of the Bill, as initiated, and section 1, as proposed in the amendment.  Under the heading &quot;Short title and commencement&quot;, section 1(1) reads, &quot;This Act may be cited as the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2015.&quot;  The amendment changes 2015 to 2016.  Section 1(2) is exactly the same in the amendment and section 1(3) is more or less exactly the same.  Are we going to have duplication?  Would it not be better and correct to substitute the amendment for what is there?  Otherwise, we will have duplication.  I wonder why there is this duplication.</p><p>I begin the discussion on the Bill, particularly this section, from the point made in the opening of the explanatory memorandum.  It is a very serious statement, as follows:</p><blockquote>Alcohol is no ordinary product.  It has major public health implications and is responsible for a considerable burden of health, social and economic harm at individual, family and societal levels.</blockquote> <p>This should give us pause.  This is where we start from.  It is not an ordinary problem.  It has enormous implications in terms of health and finance.  I am 72 years old, and have seen a very considerable change in Ireland.  Like most Irish people, my roots are firmly in the bog, and I glory in the bog.  All over my little bog in Laois, there were family grocery shops which were also pubs.  One could go in and get a flitch of bacon and have a pint of stout in the back.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was confusion at that stage, but it was when there were local brewers - Perry's in Rathdowney, Smithwick's and, in Dublin, Guinness.

I will not only address the Chair, I will address its occupant.</p> <p>Multinational corporations have been carrying out extensive lobbying of Members of this House.  Sometimes, they are clever in how they conceal their origins referring to "responsible drinkers" and all of that rubbish.  No one believes it.  They have stopped lobbying me because I used to send material back and tell them that I did not believe them.</p> <p>I will start with the impact of alcohol on the health of the people and the finances of the country.  Three lives are lost daily.  There is a &euro;3.75 billion cost to the health service and the Exchequer.  That is a hell of a lot of money.  I am not being moralistic about this.  These are the facts.  I acknowledge the presence of former Senator Jillian van Turnhout in the Gallery.  She has done a great deal of work on this issue.  She was with the Children's Rights Alliance, from which I received a briefing.  The impact of alcohol on children is frightening.  It is being done through advertising.  Children are attracted to bright advertising, including on television.  They will ask about these matters.  A survey published in December 2015 found that 64% of children aged between 13 and 17 years had consumed alcohol.  That ought to give people pause for thought.  A total of 53% had been drunk at least once.  Kids in their early teens drunk.  This is the situation with which we are faced.  Forget about the fancy stuff about putting bottles of wine behind curtains and so on.  Think directly of the damage being done.  Of those surveyed, 50% reported that they drank every month.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed concern about the high level of alcohol consumption by adolescents and has called on Ireland to strengthen its efforts to address this.</p> <p>After the Bill's recital of the technical and legal mumbo jumbo, it gets into broadcast advertisements, that is, on the wireless and television.  They are potent instruments.  We should follow directly the example set by what was done in respect of tobacco and ban the advertising of alcohol.  Alcohol is something that gives people pleasure when taken in moderation but it is a poison.  Is no one awake to this fact?  One can die of alcohol poisoning.  One does not have to wait to get cancer or cirrhosis of the liver.  A person can drink and drink - people increasingly do in, for example, student challenges where they drink enormous amounts - and die of alcohol poisoning after just one session.</p> <p>One in four people has experienced harm as a result of someone else's drinking and 55% of drinkers were hazardous drinkers.  The newspapers released a figure the other day showing that 97% of Irish people do not regard themselves as problem drinkers but that approximately 50% of them are binge drinkers.  It is a case of "Oh, but that is not a problem.  I just have an odd binge."</p> <p>It is time that we were realistic about this matter.

I hope that she keeps to them.  They are not enough but they are a beginning.  I want to strengthen her hand.  Of people questioned for the survey to which I refer, 74% were in favour of a ban on alcohol advertising on radio, television or anything else that appealed to young people.  Well done on tackling radio and television advertising, but the measure needs to be implemented as strictly as possible.  I would be in favour of a complete ban on alcohol.</p> <p>I will end on this point.  The promotion of sport through alcohol is ridiculous.  Some of it damages one's health.  This substance is used to promote and fund sports.  It is nonsense.</p></speech>

Harmful drinking is a major issue.  More than 8,000 people were treated for problem alcohol use in 2012.  Alcohol is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in the acute hospital sector, one quarter of injuries suffered by those presenting at emergency departments and over half of all attendances at specialised addiction treatment centres.  I have first-hand experience of this situation in that I have worked in many of Dublin city's accident and emergency departments, as well as for the NHS.  I know the trauma that alcohol causes the people involved as well as to the staff of accident and emergency departments.</p> <p>It is estimated that three people will die in Ireland everyday as a result of alcohol.  That equates to 88 deaths per month and more than 1,000 lives lost every year.  This is five times more than the number of road traffic deaths every year.  A study by the HSE in 2012 estimated that alcohol-related costs amounted to approximately &euro;3.7 billion per annum.  For these reasons, Fianna F&aacute;il is supportive of the legislative measures to curb alcohol abuse and excessive consumption.  We aim to strike a balance in our amendments and to be solution driven and pragmatic.</p></speech>

I am just following on.  Most small retailers are highly aware of the complications and problems surrounding alcohol because they are involved in the community and are locally based.  Anyone who goes to shops that are also off-licences will see that most have a defined break between where alcohol is sold and where ordinary groceries are sold.  This segregation is important.  It is being addressed.  We have given it quite some consideration in our amendments.</p> <p>Fears have been expressed in the House about below-cost selling and we would gladly see it addressed.  Below-cost selling by large supermarket chains in an attempt to induce people into drinking is a serious issue.  I would welcome anything that will tackle this scourge.</p></speech>

It is in the interests of public health.  We all know the burden on the public purse and, in particular, the public's heath.  This morning, there was a discussion in the Chamber about assaults on front-line staff and first responders, for example, fire-fighters, nurses, medics and garda&iacute;.  They usually respond to fires, accidents and domestic violence, which are largely fuelled by alcohol.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They then attack the first responders still fuelled by alcohol.  We need this debate and we need to get our house in order and no longer be known as the drunken Irish.  I welcome minimum pricing.  To go back to Scotland, the European courts have ruled that it is in the public interest.  There are some concerns about structural segregation.  We will discuss them when we get to section 20.  There are 52 amendments.  The basic aim is to protect children and, ultimately, change our mindset.  It is possible and it is essential for our well-being.  </p></speech>

I think everybody in this House welcomes 95% of this Bill but some people have problems with some small aspects of it.  By and large, 95% of the people think this is a very good Bill that is very welcome and will do what it aims to do.  Senator Norris posed a very good question relating to sports and advertising.  I believe we should turn it back on the drinks companies.  We should use our sports stars to advertise the fact that they do not drink.  I have not seen it done yet.  I think the health authorities should take the lead on this and give them grants for secondary school or third-level education or pay them to advertise the fact that they do not drink and that they set an example to other young people.  I think they would take a lead from that.</p></speech>

The first ministerial amendment deals with the commencement dates of the Bill, which will be introduced on a phased basis.  The amendment sets out commencement dates that now include sections 12 to 19 of the Bill regarding advertising.  The commencement dates were determined following a targeted consultation process with the industry.  Due account was taken of the time required to develop advertisement campaigns and the time span of sponsorship deals.  It is proposed that subsections 1 to 3 of section 12 regarding warnings in advertisements and sections 13 and 18, which provide for the prohibition of alcohol advertisements in certain places and the restriction on advertising in cinemas, will have a lead-in time of one year following commencement.  It is also proposed that subsections 7 to 11 of section 12 regarding the content of advertisements and sections 14 and 15, which provide for the restriction on advertising during events and sponsorship, will have a lead-in time of three years following commencement.  Section 17, which provides for restrictions on the advertising of alcohol products in publications that are subject to some exceptions, has a lead-in time of 18 months following commencement.</p> <p>It is also proposed to introduce a new section providing for a watershed for the broadcasting of alcohol advertisements on television and radio as provided for in Government decision, S180/20/101801.  This provision will have a lead-in time of one year following commencement.  The officials at the Department of Health and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are reviewing the requirements to commence similar provisions in the Bill at the same time and as such, this section may be revisited on Report Stage.  </p> <p>In respect of some of the points that were made, print media will come up under section 17.  Minimum alcohol pricing will come later as well in respect of minimum unit pricing.  Senator Norris made a point about section 1.  This will delete section 1 so there will not be any duplication.  </p></speech>

The vast majority certainly agree with many of the provisions in the Bill.  Some of us have concerns that we can tease out at a later stage.  I recognise and the Minister of State has just explained that amendment No. 1 gives the Minister of the day the mechanism to implement the orders or provisions in the Bill on a case-by-case basis as required.  This is particularly important in respect of the economic climate in the Border regions in light of Brexit and the impact it could have on the local economy in the Border areas, particularly with regard to the minimum pricing proposals with which I fully agree.  Alcohol abuse in this country is due to the availability of low-cost alcohol to people who, unfortunately, find themselves abusing it.</p> <p>I have a genuine concern about minimum alcohol pricing.  I have not been lobbied to the extent that some have said but I am concerned that some of the trade would automatically be displaced to Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State can clarify it for me but I presume that this amendment allows her to ensure that, as far as possible, there is a simultaneous policy with the authorities in Northern Ireland so we do not put ourselves at a serious disadvantage economically and, at the same time, do not achieve the objective of the Bill, which is to reduce the consumption or abuse of alcohol.  If it is available within miles across the Border for a much reduced price, we have a serious problem.  Could the Minister of State clarify whether this amendment allows her to phase in the Bill at an appropriate time?  </p> <p>The Minister also mentioned advertising measures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I presume I am correct in thinking, again to allow the Government time to implement the provisions, the legislation will allow existing sponsorship contracts to expire so that we do not interfere with them.  I am referring to sports clubs or others that have sponsorship deals and advertisements with alcohol firms or distributors.  Is that reason for this provision?  Does it allow such organisations to continue as normal while the Government can implement it but give due notice?  </p><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, that there are not enough prominent, high profile sports people enforcing the idea that alcohol is bad for a person.  Many high profile sports people are members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association or do not drink at all and it would be good to hear their voices in this debate.  They could help young people realise that there is an alternative to alcohol abuse and fight off the strong influence of advertisements about alcohol.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#T00200"><p>In respect of the minimum pricing issue, if it kicks in and how it will kick in, I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter.  Sterling is worth 90c now but it is volatile.  Can she change the provision if sterling gains parity in a few years' time?  Parity with sterling would have a major effect on the economy of the Border region.  If there is a sea change in sterling, what knock-on effect will that have on the entire Border region?  As much as we can have a minimum price we must also have an opportunity to take it out as well because I cannot forecast what will happen to sterling next month or in the future and I do not think the Minister of State or her officials can either.  Brexit and everything that is associated with the Border region at the moment indicates that the economy is exceptionally volatile and sterling is a key issue in that entire dynamic.  We must consider how we deal with the issue going forward.</p> <p>In respect of sponsorship, the sports industry sponsors sports clubs and in my neck of the woods every major nightclub has a sports award.  How does that scenario fit into this Bill?  It is all very well to impose a ban on alcohol advertisements.  What happens when the major driver in a locality becomes the major driver behind a sports award that is advertised in every newspaper using all types of publicity?  How does a monthly award, a yearly award, a quarterly award and an award for an award fit into the actual issues?  All of these awards ceremonies take place in huge nightclubs located in districts and regions that we are associated with.  It is a huge issue that we must grapple with.  As much as we are saying that alcohol advertisements will be phased out, how will we deal with the internal view of tying it together?</p></speech>

Please correct me if I am wrong but that is what I heard her say.  I ask her to outline what that means in practice.</p> <p>Like some of the previous speakers, I feel a little proprietorial about this Bill.  I was a member of the previous Government that generated this legislation that is extremely positive from a public health perspective.  I look forward to teasing out a couple of particular sections with the Minister of State later in the debate.</p> <p>I was struck by the comments on currency differential made by colleagues.  My constituency, from the point of view of the current market and currency comparisons, would be affected.  This is not the legislation to deal with such issues as it deals with a public health matter.  I ask the Minister of State to reiterate and remind us what the nature of the proposition is in terms of when the minimum unit pricing order will be made and what direct control she has over the order.  The view always was that if the ambition of the Bill was to be achieved, and if we were to adequately protect public health and make the kind of interventions that this Bill proposes in the interest of public health, then we would have to move in step with neighbouring jurisdictions.  She is aware of the challenges in that regard.  It is important that she puts on record how she intends to address the matter and what ongoing discussions are taking place with, for example, the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government on the timing and choreography of same.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#T00400"><p>I wish to further develop a couple of the points made by colleagues on the sports sphere.  I shall first refer to sports stars who distribute a good public image.  I can speak from experience about decent campaigns by the IRFU to encourage sensible or no drinking among players.  Donncha O'Callaghan and Peter Stringer are two famous sports stars who abstain from alcohol and they make that very clear distinction when they visit sports groups.  They could do with more institutional encouragement for their sensible approach to alcohol, especially in the area of mental health.</p> <p>I am concerned about the impact of the sponsorship provision in the Bill.  How can we regulate for international agreements and competitions with Irish sports bodies, national government bodies, teams and athletes?  How can we enforce the provision where contractual agreements exist, be they television deals or otherwise?  How can people compete in certain competitions that are sponsored by an alcohol company or brand?  What will happen in instances where they compete in international stadia and advertisements are broadcast on to Irish television and people can see hoarding on pitches or jerseys brandishing certain logos?  I would appreciate if the Minister of State went into detail about how the provision will be regulated and implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#T00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome this debate as it is pertinent to this country.  It is a sign of the times.  We are a more affluent society and are at liberty to make lifestyle choices.  Unfortunately, many of the lifestyle choices we make when affluent lead to many of us drinking too much.  Irish people must have a sober conversation, pardon the pun, about their relationship with alcohol.  We can deal with it through informed decision-making and taking personal responsibility.  The State plays a role in guiding us, informing us and protecting children to ensure we have a more responsible relationship with alcohol.</p> <p>During the debate, comparisons were made between alcohol and tobacco.  The end game is not ensuring everyone does not drink.  Ireland has been compared with France and Spain.  They are two countries that seem to have a more reasonable relationship with drink but those comparisons do not apply.  We are debating a public health Bill.  This is a more affluent time but we must encourage people to make the best choices for the benefit of their health and quality of life.  We have heard from experts so we all know that alcohol abuse impacts on one's health and quality of life.  </p> <p>Later we will debate sections that are up for amendment but I wish to flag the following issue.  Let us consider the advent of the change in how we relate to alcohol.  One thing that strikes many people is the price.  One can easily and cheaply buy a slab of beer.  Below cost selling is connected to the abolition of the Groceries Order.  This practice is particularly visible in the supermarket multiples where people can buy copious amounts of alcohol.  In fact, it costs more to buy a bottle of water than a can of beer.  The current situation makes alcohol freely available.  </p> <p>I welcome minimum unit pricing.  I am concerned that we are required to have an agreement with the North of Ireland to adopt minimum unit pricing simultaneously in order to have the best effect.  The situation is outside of our control and the initiative could take two years or more to complete.  In the meantime, below cost selling will continue even though it is a contributing factor to the abundance of alcohol and binge drinking.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am concerned that the Government is not acting immediately to stop below-cost selling, although such a move is within the gift of Government.  This may not be the end point, that is to say, minimum unit pricing.  It appears that, from the information the Department of Health has given us, that would be more effective.</p><p>Clearly, this below-cost selling is working for the supermarkets.  It is drawing people in and they buy drink.  We can act now.  I am at a loss to know why we are not doing something.  Numerous pointed comments have been made to the effect that we are being excessively lobbied.  In the case of every Bill or proposed legislation that comes through we are subject to lobbying.  However, it only seems to suit some people.  It does not suit public health aims.  It only seems to suit the big supermarkets.  Why is that?  We could do it right now instead of waiting.  Everyone welcomes minimum unit pricing, but when is it going to materialise?  In the meantime, there are options involving other measures.  I welcome the measures-----</p></speech>

I welcome the measures on advertising.  A number of measures in this area go to the heart of forming our attitudes to drink.  We know advertising is powerful and that is why so much money is spent on it.  Equally, if we agree that below-cost selling is a lure or bait to get people in, and it works, why are we not doing something about it?  Are there vested interests at play?  That is what I am wondering about during the debate.</p> <p>The Minister of State might address another contradiction.  We are at war with alcohol, yet we give grants to enable distilleries and craft beer companies throughout the country to be set up.  We need to have a realistic conversation.  Obviously, this problem will not be solved overnight and I welcome an open debate on the issue.</p> <p>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could address my particular concerns.  I have heard before that stopping below-cost selling is not the be all and end all, and I accept that.  However, it is clear to anyone who applies a modicum of logic and common sense that it is used and abused by the multiples to the detriment of small independent traders on the street.  We could stop it right now.  The smaller traders do not have the money for glamorous advertising etc. to help them to draw people in.  Why are we not acting?  It seems the only people who will lose out are those on the side of the multiple supermarkets.  I am concerned about that.  It is within the gift of the Minister of State and the Government to do something.  I would appreciate an answer to that question.</p></speech>

First, I will build on what Senator Mulherin has said.  We have a real opportunity to take action.  There is urgency about the matter and we have an opportunity to take action today.  I hope we do what it is in our power to do as Members, that is to say, move forward and ensure the Bill passes Committee Stage before we leave this afternoon.  We need to look to urgent action.  Let us all seize this opportunity.  I will come in again in respect of the amendments I have supported.</p></speech>

Minimum unit pricing is a measure specifically targeted at heavy drinkers and younger people.  That is the objective.</p> <p>People are concerned about what will happen with regard to Northern Ireland.  It will be a matter for the Minister to decide when he wants to bring in the measure.  There is significant concern around Brexit and how we can continue with the relationship with the Northern Executive in the context of bringing in minimum unit pricing at the same time.  That was always the intention and we sincerely hope we will continue to be able to do that.</p> <p>A question was asked about below-cost selling.  The University of Sheffield has found that a ban would have negligible impact on alcohol consumption and related harm.  However, there is an opportunity for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to consider the matter.  At the same time, we have decided this is not something that will work for us based on the evidence produced.  That is why we are going for minimum unit pricing instead.</p> <p>Another question was asked about promotions.  A number of sponsorships will be restricted at certain events.  This is covered in section 15.  It will be an offence for a person to sponsor an event at which the majority of individuals taking part are children.  A section will deal with that query.  If Senators hold on, we will deal with that in time.  We will also be regulating for price promotions.  There will be no price promotions such as those we have seen, like happy hours and messy Mondays and so on.  We are certainly dealing with that in the Bill too.</p> <p>I think I have dealt with most of the questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for the briefing she provided yesterday.  It was well attended and I found it most informative.</p> <p>Any opportunity we have to discuss overconsumption of alcohol is to be welcomed.  Unfortunately, Irish people have become famous worldwide for all the wrong reasons when it comes to our abuse and overconsumption of alcohol.  That is unfortunate.  It is fair to say that there is probably not a family in the country that has escaped the effects of overconsumption of alcohol and the dangers and addiction that comes with it.  Any Bill that strives to attempt to lower consumption must be welcomed, and I will certainly support it.</p> <p>I do not intend to go into the issues in great detail.  A number of my colleagues have referred to minimum price per unit.  That is a good idea, but it is vital we work in conjunction with our friends in Northern Ireland.  I come from a Border county.  We are going through tough economic times at the moment.  I imagine the Minister of State can appreciate that.  For anyone in business along the Border at the moment, the buzzword is survival.  We are doing all we can to hang on in light of Brexit, the devaluation of sterling and the effects these changes are having on our local economy.  It is vital from an economic perspective that anything we do in respect of minimum cost selling is done in conjunction with our friends North of the Border.</p> <p>Reference was made to the separation issue.  There seems to be considerable confusion.  I realise we will discuss it in more detail shortly.  There is considerable fear over what will be acceptable in small rural shops.  Some clarity was offered on the question yesterday and my party will make an amendment along these lines.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the question.  Any time we spend talking about overconsumption of alcohol is time well spent.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence of a former Senator, Ms van Turnhout, who was a pivotal member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that I chaired.  Senator Colm Burke was a member of that committee as well.</p> <p>That committee undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State and commend her on her initiative this afternoon.  It is important, in the context of the debate, that we consider the harmful relationship we have with alcohol.</p> <p>Let us put some facts on the table as part of the discourse in considering the Bill.  Alcohol consumption is on the increase.  Approximately 80% of the population consumes alcohol and half of those who consume alcohol are harmful high-risk drinkers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Almost 10% of those who consume alcohol are dependent on it and that feature increases as we go up the age groups.  What is important in the context of this debate is the overarching aim of the Minister of State to try to reach a solution where we can reduce the impact of alcohol on our public health system, on the number of work days lost and improve the quality of life for our citizens.  If we consider the issue in the context of the incidence of liver cirrhosis and dependency on alcohol by many in our society, there is an issue not least in terms of people's physical health but their mental health and the fact that 1,500 hospital beds are occupied per night for alcohol-related reasons.  </p><p>I do not intend to contribute much to the debate as I want to allow our spokesperson and other Members to contribute.  The pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation recognised that not one size fits all with regard to the issue of alcohol misuse.  There are some who do not share in supporting the Minister of State's responsibility and who do not want to see alcohol consumption reduced.  If we were all to be honest, and in that I include the Members opposite in particular, when we changed the Groceries Order and allowed alcohol to be sold freely, it was probably the wrong thing to do.  That should not have been allowed to happen. </p></speech>

The retail sector has a duty of care and responsibility.  It had a voluntary code and, to a limited degree, that worked or perhaps it did not work.  I always found Mr. White accessible and amenable on any issues that I brought to his attention.  He took this matter up with some of the people in question.  However, there was an ambivalence on the part of some retail outlets regarding the way they advertised and displayed alcohol.  I am referring to a particular chainstore, as Mr. White would be aware, but I must say in his defence that he acted in taking the matter up with that particular organisation.</p> <p>We must balance the need to have health advocacy with bringing in minimum unit pricing.  Representatives from the University of Sheffield showed that a skin prick test can be very positive in determining what age groups drank and how they rank.  We need to bear in mind that minimum unit pricing is but one aspect of the Bill.  </p> <p>Another issue is media advertising and how radio and television advertising can be used.  Senator Richmond spoke about sports and I am a member of an organisation and a club that has a bar, and striking a balance in that respect is important.  As many of us involved in sport know, sponsorship of sports by alcohol companies and bars is much needed.</p></speech>

I did not get a chance to speak on Second Stage and I chaired the committee that brought many of the recommendations to the former Minister and I want to give the Minister of State my support.  The key point is that we have to take a stand and start to address how we can combat the misuse of alcohol in our society.  That requires a collective response from all sides of the House and a willingness to engage and examine what we can do that is in the best interests of our fellow citizens.  That means doing what is in the common good in terms of addressing the overarching principle of health advocacy and ensuring a reduction of the misuse of alcohol.</p><p>I will conclude by quoting a letter from  the parent of a child who was killed which was published in <i>The Irish Times </i>a few months ago.  It states: &quot;I don't look on myself as a neo-prohibitionist; all I ask is that the whole subject of dirt-cheap alcohol that is causing so many problems in our country be addressed.&quot;  That is the kernel of the problem.  Access to cheap alcohol that can be purchased in many outlets is the problem.  What we need is not a prohibition or a nanny state but for this issue to be tackled through the introduction of minimum unit pricing.  If we can do that and deal collectively with alcohol misuse, we will have done the state a lot of service.</p></speech>

There are 53 amendments and we have not got to decide on the first one yet.  I ask Members to be conscious of that.  I note Senator McFadden wishes to contribute.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Acting Chairman's point that there are 52 amendments and all Members want to speak, and it is very important that they all speak.  This is a serious Bill that will go through this House and we as policy makers should speak on it.</p> <p>I accept completely the sentiments behind the Bill.  I know, as others have said, that there is growing evidence that shows the impact of alcohol misuse and the harm it can do not only to the drinker but to his or her family and to society in general, the social disorder, violence and other crimes that happen and the cost to the State in terms of hospital bed occupancy.  Everybody is aware of that.</p> <p>The Bill aims to tackle Ireland's harmful relationship with alcohol and to encourage positive public health and safety and well-being, particularly among children, and I welcome that completely.  We all see alcohol consumption every day and there is no harm in having a glass of wine every so often and nobody would argue with that, but alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product.  That is something this Bill is trying to put forward and that we as a State would see that and use the licensing system to emphasise that, especially with specific excise taxes.  The regulation of the way we display alcohol is important in terms of highlighting the harm it can do to families, particularly to children, in terms of over-exposure.  I welcome the Bill, but I have concerns about some aspects in terms of the segregation and labelling and I am sure when we will deal with those later we can address them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#V00800"><p>I wish to deal with the Minister of State's response to a point I made.  I did not find her comments on tackling below-cost selling very convincing.  I am not only referring to her but I am at a loss to know why this approach has been taken by the Department.</p> <p>Another point is that if these multiples or supermarkets buy an alcohol product that is produced in Ireland and sell it below cost in a supermarket to get people into the store to buy large quantities of alcohol, which is what they are doing, they can claim a VAT credit for it. They are claiming a VAT credit from the State and using the sale of alcohol products as a loss leader, yet we continue to stand over this.  I find that incredible in the context of what we are discussing.</p> <p>When will minimum unit pricing be introduced?  We are talking about it, we are all in agreement on it but when will it happen?  It is outside the Minister of State's control but she can do something now.  I am perplexed as to why the Department of Health is not doing something about below-cost selling right now, given that everybody knows that access to very low priced alcohol originated with the big supermarkets.  One does not need to have a PhD to know that.  One can see as one does one's shopping.  It is not the small store that has us landed with the problem of access to low-priced alcohol.  The small stores are being crippled by these supermarkets, yet we are standing over this situation and have been doing so for years.  </p> <p>My question regarding the timing of the introduction of minimum unit pricing has not been answered.  When will that happen?  We can pass this legislation today and run it all through, but when will minimum unit pricing happen?  The Minister of State cannot answer that.  It could happen in two years or three years.  We are dealing with Brexit at the moment.  Is this issue at the top of the agenda in Northern Ireland?  They have an awful lot on their plate.  Why does the Minister of State not act regarding below-cost selling?  Why should these supermarkets be able to claim tax credits for the way our system is set up?  There is much talk about tax avoidance and so on in this country when it comes to multinationals.  Here is a prime example.  It is contributing to the problem the Minister of State is trying to solve, and it is within the gift of the Government to address it.</p></speech>

A fundamental shift is needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that this is the start of something that will do away with our image internationally as well as our harmful relationship with alcohol.  The Bill contains many useful measures but it is only a start.  Suggestions such as those made by other Senators regarding, for example, sports stars and other role models who do not partake in alcohol on a regular basis are helpful.<br/><br/>We cannot lose sight of the fact that alcohol consumption has reached alarming levels.  When the 20% of adults who abstain from alcohol completely were excluded, consumption figures for 2015 were 46 bottles of vodka, 130 bottles of wine or 498 pints per person annually.  Alcohol consumption in Ireland has almost trebled since 1960.  Although it has declined by 23% from a peak of 14.3 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i>in 2001 to 11 litres in 2015, this decline has not been consistent.  Whatever the statistics, we all agree that our relationship with alcohol and our method of drinking are the crux of the problem.<br/><br/>Despite changing levels of excise duty and affordability having a direct and immediate impact on consumption patterns, we remain almost 2 litres <i>per capita</i>above the Healthy Ireland and Public Health (Alcohol) Bill target of 9.1 litres.  As all Senators who have spoken have acknowledged, this major issue needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Growing evidence documents the impact of alcohol-related harm, not just on the individual drinker and his or her family, but on wider society, for example, social disorder, vandalism, violence, other crimes - we could be here all day - reduced community amenities, absenteeism and reduced work performance.  As Senator Norris mentioned, the estimated cost of excessive alcohol consumption in terms of health, crime, public order and so on is approximately &euro;3.7 billion per annum.<br/><br/>I will not speak further on the Bill in general.  Like most others, I have already taken the opportunity.  The Bill may raise small issues for businesses but we cannot in good conscience fail to implement all of the good measures contained in the Bill.  I agree with Senator Mulherin about below-cost selling.  I am frustrated that we cannot introduce something in that regard.  We will spend an hour speaking about the segregation of alcohol in shops but that is a minor issue compared with the harm that below-cost selling causes to smaller retailers.  We need to tackle this issue head on.  I would be interested in the Minister of State's comments in this regard and I look forward to the debate on the individual sections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#W00200"><p>I will be brief.  I endorse the comments of Senators Mulherin and Noone regarding large retailers.  To be fair to all sides, I will note that we have responsible retailers and consumers, which we should recognise in this debate.  This Bill is an opportunity.  If we want to wage a war on alcohol abuse - a war of which we are all supportive - we must target the large retailers that are shifting vast volumes of alcohol in a certain way.  Rarely if ever have I seen crates of beer, spirits and so on leaving the smaller shops that people are concerned about.  If I am honest, though, I have seen it many times in respect of large retailers.  They have promotional and advertising power.  In the coming weeks, there will be direct mailings to every house in the country of coloured brochures with pages and pages of alcohol products.  Children will see them just as adults will.</p> <p>We must target the area that will reap the maximum benefit in terms of eradicating alcohol abuse.  If the Minister of State is prepared to listen to us, this is an opportunity for every Senator to shape the legislation in a way that can achieve that objective by targeting volume rather than smaller retailers, who are often known to people in the community and have a responsible approach to the sale of alcohol.  If we do this together, we can introduce ground-breaking legislation.  I acknowledge the considerable work done on the legislation by the Minister of State, the previous health committee and others but we must be careful not to cause unintentional impacts on responsible consumers, of which there are many, and responsible retailers.  A balance is to be struck but I support the targeting of large retailers who, without whim or favour, target families with significant advertising.  They are the bodies which shift the volumes of beer and spirits that are causing problems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1427" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#W00900"><p>I wish to point out something stark.  I wrote about the matter in 2013.  There are 1,200 cases of cancer every year owing to alcohol.  No one wants to talk about this.  I only heard it mentioned on "Morning Ireland" recently.  Alcohol causes cancer of the liver, mouth, throat, oesophagus, breast and large bowel.  We do not hear about any of this.  It is a drug with toxic and intoxicating effects.  In 2012, we topped the poll for heavy binge drinking.  Drinking three to six standard drinks per day increases the risk of breast cancer by 41%.  Women, especially young girls, would like to hear this.  One person dies every seven hours in Ireland from an alcohol-related illness.  One does not need to say much more.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the large retailers who have appeared at the tops and bottoms of our towns and closed down small retailers and are doing what they like, particularly as regards alcohol.  They can advertise and price it at will.  One can get some alcohol for nothing if one buys enough.  I would not like to see them closing down the small retailer who is trying hard to be responsible.  They are the ones running amok.  The largest Tesco in Ireland is in Naas.  It is bigger than the town.  What kind of planning went into that?</p> <p>My argument contains a contradiction.  People must be told that alcohol can cause cancer.  The only way to achieve the latter is through education.  I was reared in a town where there were 18 pubs.  I know all about alcohol and what it can do to people and families.  That is no one's preserve.  Some of us in the Chamber were reared around and beaten in such situations.</p> <p>The contradiction relates to the separation and the large retailers against the small Spar or Centra shops that are doing their best to stay open all hours of the day and night.  I am talking about convenience stores against the large stores.  My colleagues are correct.  We will have brochures through our doors that are larger than gifts in any Christmas hamper telling us when and how cheaply we can get booze.  It will not necessarily be the best booze either because sometimes we do not know where the vodka is coming from.</p> <p>I will speak to certain amendments further, but the issue of cancer must be discussed.  We talk about cancer in every other way but we are afraid to discuss it in terms of alcohol because the latter has a huge lobby behind it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#W01000"><p>I have not spoken on this Bill before because it was the remit of my ministerial colleague while I was Minister for Health.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has said much of what I was going to say.  My figures vary slightly - they come from the Irish Cancer Society - and show that there are 900 new alcohol-related cancer cases every year.  The WHO classifies alcohol as a class 1 carcinogen, meaning that it causes cancers of the mouth, the pharynx, the larynx, the oesophagus, the liver, the pancreas, the bowel and the breast in humans.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> What of the 1,500 beds occupied every night out of the approximately 11,000 in our system that are related to alcohol use?  What of the tens of thousands of families whose lives have been destroyed because of alcohol in terms of the hurt it has caused, the damage to relationships, the unwanted pregnancies and the violence, not to mention obesity, of which alcohol is a huge part?  Not alone is it highly calorific, it also reduces one's resolve when one is trying to be a bit more restrained.  It causes lowering of blood sugar, which will make one more hungry, and causes a low-grade gastroenteritis, which makes one seek out foods to relieve that.  This is a serious problem.  Alcohol also suppresses the mitochondrion, which is the engine of the cell.  That is why we feel so bad the next day and have so little volition and energy.</p><p>We have an ambivalent relationship with alcohol, and I am no different from anyone else in this regard, but we have an opportunity today to support the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, in what I believe is a hugely important public health initiative.  I refer to those who asked for other measures to be included in the Bill.  First, why let perfection get in the way of the perfectly good?  Second, we all know full well that if an amendment on low-cost selling is tabled today, it will delay the passage of this Bill considerably.  It is an issue that has to be addressed and I hope the Government does address it.</p><p>With regard to the smaller operator, there is no doubt that visibility is of key importance.  If there is any doubt about that all we have to do is look at the plain packaging of cigarettes and the way the industry fought against that because it was the last billboard on which to advertise its product.  A lovely array of shelves of different types of alcohol including alcopops, wine or whatever part of the industry one wants to focus on, and the multicolours that will attract a young person's eye, is advertising.  We know that to be the case with cigarettes, so why do we not acknowledge it when it comes to alcohol?  We have to protect our children from starting to drink too young.  The gastroenterologists in Beaumont Hospital will tell us that we are seeing cirrhosis in men in their mid-20s, something never seen previously.  That is astonishing, and is as a result of the availability of cheap alcohol.  As for not including the small corner shop, I remind Members they did not sell alcohol 20 years ago.  The argument being made now is that it is the only way the smaller operators can survive, which I do not buy-----</p></speech>

I refer to the pub, the club and places where there is supervision and an opportunity to mix.  As I stated, alcohol is not like other products.  It causes cancer.  We have to educate our children about it.  We have to have an approach like the one we took to tobacco, and it should be multifaceted.  There are many good measures in the Bill.  There is more we can do, but can we not start with what we have before us, move it quickly through the House, and not allow a situation to arise where people will look on afterwards and say there was filibustering on this Bill to delay it?</p> <p>There are parents watching this debate who are worried about their children.  Early Childhood Ireland, the ISPCC, Barnardos, many medical organisations and others are concerned about children and young people.  Youth organisations that have 40,000 volunteers are concerned about this issue, so I ask the Members to think about all of those as well as what I believe the Minister of State has achieved, namely, a proportionate response to a serious public health risk.</p></speech>

What came across strongly is the support Members from across parties and from none have for this Bill.  The focus on our children came across strongly from Members who contributed so far.  There are other considerations, but we must never forget the reason this is called the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  This is the Department of Health producing a document which will help address the difficult problem in our country with regard to the consumption of alcohol.  The figures are available.  Alcohol abuse is costing us billions of euro every year.  Can we imagine what we could do if we had that kind of money to put into our services?</p> <p>People raised the question as to whether minimum unit pricing should be left to one side as against looking at restoring the groceries order.  The groceries order is not the responsibility of the Department of Health.  This is the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The responsibility of this Department is the health of the people in the country.  An examination has been done and all of what we are doing is evidence-based.  A study by the University of Sheffield found that below-cost selling would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.  That is a fact.  That is the evidence on which we are basing it.  If people are anxious to have the groceries order restored, they should speak to the relevant Minister in that regard.  If they are anxious that large multiples can claim back whatever they are able to claim back, they should speak to the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners about it.  It is not the responsibility of the Department of Health to deal with that.  What we are trying to do is target harmful drinking with minimum unit pricing.  We are trying to target young people with minimum unit pricing.  It is working in other parts of the world.  I firmly believe we will be able to do it.</p> <p>I made the point earlier that we must take into account the challenges Brexit is bringing with regard to Northern Ireland but that should not stop us proceeding with what we want to do.  I hope the Minister will have the opportunity to bring it in, along with our counterparts in the North of Ireland, but in terms of our Bill we must not allow ourselves to become paralysed by events in the North of Ireland.  We have to proceed with our own legislation.  This is our country.  It is our society, and our children, that we are dealing with.  Women are presenting, and Members can speak to Professor Frank Murray about this, with cirrhosis of the liver in their 30s that was only seen in men in their 60s and 70s.  There is something seriously wrong here.  If we do not realise that we have a serious problem with alcohol, what are we here for as public representatives?</p> <p>This is the long-awaited Bill we have been looking forward to that will address the difficulties we are having in our society as a result of the harmful consumption of alcohol.  I enjoy a drink the same as almost every Member here.  I would like to think I do not abuse alcohol but I am very concerned about the way alcohol is being abused in our society.  We can see it.  We see the manipulation going on by certain people who do not want this Bill.  They want us to talk all day about nothing and not deliver on our Bill.  This is a very important Bill for our society, our children, our health services and so on.  We must recognise that and accept the evidence.  I have in my hand the report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  The Chairman at the time was the then Deputy Jerry Buttimer.  People who are still Members of the Oireachtas sat on this committee.  Deputies Catherine Byrne and Regina Doherty, now Ministers of State, Clare Daly, Billy Kelleher, Seamus Healy, Peter Fitzpatrick, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, now Minister, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Robert Troy, the then Senator Thomas Byrne, Senator Colm Burke and others spent six weeks working on the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  They heard evidence from everybody.  I urge anybody who has any questions as to the reason the Department is producing this Bill to read this document because 11 of the 17 colleagues on that committee are still Members of the Oireachtas.  We should talk to them.  We should ask Deputy Billy Kelleher or Senator Jerry Buttimer why they thought this was a good thing to sign up to.  It is crucial that we recognise the work our colleagues have put into this Bill in terms of compiling the evidence and listening to everybody across industry, people who were campaigning on the issue of alcohol consumption and the Children's Rights Alliance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Everybody was listened to.  Let us respect the work they put into this and read the comments made by Professor John Crown, a leading cancer specialist in this country.  These are the people to whom the hardworking committee listened.  It produced this document, much of which is in the Bill.  Let us not be distracted and let us focus on what we want to do.  It is now 2.20 p.m.  We are due to finish at 3.30 p.m.  I do not think we are going to achieve what we really want to achieve here, which is to get through the amendments we have; we certainly will not get there today at the pace at which we are proceeding.  I urge Members to stick to the amendments that have been proposed and deal with them one by one.  I will be very happy to answer questions as they come up because it is so important for us to get this right.  </p></speech>

We could all have made Second Stage speeches but there is a vast range of amendments we need to get through today.  I agree with the Minister of State on that front.  In my earlier remarks, I asked the Minister of State to comment on the discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive about the choreography of the implementation of minimum unit pricing because that choreography is, as she accepts and understands, extremely important if we are to achieve the ambitions of this legislation which is, as she notes, long awaited.  I would appreciate some clarity on that in so far as the Minister of State can provide it.  Obviously, she reserves the right as Minister of State to commence the legislation and that is what this amendment allows her to do but it would be useful for us if she put on the public record the status of her discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive and when she expects minimum unit pricing to be introduced in Northern Ireland so we can proceed with this legislation and realise its ambition.  In respect of section 17, the Minister of State mentioned some exemption pertaining to print media.  Could she elaborate on that?</p></speech>

That is all well and good but Brexit will have and is having a huge effect on the part of the country I come from, which is south Ulster and the other Border counties.  The SuperValus and Centras of this country might not be regarded as small operators but they operate as franchises.  They own the franchise and if that franchise goes down, SuperValu and Centra remain but the franchisees and their families as well as their employees and their families are gone so it is important that we take our time here and listen to what Members of this House have to say.  As a result of the drop in the value of sterling, Brexit is crucifying small operators in the Border and midlands area.  In principle, I agree with almost the entire Bill but there are difficulties with it and it is up to us to point them out to the Minister of State and the House.</p> <p>In respect of advertising, I would like to hear what proposals are in this legislation to restrict advertising on YouTube, Facebook and other social media outlets because I do not see any.  It is alright to prevent the national broadcaster and other broadcasters from having alcohol advertisements but what about young people because they are the ones we need to get at before they start on alcohol?  We did this in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in respect of tobacco and it worked.  I smoked when I was 15 years of age.  My daughter would think it was crazy to smoke because of legislation and education and this is vitally important.  Let us take our time on this and get it right.  While some people might think it is only the Seanad, during my 14 and a half years in this Oireachtas, the best pieces of legislation have come from this House.  Very few mistakes have been made in this House so, with respect, the Minister of State should respect this House.  We will take whatever time it takes but let us get it right and let everybody's opinion be listened to.  </p> <p>Amendment agreed to.  </p></speech>

One of the fundamental issues we will be discussing later on concerns structural separation.  In the interests of clarity and possible reassurance to allay some fears that might be out there, there should be a clear definition of structural separation.  It is worded in the Bill and a full section is afforded to it but it is not mentioned in the interpretation.  We could introduce an interpretation of the terms "structural separation" on Report Stage or deal with it later in a different type of wording.  It is fundamental to some of the concerns, which may only be perceived. Let us debate this later on, but it is something we need to address.</p></speech>

The two words are "structural separation".  There is no definition or understanding of what that term means so it is something we need to address.  I would like some response.</p></speech>

It is the term used in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 where structural separation was proposed by the then Government.  This would involve an actual wall being built along with a till and a separate door and alcohol being located within that unit which would be structurally separate from the rest of the shop or supermarket.  This is a hangover from that piece of legislation.  I believe this term does not adequately reflect what we want, which is restricting visibility so that children and young people will not be attracted to alcohol.  We can certainly look at this on Report Stage and consider something that would be more appropriate.  Members can see from the illustrations we produced that we are not asking anybody to structurally separate the premises.  We are asking them to visually separate alcohol from the view of children and young people.  That is all that is being required here.  I hope this clears the matter up for the Senator.</p></speech>

It will be helpful as we proceed through the Bill.  On Report Stage, we will have an opportunity to include a clear definition so there is a proper understanding and no doubt as to the Minister's aspirations or objectives.

The Minister of State is doing a great job and I appreciate the great work she is doing on the Bill.  She can be assured of my support for all her amendments.  However, I will speak on amendments Nos. 4, 7 to 9, inclusive, 12 and 38 to 40, inclusive.</p><p>I thank Senators Rose Conway-Walsh, M&aacute;ire Devine, Paul Gavan, P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, Fintan Warfield, Alice-Mary Higgins, Colette Kelleher, David Norris and Grace O'Sullivan for joining with me to table these and subsequent amendments.  Many of us have been working as part of our cross-party group on alcohol harm.  This is a time when politics is good, and we work together for the public good and the good of our country.  I thank the Minister of State and, especially, her officials, particularly for the briefing they organised yesterday.  I welcome to the Gallery Siobh&aacute;n Creaton from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Catherine Keane and Suzanne Costello from Alcohol Action Ireland, and Brian Allen from the RISE Foundation.  I thank Alcohol Action Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland for their tireless work over the years to guide us to this point and, in particular, their support for my work in this area.  I also thank Professors Frank Murray and Joe Barry.  I also warmly thank the wide range of public health campaigners who have come together as the Alcohol Health Alliance with a mission to reduce the harm caused by alcohol.  I especially thank former Senator Jillian van Turnhout for her assistance personally to me.</p><p>In my manifesto, I committed to being a voice for the vulnerable, and this Bill is one of my priority areas.  I will be sharing a glimpse of the work of the RISE Foundation which is focused on family members who have a loved one with an alcohol problem.  Children living with parents who drink in a harmful manner are among the most vulnerable in society.  I am extremely passionate about this, as the Minister of State knows.  The wide range of harms that are caused to children as a result of harmful drinking in the home is known as &quot;hidden harm&quot;.  The harm is not often visible in public and largely kept behind closed doors.  I have examined the evidence and I hold the life stories of the most vulnerable, and so it is with confidence that I say both my head and heart fully support the Bill and the package of measures it contains.  The amendments I put forward are to strengthen the Bill, and I hope I am successful.  At the very least, let us not water down the Bill.</p><p>In this morning's <i>Irish Examiner</i>there was a powerful letter by a father, John Higgins, to his 19-year-old son, David, who died by suicide in March 2011.  In the letter he said:</p><blockquote>Dear Sir,<br /><br />In the coming week the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will go to Committee Stage in the Seanad.  After the decision by the Court of Session in Scotland to clear the way for minimum unit pricing to be introduced in Scotland there is now a very distinct possibility that minimum unit pricing may well become a reality in Ireland.<br /><br />There is still a chance that the alcohol industry will challenge this ruling in the UK Supreme Court.<br /><br />No doubt the lobbying to minimise the effect that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill would have on the price, availability and promotion of alcohol in Ireland has gone to another level, if that is possible, seen as it has been unrelenting since the early days of the birth of this Bill.<br /><br />We read of IBEC and the alcohol industry submitting amendments to the Bill.<br /><br />They say structural separation of alcohol in retail outlets would be costly and unmanageable and that as a result jobs could be lost, they also say that minimum unit pricing won&rsquo;t work, they also believe advertising restrictions are too strict.<br /><br />The purpose of this Bill, in its entirety, should not be lost to the pressure of lobbying and perhaps threats of job losses and closures.  This Bill will save lives, it will reduce consumption, it will help to minimise the continuous bombardment of our children and grandchildren by alcohol companies advertising their product.  We can attribute three deaths per day to alcohol abuse, 547,500 hospital bed nights every year are occupied by people suffering from alcohol related illnesses, and alcohol is a contributing factor in at least 50% of suicides.<br /><br />Our 19-year-old son David died by suicide in March 2011.<br /><br />It states on his death certificate that alcohol was a contributing factor in his death, that information is there for a reason.  I write this letter for that reason.</blockquote> <p>We should remember David and John Higgins and all the other families who are impacted by alcohol related harm.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 4, 7 to 9, inclusive, and 38 are interrelated.  The amendments deal with the availability of free alcohol when another service is paid for, such as free wine when getting one's nails or hair done, free beer in the barber, or free alcoholic drinks when buying special cinema tickets.  Many of the businesses which are offering free alcohol with a service are not licensed premises and, therefore, should not be supplying alcohol in this manner.  The provision of free alcohol in barbers or hair salons highlights the increased role alcohol plays in our daily lives.  Alcohol is heavily promoted, widely available and, very often, given away for free as if it were just another ordinary, risk-free product, while the level of public awareness and understanding of many of the serious health problems associated with alcohol is low.  The Healthy Ireland survey recently published found that just 16% of women were aware of the links between breast cancer and alcohol consumption.  The national cancer control programme, NCCP, found that 12% of all breast cancers over the course of a decade in Ireland were associated with alcohol consumption.</p><p>When I worked as a therapist in the Rutland Centre, I met a young woman who was struggling with alcohol.  She used to drink wine.  We picture an alcoholic as somebody roaming the streets.  This was a functioning woman who had small children.  The biggest problem for her was walking past her local shop, going to her hairdresser or going to the cinema.  Although she wanted to do things where there was no alcohol, it was impossible.  The energy she had to put into it was soul destroying.  She would walk into the hairdresser with her child and a glass of wine was given to her.  It is the same in the cinema.  Everywhere we go, there is alcohol.  Even at first holy communions there is a marquee out the back and there is alcohol all over the place.  It is vital we consider the amendments.  For these reasons, alcohol given away for free with a service should be prohibited under the Bill.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 relate to advertising on television and radio.  I welcome Government amendments Nos. 36 and 37 and support them, given that they have a similar purpose.  It has been established beyond all reasonable doubt that alcohol marketing influences drinking behaviour, particularly among children.  The World Health Organization, WHO, states that &quot;exposure to alcohol marketing increases the likelihood that young people start to drink alcohol, and that among young people who have started to use alcohol, such exposure increases the frequency of drinking and the amount of alcohol consumed&quot;.  An NUI Galway study, commissioned by Alcohol Action Ireland, provides a recent and important insight into the experience of a large sample of Irish children aged 13 to 17 with alcohol marketing.  The results showed 91% of the children surveyed reported they were exposed to traditional - offline - alcohol advertisements, including television, during the week prior to the study, and more than half reported they were exposed to four or more advertisements per day.  Yesterday, in the AV room somebody talked about asking a young child about cigarette brands.  While the child did not have a clue about cigarette brands, when asked about alcohol brands, the child could ream them all off.</p><p>There are no statutory protections in place to protect children from alcohol advertising on television and radio, and the self-regulatory system is not working.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As part of our efforts to break the close links between alcohol and sport, we must prevent alcohol advertising from being shown during televised sports events and bring an end to alcohol sponsorship of sports.

I welcome the Minister and commend this important and vital Bill.  I hope we make significant progress on this legislation so that it comes through in its full form without dilution.  In fact, it needs to be strengthened.  To that end, I have seconded some of the amendments tabled by my colleague, Senator Black, including amendment No. 9, which proposes to strengthen the Bill by ensuring the definition of "sell" in section 2 includes "supply for the purpose of promoting the use of another service" and "supply in the purchase of another good or service".</p> <p>When I lived in Vietnam in the 1990s, at a time when strict regulation of the tobacco industry was being introduced in Europe, I saw for myself the manner in which young Asian women were consistently targeted as a market which traditionally did not smoke.  I attended concerts at which people were given sports bags filled with cigarettes along with their tickets without request.  If we do not make these amendments, there is a real danger that we will see alcohol bundled with other products in a way that could lead to the promotion of a relationship with alcohol for people who, in many cases, have neither requested nor sought such a relationship.</p> <p>It is vital that the consumption of alcohol should always be a choice.  It should not be given away.  It should not be a persistent or, for some, relentless suggestion within society.  Pressure to consume alcohol should not be attached to participation in any area of life or public life, or to the consumption of any of the other goods we have in society.  It must not be seen as an automatic accompaniment to daily life or to social occasions.  I believe that is the intent and spirit of this Bill.  I encourage the Minister and others to support these amendments to ensure that is strengthened.</p> <p>We are very aware that alcohol is accompanied by serious health harm.  This is known to be the actual accompaniment to alcohol.  This is the packaging that comes through.  I refer to the proven risk of cancer, the three deaths per day and the cost of &euro;1.5 billion to our health service in 2012.  If we can leave aside the social and human costs of alcohol abuse, which are the crucial drivers of this Bill, we can also point out that the economic cost associated with it is immense.</p> <p>I support amendment No. 42, which proposes the establishment of a review board.  I think it is vital that the Minister would have a review board that would include public health experts but not representatives of the alcohol industry.  This legislation is not an exercise in self-regulation; it is the fulfilment of our duty as regulators and as legislators to provide for meaningful State regulation.  I will refrain from speaking on amendment No. 42 until it is before the House.  I urge support for all the amendments proposed by my colleague, Senator Black, particularly amendment No. 9.</p></speech>

Although I have never heard of the practice that has been highlighted, I would be very glad if it were stamped out.  I think it is a noxious idea.  I was really disturbed when I saw in the interpretation section that "alcohol related merchandise" includes "clothing and footwear (other than children&rsquo;s clothing and footwear)".  I did not understand why children's clothing was excluded.  I am glad that is to be rectified by a Government amendment which provides that "clothing" includes footwear.  This is just as well.  I do not know whether there is any alcohol advertising programme targeting children's shoes, but it would be monstrous if there was and of course it should be outlawed.  I am glad this has happened.</p></speech>

They are being taken together to allow us to discuss children's clothing, advertising on the Internet and broadcast advertising.  Amendments Nos. 3, 6 and 29 are technical ministerial amendments that relate to the proposed provisions regarding children's clothing, which is dealt with in section 16 of the Bill.  It is proposed to delete the definition of "children's clothing" in section 16(4) of the Bill and instead provide for a definition in section 2 of the Bill, as Senator Norris has alluded to.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 2, 5, 11, 13, 36 and 37 are ministerial amendments which provide for a new section and related definitions and offences.  Protecting children from exposure to alcohol marketing is an important public health goal.  The Bill contains a range of measures to regulate advertising.  Amendment No. 36 provides for a watershed for the broadcast of alcohol advertisements on television and radio.  It states that advertisements for alcohol products cannot be broadcast on television before 9 p.m. and that such advertisements cannot be broadcast on the radio other than between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays.  The watershed times have been agreed in consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which have the intelligence in this area.  The intention is to capture the peak viewing and listening times for children, which are early evening in the case of television and breakfast time and 7 p.m. in the case of radio.  A person guilty of an offence under the new section will be liable "on summary conviction, to a class A fine, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both" or "on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both".  The amendment also proposes that a penalty of up to &euro;2,000 per day will apply to continued breaches of the broadcast watershed section following conviction.  Officials in the Department of Health and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are examining this section further and an amendment may be required on Report Stage.</p> <p>I thank Opposition Senators for submitting amendments Nos. 4, 7 to 9, inclusive, 12 and 38, which provide for restrictions on advertising on the Internet and for related definitions and offences.  I recognise there is a gap in the Bill with regard to Internet advertising, particularly given the appeal of social media for young people.  While this issue was considered during the drafting of the Bill, I believe it must be tackled at EU level because of the cross-Border nature of this form of advertising.  We are working with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in this regard.  All advertisements on the Internet must comply with the content provisions of section 12 of the Bill and will have health warnings.  I regret that I cannot accept these amendments at this stage.  However, I will request that the officials in the Department of Health and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel examine the proposal and I will revert to the House in this regard on Report Stage.</p> <p>Opposition amendments Nos. 39 and 40 also provide for restrictions on advertising on television and radio.  In these amendments, the Senators further propose to restrict advertising around sport on television and radio.  The Bill provides for restrictions on advertising at sporting events and regulates the content of alcohol advertisements.  A watershed will also be provided for in the new section.  The Bill provides for a review of all the advertising provisions after three years.  The issue of advertising in sport may be revisited pending the outcome of this review.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept these amendments, regretfully.</p> <p>I would like to respond to the point that was made about the use of glasses of alcohol to attract people to avail of certain services.  This issue is dealt with in section 21 of the Bill, on the subject of "Regulations relating to sale and supply of alcohol products".  Under this section, people will be prohibited or restricted "from selling or supplying, or causing to be sold or supplied, an alcohol product at a reduced price or free of charge to any person on the purchase by that person, or by any other person, of ... one or more other alcohol products" or "any other product or service".  That deals with the matter.  The Minister will make the regulations for dealing with that.  I hope I have addressed the concerns that were raised.</p></speech>

Some of those products are advertised by the likes of Guinness which is a famous brand all over the world.  Let us suppose somebody is found wearing the Guinness sign.  Who is prosecuted?  Is the child prosecuted?  Is it the manufacturer that produced the outfit that is prosecuted?  Is it the person who sells the garment who is prosecuted?  Where does responsibility lie?  Does responsibility lie with the retailer?  Would it not be better to introduce sizes?</p></speech>

That is very positive and shows the impact of this discussion on the legislation.</p> <p>I regret that she has been unable to accept amendment No. 19, particularly the second part that referred to the advertising of an alcohol product around sporting occasions.  We see an enormous amount of this behaviour.  I accept that this Bill is a step in the right direction but we must move in the direction of the amendment.</p> <p>With respect to some of her earlier remarks that different aspects of this Bill should be taken up with the Minister for Finance or the Minister for something else, I am sure her remarks are true.  I anticipate that my colleagues who tabled the amendments have listened to her and will immediately contact the relevant Ministers to push on this area.  I would like also to think that the Minister of State would regard this behaviour not as obstructive but as adding to her cause.  I hope she will talk to her Cabinet colleagues as well and say, "These matters have been raised in the Seanad.  We regard them as not absolutely within our province but we understand and value the contribution.  What are you doing about it?"  It would be useful to have a two-pronged approach where Senators hit from here and the Minister of State supports the amendments.  Then I think we might start to move in a certain direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#BB00500"><p>We have had a good and positive debate on these amendments.  We are trying to change an entire culture with this legislation as it covers children, adults, commercial activities and more.  I agree with the comments made by Senator Wilson that it is important that we have adequate time to debate the intricacies of the Bill.  It is only then we will find weaknesses and ways to improve it.</p> <p>I wish to discuss advertisements and brands.  My colleague, Senator Richmond, mentioned that there is an international aspect because there is clothing and branded goods that display alcohol related products.  Clarity is needed on how to regulate this sphere.  Can we stop such products being displayed?  Will enactment of this Bill prevent retailers from selling such products in the first instance?</p> <p>Sporting organisations or otherwise might have alcohol related promotions on their products internationally.  We should have a way of dealing with that aspect, especially in terms of the exposure of such items to children.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge that the previous health committee has considered this matter and a lot of groundwork has been done.  I also acknowledge the sporting organisations that have agreed to phase out seeking sponsorship from alcohol related companies.  As colleagues have mentioned, historically many sporting organisations and clubs depended on funding from such sources and it was important that alternative funding was found.  The development should be acknowledged in our general debate on this Bill.  It is quite right to say that the Bill is about public health.  We must acknowledge all of those people and organisations who have contributed, in a third party way, to the effectiveness of the legislation.  It is only by working together and bringing elements of society with us that we will have effective legislation.  I have followed up on Senator Richmond's query about regulating international products and brands.  I have also acknowledged the sporting organisations that have moved away from alcohol sponsorship and sought alternative funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#BB00600"><p>We have had a positive debate.  The Seanad should have its say when it comes to this legislation.  As a new Senator, this is one of the cornerstone debates that we have had since we were elected.  I will not say that I am enjoying this proactive debate but it is definitely good to see the Seanad tease out key issues.  The Seanad is the right place and forum to debate these issues.</p> <p>Earlier I mentioned the removal of sponsorship.  There is direct sponsorship.  I asked a question on indirect sponsorship and I will finalise my question.  What has been done about pubs or nightclubs backing or supporting teams or events through awards?  We have all seen awards promoted on publications and Facebook pages.  These sporting clubs or organisations are promoting alcohol through the back door.  Does this Bill tighten the noose around the necks of those sporting organisations?  It is important that we debate the matter.</p> <p>I live close to Tabor Lodge, which is a residential addiction treatment centre in the south.  The centre does fantastic work and has received funding on numerous occasions.  Today, I spoke to its director about how the centre progressed its services.  It is a voluntary organisation that has become one of the key drivers in tackling alcoholism in communities in the south.  When one listens to people from the organisation, one will discover that we must tackle the underlying issue of the culture of drinking.  How can we change that culture and the fabric society?  There are direct issues such as alcohol advertisements and promotions and indirect issues that we must tackle to change the culture.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke made an interesting point about name recognition in certain clothes outlets.  Some brands of alcohol are nearly considered Irish brands.  When tourists go into pubs, some of them order a certain brand of stout thinking it is the only stout in town because the brand is associated with this country.  Brand recognition is an issue that we must tease out sensitively in terms of how we sell Ireland to tourists.  Irish people have the image of being great craic but that is not a view we should sell.  We need to look at the underlying causes of alcohol abuse and promote Ireland as having a responsible attitude to alcohol.</p></speech>

As Senator Coffey has said, the main sporting organisations have moved away from sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The GAA has totally moved away from sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The soccer and rugby organisations have not been so successful.  They have said, at committee meetings, that they were not in a position to do so.  As the economy improves, alternative funding should be identified, thus allowing them to move away from such sponsorship.</p> <p>There is another aspect of promotion that should be addressed here.  If one attends rugby internationals at the major stadia of Croke Park and Aviva, trays of drink will be brought onto the terraces as the match progresses, which looks terrible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John O'Mahony:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been a spectator at a number of matches at which people are passing in and out to bring drink in and out.  Then they move in and out to go to the toilet and other spectators cannot see the game.</p><p>I am not a spokesman for the GAA but I know how it operates.  One alternative is a rule to the effect that spectators cannot bring drink onto the terraces, even from corporate boxes.  People are precluded from bringing out drink in GAA matches.  Such a rule should be put in somewhere, perhaps as a voluntary code.  The image of people drinking alcohol as the game progresses is awful, especially for television spectators.  It is totally at odds with the sense of health that the sport is producing on the field.</p></speech>

This is especially relevant for advertising and broadcasting of a main sporting event.  If such an amendment was to be brought forward, there is nothing to say it has to be put in place immediately.  It could come in by way of regulation at some stage in future.  I am somewhat concerned, because if we do not include it now, we might have to wait a further ten years to bring in corresponding legislation.  Can that be examined?</p> <p>RTE is the national broadcaster.  There is a need for RTE to move away from advertising drink, in particular, around sporting events.  RTE is funded by the taxpayer in one way or another.  We all pay TV licences, but we do not pay TV licences for people to promote a product that may be harmful to people's health.  This is something we should consider.  The amendments proposed in this area should be looked at carefully.  I am not suggesting they have to be implemented immediately, but the measures could be brought in by way of regulation at some stage in future.  If we have to come back with legislation to deal with this issue at a later date, it will be more difficult to get through because of media groups.</p> <p>We have dealt with the issue of lobbying already.  I assure the House that when media groups get involved in lobbying, they are well able for it.  We would have to go through another round of lobbying.  Why not do the whole lot together?  I call on the Minister of State to consider the matter and bring forward the measures by way of regulation.</p></speech>

Alcohol is a scourge on our society.  Many of us have relations or friends who suffer from addiction problems.  Alcohol is a real demon in our society.</p> <p>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the question of monitoring advertising on the Internet.  In 2014, we saw the phenomenon of Neknomination on Facebook.  It inspired children to down a pint of lager, nominate friends to do the same and then post the footage on the Internet.  It was an unbelievable phase and certainly some deaths stemmed from it.  The Government should come together with the governments of other member states to ensure monitoring of alcohol advertisements on the Internet, whether this involves monitoring viral videos on YouTube or Facebook.  Something needs to be done to tackle how alcohol is advertised to our young people.  We are all doomed, but we really need to look after future generations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#CC00400"><p>We have discussed alcohol advertising a great deal.  I welcome the amendment made to the broadcast watershed to the effect that a person shall not broadcast or cause to be broadcast an advertisement for an alcohol product on a television programme service between 3 a.m. and 9 p.m.</p> <p>The digital marketing of alcohol products to children is an area where regulation needs to be strong.  I have spoken on this issue in the House previously.  At a personal level, I see the merit of the proposed amendment to section 19 relating to advertising on the Internet.  One of the main aims of the Bill is to prevent children from being exposed to advertising.  The Bill already restricts advertising near schools and in places such as bus shelters and cinemas.  However, as introduced, the Bill does nothing to address the growing problem of children's exposure to alcohol advertising online, especially through social media.  This amendment would fill the gap by requiring advertisers to take reasonable steps to prevent children from viewing alcohol advertising online as well as offline.  I believe this amendment is enforceable.  Social media firms already apply age controls in respect of alcohol content.  For example, Facebook requires advertisements for alcohol to be targeted only at users of a certain age or above.  There are different ages for different companies.  Twitter has an age screening feature which requires users to enter their date of birth to follow an alcohol company account.  Where these features exist, this amendment would require alcohol firms to use them.  Most have already agreed to do so as part of industry self-regulation or as a condition of advertising on these platforms.</p> <p>On a personal level, I believe the duty is to take all reasonable steps having regard to factors such as the cost of the measures and the state of the technology.  This means that an alcohol company would not be expected to take unreasonable or disproportionately costly steps.  This amendment essentially codifies existing practices in respect of age, websites, advertising controls and social network policies and creates a legal obligation to use technologies and controls that are already available.  As I stated at the beginning, while I welcome the Bill, I believe a far more fundamental shift needs to occur to tackle the alarming rate of alcohol consumption in Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what the Minister of State has said with regard to securing European agreement.  However, the whole process needs to be accelerated, especially with regard to online advertising.  Much of the time children do not watch television; they are on their iPads all the time.  We are going to be behind the ball if we leave it to some European directive.  We need to accelerate this process, especially in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>I wish to comment on section 17.  We have no amendments to the section but we question how it will be enforced, especially with regard to the importation of magazines with alcohol advertising.  What is the situation in respect of magazines printed outside the country?  How does the Minister propose to deal with that?</p></speech>

Section 16 prohibits alcohol-branded children's clothing.  It would make it an offence for a person to manufacture, import for sale or sell in the State children's clothing which promotes alcohol consumption or is branded with an alcohol product, either by name, image, trademark or logo.  There will be a transitional period of one year for retailers and manufacturers to comply with the measure.  The legislation will provide that in the case of a prosecution the onus would be on the defendant to prove that the children's clothing in question was exempt, as in that it was available for sale within the permitted transition period.  The section specifies that clothing includes footwear as well.</p> <p>Senator Norris asked me to convey the points he made to the Minister and I am more than happy to do so.  It is important that we have good communications.  All the valid points made in the House that are relevant although not the responsibility of the Bill will most certainly be referred.

This is covered in the amendment tabled by Senator Black and others.  While we may not be able to control or implement it now, my argument is that the amendment is valid.  I am not asking that it would come into place immediately as it would take some time but that it would be looked at carefully with a view to having it in the legislation and that it could be brought forward by way of regulation at a later stage.</p></speech>

If one were to go into an airport tomorrow morning and buy a keyring with Guinness on it, which are for sale at every airport, will it be the case that if a 17 year old has a keyring with Guinness on it, it is a breach of this legislation?  Let us take the example of hats or other garments.  I was trying to make the point earlier that Guinness is more a symbol of Ireland in many ways.  I have no issue with Guinness as I would not touch it.  The Guinness brand became more of a symbol, when people came to Ireland they were not buying stout, Guinness was the only thing they would buy and that is what they looked for.  Regarding the advertising of that on items for those under 18 years old, will it come back on the person who imports or manufacturers the goods with this branding or will the retailer who sells it be liable?  What would the fines be?</p></speech>

I wish to add to the points made by the previous two speakers.  Will we be honest with ourselves?  Can we police it?  The Minister of State mentioned the environmental officer policing a young man going in to buy a hat with Guinness written on it.  We need to get real in regard to what we can and cannot do in legislation.  This is not workable in my opinion.  I do not think it is practical.  I do not think putting the onus on somebody who stocks this merchandise, be it at an airport or in a shop in Carrick-on-Suir or Cork, to police it.  There are young lads of 16 years who look 20 years.  There are adults of 20 years who look 15 years.  Every time somebody comes in to buy something, ID is required to buy a Guinness hat.  I think we need to get real.</p></speech>

If one was to dedicate this Bill to anyone it would be to the 1,600 people who contracted hepatitis C as a result of the actions and inaction of the blood transfusion service.  </p> <p>In 2005 the Law Reform Commission identified a serious gap in Irish legislation in terms of holding entities, both incorporated and otherwise, to account in situations where management failed.  In some cases, it would be impossible to secure a conviction because of the legislative gap.  While it is theoretically possible for a corporate entity to be prosecuted, the Law Reform Commission identified two serious deficiencies in securing a conviction.  First, in order to initiate a prosecution, it was necessary to establish that a senior manager within the entity had the necessary criminal responsibility or guilty mind required under current legislation.  Second, the commission also observed that the law was ambiguous and would fall foul of legal principle.</p> <p>Section 2 of this Bill means that a corporation could be convicted of corporate manslaughter if found guilty of gross negligence, where no one individual within the organisation was said to have responsibility.  There are a number of cases where that happened in Ireland although the most famous such case is that of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster between England and Holland.  This Bill will provide the necessary mechanism to ensure that corporate entities are held to account.  It will provide an avenue to justice for the families of the victims of corporate manslaughter.  It will re-balance the current legislation in favour of workers, customers, the public and the citizens.  In reality, this is about providing a game changer in corporate culture and ensuring that management understands it is liable for persons in its care.  We want to create a deterrent effect whereby senior managers are aware that they could go to jail for up to 12 years.  Corporations will no longer be able to evade their responsibilities by rotating managers.</p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Dermot Ahern, received approval from the Government of the day to put forward a criminal justice (corporate manslaughter) Bill in 2010.  A report was prepared on that Bill but it has not yet been published.  Unfortunately, it never progressed.  Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to accept amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage, which will begin in ten weeks.  I know there probably will be a call for pre-legislative scrutiny but if anyone claims he or she can do better than the Law Reform Commission on pre-legislative scrutiny, I would beg to differ.  We want to produce the best Bill possible and we want to provide on this side of the Border what is available on the other side, namely, adequate corporate manslaughter legislation.  The UK legislation was proposed under a Labour Government and pushed by the trade union movement.  When people hear the term "corporate entities", they think of large private and public companies but we are also talking about State agencies, as in the case of the blood transfusion service.  </p> <p>The tragedy of the gap in our legislation is such that when prosecution cases relating to the blood transfusion service were under way, the individuals who should have but did not act when contaminated blood products were given to people could only be prosecuted under the Offences Against The Person Act 1861, a section of which refers to deliberately administering a noxious substance.  That was the best the Director of Public Prosecutions could come up with in terms of prosecution but even that failed because of delays and serious failings within the aforementioned Act.  That legislation did not countenance that a State agency would deliberately and knowingly contaminate 1,600 women with blood products it was aware were deficient.  </p> <p>I am aware of a situation relating to the Coast Guard service in County Kerry.  Senior management in Dublin was aware that the communications equipment being used was liable to catastrophic failure at any moment.  The Coast Guard service co-ordinates rescue operations involving the Coast Guard helicopter service, lifeboats and ships in distress.  Management had been informed by Motorola that the equipment being used, which dated back to the 1960s, was liable to fail catastrophically at any moment.  Mid-rescue, it could simply stop functioning but management did nothing.  In a rescue situation, if communication fails, lives could be lost.  Despite being told that, senior management refused to seek new equipment because it wanted to close down the coastguard station at Valentia and move operations to Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They wanted to keep highlighting the fact that the equipment was out of date.  Their concern was more about their own requirements of closing Coast Guard stations, at Malin and Valentia in this case, rather than the lives of the people involved.  However, if corporate manslaughter legislation was enacted and those in senior management knew they could go to jail in the event of lives being lost because communications equipment failed and they knew about it, I imagine there could be a cultural shift.  This deterrent factor that I am seeking to have put into law, as is the case in other jurisdictions, would bring to mind the new reality for those in areas of responsibility and those responsible for people's lives.  These people should have the best interests of the citizen at heart.</p><p>Tragically, in the case of the blood transfusion service, the Coast Guard in Kerry and in the case of CIE following the Buttevant rail disaster, no one could attribute blame to one individual.  This is another important aspect of the legislation.  There was an entire cultural problem within these organisations.</p><p>There are remedies other than sending an individual or a number of people to jail.  Under this legislation, the corporation, entity or State body would have a report undertaken on its activities as a result of a court action being brought against it.  The cultural shift required as a result of this report would then be put in place.  If it were not to be put in place, then the courts could seek further redress.  The courts could also impose sentences that do not involve jail terms, for example, community service.  There are other possibilities as well.</p><p>Fundamentally, this law should be put in place for the 1,600 victims of our blood transfusion service.  Tragically, that is the worst case I can make, but it is not the only case in which State agencies or bodies failed to act in the best interests of the people.  The idea of having gross negligence on the Statute Book would allow the Director of Public Prosecutions and others to pursue individuals.  It would also ensure individuals who, for whatever reason, do not have the best interests of the citizens at heart might at the least have their own interests at heart and might think twice before forgetting to recall blood products or not bothering to recall blood products they know to be contaminated.</p><p>In the case of the Stardust nightclub fire, there is nothing to say this law would have secured a prosecution.  However, it is certain that the current law would definitely not allow prosecutions in such cases.  Health and safety legislation predominately addresses issues of gross negligence in the workplace.  Outside of that there is little available when it comes to customers, women in hospitals expecting the State to look after their best interests or people who are on the high seas off our coasts who expect modern communications equipment to deal with the crisis at hand.</p><p>The extraordinary thing was how the Coast Guard was allowed to be run down to the point it reached.  This happened despite the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, instructing senior management to buy new equipment.  The new equipment was purchased and put into a warehouse in Blanchardstown for two years until the warranty ran out.  We then waited for the next Minister to come in and produce a report on why the stations at Malin and Valentia should be shut down.  Those involved hoped that the Minister would agree with the report and that the new equipment would be installed in Dublin.  All the while, antiquated Motorola equipment was in use.  It was so bad that the operators of the consoles used to have tweezers to pull the buttons out of the consoles after pressing them.  That was how old they were and how liable they were to catastrophic failure at any moment.  Senior management were given what was known by Motorola as a death certificate.  They had all that equipment and information and they did nothing.  They sat on it for ten years.  What was the likelihood that someone would die as a result of such behaviour by senior management?</p></speech>

Let us suppose I was able to inform those in senior management that, under corporate manslaughter legislation, if that equipment failed, they would go to jail.  I imagine that while such people would not have the interests of the people on the high seas in their hearts, they most certainly would have the interests of not going to jail in their hearts.  This is the cultural shift and the deterrent factor we are looking for.</p> <p>I sincerely hope no one ever gets convicted under this legislation.  I wish there was no need for it.  However, as we know from the hepatitis C scandal and others, it is required.  If, in future, families lose loved ones, there will be a remedy to ensure the people who acted irresponsibly, who were grossly negligent or who failed to act would go to jail, as they should.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1376" speakername="Lorraine Clifford Lee" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#KK00400"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I commend my colleague, Senator Daly, on all the work he has done to date on the Bill.  As Senator Daly has outlined, the Law Reform Commission report on corporate killing in October 2005 recognised that current legislation was deficient and recommended that the new offence of corporate manslaughter be created.  The commission opinion was that existing liability mechanisms in tort and health and safety legislation were insufficient to articulate the abhorrence of society with regard to manslaughter.  It recommended a number of sentencing options.  Furthermore, the Law Reform Commission identified a number of organisational failures in Ireland that resulted in death.  Senator Daly has outlined a number of these, including the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board failure to recall contaminated blood products, the Stardust nightclub disaster, the Whiddy Island disaster and the rail crash in Buttevant.  These cases were used to show how grossly negligent management resulted in death and how these tragedies could have been prevented.</p> <p>In 2010, the then Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, received Government approval for the preparation of a Bill to make corporate bodies criminally liable for deaths they cause.  However, despite Government approval, the Department of Justice and Equality, under the then Minister, Mr. Shatter, and subsequently under the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has yet to publish legislation to deal with this important matter.  That is why we have brought the Bill before the House today.</p> <p>The Bill follows numerous attempts by Fianna F&aacute;il to have corporate manslaughter recognised as an offence, most recently in a Bill published in 2011.  The Bill provides that where an undertaking causes the death of a person by gross negligence, that undertaking is guilty of an offence called corporate manslaughter.  The Bill is of the utmost importance when health and safety statistics are taken into account.  Health and Safety Authority statistics show that between 1998 and 2004, 88 corporate entities were convicted of health and safety offences where deaths occurred.  This illustrates that corporate bodies are often responsible for fatalities.  Another survey of deaths in the construction industry from 1991 to 2001 found that 22% of building site fatalities were primarily attributable to the injured parties, 28% were caused by problems with management of the construction company and a staggering 47% were caused by management difficulties.</p> <p>Under this Bill there is provision for criminal sanction for an undertaking that causes death by gross negligence where it owes a duty of care to the deceased person.  The sanction would apply if it has breached that duty of care in that it has failed to meet the standard of care or the breach of duty involves a serious risk of death or personal harm or the breach causes the death of a person.  In such cases, the court would have a number of means to penalise those convicted of corporate manslaughter, as outlined by Senator Daly.  Under the provisions, courts would be in a position to impose a remedial order on the convicted undertaking, alongside a fine, to remedy the circumstances that led to corporate manslaughter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This Bill would also allow for a disqualification of a high managerial agent from acting in a management capacity in specified areas if that managerial agent has been convicted of grossly negligent management causing death.  This may motivate the managerial agent to not be grossly negligent in the first place.  This is a progressive Bill, which is long overdue.  I welcome it and call on all Members present to support it.  </p></speech>

Currently the law provides for the offence of gross negligence manslaughter, a common law offence.  Prosecutions for such offences are infrequent as such events are themselves uncommon.  Perhaps the most famous of these rare events dates back to 1998.  The accused, a funfair owner, was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter after a woman died when her chair became detached from a 20 year old chairoplane ride at the accused&rsquo;s facility.</p><p>The law also already provides an offence of endangerment under section 13 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which provides: &quot;A person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.&quot;  In addition the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 provides statutory standards and practices to be adhered to by employers and employees.  It includes offences for breaches of statutory safety standards.</p><p>The Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2010 has 13 sections and is similar in many respects to a draft Bill included in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on corporate killing.  The Bill provides for the creation of two criminal offences directed at those culpable for fatalities occurring in the corporate environment.  The first is corporate manslaughter, the corporate offence which is directed at the culpable enterprise.  The second is grossly negligent management causing death, the individual offence which is directed at a high managerial agent within a company.  While the corporate offence cannot attract a custodial penalty the individual offence has penalties of a fine or up to 12 years imprisonment.  The corporate offence is punishable by a fine.  The convicted corporate entity may also be ordered to undertake specific actions on foot of orders handed down by the court. </p><p>Section 1 is an interpretation section which provides definitions of &ldquo;court&rdquo;, &ldquo;high managerial agent&rdquo; and &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;.  Section 2 sets out the offence of &ldquo;corporate manslaughter&rdquo; which is the death of a person caused by the gross negligence of an undertaking where the undertaking owed the deceased person a duty of care; breached the duty of care by failing to take all reasonable measures to anticipate and prevent risks to life; the breach of the duty of care involved a serious risk or serious personal harm and the breach caused the death.  The section also sets out the factors about the undertaking that have to be considered in deciding whether the undertaking owes a duty of care.</p><p>Section 3 sets out the offence of &ldquo;grossly negligent management causing death&rdquo;.  This section also sets out factors for consideration when determining whether a high managerial agent should be liable for the offence, such as the level of responsibility and powers of the person in question or whether he or she passed on information on the risk to those who could have eliminated the risk of serious harm or death.  The Bill provides that a high managerial agent would still be open to prosecution even if the corporate entity had been dissolved.  Section 13 provides the Short Title of the Bill.  Most are valid points but there are some key issues for debate, first, regarding the offence of corporate manslaughter against an individual.  This Bill provides for an offence by a &ldquo;high managerial agent&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;a person being a director, manager, or other similar officer of the undertaking, or a person who purports to act in such a capacity, . . . whether or not that person has a contract of employment with that undertaking;&quot;.  In effect, the Bill will apply to any person who makes any management decision even if the person is not employed by the business in question.  No matter how the definition of &ldquo;a high managerial agent&rdquo; is framed, the fundamental problem remains that the Bill is trying to define an offence by reference to the position of an individual in a hierarchy, whereas it is a general principle throughout our criminal law that the law applies equally to every citizen, depending only on the individual&rsquo;s culpability.  The second issue for debate is application of the offence of corporate manslaughter to unincorporated entities.  The Bill would apply to all &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; in the State.  In the Bill:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; means a person being a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged in the production, supply or distribution of goods or, the provision of a service . . . including those which are Government Departments and statutory bodies, whether carried on for profit or not, as well as faith based organisations and groups.</blockquote> <p>The fact that the Bill would apply the offence of corporate manslaughter to unincorporated bodies may well create a legal minefield.  It would potentially apply to every employee and every volunteer in almost any kind of organisation.  It would be difficult to conceive of any activity that the offence of corporate manslaughter would not apply to and potentially any person in the State could find themselves exposed to the risk of prosecution even if they have no corporate role whatsoever.</p><p>The third point is that there are no exempt activities in the Bill.  The corporate manslaughter offence would apply to all activities, including our ambulance services, fire services, Defence Forces, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the lifeboat service and air-sea rescue.</p></speech>

Several other countries have already taken the necessary steps to improve their legal system with regard to corporate manslaughter.  Britain passed the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, a landmark in British law.  The Act came into force on 6 April 2008, allowing companies and organisations to be found guilty of corporate manslaughter as a result of serious management failures resulting in a gross breach of a duty of care.  Canada has also taken steps to improve its legal system in this regard, passing the Bill C-45 in March 2004.  C-45 established new legal duties for workplace health and safety, and imposed serious penalties for violations that result in injuries or death.  Moreover, the C-45 provided new rules for attributing criminal liability to organisations, including corporations, their representatives and those who direct the work of others.  I commend the Senators for putting this Bill before us and I welcome the Minister's comments in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#LL00700"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I see this Bill as an improvement to the law particularly because at its core it involves protecting workers and punishing those, rightly and justifiably where appropriate, who do not protect their workers in the way that they should.  Given this important purpose one would think the Government would have passed such legislation long before now.  For the past 15 years Sinn F&eacute;in has been urging the Government, and supporting previous attempts, to introduce such safeguards into the workplace, in the form of a corporate manslaughter Bill.  We tried to introduce a Bill in 2007 and supported attempts to do so in 2011 and earlier this year so we are pleased to lend our support to this Bill.  I hope it receives the necessary support to ensure that it speedily becomes law.</p> <p>According to the Health and Safety Authority, 421 people lost their lives at work between 2008 and 2016.  This huge loss of life should act as a call to action for the Government.  There should be no further delay in this matter.  Hundreds of families are grieving the loss of their loved ones.  The Government and employers owe it to those carrying the burden of that loss from the workplace to ensure that no more deaths due to deliberate neglect occur.  Corporate killing, that is death in the workplace as a result of employer indifference, needs to be put on a statutory footing.  It is totally unacceptable that companies through dereliction of their duty of care to those they employ are endangering their lives.  If passed, this Bill will act as an incentive to employers to ensure their workplaces are a safe and secure environment for their staff.</p> <p>The sentiments I am expressing today would then apply to workplaces North and South.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the North, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act came into force in 2007.  Its first application occurred in a Belfast court in May 2012 and resulted in a firm being convicted of the death of an individual due to neglect.  The firm in question was fined a considerable sum of money in respect of the death of its employee.</p><p>Safety in the workplace makes sense for workers and employers.  It protects workers and employers.  It is important to highlight that we, too, have a Workers' Memorial Day to remember all those who died.  In remembering those who died, we are also saying that no more tragedies at work should occur as a result of deliberate negligence.</p><p>It is not clear why the Government has failed in its duty of care towards the working population by failing to introduce a corporate manslaughter Bill.  We can speculate about the motivation of employers when they oppose such legislation and if there is opposition from employers, then the Government must not be deflected from its primary responsibility in this area.  Health and safety in the workplace is not conditional on the ability of the employer to pay for it.  Nor should it be subject to a cost-benefit analysis.  A price should not be placed on a worker&rsquo;s life by either the employer or the Government.  In circumstances where an employer is responsible for an employee&rsquo;s death, it is unacceptable that it is too difficult to hold the company to account and be made liable for that death.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes that a legal incentive is required to concentrate the minds of the Government and employers in this important area.  There should be no further delay in protecting workers' rights and their safety in the workplace.  No person should ever have to go to work with the fear that they will not return to their family.  I believe this Bill will provide the much needed safety for workers in their day to day lives.</p></speech>

I also welcome what is a constructive and important Bill, which I would love to see move forward today and which am happy to support.  It is an important Bill in the context of Ireland having made commitments in respect of the area of business and human rights in its business and human rights strategy.  It fits very much within that space.  It is an important principle that companies which are legal entities and undertakings for the purposes of the protections offered under our statutes should be also appropriately liable under those statutes for the very real consequences of their actions.</p> <p>One reason the Bill is needed is because there is a gap which civil cases alone cannot fill.  Previously, in holding corporations to account, we have relied to a large extent on cases taken by individuals which are often settled and may look to some form of economic compensation but which do not do enough to challenge the culture and the complacency within corporations around actions that have a detrimental impact.  The Bill gives the Director of Public Prosecutions a power not reliant on an individual taking a case because their health and safety considerations have been breached but rightly being able to represent the public concern and the public good and demand action in that regard.</p> <p>The form of penalty set out in the Bill will act as a genuine deterrent because, on a global level, there can be a calculated cost for some companies in terms of certain compensation that they are willing to pay.  That moves it out of the space of calculated cost into a space whereby, appropriately, there is genuine reputational damage in terms of companies in breach of their appropriate human rights, safety and other considerations.  In that regard, I am sure the Minister is aware of the progress we have made on equality legislation where we have moved past a situation where an individual might seek redress because their equality rights have been breached and looking to a positive public duty in terms of trying to ensure a culture of responsibility.  This Bill is in the spirit of that also.  I welcome the two-pronged approach.  It is very important that the Bill sets out penalties for both companies and for those in high managerial positions.  That is a vital and welcome aspect.</p> <p>There are parts of the Bill that could be strengthened.  The definition of "high managerial position", as highlighted by Senator Noone, needs to be examined - we could do that on Committee Stage - because the Bill refers to those with delegated managerial roles with or without contract.  Having worked previously on the volunteer charter, I believe it is important that we make sure that, for example, interns and volunteers would not be in a position to hold a company to liability.  That aspect might need some work done on it.  I believe it is possible to identify those in high managerial position.  We have identified named personages in other spaces with particular responsibilities.  That is appropriate.</p> <p>It is also important that we monitor and look to address the concern which has arisen in the United Kingdom about managers who are rotated through or scapegoated.  It is important because we do not want a situation to arise where we do not notice a pattern developing by which corporations seek either to scapegoat or rotate managers through so that nobody is ever culpable.  The two-pronged approach is important in that regard.</p> <p>The Minister might clarify a point on gross negligence.  I understand that in the UK gross negligence relates not just to intent but to intent or recklessness.  In terms of the language in the Bill, I am not sure whether it refers to intent or intent and recklessness.  That is important because a choice not to consider consequences in that regard must be challenged.</p> <p>There are economic costs in bringing this through but the State is currently carrying the costs for the huge impact of cases of gross negligence against corporates.  It is a huge cost, not just to individuals but to the State in terms of addressing some of the consequences of environmental health and other areas that would be covered by this Bill.</p> <p>At a time when the Government is actively supporting the introduction of new investor courts that will operate outside our national legal system, which would allow corporations to seek compensation for unearned future profits if they are affected by regulations, it would be appropriate that we would take action in the more appropriate national legal space to ensure that citizens also are able to address the impact of the very real and concrete costs which come to them arising from the negligent actions of corporations.  It would be very unfortunate if we were to move forward with further additional compensation for corporations at a time when we still do not have adequate protection for citizens, be they workers or members of the public.</p> <p>I will pass over to my colleague at this point.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Eleven years later, it will close a serious legal gap identified by the Law Reform Commission in its 2005 report on corporate killing.  Above all, it will act in a preventive way.  I speak as a recently stepped down senior manager for an organisation which employed 1,000 staff.  I was responsible for providing services and supports when I was in COPE to 2,500 children and adults.  I speak from the point of view of this Bill having an impact on somebody who would have been in that role.  In terms of senior managers but also boards - which I am not sure are covered - the legislation will act preventively by encouraging senior managers and boards to think twice, act and make responsible decisions which can have life and death implications for other people.  It is the "other people" part that is the important aspect.</p> <p>The Bill will strengthen accountability of people in positions of power over other people and, above all, change the culture around decision making and get people to consider the consequences arising from actions, or inaction, which we know from the cases cited in Whiddy Island, Valentia and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, have serious implications for other people.  I welcome the introduction, albeit 11 years later, of this Bill.</p></speech>

Others have spoken about the long history and background to the introduction of an offence of corporate manslaughter.  It is not a new idea, it has been around a long time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am happy, on behalf of the Labour Party, to support the Bill.  We introduced the first Labour Party Bill on corporate manslaughter in 2001.  Quite a succession of Bills have been introduced by different parties over the years since then.  It is unfortunate that we never moved to legislate finally on it.  I hope this Bill will be the final catalyst.  Others mentioned a very important Law Reform Commission report on corporate killing from October 2005.  I know this Bill is very much based on the Law Reform Commission's draft Bill that was produced then.<br/><br/>It is worth commenting on the contrast in terms of the law in England where a reform to introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter was finally introduced, as others said, in the 2007 Act there.  There is some interesting history around the UK Act, which is called Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007.  It created a new offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland called corporate manslaughter and in Scotland it is called corporate homicide.  There were originally proposals to make it an offence of corporate killing.  That term was seen as too emotive and it was dropped in favour of the term &quot;corporate manslaughter&quot;.  That legislation provided for an offence where an organisation has caused a person's death and also the way in which its activities are managed or organised that caused a person's death and the way in which the activities are managed or organised that amounted to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by the organisation to the deceased.  The test is somewhat different from that adopted by the Law Reform Commission in this Bill.  It would be worth considering whether the test in this Bill is too onerous and whether the test in the English law is somewhat better.<br/><br/>There is other interesting history in the English Bill in that there have been quite a number of successful prosecutions for corporate killing before that under pre-exiting powers.  There were a number of major disasters in the UK that changed public opinion and made the introduction of the legislation particularly urgent there.  Others have mentioned some of these.  There was the Zeebrugge ferry disaster in 1987 where 193 people had lost their lives when the <i>MS Herald of Free Enterprise</i>, a cross-channel ferry, capsized after leaving the port with it bow doors open.  I have read over the years since some of the reports on that disaster and there was a famous report which referred to the company's operations as having been from the top to bottom infected with the disease of sloppiness.  It was the first time where an offence of corporate manslaughter was sought to be prosecuted but the prosecution failed on the basis that nobody sufficiently high up in the company could be identified with the particular breach of duty and the particular gross negligence.  This was always the pitfall of the old common law position on corporate killing.  In Lord Denning's words, it had to be proven that the acting mind, the directing mind, of the company was liable rather than just the hands, the mere operatives who carried out the policy decisions of those at the top.  It is a very archaic view, some would say now, of company organisation.<br/><br/>In Britain there were a number of disasters starting with the Zeebrugge ferry and then a number of rail crashes, which others have mentioned, one in Southall in 1997 which resulted in seven deaths and in Paddington in 1999 which resulted in 31 fatalities.  These and other terrible accidents in which large numbers of people were killed led ultimately to the passage of the legislation there.  Fortunately, we have not had anything like that in Ireland but, as a result, this issue has not been as politically urgent or has not been seen as politically urgent as it should been.  The impetus here should lie in our occupational deaths, that is, deaths at work, and others referred to high numbers of deaths, in particular, in agricultural workplaces and in the construction industry.<br/><br/>When we look at how deaths have been dealt with in criminal law and in health and safety law in particular as a result of workplace accidents, generally prosecutions have been taken under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  Colleagues will be familiar with the Zoe Developments' case in 1997 where a company was ultimately ordered to pay &pound;100,000 to charity after the death of a building worker on one of the sites operated by that company.  The site in question was also closed for a time which was seen as a much more severe sanction on the company because it lost a large sum of money as a result.  Roseberry Construction was another case which colleagues may recall where two individual workmen were killed, again in a workplace accident.  In that case, the company was fined &euro;200,000 for breaches of health and safety legislation.  There have certainly been prosecutions but they have not been of the order of corporate manslaughter or in the name of corporate manslaughter and clearly the fines, while they have been significant, have not been of the nature of fines we have seen in England.<br/><br/>Turning to the experience in the UK and looking at some of the cases there, to some of which colleagues referred, since the 2007 Act came into force, we have seen a number of very high-profile successful prosecutions for corporate manslaughter.  The County Armagh case was referred to where a farming company was fined &pound;187,000 in 2012.  In 2011, the first prosecution was in the Cotswolds where a trench collapsed in Gloucestershire and the company was fined &pound;375,000.  A big fine of &pound;480,000 was imposed in 2012 on Lion Steel, a manufacturing company, over the death of an employee of the company, Stephen Berry, who suffered fatal injuries.  The fine provided for in UK law is unlimited.  Fines are clearly the right sanction for a company.  There has been a long debate over how one sanctions a company for corporate manslaughter and for corporate liability for criminal offences.  That is the model that is followed here.  It is a no-brainer that this legislation should be adopted, that we should all support it and that we should move forward with it, looking, if necessary, at amendments on Committee and Report Stages, but noting that it is overdue that we would move to have this sort of offence.<br/><br/>Another observation I would make in terms of changes to criminal law is that we have seen in recent years a much greater emphasis on enforcement of company law offences, specifically since the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act in 2001 and the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  We have seen a much greater culture of corporate liability for criminal offences and specifically for breaches of company law provisions as well as the health and safety law breaches to which I have referred.  It might be deduced and we might conclude from the movement towards greater liability being attached in criminal law to companies for breaches of or offences under company law compared with the lack of momentum on corporate manslaughter that greater priority was given to making companies liable in Ireland to protect financial interests than to protect human life or health, especially of employees of companies.<br/><br/>With those few remarks, I welcome the Bill and very much welcome the principle behind it.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to say that I understand that she proposes to accept the Bill in principle.  It is another good day for the Seanad.  It is interesting that we have put through a number of Bills recently.  The media showed complete disinterest in any of this material which is very important.  I congratulate Senator Mark Daly on finding this legislation.  It is a very good thing that Seanad &Eacute;ireann picks up on the doings and deliberations of the Law Reform Commission.  Otherwise its findings would be just left lying on shelves in dusty tomes.  It is excellent that we took up this matter.  It addresses a situation where corporate bodies and entities have evaded their responsibilities.</p><p>There is a short story by James Joyce called <i>A Painful Case</i>in which Mrs. Sinico is killed at Sydney Parade by a train.  The last line of it instructive: &quot;It seems nobody was to blame.&quot;  This was the attitude as far as corporate manslaughter was concerned in this country and will continue to be until the passage of this Bill.  It seems nobody is to blame.  In other words, they can get away with it.</p><p>I remember a series of scaffolding disasters, particularly on building sites, where people were killed, the building companies were fined a couple of thousands pounds but nothing was given to the families.  This is one of the provisions I would like to see in the Bill.  I would like to see the direction of money.  People are fined but the money should go to the widows and orphans to protect and look after them.  The area of agriculture was mentioned but almost all the accidents involve a single farmer, farm machinery and children, so where is the corporate entity to be sued?  In addition to the responsibility on corporations and such bodies. there is a responsibility on every citizen to take care.  We see advertisements on the television every night about people out in countryside or clipping a hedge next of an electrical wire.  People have to take responsibility for themselves.</p><p>I speak with some passion on this because for quite a number of years I was the manager, owner, and everything else of a gay nightclub in Temple Bar.  It actually started the whole of Temple Bar.  We had a cinema, restaurant, discotheque, library, outreach facilities, publications and all that kind of thing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were an amateur, volunteer body.  God Almighty could not have stopped people smuggling in bottles of vodka, joints and the like.  There was a flat roof and I was always in a taut state of excitement in case some of these people would fall of the roof and we would be liable.  Again, they should have had a duty of care.  Then considers events such as the Stardust fire, where the fire doors were bolted.  That is a clear example of responsibility.  Fire exits should always be maintained.</p><p>My colleague in Fine Gael said that we could not possibly have the fire brigades and ambulances.  Why the hell not?  Senator Daly gave the example of the rescue services and the way in which they were deliberately deprived of life-saving instruments and material.  I believe that if the fire brigade is grossly negligent, it should be done for that in the same way as everybody else.  It has a responsibility.  As the individual fire fighters and so forth give their efforts and risk their lives on behalf of all of us, that means we also have a duty to protect them legislatively, so I apologise for not accepting that argument.  It should be liable just as much.</p><p>I noted the way the Bill is sensitively worded.  It says that the standard of care required of the undertaking is to take all reasonable measures, having due regard to the state and circumstances of the undertaking.  In other words, it must be proportionate.  This is a very good thing in legislation.  I am not entirely sure of the difference between corporate manslaughter and grossly negligent management causing death.  They appear to be pretty much the same.  I like the idea of pre-sanction reports.  Before one goes in with the hatchet one finds out what the situation in the company is.  There is absolutely no point in fining a company or an individual &euro;5 million if they are virtually bust.  A pre-sanction report should include information on the means and financial status of the undertaking, which is very important, and the previous compliance, in other words whether it had a good record.  This is evidence relating to the character of the company.  The report should also include the previous co-operation by the undertaking with relevant bodies having legislative enforcement functions and the possible adverse effects on other parties of imposing a fine or other measures under the legislation.  It is a carefully constructed provision.</p><p>I support the idea of community service orders.  They are much better if it is an individual, if it is a fairly small situation and if there are extenuating circumstances.  It is good to have provision for community service orders in the legislation.  I love the idea of adverse publicity orders, where the company must state in public, "We were wrong.  We were responsible for this death and we are very sorry.  We will never do it again and we warn other companies to take precautions".  That is very good, because it might well prevent incidents further down the line.  My final point is about the &euro;5 million fine.  I do not know anybody who could support such a fine.  Nobody of my acquaintance could and I certainly could not.  However, it is probably wise to make provision for the most extreme circumstance.</p><p>This is a very good Bill.  Hello, media, I think this is another good day for the Seanad.  We are showing that we are worth our weight in gold.  Nobody is listening, but the Seanad is a damned good institution and it does valiant work protecting the lives, safety and welfare of the people of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-26a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016102600002#OO00200"><p>I thank Senators for their contributions on this very important topic and I thank Senators Mark Daly, Robbie Gallagher, and Lorraine Clifford-Lee for introducing the Bill.  We can all agree that where there has been an incident which results in the homicide of a person or persons, it must receive a strong response from the criminal justice system.  Fatalities which occur as a result of gross negligence in the corporate or workplace environment are no exception.  The victims of such incidents are not only the person who has been killed but also the immediate and extended family, colleagues and friends.  It is our duty to ensure that there is an effective and appropriate criminal justice response in place to deal with such events.  The Government therefore does not oppose this Bill in principle.  However, I will discuss some of the more detailed provisions and make some recommendations and suggestions on them.</p> <p>The objective of the proposed legislation is to address a possible lacuna in the criminal law.  This gap, in theory, leaves members of the public with inadequate protection from gross negligence that results in a fatality on the part of corporate entities.  The protection of the right to life and the vindication of that right, by law, are fundamental rights recognised in the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  As Senators said, the Law Reform Commission issued a report on the subject of corporate killing some years ago.  This provided a possible criminal law response to incidents of corporate homicide and, as in the Bill before us, both corporate and individual offences were included.  More recently, my Department co-ordinated an interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from across the various Departments, to examine this issue.  The group considered the issue in great detail for the purpose of identifying the impact of introducing targeted legislation that criminalises homicides which are the result of gross negligence in the corporate environment.</p> <p>The outcome of the working group's analysis highlighted the complexity of this sensitive area of policy and the fact that a wide range of issues must be considered prior to the development of a legislative response to such fatal incidents.  It is important that any new criminal law in this area would create an environment where systems in place that protect public safety and provide opportunities for learning and improvements in workplace safety and practice remain effective.  Furthermore, the consequences of a conviction should not have a collateral effect of penalising those linked to the corporate entity but who are entirely innocent of any criminally negligent behaviour.</p> <p>In this regard, Members can see immediately that the Bill presents challenges that require consideration with regard to providing an effective criminal law solely directed at fatalities occurring as a result of negligence in the corporate environment.  The criminal law route should only be used where death has occurred as a result of flagrant abuse of the safety standards expected of corporate entities.  Before embarking on the creation of new offences, particularly offences which, as Senator Norris noted, will carry substantial penalties, it is important to be aware of, and have regard to, legislation which is already in place, which not only provides an effective punishment but also reflects the public abhorrence of such crimes and serves as a deterrent to their occurrence.</p> <p>There are a number of laws in place already.  I will deal separately with the law which deals with an offence by a corporate entity, and then refer to the law as it applies to an individual.  Safety in the workplace is governed by the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  I should point out that this legislation was not in place when the Law Reform Commission reported, so we should take account of the legislation introduced subsequent to its report which impacts on this area.  I will not go into detail about that Act but it provides for having statutory standards and practices in place to be adhered to by employers and employees.  Compliance with the statutory requirements set out in this legislation is very important.  It is a major contributor to safety in the workplace and to ensuring that serious or fatal incidents in the workplace are, thankfully, relatively rare, although there are issues in certain sectors which require us to be vigilant on an ongoing basis.  The fines that can be imposed for breaches of this legislation are substantial.</p> <p>The offence of endangerment under section 13 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act provides for a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 provides for substantial fines and a term of imprisonment of up to two years.  There is also the law which provides for the offence of grossly negligent manslaughter, and Senator Noone referred to the 1998 case where the accused was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter after a woman died when her chair became detached from a 20-year-old chairplane ride at the accused's funfair.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Prosecutions for such offences are rare because such events are rare but I understand the motivation behind this legislation and why Senators want to see it on the Statute Book.  However, I want to make the point that it would be incorrect to suggest or believe that there are no remedies in either the statutory regulatory environment or in criminal law to deal with those culpable of serious negligence which results in death in the corporate setting.</p><p>As I said earlier, the Government does not oppose the principle of this Bill and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it.  I note what Senator Mark Daly said about wanting to ensure we had the best possible approach and I make these comments in this context.  A number of issues require deeper consideration in ensuring the best approach to the provision of a criminal law response to the type of fatalities that are the focus of this Bill.  First of all, I would like to address particular concerns in regard to the proposed individual offence of grossly negligent management causing death, as set out in section 3 of the Bill.  Under the provisions of the Bill, a high managerial agent would be open to a custodial penalty of up to 12 years imprisonment upon conviction.  The Bill defines a "high managerial agent" as "a person being a director, manager, or other similar officer of the undertaking, or a person who purports to act in such a capacity, including those that play a role in the making of decisions about how the whole or part of the activities of the undertaking are to be managed or organised or the actual managing of those activities, including those who have been delegated managerial duties, whether or not that person has a contract of employment with that undertaking".  In effect, the Bill will apply to any person who makes any management decision even if they are not employed by the business in question.  That would create many difficulties and may be unworkable.</p><p>It would mean, for example, that a person who is on the board of management of a sports club, school or community organisation could be seen to be legally responsible for a death for which they did not have personal responsibility.  In such a scenario, one would have to ask who would be willing to volunteer to sit on the board of management of a community organisation, sports club or school.  Moreover, no matter how we modify the definition of a high managerial agent in the Bill, there is a fundamental problem because we are trying to define an offence by the position of an individual in a hierarchy whereas throughout our criminal law, the law applies equally to every citizen depending only on the individual's culpability.  Defining an offence by reference to a person's job title may make bad law and I would be concerned about it.</p><p>The existing offence of gross negligence manslaughter is a more objective and fairer procedure.  In 1948, the courts set out the factors which are to be considered in establishing the offence of gross negligence manslaughter.  Criminal negligence occurs where the accused fails to act as experience shows necessary to avoid risk of injury to others, the accused's negligence must be responsible for death, the negligence must be of a very high degree and the negligence must involve a risk of substantial personal injury.  In 2012, the High Court stated that this law is clear.  The penalty for this offence can be life imprisonment.  In contrasting section 3 and what we have under this provision, I am concerned about section 3.  The current law is stronger than section 3.  The effect of the penalties provided for in section 3 could mitigate against effective investigation of health and safety in the workplace.  The current standard is that in order to ensure an effective investigation and response that will prevent such incidents occurring in the future, people can report and provide information that would ensure that such incidents do not recur on a non-punitive "no fault" basis.  I believe that if we introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter attaching to persons because of their position in a management hierarchy, we will significantly reduce the effectiveness of our health and safety law.  It was because of these kinds of difficulties that it was decided in the UK to confine its Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 to corporate offences and not to include an offence of manslaughter by an individual.  I suggest that in considering this legislation further, this might be the best approach.  I ask the Senators sponsoring this legislation to reconsider this and consider how it might be approached.  On behalf of the Government, I suggest that section 3 of the Bill should be deleted because it would be bad law and create confusion and vagueness in the law.</p><p>I will now turn to a separate issue of concern.  The Bill would apply to all "undertakings" in the State.  The Bill defines an "undertaking".  I do not need to go into how it is defined because it has already been referenced.  We would be concerned that this definition could create a legal minefield.  It could mean a group of hill walkers could be liable to a charge of corporate manslaughter if one of them has a fatal fall due to negligent planning and improper safety procedures.  It would apply to every volunteer in almost any kind of organisation.  It would be difficult to conceive of any activity to which the offence of corporate manslaughter would not apply.  Potentially any person in the State could find themselves exposed to the risk of prosecution even if they have no corporate role whatsoever. </p><p>The question of the emergency services is an interesting one and different views have been expressed about it here today.  These are activities by the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the lifeboat service and air-sea rescue.  These are activities which are essential public services and, obviously, involve a necessary level of risk.  There is a discussion to be had about whether a corporate manslaughter Act should encompass these areas.  Would it mean that individual members of all of these services would be vulnerable to prosecution for corporate manslaughter, what would be their area of responsibility when they are out there doing their work providing essential public services and is that the right public policy?  </p></speech>

We are talking about boundary issues here that we need to examine further.  I suggest that we have amendments that would confine the scope of the corporate manslaughter offence to corporate bodies.  This is clearly an area of concern as well.</p> <p>In number of areas, the Bill does not set any limit on the amount of a fine.  We need proportionality between any maximum fine and any maximum sentencing to imprisonment.  The sections dealing with pre-sanction reports and remedial orders appear to potentially conflict with the 2005 legislation introduced after the Law Reform Commission completed its work on this issue.  Many aspects of that legislation are relevant when discussing the Bill proposed by Senator Mark Daly and others.  We could further examine the procedures in regard to community service.  </p> <p>I welcome the discussion in the Seanad on this very important topic.  Senators have quoted quite a number of incidents in the UK and Ireland that clearly have raised concerns where they believe this Bill could usefully have been used.  I am making the point that I am not opposing the legislation but I have a number of significant concerns and suggestions relating to the amendment of it, which I believe would improve it and make it more workable.</p></speech>

The Law Reform Commission report referred to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and its legislation took into account that Act.  The Bill we have brought forward also takes much of it into account.  The benchmark is whether people in senior management positions in agencies and corporate bodies should go to jail if people die as a result of their management and mismanagement.  I suggest, and many people agree, they should.  The reason section 3, which contains the sanction of imprisonment, was removed in the UK was that the people in charge at the top level in England would not like to face such an offence in a court of law.  While they have no problem with their corporate entity being fined, community service or adverse publicity, they have a problem with going to jail.  We need to discuss it.</p> <p>I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is accepting the Bill.  I am glad new politics works, in some instances.  Now, unfortunately, the pressure is on the Department of Justice and Equality.  In ten weeks' time it is going to Committee Stage under new politics.  We will table amendments and I would love to sit down with the T&aacute;naiste's officials and tease out the sections of the Bill she is not happy with.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to reflect on the 1,600 victims of the hepatitis C scandal and those who died as a result.  In her heart of hearts, the T&aacute;naiste must agree that somebody should have gone to jail for it.  This is what we are trying to prevent.</p> <p>I want nobody to ever have to go to jail under the legislation.  I want it to bring about a cultural change whereby it will not happen again, because people will know they could go to jail.  As the T&aacute;naiste is well aware, there are people who have no problem with adverse publicity orders against their organisations or by the time any court of law gets around to finding against their corporate entity or agency, they are well retired and pensioned off, and they do not care.  They have to care.  We have got to make them care.  If they do not care about the individuals, we must make sure they care about the women who ended up getting sick because people in a State agency failed them and knew they were failing them, and knew people would die.  This is the only benchmark.</p> <p>Section 3 is a critical part of the Bill.  It was removed in the UK, and I take into account the voluntary organisations.  We can tease out all those elements.  However, we must not forget that this is about prevention.  Nobody ever gets a medal for preventing a war.  The guys who go to war get all the medals and glory.  We are trying to stop future hepatitis C scandals and future Stardust fires.  From now on, our task and responsibility is to ensure that, when we are long gone from public service, the Bill will prevent those who should have acted from gross mismanagement to the point that they will go to jail if they fail people.</p></speech>
