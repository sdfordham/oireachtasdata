Last Friday the National Treatment Purchase Fund published figures dating from September 2012 to September 2013 which showed that waiting lists have increased by 8,000 persons.  The facts are as follows.  There were 49,496 persons on the inpatient and day case list in September 2013 which meant an 18% increase on the 2012 figure.  That is most alarming and appalling.  In addition, the Minister for Health has declined discretionary medical cards for sick children which is a shame.</p><p>I also note and welcome, as does this side of the House, the fact that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has been asked to supervise the Minister for Health's handling of the health budget.  I am sure that the Taoiseach, in particular, has lost at least some, if not all, confidence in the Minister for Health.</p><p>The most emphatic and worrying issue is the problem facing sick children.  It is an appalling vista to know that 42,000 children must await outpatient appointments as of today.  That is an amazing figure.  In excess of 31,000, or the vast majority, are on the list for Temple Street hospital and Crumlin hospital in Dublin.</p> <p>Of these figures, some 3,168 are waiting for cardiology appointments, life saving treatments, at Crumlin hospital and a further 1,043 are waiting for cardiology appointments at Temple Street.  Some 2,243 children are awaiting eye appointments in Crumlin and 1,570 awaiting similar appointments in Temple Street.  Some 3,527 children are awaiting ear, nose and throat appointments in Temple Street while another 1,500 are on the equivalent list in Crumlin hospital.  There are 4,706 on the overall list at Crumlin hospital and a further 3,419 at Temple Street hospital.  In fact, there are 8,500 children, as we speak, on the waiting lists in Ireland which is a significant increase.  This is very worrying because last year, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in whom we had faith because in the year running up to the election, he gave an assurance to the other House that once he took the reins of power he would resolve all the issues confronting the HSE, including waiting lists.  One of his critical issues was to reduce waiting lists.  I commend him for providing a special &euro;18 million fund to target waiting lists when the waiting lists were at 47,943.  The numbers on the waiting lists have increased significantly since then.  I am talking about the waiting lists concerning sick children throughout the country.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, come to the House and tell us the plan to alleviate the concern of parents for sick children, our future generations, who are on the waiting lists are getting worse.  If the waiting lists were improving I would be the first to acknowledge it.  In this regard the Minister has failed dismally.  I ask that either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform come to the House today, as a matter of urgency, and explain what will be done in the coming months rather than years.</p></speech>

I have asked previously and I ask again for a debate in the new year on the children's hospital and on the important and long overdue plans the Government has to establish a new children's hospital.  The conditions and the facilities in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals have been criticised in the past and during boom times.  It is most unfortunate that previous governments did not do something to alleviate the conditions there and to ensure that better structures were put in place.  I know this Government is committed to that but I ask the Leader for a debate on that issue and on progress with the establishment of the new children's hospital.</p><p>I take the opportunity to acknowledge the death last week of Nelson Mandela.  As we are all aware the memorial service is taking place in South Africa today.  The death of this incredible man, a Nobel Prize winner and former President of South Africa, has had an immense impact internationally and also in Ireland.  Many tributes have been paid since his death.  The other House is paying its tributes to him this afternoon and we might, at some point, have the opportunity to do that in a more formal manner.</p><p>I wish to mark today as international human rights day and commend Dublin City Council for an initiative it has taken in unveiling a monument to another great peacemaker and statesman, Vaclav Havel, former President of the Czech Republic.  The new commemorative piece, a table and chairs, in memory of Vaclav Haval has been established in St. Patrick's Park, Dublin 8.  It was unveiled by the Lord Mayor, Ois&iacute;n Quinn.  The initiative was taken by Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC, from the Bar Council of Ireland, and private funding was raised.  Dublin is the second city, after Washington DC, to establish a monument to Havel and Barcelona will follow suit in the new year.  It is lovely to commemorate a peacemaker of this stature.</p><p>I ask the Leader for a debate on the university panel reform, proposed by the Taoiseach.  We are likely to have such a debate in the new year but I want to ensure we have it to see what shape the new expanded graduate panel will take.</p> <p>In that context, I welcome to the Visitors' Gallery Dr. Peadar &Oacute; M&oacute;rdha, who is very active in the London branch of the Trinity College Dublin Association, and his distinguished guest, Sir Gavyn Arthur, a High Court judge in London.</p></speech>

I gather we will import 1.7 million turkeys this year.  Six or seven years ago we were producing 3.5 million turkeys, but the number produced this year will be fewer than 1 million.  I wonder what has happened.  The vast majority of Irish citizens do not know the turkeys they are buying are imported.  The reason is that we do not provide that information.</p><p>Some months ago, we considered the Food Provenance Bill 2013 in the House.  The Minister said at the time that he was in agreement with everything in the Bill but that he would like to delay it until the  European Union introduced its legislation.  I gather that legislation will be coming into force next April.  At this stage, we should be doing something more than we are doing.  I do not believe the vast majority of Irish citizens will know, even with the EU legislation, the provenance of the products they buy.  We should be able to identify the sources of products, even where a product contains items from different countries.  Second Stage of the Food Provenance Bill was read well.  The Minister asked us to hold on until he decided to make further progress on it.  I urge him to allow the Bill to proceed or introduce his own version of it in the near future.</p></speech>

Parents state that putting children through school can cost over &euro;500 per annum per child.  This is quite a hefty bill on top of everything else.  The Minister has made great inroads in reducing the cost of schoolbooks by financing and supporting book rental schemes, but the cost of school uniforms still remains a bugbear for many families.  I encourage all parents associated with schools around the country to participate in the consultation process initiated this week.  A circular and a questionnaire have been sent to all schools to give parents a direct say in what happens.</p><p>I urge parents to take into account another aspect of this matter.  The cheapest product is not necessarily the best value.  They should  take into account the wear and tear of garments and how long they will last.  In this regard, we should bear in mind Irish jobs and Irish manufacturers of school uniforms around the country.  Importing cheaper products is not necessarily the solution to achieving the best value in school uniforms for children.  I encourage all schools and parents to take part in the consultation process.  At some stage in the new year, I ask the Leader to facilitate, with the Minister for Education and Skills, a debate on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000005#D00500"><p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I mark the occasion of the passing of Nelson Mandela, who was an example to all the world of what can be achieved by peaceful methods.  His contribution to world affairs will live for millennia, and so it should.  On the occasion of our recalling what was achieved by peaceful means in South Africa, it is worth noting today that the brother of the late Fidel Castro greeted US President Barack Obama by way of a handshake.  That was also a very historic moment and one worth mentioning in the House today.  Perhaps it is a sign of developments to come involving the United States and Cuba.</p> <p> I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Denis O'Donovan.  There has been an amendment each day on the health issue for many weeks and today it seems there will be a &euro;200 million Supplementary Estimate, as predicted without any pleasure at the beginning of last year by this side of the House.  The reality, in terms of the mismanagement of the health service, is clear for all to see.  Senator Denis O'Donovan mentioned some of the issues involved.  Up to 8,000 children have been waiting for more than a year to see a consultant in the two main children's hospitals.  The HSE has revealed that 30,000 persons are on the outpatient lists at Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals.  A massive 15,762 are waiting for treatment at Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin, with 3,351 waiting for up to two years.  Some 1,150 sick children have been waiting for up to three years to see a heart specialist.  Surely this is not a scenario we can celebrate as success in the management of the health service.  On prescription charges, in reply to a parliamentary question in the other House the Minister confirmed that if an elderly patient needed two courses of drugs, he or she would be charged double the prescription charge.  There will be an overrun of &euro;200 million this year.  It was confirmed by the HSE this week that 10,400 persons with serious conditions had had their discretionary medical cards withdrawn.  That is before the beginning of the cull to save &euro;113 million in the year ahead on medical cards.  All of this is set against a backdrop against which the Minister states that in the year ahead he will save &euro;666 million under the health service plan, a plan we have not seen.  I implore the Leader to bring forward the plan before the end of the year in order that it is not lost within the festive season.  It is important that we discuss it.</p><p>It is a disgrace that the Local Government Bill 2013 has been kicked to the back end of next week.  We in this House are to be ignored and treated with the same level of contempt and disdain which led to an referendum which the people rightly rejected.  I ask the Leader to note that vital legislation such as this cannot merely be stuffed in here in the last couple of days when it suits the D&aacute;il.  We ought to have had time to consider the Local Government Bill 2013 and the health service plan in an appropriate fashion, but that will not happen in the last couple of days before Christmas.  The Government had time to bring forward these matters previously.  It could have initiated such legislation and debates in this House, but it chose not to do so and it has shown again it contempt for democracy in so doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000006#E00200"><p>There is a good news story in the health area.  I was glad to hear that in the past week there were 12 kidney transplants done in a four day period.  It was a significant achievement by the medical personnel involved in the hospitals concerned.  This indicates the work that must be done.  When we entered government, there were on average 150 transplants a year.  We need to target a figure of 300 per annum and progress is being made in that regard.  It was down to a lack of planning that this occurred between 2000 and 2010.  Referring back to what my colleagues said about waiting lists for children, there has been a lack of planning in medical provision for children in the sense that the birth rate has increased dramatically, from 60,000 to 75,000 per annum.  There was an equivalent lack of planning for an increase in paediatric consultants during that ten-year time period.  As a result, we are suffering the consequences.  It is quite easy for Members on the other side of the House to criticise the Minister on this issue, but there was a lack of planning in employing additional staff and we now must deal with that issue.  The Minister is dealing with it.  It is something at which we must look and tackle in order to deal with the issues raised by my colleagues.  No doubt the Minister will be dealing with it in the next few months.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, a strong connection between the students' union and Nelson Mandela and I am pleased its representatives have joined us today.  The Lenihan family has made many contributions to public life. </p><p>I welcome Judge Smithwick's report on the shootings of Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan.  At the end of his most comprehensive report, which runs to 432 pages, Judge Smithwick recommends the establishment of an integrated border intelligence team between the two jurisdictions on the island modelled on the team in operation on the United States-Canada border.  I hope our ambassadors to Canada and the United States will be asked to brief the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality on how the team operates.  I ask the Leader to provide information to the House in advance of our discussion on the Smithwick report on how the integrated border intelligence team between the United States and Canada works.  Relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland and the authorities, North and South, are at least as harmonious as relations between the United States and Canada.  A border intelligence team may be a good model to explore before the House debates the Smithwick report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000007#F00200"><p>I, too, pay tribute to Nelson Mandela.  He was a man, the like of which the world has rarely seen, and we may not see a man of such calibre again in our lifetimes.  It is important to remember that Nelson Mandela brought home to us that we are all connected by a universal human thread and strongly emphasised what constitutes humanity.  It is also important to remember that he was cut off from and denied humanity during his incarceration of many years.  It is in that context that I raise the report published by the Irish Refugee Council today on the system of direct provision and the manner in which asylum seekers are treated.  Many asylum seekers are incarcerated in the system of direct provision.  The Irish Refugee Council makes clear in its recommendations that significant changes are required to the system.  It does not behove us, on a day when Nelson Mandela is being honoured by the people of Ireland through the attendance of our President and T&aacute;naiste at his funeral in South Africa, to allow a system of direct provision to operate, under which children are being raised without family life and adults and families are effectively imprisoned.  It is not acceptable that we allow this system to continue.</p></speech>

Senators cannot do justice to him or to his legacy in contributions on the Order of Business.  Given Nelson Mandela's international stature and achievements, I hope the Leader will allow the Seanad to do him justice by allowing Senators on all sides to make full contributions this week.  Nelson Mandela was a freedom fighter and peacemaker who understood that there is a time for war and a time for peace.  We should take time to have a proper and full examination of his life and what he stood for and to pay tribute to his greatness.  The world has lost a great statesman.  I hope the Leader will allow time this week for all of us to make comprehensive contributions on this important issue.</p><p>I support the amendment to the Order of Business and concur with comments made on increasing waiting times.  I raised this issue several times with the Minister for Health who consistently denies there has been any increase in waiting times for patients.  In some specialties waiting times are now in excess of two years.  I cited a number of examples in Waterford where, as the Leader will be aware, people continue to wait far too long to access orthopaedic services.  The problem is not only the time people must wait for the treatment they need but the difficulty they experience even securing an appointment with a consultant.  We must discuss this issue with the Minister.</p><p>The issue of top-up payments to chief executives of voluntary hospitals is also simmering and causing considerable anger and frustration among citizens.  </p> <p>It is important for the sake of accountability and transparency that we have a proper and independent investigation of the issue so we can find out exactly who knew what, from the Minister and the HSE to the boards and the CEOs.  It is unacceptable that we will be discussing increases in waiting times for patients at a time when these top-up payments are being made.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely that the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language come to the House to discuss the resignation of the Irish language commissioner.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh will speak more about that subject when he seconds the amendment.</p></speech>

Many things have been said about him and no words of mine would be adequate to describe his greatness or his contribution to the world.  President Obama described him as the last great liberator of the 20th century.  South Africa lost the father of the nation, a man of vision and a great hero.  He was a man of great of humanity and forgiveness who, despite being incarcerated for 27 years, worked to bring about peace in his country.  He has left his mark on the world and we need to build on his legacy.  I support the request to the Leader to arrange for statements to be made in his honour this week.  In the longer term, we should debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade how the Mandela legacy can have an impact on the parts of the world that are being ravaged by war and strife.  The greatest tribute we could pay to Nelson Mandela would be to create something lasting.</p><p>I congratulate the State's industrial relations machinery on brokering an agreement that will ensure we have power supplies over Christmas and that the elderly and businesses will not be discommoded.  The fear that people would be without electricity over Christmas has caused considerable distress in recent days.  I refer in particular to the elderly.  It is time for a debate on what needs to be done to protect vital infrastructure in this country.  This is an area of discussion in which the House can play a significant role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1121" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000008#G00300"><p>I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the late Nelson Mandela.  I trust the Leader will arrange a more substantial timeframe for additional statements in the coming weeks.  I note with satisfaction Senator Bacik's comments on the unveiling of a memorial to the former President of Czechoslovakia, V&aacute;clav Havel, who was a politician of huge moral substance.  To speak of Havel and Mandela in the same breath offers very positive guidance for everyone who is involved in politics.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue of housing from the perspective of people who are on housing lists or are attempting to purchase houses.  There has been much talk of an improved market but I am concerned that we are beginning to welcome an increase in house prices as if it is somehow a panacea for the economy or will get Ireland back to work.  Let us not forget that much, if not all, of our current economic dilemma and misery was caused by house prices.  We should be cautious in our welcome of the movement in the property market.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the private rented sector and on local authority housing lists have an interest in securing homes.</p> <p> I have enormous political and personal respect for the Minister for Finance, but I was unhappy yesterday to hear him welcome the availability of interest-only loans to landlords for the purchase of private rented accommodation.  There are people other than landlords who could benefit hugely from interest-only loans.  I am concerned that in our blinkered desire to restore this country to economic sanity and encourage development and the creation of jobs, we could fall into the same trap into which we fell, eyes open, in the 1990s.  Property became a type of god and the massive rises in house prices ruined our country.  We must be very cautious to ensure that does not happen again.  I am calling for a substantive debate on housing policies and options as early as possible in the new year.</p></speech>

The resolution of the dispute represents a win-win situation for all concerned.  Last week I appealed for all sides to engage in negotiations and for common sense to prevail.  Fortunately, that is what happened, and the threatened strike has been called off to the benefit of all concerned.</p></speech>

B'fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn faoi sin l&aacute; n&iacute;os faide anonn.  I congratulate the Irish Refugee Council, which is celebrating 21 years in operation this year, on the publication of the report, as referred to by Senator Aideen Hayden.  It is arguing in this document for basic human rights agus ceann de na cearta at&aacute; &aacute; sh&aacute;r&uacute; ar bhealach n&aacute;ireach i l&aacute;thair na huaire n&aacute; cearta na saor&aacute;naigh maidir leis an nGaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom cuidi&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; molta ar Riar na hOibre.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator David Cullinane, go n-iarradh muid ar Aire na Gaeltachta teacht isteach inniu le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar ch&aacute;s n&aacute;ireach an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  I am totally taken aback by how lightly the Government is taking the issue of the resignation of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in.  He was appointed to the role under presidential seal and is in the position of an ombudsman.  In fact, it is the first time in the history of the State that an ombudsman has seen fit to resign on a point of principle, namely, that he is not getting the support he requires from the Government to do what he needs to do in upholding the law of the land.  This is an incredibly serious issue which the Government should be taking much more seriously.  We need an urgent debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to explain why this happened and why the Minister did not reassure the commissioner that he would put in place the necessary resources.  It is not even necessarily a question of money; it is more about support from Departments and via Government policy to allow the coimisin&eacute;ir to do his work properly.  I am calling for that debate today.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dt&oacute;gfaidh an Ceannaire an cheist iontach tromch&uacute;iseach seo d&aacute;ir&iacute;re.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000009#H00400"><p>Senators Denis O'Donovan and Marc MacSharry referred to hospital waiting lists, with particular reference to children awaiting an appointment.  Given that the Minister for Health is in Brussels today attending a meeting of health Ministers, I cannot accede to the request to amend the Order of Business to bring him to the House for a debate on this issue.</p><p>Since the special delivery unit was established by the Minister in July 2011, significant progress has been made in reducing the number of patients on hospital trolleys and on waiting lists.  For example, by the end of last year, there was a 98% decrease in the number of people waiting more than nine months for an inpatient or day case appointment, a 95% decrease in the number of children waiting 20 weeks, and a 99% reduction in the number of people waiting more than 13 weeks for routine endoscopies.  The early months of the year brought severe pressures on emergency departments, which had an impact on waiting times.</p> <p>The Minister for Health has set a target of eliminating inpatient waiting lists of over eight months by the end of the year.  The increase in 2013 was as a result much greater than expected, with a 16% increase in total numbers waiting between December 2012 and July 2013.  However, through the sustained intervention of the special delivery unit, the trend is now reversed, with a 5% reduction in total numbers waiting and a 42% reduction in number waiting over eight months since end of July 2013.  As of 21 November 2013, 3,393 people had been waiting more than eight months.  A range of actions are being undertaken to assist in meeting this year&rsquo;s target, including the use of the &euro;18 million intervention fund to meet the target, developing and monitoring special plans with hospitals where elective waiting lists are under pressure, identifying increased capacity and capability across hospital groups, increasing operating theatre lists, the development of a national analysis of risks affecting hospital and specialty-level performance, the agreement of mitigation plans with hospital senior leadership, and direct interventions at site level in some hospitals where there are particular challenges.  One cannot say the Minister is not acting as much as he possibly can.  To have one child on a waiting list is unacceptable, but the Minister is doing his utmost to solve the problem.  I hope we can have him in the Chamber before we break next week.  Senator Bacik pointed out that the Government is committed to plans for a national children's hospital.  It is something the Minister should debate with us so that he can outline the progress made in that regard.</p><p>Senators Bacik, MacSharry, Cullinane and Mullins spoke about Nelson Mandela, a wonderful man and an outstanding statesman of our time, who was dedicated to peace and reconciliation.  Forgiveness is the word used most often in describing him.  I agree that we should have a debate, which Senator Bradford also called for.  I suggest that we amend the Order of Business and have tributes to Nelson Mandela from 9 p.m to 10.30 p.m.</p><p>Senator Quinn proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 14 be taken before No. 1.  I will accede to that request to amend the Order of Business.  I note his points about the Food Provenance Bill and I will seek an update on it.</p><p>Senator Whelan referred to school costs.  He rightly pointed out that the Minister for Education and Skills is requesting schools to start balloting parents on uniform policy.  The move is aimed at giving parents a greater say on the uniform, if any, that a school should have and tackling the high cost of some uniforms.  Schools have been sent a ballot paper on school uniforms to issue to parents.  The survey was developed in consultation with the education partners and asks two main questions: whether parents want the school to have a uniform and, if so, whether they want generic or bespoke uniforms.  Schools are being asked to send the surveys to parents by February to allow boards of management time to consider the results and to make any changes warranted by September.  That is to be welcomed by everyone.</p><p>Senator MacSharry referred to the Local Government Bill.  It is planned to deal with all Stages of the Local Government Bill next week, with Second Stage on Monday and Committee and Report Stages on Wednesday and Friday, respectively.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that the debate on the Bill will not be guillotined and that we will have an adequate debate on it.  We will see what progress we make on it next week.</p><p>Last week Senator O'Brien asked for an update on the pyrite Bill and I indicated that it would not be with us before Christmas.  However, I understand the Cabinet has agreed that the Bill will be published and that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is anxious that it be taken next week in this House.  I will examine that possibility.</p><p>I agree that a great deal of legislation is being packed into a number of weeks which is not desirable, but we have experienced this year after year in the House.  It is not acceptable to have so much legislation being put through the House.  There were weeks when we were begging for legislation and could not get it.  We will do the best we can in progressing the Bills that will be brought before us this week and next week, but I have no intention of rushing any of them through.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke has pointed out in the context of the health service that 12 kidney transplants were carried out in four days last week.  That is testimony to the wonderful consultants we have in the health service.  While we may speak about their salaries and so on from time to time, their excellence in carrying out such transplants and the other work they do needs to be recognised.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the Smithwick tribunal's report and the issue of an integrated Border intelligence unit.  I note his points in this context regarding Canada and the United States.  I assure him that we will have a debate early in the new year on the report.</p><p>Senators Aideen Hayden and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the report on direct provision by the Irish Refugee Council.  We had a debate on this issue previously.  I agree that we should probably debate the report early in the new year.</p><p>Senator David Cullinane referred to top-up payments.  The Government is concerned about this issue and will take action in this regard.  I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendment to the Order of Business on the Irish Language Commissioner.  I addressed the issue on the Order of Business last week.</p><p>Senators Michael Mullins and Terry Brennan commented on the ESB dispute.  The settlement is unqualified good news at this critical juncture in the country's economic recovery and at this critical time of the year.  The unions and management deserve credit for ending the uncertainty that threatened disproportionate damage to the country's best interests.  I compliment everyone involved, in particular the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>Senator Paul Bradford called for a debate on housing and urged caution on the issue of house prices.  I have requested that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government come to the House, but she will not appear prior to Christmas.  I hope she will be present early in the new year.</p><p>I accept Senator Feargal Quinn's amendment to the Order of Business.  Tributes to Nelson Mandela will be taken between 9 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., with all Senators having five minutes to contribute.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State has not read the article but I hope that it has been brought to his attention.  The article was written by Mr. Colm McCarthy whom Senators will know as the author of an bord snip.  He raised problems of a fundamental and worrying nature about the actual and eventual cost to the taxpayer and consumer, perhaps due to the delay in rolling out the new system or 12-year period between the commencement date and eventual takeover of the system.</p><p>  He also raised matters such as the hiring of 300 staff to date by the new authority.  I want to pose some questions on the matter.  Have staff transferred from local authorities?  Are they new staff?  If it is new staff then nobody will have left the local authorities - not that we seek that they do so. </p><p>  He spoke about the intervention by the Labour Relations Commission, talks, dialogues and some sort of forum - that is presumably not mentioned in the legislation - to put in place all of the structures.  He also spoke of the 12-year delay before the new system is up and running.  All of those issues concern taxpayers and the eventual consumer will foot the bill.  Perhaps I shall have an opportunity to go into greater detail with the Minister of State when we discuss later sections.  As far as I was concerned, the article was a bolt from the blue.</p><p>  I concede, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that I missed the Second Stage debate last week so have not had an opportunity to contribute.  Mr. McCarthy has raised some issues that I am sure the Minister of State shall attempt to address.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000014#R01000"><p>If it is helpful, the points made by the Senator are subject to the implementation of the Act.  In other words, things that happen as a result of the implementation of the Act are different costs to the costs covered in the section, which are purely the administrative costs of the Act.</p><p>The Senator has raised a very important question.  Let us compare what happened with the HSE and the health boards with what is happening with local authorities and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  They are two entirely different procedures.  Overnight everybody shifted from the health boards into the HSE but in this case there are service level agreements. </p> <p>Each individual local authority will sign a service level agreement with Uisce &Eacute;ireann as to what functions it will carry out.  The local authority will carry out those functions and will be paid for carrying out those functions but will be under the direction of the Minister and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  In other words, the staff will continue to be employed by the local authority.  If one works with a local authority one may have the option to transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  Workers may remain with their local authority for at least 12 years should they so wish.  At the end of that period, if workers were still doing that work, they would transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>There are more than 4,000 people working in the water services nationally.  It is important that the transition between all 34 local authorities to the unitary one body, Irish Water, will happen over a period, that it will be phased and paced and not cause disruption and that there will be no loss of corporate memory in respect of all the issues that workers would have and may not wish to transfer.  There are all sorts of issues there.  The key, as pointed out, is that there is an independent chairman who meets the local authority side, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, the Department and the unions to iron out issues that arise from time to time.  This will ensure as smooth as possible a transition of the services and of the people who want to transfer and that there is a period within which everything beds down in a cost effective way, because this is about getting new synergies between Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the local authorities.  Not everybody who works in the water services works 100% of their time with water, but many do.  If one is working with a local authority today and decides to retire in five years' time, what happens to one's job.

It is an important point but I do not think it is in this part of the Bill as it deals with the administration.  I read the article by Colm McCarthy on the transfer of assets and liabilities to ensure that everything is written down on paper.  What the Minister of State has said is correct, namely, that one does not want to find at the end of, say, five years that good assets have been handed over for less than they are worth and charged more for rusty or lead pipes that have to be replaced.  It is also important that everything is written down and spelled out in the plan when agreed to ensure there are no hidden costs.</p></speech>

Perhaps he would outline what kind of expenses are envisaged even if it is a general clause?  What expenses will the Minister incur in the administration of an Act, such as this, how much will they be and what would they be expected to be?</p><p>On the broader issue, is it true that the real issue is that the Government had intended to transfer all the workers from the local authority to Uisce &Eacute;ireann but SIPTU put its foot down because it was not happy.  Perhaps the Minister of State would outline the position at some stage when going through our discussions.  My understanding is the unions were not happy with the Government's plans, they have issues and are concerned that privatisation could happen down the road, due to an understanding here.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned retirements and staff being replaced.  In Uisce &Eacute;ireann there are concerns that this will not happen and that one will really see a reduction in the workforce dealing with water services as time passes.  Will the Minister of State touch on this issue?</p></speech>

Section 3 relates to expenses.  Unfortunately, I am mystified as to why some of the amendments we have tabled, including those of Sinn F&eacute;in, have been ruled out of order.  I do not understand why because they do not all pertain to an expense on the Exchequer.  Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach might clarify the position through his office, particularly on amendment No. 5.  We can deal with each amendment as it arises.  Perhaps this is the wrong time to raise the matter.</p><p>With regard to section 3 and the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the legislation, there is no regulatory impact analysis accompanying the Bill.  Particularly given that we are establishing significant State infrastructure that will be responsible for a public resource, water, there should be a financial impact analysis.  It would be fair for the Oireachtas to expect a cost-benefit analysis, at the very least, of the cost of the establishment of Irish Water to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which is funded by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the matter of the 12 year contracts given to employees.  What is the position on redundancy payments where an official of a local authority is transferring to Irish Water?  I asked about this on Second Stage.  Will a redundancy payment be made to the transferee, although his or her employment is continuing in the public service in Irish Water?  If there is a redundancy cost, who will bear it?  Will it be the local authority, Irish Water, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or NewERA?  What is the overall cost?  I am sure a breakdown has been provided.</p><p>Substantial costs will arise nationwide under the legislation because Irish Water will be responsible not only for the water we drink but also wastewater.  There are thousands of unfinished housing estates throughout the country.  If a local authority has its homework done by transfer day, 1 January, it can transfer the assets to Irish Water.  If it does not have that work done, what will Irish Water stipulate in order to bring wastewater units up to a standard whereby they can be transferred to it?  Who will bear that cost?  If local councillors across the country are being asked to find that money in their budgets, they will simply find it undoable.  In a local electoral area in Inishowen in my county there are 55 unfinished housing estates and the biggest problem is wastewater treatment.</p><p>The problem of transfer day is very unfair.  Local authorities will not be in a position to have all of their infrastructure ready for that day.  That is why one of my amendments proposed a transition period.  That would be sensible, but the amendment was ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach.  </p><p>Fundamental questions arise in regard to the cost involved.  As Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, we are setting up what I regard as a quango, potentially the biggest the State has ever seen.  Under that quango, we are leaving open the possibility of privatising public drinking water supplies in the years ahead.  It may not occur under the Government's watch, but a future Government might decide it was economically viable to sell Irish Water, thus privatising public drinking water supplies.  If that is to be the case, we are telling everyone to purchase the water he or she uses in his or her home as he or she would purchase it in a supermarket.</p> <p> The other issue to which there is no reference in any accompanying documentation is the cost to the Irish household.  It is written in the Bill that this will be at the discretion of the Minister or the Government, but there must be a debate on that as part of Committee Stage as well.  It is not relevant to this section but it is something that will have an impact on every family across the country.</p></speech>

My amendment, amendment No. 24, was ruled out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.  My intention is to find out what we have failed to find out, as Senator Norris asked on the last occasion - that is, the amount of the "generous" free allowance.  That will be an expense.  I attempted to quantify it in terms of a number of litres, but the amendment was ruled out of order because it involved a cost to the Exchequer.</p><p>There will be a cost to the Exchequer if the Minister of State implements the programme for Government commitment to the generous free allowance, of which we still have not been told.  Neither do we know how much the water charges will be.  It is time for the Department to come out with details of the expenses.  What will the Department itself bear, how much will be the free allowance to users and what will be the cost of the water?  Most of the other amendments seem to have been ruled out on fairly contestable grounds, but the Minister of State should tell us the full cost of this and who will bear it.</p></speech>

He or she will not become redundant to go there.  The person will transfer in and the question of redundancy will not arise.  There are no plans for any redundancies of local authority staff.

If the roads and the lighting are not up to scratch and if it is not finished, then the public could not take over such a liability.  If there are issues, however, I presume they would have to be resolved.  In other words, if there is an estate that has inferior, insufficient or inadequate water infrastructure, that is a problem for that estate to resolve.</p><p>I am aware that there is an official list of unfinished estates, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is dealing with that.  As far as I am aware, they are in the process of transition to finished estates which can then be taken over.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is bringing into public ownership a transparently listed number of estates in the context of services.</p><p>On the question of the free allowance, the programme for Government provides for a free allowance for every household.  The approach to providing the free allowance - I acknowledge the questions from the Senators present -  and the level of such allowance is being considered by an interdepartmental group being chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will be bringing proposals to Government on this matter shortly.  In other words, all of the issues are being debated, they will be finalised fairly soon, and when they are there will be transparency and a full debate.  There is no reason for concern that it would not be discussed fully here in the House.</p><p>Senator Keane asked about assets.  At the time, I understood her to be speaking about staff, not assets.  When staff transfer, the 12-year rule applies in that there are up to 12 years in that arrangement.  While the Bill provides for the transfer of all assets, there is a commencement date on which they will transfer.</p> <p>This means that the assets will not transfer simultaneously or in any given year but will be subject to due process.</p><p>The book value of the assets is deemed to be approximately &euro;11 billion, a significant sum.  Each asset and the liabilities attaching to it must be processed individually.  Nothing is being rushed and the legislation provides for transfers to proceed when appropriate.  Clearly, however, the quicker the process proceeds, the better.  If there are differences of opinion or issues arise in respect of certain assets, these must first be resolved before the transfer proceeds.  For example, in the case of an asset which has a community facility such as a football field attached to it, decisions must be taken on who will take over the facility, access and so forth.  Each local authority will have different issues to address.</p></speech>

People living in the estates on the list did not have to pay the household charge because they were living in a development that did not meet certain criteria.

This was considered necessary to enable Irish Water to put in place superannuation schemes pending the enactment of this Bill.

Property vesting day could therefore be any day in the future, but as the Minister will have to approve the day by order, it will ultimately be at his or her discretion to decide when to take over a housing estate or water services infrastructure.  My difficulty with this aspect of the Bill, in respect of which I have tabled an amendment, is that the transfer day will be 1 January if the legislation is passed before Christmas.  Local authority members and officials have expressed particular concern about unfinished estates and sewerage infrastructure.  If, for example, an unfinished estate has broken sewerage infrastructure it might cause contamination to the surrounding town and the council will have to find the money for repairs.  What standard will these estates have to meet before the transfer takes place?  This could cost councils billions of euro.  I understand there are at least 2,500 unfinished estates.</p></speech>

Irish Water will have no responsibility for the estates themselves.</p></speech>

We are assured that this is not the Government's policy and there is no intention to proceed in that manner, but the ducks certainly are being lined up for potential future action, to which we are generally opposed.  On the contrary, we are firmly of the view that water is an important public utility and, as such, should remain in public ownership.</p><p>  We are proposing in this amendment that a service level agreement, SLA, of no fewer than 30 years should be enacted, that period being reflective of the timeframe allocated for public private partnerships under local authority agreements and so on.  Twelve years might seem like a long time at this point, but we cannot know whether a future Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or another party might be in favour of the privatisation of such utilities.  A service level agreement of 30 years or more will kick that argument out of the ball park, as the Yanks would say.  If the Government really does have no intention of privatising our water utility, then the Minister of State should agree to this amendment.  Doing so will make no difference to what the Government is proposing to do and is in line with the Minister of State's assurance that he is favour of keeping the water asset under State ownership.  The proposal would strengthen that connection.</p><p>  I heard on the radio as I travelled to Dublin yesterday that the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will proceed if the right price is secured.  People are fearful that our water asset, too, could end up in private hands, which would have major downsides.  The proposal to install water meters and charge households for water was dreamt up by the previous Administration but is being brought to life by this Government.  We are asking the Minister of State to take on board our suggestion that SLAs be extended to 30 years so that the argument for privatisation can be put to bed, once and for all.  A contract of that duration would send a signal to private corporations around the world which might be interested in buying up our water utility that they should back off.</p></speech>

He referred in his contribution to public concerns regarding privatisation.  In the case of the ongoing difficulties at ESB, the public concern was not whether that company was publicly or privately owned but whether the service would be provided.  The outcome of this legislation and of the Government's deliberations must be the provision of a top-class water service, devoid of leaks and other difficulties which prevail throughout the country at present, at a fair and reasonable cost to consumers.  That is the objective to which we all aspire.</p><p>  The suggestion that the service legal agreement should extend beyond what is an already excessive provision of 12 years does what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh wishes it would in that it will make the legislation quite irrelevant.  We must ensure that taxpayers, who foot all of the State's bills, get value for money and a top-quality product at a reasonable price.  The Senator mentioned that there is a Fine Gael view and a Fianna F&aacute;il view on this issue.  His own party is in power in another part of this island but I do not see the Northern Ireland version of Sinn F&eacute;in doing much to dismantle whatever privatised services are in operation in the North.  Every party in government soon discovers the reality-----</p></speech>

There is an onus on every party in government to do its best for taxpayers.  My concern is that the legislation as currently construed, with the provision for a 12-year service level agreement, is effectively saying that there will be no great change and that the dawn of a new day, with a new authority acting efficiently and effectively in providing such an essential service to the public at a fair, appropriate and reasonable price, might not come about quickly enough.</p> <p>I presume the Minister of State will not accept the amendment but, in responding to it, he might indicate why he feels the 12-year limit should be in place, and he might refer to the forum he mentioned in passing earlier.  I apologise for being absent last week, but I would like to learn more about the forum.  There is a new board in the form of Irish Water as well as local authorities and the Government, but, with classic partnership precision, a new forum has emerged.  Who or what is the forum?  Who sits on it and who appointed these people?  The Minister is rightly taking the law into his hands to set policy.  The forum seems to have become a co-Minister in this legislation, deciding when staff may be transferred and whether a service level agreement has been reached.  For all the faults of Members, we have the opportunity to debate this in public and put the situation on record before the taxpayers of the country, and to put on record what should be the situation.</p></speech>

Who has responsibility for it?  There will be a service level agreement between Irish Water and the local authority, which will have to repair burst pipes, etc.  If there was a fatality, which often happens in situations like this, will Irish Water or the local authority address this?  These are important logistical issues.</p></speech>

I have two issues with the Bill which are relevant to this amendment.  The first is the removal of powers from local government in respect of water services.  I served on a local authority for seven years and I heard many calls from councillors of all parties and none for more powers to be given to local government.  We had a discussion during the Seanad referendum campaign about whether we had a robust system of local government and the need for a debate on the powers and function of local government in the context of empowering local authorities rather than taking powers from them.  Previous Governments took powers from local authorities in respect of waste management-----</p></speech>

If we are not allowed to make these general points in the context of these amendments, it will be a bad day for local democracy and for the Seanad, but the Leas-Chathaoirleach is entitled to his opinion.  I do not agree with taking powers from local government.</p><p>The second issue I have relates to the potential privatisation of Irish Water, which is also relevant to the amendment.  We should not go down this road.  The company must remain in public ownership.  I agree water is a scarce resource, which we need to protect and invest in, but I am concerned that we would be going down the slippery slope of privatising water services.  We have seen this many times before with local authority services where the first thing done to privatise a service is to transfer responsibility for it from local government to a quango or board before eventually privatising it.  It may not happen during the Government's term but it could happen down the road.</p> <p>The amendment seeks to ensure the service level agreement will be no shorter than 30 years, not the 12 years proposed by the Government.</p><p>These are the two core points I intended to make.  The first relates to taking powers from local government for water services and giving them to Irish Water.  The second relates to the potential privatisation of water services down the road.</p></speech>

I am happy to provide responses that are not allowed to be given now and will get the answers to Senators before Thursday, if I can.  This is all about transparency and accountability and I am happy for it to be that way.  We must work within the rules as we go through the sections.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised a question regarding the Irish Water consultative group, which comprises the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, local authority managers and local authority trade unions.  It is chaired by an independent chairman from the Labour Relations Commission.  The group agreed that the first service level agreements to be put in place between Irish Water and each local authority should be of 12 years duration, with two interim reviews after two and five years.  The Bill, as published, does not specify a duration and the issue is still being considered by the Department in consultation with stakeholders.  Amendments may be submitted on Report Stage.  However, the duration of the agreements proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in is not considered appropriate, having regard to the agreement of the consultative group.  Outside of this, there is room for further service level agreements should they be required and agreed after 12 years.  The process is entirely flexible in that respect.</p><p>I do not wish to break the rules, but there is a new amendment No. 78.  Although it does not mention it, it clarifies absolutely that there cannot be privatisation.  When we get to the amendment, I will be happy to speak to the issue.  The amendment has been added on Committee Stage as we consider, like everybody in the House, Irish Water cannot ever be privatised.  This will copper-fasten the position in legislation and I hope Senators will be able to support the amendment.</p></speech>

In the same way, the process could be longer.  There are 34 local authorities which are massively different in terms of size of population, infrastructure, etc.  We are dealing with major cities and small counties, with different issues in each of them.</p></speech>

For example, there will have been a general election by the time the second review occurs and a future Government might bring pressure to bear on the parties to the service level agreement to shorten it and, therefore, speed up the potential privatisation and transfer to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  That might happen if a future Government was to be more gung-ho on the issue of privatisation and the consultative group could be asked to consider shortening the length of time given for service level agreements.  If a potential buyer for Uisce &Eacute;ireann could be found, the process could take less than 12 years.</p></speech>

Of course, service level agreements between Irish Water and local authorities can vary.  It would, however, be by consent.  For example, an adjoining local authority, such as a city, should be able to bring new synergies to a neighbouring local authority which might be predominantly rural.  If this agreement was not in place, then the opportunity for new efficiencies in the provision of services for those communities which might not have the capacity to provide that infrastructure from their own resources might not arise.</p></speech>

We also agree that it is important that if a large municipal centre in one local authority area can service a broader hinterland in another, then synergies between the two local authorities should be encouraged.  That can be achieved through the service level agreement being in place.</p><p>I note, however, the Minister has not ruled out the potential that within the 12-year period, after agreement between all parties, the assets could be fully transferred to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

I have great concerns about how transfer day is set out in the legislation, prescribed as 1 January.  I presume water supply systems in unfinished housing estates or town sewerage infrastructure which does not meet EU environmental standards will also be transferred to Irish Water on transfer day.  While I know the Minister of State does not have responsibility for unfinished housing estates, this issue is a timebomb.</p> <p>It will be an issue come the next local elections in 2014.  It will be very difficult for councillors, Government or Opposition.  Through no fault of their own, they will be left to carry the can, with residents coming to them who have not made their applications to local authorities to take over their housing estates before transfer day on 1 January.  Thereafter, Irish Water will set the standards with which wastewater treatment systems will have to comply before it takes them over.  The local authorities and housing estate residents will have to fund the cost of bringing the systems up to standard.  These are people who have bought houses, have high mortgages and young families and live in estates all over the country, including commuter estates outside Dublin.  They and the local authorities will not have the finance to do this work.</p><p>I heard what the Minister of State said, that another Department was responsible for bringing all parts of unfinished estates up to standard, but no fund is available to do the work required.  While the local authorities have drawn up a list of all the estates and the work that must be done, they do not have the money to meet the costs associated with it.  I am talking about estates where developers have gone bust.  Let us remember that the councils granted planning permission for these estates and were to obtain bonds from developers.  Some of these bonds may be available to carry out some of the works, but in the vast majority of estates the bond would not cover a fraction of the works to be carried out.</p><p>On transfer day, according to the capital requirements for bringing public service infrastructure - wastewater and public drinking water - up to standard, it would cost &euro;600 million annually in the next ten to 15 years to fund all of the work.  It gives me little hope when I see a 32% reduction in the water infrastructure and capital investment programme during the 2011 to 2014 period.  I acknowledge that the Bill provides for Irish Water to raise capital of &euro;2 million in the Irish markets, but that will not fund what is required.  That &euro;600 million annually would be spent on public infrastructure to meet EU legislation, but that would not cover the 2,500-plus private estates throughout the country.  Some of it involves roads and footpaths, but wastewater treatment systems account for the vast majority of the big, difficult issues.</p><p>How will local authorities fund themselves to meet the standard Irish Water will set after transfer day?  Perhaps the Minister of State might outline what the standard will be because it is not set out in the Bill.  What standard will Irish Water set for local authorities for private wastewater infrastructure that will be transferred after transfer day?  What will be the cost of bringing all these pieces of infrastructure up to standard?  From where the money will come?  We can say another Department will pay for it and that is fine, but under this legislation, the local authorities will be duty bound and people will be left high and dry.  They will be caught between a rock and a hard place.  At least the local authority is currently responsible for wastewater and public drinking water, but these functions will be transferred to a semi-State body, Irish Water.  I can imagine housing estate owners in Connemara, County Louth, County Monaghan or Donegal Donegal ringing a call centre in Cork to try to negotiate the taking over of their wastewater treatment systems.  It will be much more difficult because we are centralising the system and that will leave things much more difficult and we are not sure what the standard of compliance will be.</p></speech>

Maidir leis an m&eacute;id ad&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill, I will try to clarify the issue.  Private infrastructure is not mentioned in the Bill.  It is only infrastructure for which a local authority is accountable - in other words, water or sewerage infrastructure that a local authority is in charge of or owns.  Anything outside of this is not the responsibility of the local authority or Irish Water.  Unfinished estates are those on a list deemed to be unfinished according to particular criteria, some of which Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh enumerated.  I believe there are three separate lists, but I do not have the details with me.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, is dealing with these.  If it is helpful I will get a list of them before Thursday and perhaps Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh can help me by providing me with a list of particular estates in his constituency and I will be happy to get an answer on them.  I want to be as transparent as I can with my answers.  There is no issue about Johnny Murphy in an estate that has not been taken in charge ringing Irish Water about a matter.  The service level agreement is between the local authority and Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>Maidir le na ceisteanna &oacute;n Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh-----</p></speech>

If an industry wanted to move to Waterford it would be important for it to know whether a commitment had been given.  In some cases, funds might have been given to the local authority to provide special services to a particular industry.  No matter where the industry is located, it is important that service continues and due regard is taken of the development plan.  If a plan includes new infrastructure then it will form part of the Irish Water service plan.  In bringing about such a plan, companies will talk to local authorities, discussing what they wants done, what the local authorities have committed to doing and so on.  Irish Water intends to have better joined-up thinking.  I hope my explanation has proved helpful.</p></speech>

There is no concern about a lack of due and proper consultation or a capacity for people to make their views known, whether they are elected officials or councillors.  Negotiation is part of the process of preparing a strategic plan for an area.  It is critical that a plan is compiled through consultation.  I will go into greater detail on the matter when we reach section 26.  I hope I have been helpful.</p></speech>

Where it states that the Minister &quot;may&quot; do something, very often that refers to financial decisions.  The section states:<blockquote>The Minister may, on or after the transfer day, from time to time, by order, appoint a day (in this Part referred to as a &ldquo;property vesting day&rdquo;) for the purposes of this section.</blockquote>I want to replace the word &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall.&quot;  Using &quot;may&quot; will allow competing financial demands to be considered, leaving critical water infrastructure in limbo and in the hands of either a local authority, housing estate owners or house owners on housing estates.  The provision could leave a local authority exposed.  If an organisation such as Irish Water raises moneys on the international market and confidence is placed in the authority, then it is right that the authority fully fund upgrade works on public infrastructure in order to provide water or wastewater facilities.  We have already referred to wastewater facilities.  We want wastewater treatment systems on housing estates to be taken over as well.</p><p>  I want the section amended in order to read that the Minister &quot;shall&quot; appoint a day.  Using the term means the Minister's discretion remains intact.  It does not just refer to the Minister of State.  Any Minister in any government, on any given day, will be left with a ministerial decision about whether a piece of infrastructure will be transferred.  Use of the word &quot;may&quot; implies uncertainty and I propose that it be replaced by &quot;shall&quot; so that the Minister is duty bound to transfer the pieces of infrastructure to Irish Water.</p></speech>

I understand, having read the legislation, that there will be a transfer date.  Senator Cummins mentioned  planning permission and development plans approved by the local authority, and a lot of reference has been made to sewerage treatment plants on private estates, etc.  What happens when estates are taken over by local authorities?  As we are all aware, that requires a process.  A local authority cannot just say &quot;Today we will take this over.&quot;  It must undertake inspections, surveys, etc.  Therefore, the legislation must contain a provision whereby Irish Water takes the function over from local authorities.  Such a provision is already in place and the measure will be operated on an ongoing basis, but I seek clarity on the matter.  It will cause concern.  A housing estate, through no fault of residents, may not be ready on the transfer day for whatever reason.  For example, a developer may have gone west, or no one might be in a position to offer the estate to a local authority.  We must remember that an estate must be legally offered to the local authority.  That is the law as it currently stands.  A local authority must be in a position to take charge of an estate and when it reaches certain standards Irish Water will <i>de facto</i> take it over from then onwards.  The matter needs to be clarified.</p> <p>I do not believe residents living in these areas should be unduly concerned.  My understanding of the legislation is that there is no ambiguity, but I would like the Minister of State to spell this out.</p></speech>

This is about transferring them but at the right time.  Therefore, changing the word in the section would make no difference.  The intention is to take them over, but the conditions must be right.  We are talking about the assets and liabilities and they have to be clear legally on what they are doing.  The other point, separate from what the Senator mentioned, is that there may be assets which have a public park or something else attached to them.  We must have due process.</p></speech>

It relates to the transfer of property from councils or water service authorities to Irish Water and proposes that a comprehensive table of all moneys or infrastructure transferred to and expended by Irish Water for the purposes of the subsection be published annually providing a county by county breakdown.  This would be appropriate from the point of view of transparency point of view.  Perhaps the amendment might need to be tuned.  There are serious questions about Irish Water being beyond scrutiny through freedom of information requests in its establishment phase.  There is a requirement for local authorities, local authority members and the general public to be absolutely clear and aware of what is being transferred to Irish Water in order that Joe Murphy living on Main Street, Clonmel, Gortahork or Skibbereen can log on to a website annually at the end of the year to see what has been transferred and, therefore, what has been left within the local authority.  Presumably after transfer day there will be other stuff to be transferred and we need transparency in that regard.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is willing to accept the amendment, but as this is public infrastructure owned by the taxpayer which is being transferred, I do not see any issue in accepting it.  I hope he will accept it, as it would provide for some level of scrutiny and clarity to allow us, as public representatives in the Oireachtas or any council chamber across the country, to scrutinise, question and hold to account in some way the new entity to be known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann or Irish Water.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is feasible to put a monetary value on these assets.  In regard to the liabilities Irish Water will assume from local authorities, when will we know the extent of these liabilities and the value of the assets being transferred?

We all appear to be in agreement that we want to ensure transparency in the transfer of assets and moneys and an amendment of this type would, I hope, help that process.

An asset will be transferred by ministerial order and it will not be done quietly and silently.  An order will be signed which anybody will be able to find and look at.  What will be transferred will be visible and there will be nothing hidden about it.  On the question of where the money will be spent - the point the Senator makes about accountability - the planning regulations provide that development contributions may be transferred, but they must be used in the local authority area in which they were collected.  I presume local authority members will be more than anxious to make sure there is transparency.  At the heart of the issue is the contact between Irish Water, local authority members, councils and the public in a transparent process.  There is nothing to worry about in this regard because the transfer of assets requires a ministerial order and everybody will be able to see and examine what is in it.</p></speech>

Obviously, the development charges are being transferred.  That is the reason I want a county by county breakdown.  A ministerial order is required for the transfer.  For the ordinary punter on the street, a ministerial order could be something from Mars.  The information should be published annually and made available to the media.  Some 50 or 150 signed ministerial orders which are buried somewhere may be available to those of us who can find them, but they are not readily available to the ordinary punter on the street.  A comprehensive tabular statement to be published annually on Irish Water's website or that of the Department is what I am seeking.</p></speech>

The subsection provides that water service development contributions collected by a local authority and transferred to Irish Water can only be expended within the functional area of that authority.  While I understand the rationale behind the amendment, it is unnecessary as the company will only be permitted to spend the money in that functional area.  The best judge of this is the Senator because he will make sure that that is what will happen.  That is why it is important to have that level of contact with Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann.

This section is overriding the democratic mandate that has been given to local councillors.  We were suggesting that, before the transfer of assets, there would be a vote by councillors.  We were told there would be an enduring partnership and that Uisce &Eacute;ireann would be working with local authorities, etc., but we feel the transfer will seriously diminish the role of the elected councils and all but eliminate democratic accountability.</p><p>Another issue raised about Uisce &Eacute;ireann is that since it is a semi-state organisation, there will not be the desired input from elected representatives and accountability will be lost.  Perhaps on Report Stage, the Minister of State will need to consider an amendment of some kind to address this.  We might table something similar, if it is ruled in order, on the democratic accountability of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Over recent months, we have seen a move away from the way democracy has been conducted because of the proposed abolition of town councils, the reduction in the powers of councillors and the loss of councillor input into local authority investment programmes for critical infrastructure for wastewater and public drinking water.  This is a retrograde step.  It is certainly a step to remove democratic accountability in respect of the services in question.  Local authority members have worked diligently over the years to try to ensure they held local officials to account.  They are currently obliged to do so under the Local Government Act 2001 in regard to public drinking water and wastewater.  Unfortunately, if this legislation is passed, councillors will lose their powers after the transfer.  We are removing powers from councillors, whether we like it or not.  This is the wrong approach.</p><p>Someone with a burst water main in a very remote rural area will now have to ring a call centre in Cork.  This is just like the position with the ESB in that one must ring the 1850 number in Cork.  It is removing councillors and local input from the equation and creating something that is far removed from the burst pipe in the locality, which is wrong.  We are doing this by transferring all the functions.  One can argue, as was done on Second Stage, that there will be local engineers whom councillors can ring, but effectively what is happening is that all the functions are being transferred to a centralised body.  We are centralising the system and removing democratic accountability and the capacity to hold those who make decisions to account.  While councillors will have a role in regard to the strategic plan, they will have a consultative role as opposed to a decision-making role.  This is where the difficulty lies.  One can bring forward legislation and proclaim one is consulting elected representatives but ultimately the people making the decisions will do so irrespective of consultation because they will have a statutory responsibility and remit to do so if this legislation is passed.  That is wrong.  It is wrong to remove the voice closest to democracy, namely, the voice of the local councillor.  Local councillors can give a voice to the local communities they represent when issues arise concerning public drinking water or wastewater.  This function is now being removed and, unfortunately, there is centralisation of services.  We do not know the ultimate position on the assets of Uisce &Eacute;ireann but we know where it is going - that is, towards the removal of the current role of local authority members and local council officials.  That is the wrong step to take and I fundamentally disagree with it.</p><p>The Minister of State and I have differing views.  He may refer to the EU-IMF and troika deal as much as he wants but ultimately it must be acknowledged there was nothing in the troika deal to establish a semi-state organisation to roll out water services.  There was no negotiation by the Government with the troika to make the point that Ireland wants to keep service provision localised because councillors and local officials have been doing the job in question and can continue to do so.  What is being done is the wrong move.  We are allowing centralisation of the fixing of the water charge because the Commission on Energy Regulation will be setting a charge.  We know what it has done with electricity prices; it has allowed the ESB and other service providers to impose 15% increases year on year, thereby affecting every citizen.  What will be done differently on this occasion?  I submit nothing will be done except to allow the cost of water to increase year on year.  In five or ten years, every politician on both sides of each House and in the local authorities will be criticising Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It will then be too late, however, because the legislation will have been passed and the bills will have to be paid.</p></speech>

This Administration and its opinion pollsters, opinion formers, etc., received a very rude answer to the question relating to the proposed abolition of this House.  It just might find that local authorities are much more popular than imagined.  The decision to abolish the requirement with regard to electing the members of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was an incredibly bad one.  None of the analysis relating to why our economy crashed attributes responsibility to the fact that we had too much democracy.  The crash might, however, have been due to the fact that there was too great a concentration of power.  For example, less than a handful of people made all the vital decisions in September 2008.  It would be a pity if the Government were always to be against both local democracy and participation.  I do not believe it was elected on such a mandate.  As Senators on this side have noted, it is regrettable that the Government appears to have undue faith in quangos and always wants to abolish democratically elected bodies.  This is the fourth successive occasion on which it has engaged in such an abolition.  I am of the view that this is a mistake in the context of the quality of democracy in this country.</p></speech>

I am interested in what Senator Landy said regarding the commitment the Minister of State gave on Second Stage in respect of establishing a link between councils, elected local representatives and Irish Water.  As the Minister of State is aware, I am concerned that removing the service is, in the first instance, a retrograde step.  Leaving that aside, I am willing to listen to what he has to say.  Perhaps he might explain what will be the exact nature of the link.  I would argue that once the service is removed, whatever link remains will not be as strong as that which exists at present under the local government model.  That is my view but I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments on the point made by Senator Landy regarding what has already been taken on board and on how everything will work in practice.</p></speech>

Part of the task of those individuals is to contact all elected members in each area.  Councillors will be able to communicate directly and discuss matters with these people at all times because they will know their names and telephone numbers.  That is critical, particularly as it reflects the position which currently obtains in respect of the local authorities.  I will request an update on this matter before Report Stage.  I gave the commitment to which the Senator refers in good faith and I am assured that what I outlined is happening.</p><p>I do not want to become involved in a political row but I wish to make a particular point.  The cost of water in County Wicklow is double that which obtains in County Kildare.  One of the good things about synergies is that there will not be any significant difference.  On average, the charge for water across the country is &euro;2.52 per 1,000 litres.  In some counties one would be obliged to pay almost double that, while in others the cost would be halved.  The idea is to have equality throughout the country in terms of access to water and the costs involved.  I will not discuss the matter in detail no but the synergies to which I refer will mean that counties which do not currently have the capacity to develop their own infrastructure - because they do not, and never will, have the money to do so - will, through Irish Water, be able to obtain new regional plans.  The latter will be based on river basin districts, etc.</p><p>I am very confident that Irish Water will be extremely successful.  I take the Senator's point on communication.  I served as a county councillor for 27 years and I know what is involved.  It is important that we should maintain and strengthen the link that exists, particularly in current circumstances.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 17, which relates to section 14, has been ruled out of order.  I accept the point the Minister of State made with regard to Senator Landy's contribution and the question I asked about consultation with local councillors.  There is a difference between consultation and having control over decision making, a matter to which I referred earlier.  It is good that there will be consultation with local councillors.  The fundamental issue relates to the democratic imperative in respect of the role and responsibilities of local government and control over decision making.  In this instance that control is being taken away from democratically elected councillors and given to Irish Water.  We are discussing a vitally important public utility, namely, water, and I am of the view that what is being done is a retrograde step.  While I welcome the Minister of State's clarification in respect of consultation, etc., my point did not relate to that.  It was a more fundamental point in respect of decision making and the powers local councillors should have in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has clarified that local authorities and Irish Water will not have a redundancy liability.  For example, in the case of a person who has been working for a county council for 15 years and enters into a 12 year sabbatical or service level agreement with Irish Water, there will be no redundancy liability at the point at which he or she departs from the local authority and any such redundancy liability will accumulate over the years and be paid at the end.  I seek clarification on this point.  I am not sure if I am making it clearly.</p><p>Senators have been discussing the transfer of staff from local authorities to Irish Water.  I would prefer if these staff remained working in the water services or were given alternative employment, on the same terms, in the local authority sector.  This would result in new jobs being created as a result of the establishment of Irish Water.  Qualified individuals who are currently unemployed could then apply for the jobs and Irish people would work in Irish Water.  I am not sure if only local authority staff will be transferred into roles of responsibility in Irish Water.  While local authority staff have the experience required for the new positions, other individuals who are unemployed may also have the relevant experience and qualifications.  Will all the positions be publicly advertised or will a specified number of them be ring-fenced for local authority staff to be transferred to Irish Water? </p><p>On the salary cap for staff of Irish Water, I understand the legislation provides, albeit in a different section-----</p></speech>

On security of tenure, local authority employees are permanent staff.  Transfers of local authority employees to Irish Water under a service level agreement will take place by agreement, in other words, the employees will continue to be employed by the local authority.  However, they may also opt to transfer to Irish Water as employees of the new organisation.</p><p>On pensions, the local authority retains liabilities for the service the employee has accumulated while an employee of the local authority.  If a person works for a local authority for the next ten years, the local authority will be liable for the pension accrued during that period.  Moreover, employees who transfer under a service level agreement remain employees of the local authority.  However, local authority staff who move to Irish Water as employees of the new organisation will be in a different scenario in respect of pension entitlements.  I do not expect the terms of those pensions to be less favourable than those they currently enjoy as staff would have no reason to transfer to Irish Water if it would leave them worse off.  I understand the issue of pensions is addressed in subsequent sections. </p><p>Irish Water will be responsible for health and safety, which is included in the service level agreements. </p></speech>

In page 11, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:
&ldquo;Definition in this Part
16. In this section &ldquo;approved water charges plan&rdquo; means a water charges plan approved under subsection (9) of section 17.&rdquo;.This section provides that Irish Water shall charge each customer in receipt of water services.  The charge to be levied under this section shall be calculated in accordance with the water charges plan, as set out in section 17.  Subsection (4) provides that where a charge remains unpaid, it shall be recoverable by Irish Water as a contract debt.  Subsection (7) provides powers for Irish Water to either reduce or disconnect the supply of a customer who has not paid a water bill.  However, subsection (8) provides that a household cannot be disconnected for non-payment of a bill.  Disconnections would, therefore, only occur in respect of non-domestic premises.</p></speech>

In such circumstances, who will be responsible for the payment of the bill?  Who will pick up the tab if people cannot be disconnected for non-payment?  A delicate balance must be struck on this matter.  It is critical that water supplies are not cut off because we need water to live and for good health.</p> <p>We need water to live and for good health, but we are about to introduce water charges, which means that people will have to pay.  If we all to decide not to pay our bills in the knowledge we will not be cut off, what is the incentive to make us pay and how will the Government and, more to the point, Irish Water manage this?</p></speech>

The same issue arises in this amendment.  What is the approved water charges plan?  We do not know how much water will cost or the amount of the free allowance that will be granted.  I am not trying to make a wrong analogy, but a used car salesman has to tell his customers how much he is charging.  The Government has been far too coy.  It is time to put the numbers on the table in order that we can approve the water charges plan.  In 2010 there were discussions with the Siemens company on its offer to install meters for nothing.  More than three years later the dance of the seven veils has gone on for long enough.  There is too much concealment and hugger mugger.  Put the numbers on the table and let the people make their decision.</p></speech>

Barrett that we have been dancing around the issue for a long time.  Will the plan include a standing charge for meters or providing the service?  The ESB and other utility providers charge between &euro;30 and &euro;35 before a customer consumes a single unit.  That is an absolute disgrace and I hope a similar standing charge is not included in the water charges plan.  Even if one is not using gas or electricity, the bill will be &euro;30 or &euro;35 per month because of the standing charge.  I hope that will not apply to Irish Water.  I have no problem with people paying for water, but it will be difficult enough for them to pay for the water they use without also facing a standing charge.  If meters can be purchased, whether for &euro;50 or &euro;400, people should be allowed to buy them rather than pay a standing charge in every bill.</p></speech>

A plan will be put forward to the commission which will decide whether the charges set out in the plan are acceptable.  I presume Irish Water will bring forward the plan for charges.  I acknowledge the issue has not yet been addressed in the legislation and that amendments are being brought forward in this regard, but where does the plan go in the event of it being rejected by the commission?</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware that my party opposes the Bill partly on the basis of the proposal to introduce charges.  People will be asking what all of the other taxes they pay are being used for.  They are still coming to terms with the universal social charge, the purpose of which was never properly explained.  That charge had a big impact on people's pay, but the rationale behind it remains unclear.  The property tax or family home charge - whatever one wants to call it - was also imposed on them with the explanation that it would pay for local services.  Now they are being asked to pay for water separately.  We will end up with a situation where people will pay separately for waste collection, school books and transport, and household charges and property taxes for local services, while also paying water charges.  At the same time, they are paying more than ever before in direct taxes, whether through PAYE or the universal social charge.  They are concerned and frustrated about how they will be facing annual bills that will impact on their quality of life.  It is not so much a question of whether people are going to be asked to pay a standing charge for the meter which will only compound the anger but whether this makes sense in the context of the property tax.  Perhaps the Minister of State might dispel people's confusion about why we are paying all of these charges separately.  What is the point of a property tax if we are paying separately for everything else?</p><p>How will the Government protect low income families from the burden of these charges?  Leaving aside my opposition to water charges, I am concerned about how they will impact on people.  I am sure these concerns have also been raised with Government Members.  What measures will the Government put in place to ensure people do not end up in water poverty, as already happens in the case of fuel?  I think the Minister of State addressed this question on Second Stage, but perhaps he might clarify the strategy in this regard.  I do not want to delay the debate.  I have made my political point and look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

Like every service, water provision has always been paid for by somebody.  It is not the case that water was provided free of charge for consumers.  It was paid for in one shape or form through taxes.  The Bill brings a new structure to paying for water.  Senator David Cullinane has referred to the long list of charges which people are now paying, including property taxes and refuse charges.  The only part of these islands with an even longer list of charges is Northern Ireland, where his colleagues are in government.  No matter where one is or who is in government, services have to be paid for by somebody.</p></speech>

I am not aware that his party objected to it.  When we conclude our debate on what charges should apply to water and refuse charges and property taxes, the next part of the equation is ensuring value for money.  I have no difficulty with the amendment dealing with the poverty impact.  We often table similar amendments.  However, the other side of the coin is that when we collect taxpayer's money, we must be in a position to assure citizens that their money is being spent wisely and not wasted.</p> <p>We all know there is a huge degree of waste in our water system as it is currently constituted.</p></speech>

I accept that there will be a charge.  Charges have always been paid in one form or another.  We need to ensure that the price set for the charge that consumers will have to pay will be fair and reasonable and that the current faults within the system, which are producing such waste and loss of revenue and income, are tackled and that we have a top-class service.  All of us appreciate that water is a key component of our economic activity.  It must be provided for and it certainly must not be squandered.  We need to ensure that there is a proper balance between the charge and the service, that value for money is provided and that wastage of water, and therefore wastage of money, is extinguished to the maximum extent possible.</p></speech>

I can understand where different political parties are coming from and I will leave it at that, rather than go through the usual points I might make.</p><p>The reality is that our water services cost &euro;1.2 billion annually.  Therefore, it costs &euro;1.2 billion to supply water to every house and business in the country.  Some &euro;200 million of that comes from commercial returns.  In other words, commercial companies pay &euro;200 million, which leaves us to find the remaining &euro;1 billion.  We have to do that by reducing the cost of water if we can.  That is what Irish Water is about.  It is setting up new synergies between local authorities and getting a better deal for the consumer.  </p><p>The is a difference in this respect.  One way a charge could be taken from a worker's pocket is through direct taxation, and the way charges were taken through VAT on houses in previous years was a different way of raising funds.  However, we did not have a sustainable way of funding the State and that is the reason we ran into difficulties with the troika and the reason we could not borrow money to pay for our schools, hospitals and everything else.  That is reason we have ended up where we are.  It is fairer that people who use water pay for it - that the users pay.  That is a fair deal, provided that, in line with the key point that was made, consideration is given to low-income families, the issue of affordability, people with medical problems and so on.  There will be transparency in this regard.  </p><p>Senator Barrett asked that the figures be provided.  That process has already started and the energy regulator has just finished a consultation document, covering a process spanning a month, on how these charges will be made up and what should and should not be in them.  People's views have been sought, and the regulator will advise the Government, having listened to what they had to say, by the end of January.  The ball will then be back in our court.  While the charges will be implemented in the last quarter of next year, the first bill will not issue until January 2015.  There is plenty of time to ensure there is the transparency and accountability that everybody here wants to enable them to query and challenge matters and talk to the regulator.  As Members of the Oireachtas, Senators can ask an Oireachtas committee to request that the regulator come before it to explain matters.  They can also request that Irish Water come before it  to explain matters.  Nothing is being rushed here.  There is plenty of time for accountability and transparency.  </p><p>On the question Senator Cummins raised about the standing charge, all utilities have a standing charge.  It is not to cover the cost of having a meter but to cover the cost of providing the services to the meter.  In orders words, it is to cover the cost of having the infrastructure in place to provide the supply of water to one's house.  Whether one uses it is another matter.  It covers the cost of bringing the water to that point but does not include the cost of water used by a household.  The standing charge would cover the cost of repairing the leaks on the public road and the administration of that process.  It is a separate charge from the consumption charge.</p></speech>

If I say I am against the imposition of standing charges, that is fine and that would be a popular thing to say.  It would make for a great story, but the fact is that even if I do not use water I still have to pay the standing charge because it goes towards covering the cost of the other services that are provided to my meter.</p><p>On Senator Healy Eames's question about those who cannot pay the charge and those who will not pay it, she is right in that everybody has to pay, because if people do not pay for this who will pay for it?  The debt owing will be recovered through a legal process.  I travelled to the United Kingdom and saw how its system works there.  Customers fall into two categories: those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  Those who cannot pay are in a different situation because they do not have the money and they may be in water poverty.  We are dealing with that issue in terms of affordability issues, and that is important.  The free allowance is important as well. </p><p>In the United Kingdom, those who can pay and those who will not pay are quickly identified and the authorities move directly to issue a civil bill for the amount owing.  There is no messing over there.  If one can pay the charge but does not pay it, one will find a charge against one's self.  That is fair.  However, it is not fair to cut off people's supply, because that can give rise to health and other issues.  The practice as followed in the UK is the fairest way to proceed.  </p><p>I do not know if I have answered all the questions, but the general thrust of the Bill is that we do not have a choice about bringing in water charges.  They are in place in every country in the OECD except Ireland.  I find that everywhere I go people pay water charges.  I discovered that China, a good communist country, has water charges in place also.  I am not saying that the Senators will be going there or anything like that.</p></speech>

I have two or three questions on the issue of charges.  The Minister of State mentioned that currently the State spends &euro;1.2 billion on the provision of water services and that when commercial rates are removed a cost of &euro;1 billion remains.  That is considerable sum.  We are already paying &euro;1 billion in our taxes for the provision of water services.  With the bringing in of water charges, on what will this tax sum be spent?  I want to hear the answer to that question.  Is it needed for this project or will that &euro;1 billion be available for something else, in view of the fact that taxes are not being reduced?</p><p>My second question is about the onus the imposition of water charges places on families.  I will be honest with the Minister of State about this.  I believe water charges will be a bigger issue than the property tax for families across Ireland.  With the property tax, people know what is involved.  There is a flat fee once one agrees the value of one's home, but with water charges there will be a running bill.  I know there will be a quota but we still do not have that.  I  am a mother of teenagers and it is difficult enough to monitor water usage in a household with young people.  It takes, on average, based on the evidence given in health promotional material on habit changing, 18 months to change a habit.  Eighteen months could wreck a families' finances in terms of water bills.  I have great difficulty with an open-ended bill and I would prefer a flat charge.  I know some families will get flat charges because they are in areas where meters are not yet in place.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on this?</p> <p>Has the matter been discussed?  A serious information campaign will be required.  The local authorities in Galway carried out a water conservation project.  They concluded that the leakage on the private side of the meter would cost &euro;50,000 in the case of some families.  Therefore, a big information campaign is needed.  I understand that under the Irish Water project, the first fix must be the responsibility of Irish Water.  Who will pay the council for it?  Will it be Irish Water?</p><p>I have asked the Minister of State many questions; one about where the tax bill of &euro;1 billion is going and a second about my preference for a flat charge for families in order that everybody can plan ahead.  One does not want to run people into civil bills, which is awful.  The third question relates to the information campaign and the concerns about leakage on the private side of meters, of which families might be unaware until they receive a monstrous bill.</p></speech>

However, it does come from somewhere.  It comes from what people pay in taxation, which was always the case; therefore, it is not fair to say people do not pay water charges.  The Minister of State did not answer the fundamental question I put to him on the logic of paying a property tax.  Reference has been made to the North, for example, where we have a rate.</p></speech>

That works out at &euro;740 per year.  If that is what we are being asked to impose, the Minister of State should make the information available.  However, such a charge would cause severe concern.  That is the amount I calculate based on the information given by the Minister of State.</p><p>  As Senator David Cullinane said, we are talking about people who are paying their taxes.  The Department seems to think that because it will get the money from the water charge people who pay income tax are some kind of scroungers.  They are taxpayers who support the State and now they could have to pay &euro;740 extra.  It would be useful if we could factor such an amount into the debate.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i> has stated the charge will be &euro;500.  The website, <i>moneyguideireland.com</i>, states it could be &euro;740 based on the numbers from a few years ago.  We might try to raise only &euro;500 million, in which case the charge would be &euro;370, but the lump sums mentioned are serious impositions on taxpayers.  If the Minister of State were to say people would get &euro;740 off their income tax and be charged for water, that would make matters much more efficient, but he is doing both.  The Department has overlooked this.  It wants the money from the water charges, but it will not tell the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to take it easy on the income tax side.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to a loss of water.  It cannot be in houses or one&rsquo;s house would fill up with water and gardens would be flooded.  The loss of water is a matter for the Department.  The pipework in the public domain must be examined.  The attempt to say consumers are wasting water does not hold any water.  However, it has been the line from the Department that this is a new environmentalism or a new puritanism.  It is obvious that the losses occur mostly in areas for which the Department already has control.  The loss of water could not happen in houses.  One&rsquo;s upstairs bathroom would flood and destroy the house if that was where the leaks occurred or the garden would be flooded.  I do not believe the leakages are predominantly or significantly in private property.  If it is the case that we are talking about imposing an extra charge of &euro;740 for water on top of all the taxes imposed recently, let us put the number up-front and be less coy about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000036#OO02300"><p>I wish to make a few important points by way of clarification.  I welcome the comments made by all Senators.  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames has said the first fix is free.  In other words, if there is a leak on the customer&rsquo;s side, it will be fixed for free.</p><p>On the question posed by Senator Sean D. Barrett, the problem is that the leak is not necessarily in one&rsquo;s house, it might be under it or from the pipe underground and not visible.  The figure nationally is that approximately 42% of all water is unaccounted for; in other words, it never goes for human consumption.  Nobody drinks it or uses it because it never gets to the tap.  Members from rural areas will know best of all that if there is metering of water, less water will be used.  There is clear evidence in that regard from this country and other places worldwide.  First, following the installation of the meter, one will find out the location of the leak.  I can supply the Senator with data that show significant wastage or unaccounted for water on the customer side.  Depending on the age of the infrastructure &ndash; much of it is Victorian &ndash; wastage can amount to 30% or 40% on the customer side.  That is backed up by evidence from other jurisdictions also.</p><p>The leaks are not in one&rsquo;s house.  A burst pipe on the road is the easiest leak to fix because everyone sees it.  The vast majority of leaks are much smaller and more pernickety.  I am aware of someone who had a significant leak under the house for more than 30 years.  The foundations had practically been washed away and they never knew it.  The leak was slow but continuous.  The benefit of metering and dealing with unaccounted for water is positive.  The other evidence is very clear.  There is a group water scheme in Ballycroy, County Mayo.  When meters were put in place, the savings in water use amounted to 60% to 70%.  Metering has a significant impact in reducing the wastage of water.</p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett brought some figures to the attention of the House.  Let us deal with the facts as we know them.  Everyone agrees that the cost of providing water is &euro;1.2 billion.  If &euro;200 million comes in from the commercial sector, the State must find &euro;1 billion.  That does not mean that the figure of &euro;1 billion is passed on to the householder.  A key issue is the Government&rsquo;s subvention, namely, what the Government will allocate to fund water services.  Last year it was between &euro;240 million and &euro;250 million.  The level of State subvention is important.  Irish Water has the capacity to borrow money.  In other words, it could borrow money for infrastructural projects.  It would seek to borrow X amount of money and Y would be the return on the income.  It is wrong to say the cost of &euro;1 billion will fall on the householder because it definitely will not.  One will have the borrowings of the company and the capital investment by the State.</p> <p>To say that everybody should pay the same is patently wrong because a 90 year old living alone should not have to pay the same as a neighbour with several family members at home.  People should pay as they go and the constructive way to deal with this is for people to change the way they use water.  This is where the argument must go.  The question of conservation has been missing from this debate tonight.  We must future-proof the water resources in this State.  We must ensure that Dublin has sufficient water to support industry in the region.  Supply in Dublin will match demand by 2020, which means that if we do not augment the water supply in the greater Dublin area we will not be able to sustain employment and ensure high water quality in the region.</p><p>Conservation at household level includes the use of dual-flush cisterns, capturing rainwater and so forth.  There is an awful lot people can do to reduce costs.  The water that is pumped into houses is not the only water available for use.  There are significant ways for people to reduce their water use at home.  In Ireland the average person uses approximately 145 litres of water per day, which is the equivalent of two full bath-loads of water and way more than what is needed.  We should be able to get that usage down.  People will be able to control their bills by reducing their water consumption, which makes environmental sense.  </p><p>It was suggested that a civil water bill is not acceptable.  Either people pay for their water or they do not.  If they choose not to pay and there is no way of getting the money from them, what do we do - sit at home, smoke a fag and say that is terrible?  No, we go after people who can afford to pay but will not pay.  It is a very quick process and from what I saw in England, it is very effective.  I do not have a problem with that.  The water company will not have to go to court.  The bill will be put against a person's income and there is no big deal involved.  We must change the debate, which in this forum has been too negative.  We must broaden the scope of the debate and open it out into a discussion about the future of our country.  We are a water-rich country and have great potential to attract water-intensive industries here.  Parts of the United Kingdom suffer from drought a lot of the time.  We have great potential to attract investment and create new jobs in agriculture and the food industry as well as in the technology and pharmaceutical industries, but we can only do that if we have a modern, state-of-the-art water infrastructure, and that is what this is all about.  </p><p>On the question of information, we need a much more sustained public awareness campaign to get the message across to people about water use, conservation and other related issues.  That will enable people to think about the broader issues and to have a vision for the future of our country.  I hope that answers most of the questions raised.</p></speech>

In that context, Senator Gilroy might afford me the opportunity to ask a question and receive clarification from the Minister of State.  Senator Sean Barrett, a world-renowned economist whom we are lucky to have in this House, has predicted that the average water bill will be approximately &euro;740 per household per annum, based on the current cost of producing treated water.  Surely that sum will more than pay for the cost of supplying the water being used in a household.  Irish Water, I assume, will be a profit-making organisation, but for whom will it be making those profits?  Surely those profits should be used to maintain the pipework and general water infrastructure rather than asking consumers to pay a standing charge on top of the charge for the water they use.  If consumers are facing a bill of &euro;740 plus a standing charge, are they are looking at a total of &euro;1040 per annum?  Is the Department fiddling with the figures?  I cannot understand the logic behind this.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has already responded to a lot of questions that, with respect, had no relevance whatsoever to the specific amendment before us.  His response was related, in some instances, to other sections of the Bill dealing with investment and leaks, subjects which have nothing to do with the section we are supposed to be discussing now.  I do not want Senators to be encouraging the Minister of State to stray into areas which are not relevant to the specific amendment we are dealing with now.</p></speech>

While we are about to exit that programme, we still have significant cuts to public expenditure to make.  What we are doing here is making sure we have an adequate water supply into the future.  The money people pay for their water will go to Irish Water and not to the Government.</p><p>  I wish to be very clear about a related issue.  Senator Barrett came up with three or four different estimates for the charges, but the one he liked best was &euro;750.  I have no doubt that he is one of the best economists in the world and should, like Paul Krugman, be writing for <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> on a daily basis.  However, the fact is that those figures never passed my lips.  I am saying, definitely and categorically, that the charge will be nowhere near the figure put forward by Senator Barrett.  </p><p>  The second point is that the Commission for Energy Regulation will debate the issue of the charges in a transparent way.  There will be a second period of consultation before the charges are finalised.  The attempt by Senator Wilson to put words in my mouth by saying that the charge will be &euro;750-----</p></speech>

It is related to a previous amendment which we discussed.  It requests that a full and comprehensive table of all moneys would be published annually, providing a county-by-county breakdown.  The Minister of State indicated that he would have a look at this and come back on Report Stage to see if there is any way in which he could facilitate a statutory obligation being placed on Irish Water to do this.  If the Minister of State extends that to this section and comes back on Report Stage with some changes, I would be willing to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

I undertook to contact Irish Water officials and see if they have any difficulty with the agency placing the data requested by the Senator on its website and putting it in its annual report.

It requires Irish Water to give a full breakdown annually on a county by county basis of all moneys that are transferred and expended by Irish Water.  If Deputies were to table a parliamentary question, they probably would get that response anyway.  If that is the case, then why can we not just accept this and do it as a matter of proper transparency?  If we are going to get the information anyway, surely it makes sense that Irish Water provide it on an annual basis.  The Minister of State made a point earlier about county disparities, so if people could see where all the money was going, that would make sense.  I do not see the logic in not accepting this amendment when the Government will be forced to provide this information anyway through parliamentary questions.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem at all with what the Senators are seeking, and I do not think Irish Water will have a problem with it.  What the Senators are suggesting makes sense.  It is transparent and accountable.</p><p>There will be an annual report from Uisce &Eacute;ireann that will be placed before both Houses, so the Senators will have an opportunity to debate it at that stage.  Every single constituency representative will seek to find out what is happening with the money in his or her constituency.  That is a natural part of a two-way process.  There is nothing secret or hidden in it.  The moneys can only be used for the counties in which they were raised.  There must be total accountability for that as well.</p></speech>

I do not see the difficulty here.  If we are all in agreement, then it should be a statutory obligation, and not an obligation that the agency deems fit itself.  We should not be giving Irish Water the choice.  Informing Irish Water that we had this debate in the Seanad and what the Senators recommended is not in the legislation.  I asked a Deputy recently to submit a parliamentary question to the HSE, but the HSE wrote back and stated that it could not provide the information.  It was a very simple information on specific statistics from hospitals.  The HSE referred the inquiry to the Irish Medical Organisation, which would not provide the answer either as it claimed it had no legal obligation to do so.  On that basis, I would not be happy with simply asking Irish Water to provide the information.  I believe it should be on a statutory basis, and clear and concise.</p><p>Every local authority member across the country and every citizen in this State deserves to know where the public infrastructure of the State is going to be vested, when it will be vested and in whose control it rests.  We are transferring public infrastructure across to a semi-State organisation, and we are afraid to include a statutory provision for an annual tabular report on a county by county breakdown.  Councillors could debate this at council meetings if they were or were not happy.  That is what we are looking for.  A councillor does not have the facility to ask a parliamentary question.</p><p>The Minister of State's earlier answer was about ministerial orders and so on, but then writing to Irish Water was to be discretional.  We could end up with my recent experience with the HSE and the IMO.  We have to be clear and concise.  Ministers in the past may not have been that clear, including some of my own Ministers who established organisations which should have been under more scrutiny.  Let us learn from that and at least introduce this level of scrutiny, especially since Irish Water is not included in FOI legislation in its establishment procedures.</p></speech>

There will be an annual report.  Anything that will be transferred from a county council clearly will be in the minutes of the council.  What the Minister will sign is a public document, a memorandum.  He must give his consent and the document will be available in the county council.  I presume ministerial orders are available online and I am sure the stuff will be available in the annual report.  I do not see why it should not be.  This is no big deal.  I have said I shall return on Thursday to discuss the matter.  I do not have a problem with the provision.  It is good to approach a body and say, "Listen, this is the Seanad's view on the matter; what is your view?"  I do not see anything wrong with the provision, which is constructive.  We know that the option is available to county councils and that a ministerial order is a public document.  We also know that councils must have annual reports and that they must account for all of the moneys spent.  We know that any money must be spent in the county where it was collected.  There is total transparency in all of these matters.</p></speech>

It is my experience that annual reports can be very general and do not specifically provide a breakdown on a county by county basis, as sought in the amendment.  We will receive an annual report from Uisce &Eacute;ireann, but that does not necessarily mean what is being sought in the amendment will be included in it.  Will the figures and breakdown we want be included in it?  I do not think the Minister of State can give us that answer.  Without his doing so we are not being prescriptive and not asking Irish Water to do what we want, even though we all agree that it would be the best outcome.  The Minister of State's response is flawed.  He hopes the details will be included in the annual report and says an annula report may or may not contain the information, but there is no guarantee that it will.  That is why the amendment is important and I support the Senator who tabled it.</p></speech>

The answer to both questions must be yes because we are dealing with public money.  I can see what Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill is seeking in tabling the amendment.  I sympathise with him 100% in his dealings with the HSE, but he has not compared like with like.  It is wrong to compare the HSE with anything else in the world, especially when one seeks information.  The amendment is unnecessary because the information is publicly available.  Making it statutory for the new utility to make the information available would mean that the same could apply to CIE, Aer Lingus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is no statutory requirement to compel these organisations to make their accounts publicly available.  Their accounts are publicly available and easy to follow for those who know how to read them.</p></speech>

Therefore, we need to place the provision on a statutory footing.  For too long leeway has been given to semi-State organisations to provide annual reports in which very important information tends to be buried.  All I seek is a simplified breakdown.  Let me give an example.  There is a statutory requirement on some semi-State organisations to provide a breakdown of expenditure or job creation on a region or region or county by county basis.  This means that a precedent has been set and I want this statutory requirement to be extended to Irish Water.  I will accept nothing less than having it stipulated in the Bill.

The Government may have the best of intentions in establishing Irish Water, but it could end up like a runaway train unless protocols are put in place to ensure total transparency on the assets owned, including their monetary value on transfer day.  NAMA is accountable to no one, even though it is the largest property owner in the world.  No one knows the identity of its 17% stakeholder and it might as well be an investor from Mars.  Apparently, the Minister for Finance is unable to state who it is when asked parliamentary questions.</p><p>We need to be clear on this issue.  We cannot give power to the CEO or senior officials in Irish Water to decide, &quot;This year we are not going to bother.  It is getting near Christmas and we are under pressure with the report, so we won't give the breakdown this year.  We gave it last year and will give it again in five years time.&quot;  We cannot that to happen.  Irish Water must be duty bound under law to provide the information for the taxpayer.  That is the very least it should provide for the taxpayer and it is the least I expect.

My amendment proposes the addition of &quot;the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority&quot; after the word &quot;Commission.&quot;  It must be agreed that in these matters consumers are extremely weak.  In fact, the programme for Government contains a proposal to strengthen the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and a merger is being contemplated by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton. </p><p>  Asking such a vital service to act at the behest of the Commission for Energy Regulation requires us to examine its track record.  The aforementioned Mr. Colm McCarthy published an article in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Independent</i> that I did not see.  On the previous Sunday he published an article on electricity prices in which the price for industry in Ireland was ranked at 141% of the EU average and the household price, 142%.  I do not think the commission has done its job on behalf of the consumer.  Issues have been raised here and at economic conferences up and down the country.  Why is the head of the ESB paid three or four times what the Taoiseach is paid?  The commission has not addressed the issue of the cost of electricity for industry in Ireland.  I have great misgivings about allowing it, on its own, to do the same for the consumers of water.  It owes us a lot of explanations for what it has done in the case of electricity.  I wish the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, was more active on behalf of consumers.  The national dependence council has drawn attention to the matter.  The National Consumer Agency needs representation in this regard.  As for the Competition Authority, the ESB faces weak competition.</p> <p>We need somebody who knows about competition to simulate a fair competitive price for electricity and a fair competitive price for water, and not to assume that we will end up paying 41% and 42% more than the EU average.  Along that index, taking the EU as 100%, we are ranked one for one and one for two for industry and households, France was ranked at 82% and households 73%, Germany was ranked at 91% and households 109%, the UK was ranked at 121% but below our ranking.  Therefore, we are not getting the bang for the buck in the regulation of energy nor do we get it from the other regulators either.  </p><p> The National Transport Authority increased bus fares last week.  The number of bus passengers is down more than 50 million and the number of train passengers is down about 7 million or 8 million since the recession began.  We have lost 250,000 people out of the health insurance sector.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation, by a directive of the then Minister, Noel Dempsey, before he left office, increased airport charges so much that we drove millions of people out of Irish airports.  Only now with this budget and the removal of the airport tax are they starting to come back.  Badly performing regulators or regulators who are captured by the sector they are supposed to regulate have done the country serious damage.  For Report Stage the Minister of State should consider measures to deal with that regulatory capture.  It has definitely happened in the case of energy and everybody is paying for it.  I need a far more dynamic and active person on behalf of the consumer.  That is the reason I seek the insertion of those two bodies.</p><p> I have mentioned the eminent economist, Mr. Colm McCarthy.  Mr. Joe Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, writing on this issue said that regulatory bodies are always taken over by producers.  For public choice theorists, regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with the high stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in an attempt to gain the policy outcomes they prefer while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.  Regulatory capture refers to actions by interest groups when this imbalance of focused resources, devoted to a particular policy outcome is successful at capturing influence with the staff or commission members of the regulatory agency so that the preferred policy outcomes of special interest groups are implemented.  </p><p> There are scores of examples internationally.  This is a serious problem.  I think it is very naive of the Government to say that a pretty ineffectual electricity regulator will determine water bills.  The reason I tabled amendment No. 31 was to have consumer representation and some competition representation also.</p><p> Amendment No. 39 seeks to amendment section 20(3) which reads, &quot;The Minister shall not give a direction under this section without first consulting the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.&quot;  I cannot figure out the reason that subsection is in the Bill.  It brought back echoes of the infamous incorporeal meeting of the Cabinet in 2008 when the Minister of State's predecessor, Mr. John Gormley, was not contacted.  He was in Sandymount and Deputy Willie O'Dea was coming up from Limerick.  Why does the Minister or his successor have to consult with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, or his successor?  Should that not be a Cabinet decision?  Should there not be consumer agency involvement?  Should there not be a competition agency involvement?  It seems very strange that two Ministers should get together and issue directions on the basis of two people.  That is the reason I tabled amendment No. 39. </p><p> The next amendment in this grouping is No. 50, which refers to codes of practice.  It seeks to amend section 25(1) which reads, &quot;Irish Water shall, as soon as practicable after the transfer day, prepare and submit to the Commission a code or codes of practice in accordance with this section&quot;.  I compliment the Minister of State on a very fine code of practice.  However, it includes issues such as: billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided; methods of payment of water charges; the provision of information to consumers of Irish Water for the purposes of enabling customers to communicate with Irish Water; and the making of complaints.  Those are classic issues where the National Consumer Agency should be involved.</p><p> Amendment No. 67 refers to section 31 which deals with the advisory role of the commission.  The section reads, &quot;The Commission shall advise the Minister in relation to the development and delivery of water services.&quot;  I think that should be done jointly with the National Consumer Agency.  It does not get much rights in our system and it do not get them very well represented by the Commission for Energy Regulation and I would like it to be involved.  That is the reason I proposed the amendment.</p><p> Amendment No. 73 refers to section 33(4) which reads:<blockquote>The Minister shall, before giving a direction under this section-<br />(a) give a draft of the proposed direction to-<br />(i)  the Commission, and<br />(ii) the Joint Committee referred to in paragraph 26 of Schedule 1 to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. ...</blockquote>My amendment seeks to insert the following at line seven, &quot;(iii) the National Consumer Agency.&quot;  Again, this has got to be a consumer friendly organisation and should have representation.  What would happen is that those persons, including the National Consumer Agency, would be invited to make representations in writing in relation thereto within such period of not less than 30 days.  The amendment seeks to include the National Consumer Agency.</p><p> The last amendment, No. 77, in this grouping refers to section 34(1) which reads, &quot;The Commission may, from time to time, request Irish Water to provide the Commission with such information as the Commission may reasonably require to enable it to perform its functions under this Act.&quot;  I ask that the National Consumer Agency be involved as well because it will have views.  It has been neglected and not well served by some of those sectoral regulators who typically represent producers rather than consumers.  There is a case for a much more rigorous regulation of this sector when we are starting.  It has not applied in energy.  Colm McCarthy's numbers showed how we ended up.  It did not apply in banking, accounting, financial services or in credit unions.  Every sector we failed to regulate properly seems to be in here seeking bailouts almost on a weekly basis and we have always sided with the Government to have stricter regulation.  The regulation of the water industry by the Commission for Energy Regulation is too loose and lacking in power to speak out on behalf of the consumer.  I ask the Minister of State to take some of those points on board on Report Stage.  If it is like the highest priced electricity at 41% and 42% above the European average, people do not want that.  We have a lot of regulatory agencies whose performance has been underwhelming, to say the least, and we do not want to add another one.  </p><p> Maybe as the theory of regulatory capture says that the consumer group will become marginalised, the Competition Authority maybe has not been as strong but if they are not there they certainly will not be able to influence the cost of water in Ireland.  It is such vital commodity as all the other Senators have said and we do need a stronger consumer voice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000040#SS00200"><p>I want to put on the record that the need for a consumer voice is very necessary.  My understanding is that the National Consumer Agency will have exactly the same power to do what it does for every other sector and for the water sector.  However, Irish Water will not have to submit its plan to the National Consumer Agency or the Competition Authority but the consumer will have a right to appeal to the authority in the event of a complaint and Irish Water will then have to examine that complaint.</p> <p>Therefore, the consumer is protected by the National Consumer Agency against Irish Water as he or she is protected against any other utility company.  I hope my understanding is correct.  Irish Water does not have to submit the plan to the National Consumer Agency because this power is not provided for in the legislation.</p><p>With regard to the Competition Authority, Irish Water has no competition at present.  There is only one Irish Water and I do not foresee the group schemes competing with it.  We discussed privatisation, which will not happen.  If an issue arose in this regard, there would be a dire need for a competition authority.  As the Minister said, however, this has nothing to do with privatisation.  The consumer will receive the same protection from abuses by Irish Water as from those of any comparable organisation.</p></speech>

The primary function of the Commission for Energy Regulation will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure that a consistent and appropriate level of services is provided to them.  It will also be responsible for approving the water charges plan prepared by Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the codes of practice that will apply to it in terms of standards governing the performance of its functions, billing and the methods of payments, the provision of information to customers, and standards of customer care.  In line with the Government's policy on economic regulation, the commission shall be required to produce strategy statements.  It will have a role in advising the Government on the development of water services.  The Bill provides that the Minister may provide a policy direction to the commission in regard to the performance of its functions.</p><p>The section provides that Irish Water shall prepare the water charge plan setting out the manner and method for the water charges to be applied under section 16.  This plan must be submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation by Irish Water and the commission will have the power to approve or reject it.  The water charges plan will contain the charges to be applied where they are based on the quantity of water as measured by a meter or assessed based on a formula to be set out in the plan.  The plan must specify the charges to apply to different categories of customers and the different methods of payments.  The section provides that water charges will apply to water supply to the premises and wastewater discharged from the premises.  The section specifies that, unless agreed otherwise between Irish Water and the customer, the amount of wastewater discharged shall be equal to the amount of water supplied.  The commission will be responsible for approving the plan.  It is critical for the new funding structure that the commission be seen to be absolutely independent in fulfilling its function.  It will undertake public consultation and has already done so.  It will be fully transparent in how it conducts its business.  All the submissions made to it will be on its website.  Regardless of whether one is the Senator, Deputy or representative of a public body, one's submission will be transparently available.  Obviously, if the National Consumer Agency made such a submission, I am quite sure it is at one's peril that one would ignore it.  In other words, a rationale for action must be provided.</p><p>There is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas from debating a water charges plan before or after it has been approved by the commission.  It is important that the Houses be able to discuss a plan.  We have decided that the Commission for Energy Regulation will be the agency responsible for the regulation of water services, including all the matters I have raised.  I will not be accepting the amendments but I appreciate the arguments that have been made.  I hope I have responded to them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000041#TT00400"><p>I am not happy.  I thank the Minister of State, as always.  A number of enterprises are charging prices way above the European average, particularly in the area of energy.  I do not know why we chose to associate water with energy given people's bad experience with electricity and gas, but that was a choice that was made.  We have the international record, including that of Nobel Prize winners, suggesting there is no great surprise associated with the fact that producers get to dominate the regulatory agencies.  One could make a submission and Members of the Oireachtas could submit their views, but we cannot obtain the price of the water or the free allowance.  That is why I tabled one of my amendments.  It was ruled out of order.</p><p>The Oireachtas is not being taken into the Department's confidence in this matter.  I would not give much for our rights with the Commission for Energy Regulation given that it has not been able or willing to address the cost structures, particularly that of the ESB.  I disagree utterly with the practice that the head of the ESB should be paid multiples of the salary of the Taoiseach.  I regard the Taoiseach as a far more important person than whoever runs the electricity monopoly.  However, those concerned have gotten away with this and the regulator has been pretty powerless at representing the consumer.  He is not the only one.  Where airports, health insurance and the National Transport Authority are concerned, we have the same experience.  We must learn that unless the consumer is represented in the decision-making process, the producers will dominate.  There is a cosy relationship.  I remember when Aer Lingus treated the Department responsible for transport as its downtown office.  On the first day on which competition was opened up, fares fell by 54%.  The regulators were, therefore, charging double the market price.</p><p>We must stimulate competition.  I refer to Senator Keane's point and the purpose of competition.  If this were a competitive industry, how much with the senior executives be earning?  That should be taken off.  If people are to be earning monopoly salaries and supported in that by an alleged regulatory body that does not act on behalf of the consumer, it does not serve us well in respect of the very vital commodity of water.  To link water with energy when we have had such an unsatisfactory experience in regard to the latter is wrong.</p><p>On Report Stage, I ask the Minister of State to think about where he and the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, consult on matters.  Are the other views of the Cabinet not taken into account?  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and those Ministers representing consumers might want to express a view.  It seems very strange that two members of the Cabinet came to the Oireachtas looking for power to consult each other to make decisions.  The complaint heretofore was that four members of the Cabinet make all the decisions.  It has reduced to two in this instance, and my amendment seeks to change this.</p><p>The consumer is not heard.  I have the same figures as the Minister of State.  Some 145 litres of water are used per person each day.  My breakdown of this is that 32% is used for showers and baths, 28% for toilets and 22% for washing machines.  This is 82% of the total.  Is anybody making that point or are the Department's engineers just convinced that everyone is wasting water and that they should be charged up to &euro;740 per year because it is their fault?  The standing charge, if it is not related to use, will have no impact.  It is just a tax.  If somebody takes the Minister of State's advice and cuts down on consumption, he will still have to pay the standing charge.  The economics of this concern me, as does the lack of consumer and competitiveness representation.  I will be pressing the amendments.  The governance of the sector is vital and we really need to amend the legislation on Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000041#TT00500"><p>Since the water charges plan is so important, it is important that we get it right.  Section 17(10) states "the amount of waste water discharged from a premises is deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied to that premises, unless Irish Water and the customer agree otherwise".  I want the Minister to return to Irish Water to allow for a facility whereby the customer can agree with the company on the amount of water used.  If a customer harvests water, the amount of water coming in will not be the same as that going out.</p> <p>The water coming in will include rainfall and the water measured through the meter, while the water going out will be a combination of both.  </p><p>The provision includes the words, &quot;unless Irish Water and the customer agree otherwise&quot;.  The customer and Irish Water should be required to agree as water harvesting will not be encouraged unless provision is made for it.  This is a matter of vital importance.  The Government plan includes water conservation and reduced consumption.  Encouraging people to harvest water will reduce water bills.  I ask the Minister of State to revert to me with a response before Thursday.  Harvesting is not mentioned in the legislation which focuses on conservation and reduced consumption.  One can use as much water as one wishes without paying for it if one collects rainwater.  God knows, we get enough rain and we do not get very much for free, yet rainwater flows down the drain.  I ask the Minister of State to produce a good plan for harvesting rainwater. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1121" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000042#UU00200"><p>I concur with Senator C&aacute;it Keane.  In selling this new concept to members of the public, we must try to portray the benefits of water conservation and quality, improvements in economic activity and the need to secure a long-term asset for the country.  Domestic consumers and householders must also see benefits.  Senator Keane has outlined some useful proposals in that regard.  Given the numbers in the House, the passing of the Bill is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  I hope, however, that there is still room for manoeuvre in terms of new thinking on positive improvements to the legislation.  Encouraging people to harvest water must not only be considered good economically or environmentally but must have some benefit for householders.  For this reason, Senator Keane's suggestion should be taken on board.</p><p>  Section 17 makes provision for the setting of charges and the methods for calculating and paying such charges.  I ask the Minister of State to discuss with his officials and Irish Water the system of billing, including the notification of bills to consumers.  I do so because among the limited number of people who currently pay water charges under a metering system, Members encounter cases of financial horror at local level where people suddenly realise, on receiving a large bill, that there is a leak in the system.  Instead of paying perhaps hundreds of euro per annum, as is normal, their bill could amount to between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000.  Local authorities have adopted a reasonable approach to dealing with such persons and will attempt to arrive at a fair solution on a once-off basis.  If a leak occurs a second or third time, they will consider the problem to be one for the consumer.</p><p>  If people form a habit of frequently checking their water meter, as they may do with an ESB or gas meter, and calculate how their bills will add up, it prevents bills going through the roof - please excuse the pun - as a result of leaks remaining undetected.  We must encourage a billing system under which regular communications are made between Irish Water and consumers.  A leak can be addressed without major financial losses if it is dealt with within one or two months.  However, if a person pays a bill, a leak occurs shortly thereafter and the subsequent bill is not issued or the meter is not checked for almost a year, the consumer will argue that he or she was not aware of the leak, whereas the company will argue the matter is the responsibility of the consumer.</p><p>  Whether the annual water charge to households will be &euro;400, &euro;500 or &euro;600, the amount will be significant.  If Irish Water communicates with customers two or three times per annum and obliges the householder to fill out a simple check list and return it by post, financial disaster could be avoided for many consumers as leaks would be detected through an out-of-kilter meter reading.  They could then be dealt with at an early stage.  While the Minister may not be able to write such a requirement into the legislation, he should encourage Irish Water to have ongoing written, text or e-mail communications with consumers, rather than engaging them with only once per annum.  I have encountered too many cases, primarily in the area of agriculture, where people who have paid water charges for ten or 15 years without a problem suddenly receive large bills because a leak was not detected for 12 months.  The Minister has an opportunity to place an onus on Irish Water to engage with consumers more than once per annum.  The cost of a stamp, a text message or an e-mail could avoid major difficulties for consumers and the company.  A stitch in time saves nine, while a timely check of a water meter could avoid significant waste and high bills. </p></speech>

There is nothing more important to consumers than bills and if a utility bill is increasing, it is important to intervene in an appropriate manner and to have a strategy in place for doing so.  Drive-by meters will be installed which enable electronic communication from the meter to Irish Water on the volume being used.  People will also be able to check the meter physically.</p><p>Under the current system of water charges, Louth County Council, my local authority, identifies from a bill that water usage is higher than usual and informs the company in question that its usage has increased significantly.  While it is a matter for the user to fix the problem, it is helpful that the local authority informs users of a problem.  County councils do not generally bill the total cost of the water used where they identify that there is a problem.  While it is a matter for Irish Water to establish a policy on this matter, it is critical that it is a user-friendly and proactive policy under which the company makes use of all available tools, including texts and e-mails, to communicate effectively.  In this way, it will be able to build a proper relationship with customers, one which meets their needs.  </p><p>To return to the point made by Senator Barrett, for whom I have a great respect, the sole purpose of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CRE, is to protect consumers.  Irish Water will be required to comply with direction issued by the commission, which will have sector specific powers that extend beyond the powers available to the National Consumer Agency.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane pointed out that the National Consumer Agency has the power and capacity to act on this issue within its remit.  Notwithstanding the Senators' criticisms, the intentions and policies of the Commission on Energy Regulation are made clear in its consultative document.  I do not know if the Senators read the document. </p> <p>It will proceed to a second stage of consultation early in the new year.  I will be happy to engage with the CER at that stage on the issues arising in order that it is more accountable to the Senator's views.</p><p>The reference to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is made simply because Bord G&aacute;is is the vehicle establishing Irish Water.</p></speech>

Barrett on the previous amendment, which is along the same lines as amendment No. 32.  These amendments would provide for accountability and protect consumers.  Senator Sean D. Barrett sought to introduce accountability to the charging policy, including a consultation process, in order that the consumer would be protected and informed.  That is what I am trying to do in this instance.  Amendment No. 32 would require the water services plan to be laid before the Oireachtas, as well as the commission, in order that Members could discuss it on an annual basis.  Amendment No. 33 has a similar aim.</p><p>  While the Commission for Energy Regulation will have responsibility for the water charges plan, the information provided by idt earlier this year referred to the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services.  This function is to be assigned to the commission and it is expected that the regulator will have a number of functions, including setting revenues, tariffs, charges, performance targets and efficient investments in the water network.  In addition, it will ensure Irish Water can finance its operations, having regard to the level of ongoing Exchequer funding in the medium term.  If the Government were to decide to cut the funding for Irish Water, the CER would have a statutory role in ensuring the service was self-financing.  As Senator Sean D. Barrett noted, if the Government were to cut funding by &euro;1 billion over a certain period, it would have to be made up by charges to households.  That is why it is important that the Oireachtas which will be approving the subvention to Irish Water should also be able to debate the company's charging policies.  Obviously the Department's Vote will be debated in the context of budgetary decisions, but we should also oversee the company's charging plan.</p><p>  I agree with what has been said about the CER.  It has proved to be ineffective and inefficient in combating the spiralling costs of energy for domestic households.  People are under serious pressure in meeting their energy bills at a time when the commission has an obligation to protect consumer interests.  I question its ability to do this.  For that reason, it is important that we give the Oireachtas an oversight role.</p></speech>

I sought clarification from the Minister of State on the amount of money that would potentially be raised through water charges and, while he outlined figures that were helpful to us, I am still unclear as to how much will be collected in water charges and how that will influence the water charges plan.  He referred to a figure of &euro;1.2 billion.  He should correct me if I am wrong, but I understand from what he said that &euro;200 million will come from commercial water charges.  I assume the subvention from the Government is a capital investment of either &euro;200 million or &euro;250 million.</p></speech>

Accordingly, the CER will be the agency responsible for approving charges to be levied on customers and setting the standards of customer care to be delivered.  The Bill provides the CER with powers of direction with regard to the standards to be applied by Irish Water, which will be elaborated on in codes of practice.  A number of Senators have been criticising the regulator, which is a popular thing to do.  I do not know if it is fair, however, because the regulator operates in a transparent way.  It prepared a consultation document on Irish Water which sought to develop a fair and reliable water system that would not involve excessive charges.  The document set out questions to which it requested replies by 29 November.  The commission will reflect on the responses before it communicates its advice to the Government.  This will be followed by another stage of consultation.  The process is transparent, open and accountable and I believe it will work fairly.</p></speech>

Will he clarify when this will happen and what will happen in the meantime?  I understand a mechanism will be used based on the water-in-water-out principle to which Senator Keane referred earlier.  This means premises that are not metered initially will be measured.  By the end of 2015, between 200,000 and 300,000 housing units will not be metered.  How will they be charged prior to being metered?  Will that be fair?  Will the Minister of State give us an explanation?  This is a valid issue because not all meters will be ready on the first day of 2015.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Cummins.  There will be a two-tier system until all the meters are installed.  One group of people will pay based on usage while another group will pay a standing charge prescribed by Irish Water.  That is unfair.  Someone without a meter could use 5,000 litres of water a month while someone who is metered could use the same volume but pay a grossly different amount.  I agree it is fairer to charge using a metering system but this should not be done until all of the meters have been installed.  Surely logic and common sense should prevail in this regard.  A three-year metering contract is being rolled out throughout the State.  I am not sure when that is due to conclude - perhaps the end of 2015 - but according to the briefing given by departmental officials, bills for the final quarter of 2014 will issue in January 2015.  When the first bills issue, how many of 1.36 million housing units in existence, according to the most recent census, will have a meter?</p></speech>

With amendment No. 35 the Government is being allowed to charge people who do not have meters attached to their homes.  That is grossly unfair.  I put it to the Minister that nobody should get a bill until all the meters are installed as only then can we charge like with like.  There would be two different prices for the same product.  If one of the multinational supermarkets, such as Tesco, did that, the Government would seek to prevent such a practice.  Nevertheless, the Government is looking to allow Irish Water to do it.  Water is defined under European legislation as a food product and it will be charged based on quantity for some and for others the amount charged will be based on their connection to a public drinking water supply.  Perhaps the Minister has some statistics that could further the debate.</p></speech>

The tariffs have yet to be decided but households which are not metered may be charged on an assessed basis; the volume of water that might be used would be assessed based on the factors such as number of people in a household.  In other words, the charge would not be based on the house but rather occupancy and so on.  That will be included in the water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  In other words, the regulator will make a proposal, which will be debated here, and there will be a response.  The assessed charge will represent the best proxy for usage, or the most accurate idea we can get.  There will be no random or arbitrary charge so it will be based on criteria.  I presume the number of people in the home will be a factor in the charge, as volumes of water differ in houses with fewer people.</p></speech>

The first phase of houses to be metered have a direct connection to the mains and we know where that connection is.  Along the street there are pipes going to the premises and the meter will go at the boundary box, and we know exactly where that is.  With a significant number of homes - somebody mentioned there are 200,000 to 300,000 homes - we may not know where the pipes are or they cannot be found.  The house I live in was built in the 1930s and in that case the water supply runs behind the houses rather than in the front, so it is not practical to dig up somebody's garden in order to install a meter.  An economic decision would have to be made as to whether to put a new pipe at the front of the homes and below the public footpath, which would cost money, or find an alternative.  There are studies in some parts of Ireland considering how to put a meter inside a home or in a location that is not necessarily at the preferred point outside.  If a person lives in an apartment complex, in some countries there is a grouped meter outside.  Depending on the number of apartments and occupancy, a fair and reasonable charge could be levied.  I am sorry the Senator is not happy with that and perhaps I could provide further information on the matter before Thursday.  In other examples two farms may have a shared connection.  People live in different ways and nobody knows in some cases where water is coming from.  The Senator may be aware of some such cases.</p></speech>

Under subsection (8):<blockquote>Irish Water shall, when preparing a water charges plan take account of the following matters:(a) the need to ensure that Irish Water performs its functions in a commercially viable manner;<br />(b) the public utility nature of its functions; and<br />(c) the need to maintain a balance between the matters referred to in <i>paragraphs (a) </i>and <i>(b).</i></blockquote>I am asking that Irish Water would be compelled to take into account the ability of people to pay as well.  There must be a mechanism built in as many people are struggling currently, with over 100,000 in mortgage negative equity.  People have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.  They are even struggling with the property tax but they are now being asked to pay for water.  We do not know what the price will be and if there will be a difference depending on whether these people have a meter.  If, as Senator Barrett suggests, Irish Water is to make up the shortfall of the &euro;1 billion, the average will be approximately &euro;750 per house.  If that does not happen there will be subvention through the tax system, as is currently the case, and the Government will have to decide the level of general taxation going to Irish Water.</p></speech>

We can see it happening every day of the week with banks putting serious pressure on people.  The bank issue may not be relevant here but the pressure felt by families is absolutely desperate, and I know every public representative, and not just those in the Opposition, shares that view.</p><p>There is the matter of those who can afford to pay versus those who cannot.  Many people living on the bread line cannot afford to pay for water.  One can consider the large number of people with medical cards, and to qualify for a card the income threshold is very low.  If people are living on the bread line like this, should they be asked to pay an amount for water, especially if the same is being asked of people on a salary of &euro;150,000?  Is it fair to charge the same levels in that regard?  That issue is not being brought to bear in this legislation.</p><p>Where an individual can demonstrate that they cannot afford to pay a water bill, what mechanism is available for them to write to Irish Water or make an appeal, stating reasons they cannot pay?  Could there be some analysis of the individual's rationale for not being able to pay?  In other words, the individual should be afforded the opportunity to deal with the issue through a prescribed form on the Irish Water website, for example, or in another manner.</p> <p>Something must be built in for those who genuinely cannot afford to pay for their water.  I accept that under the provisions of this legislation their supply will not be cut off, but it will be reduced.  I disagree with that approach for those individuals who genuinely cannot afford to pay.  I accept that some people who can afford to pay will not do so, and that is a different matter entirely.  However, those individuals who cannot afford to pay should not be forced to pay or be penalised in terms of supply.  Some element of compassion must be built into this and the ambition regarding what Irish Water can collect should be realistic.  One cannot get blood from a stone and there are people out there who simply cannot afford to pay.  These are the same people who have mortgages and whom the banks have squeezed against the wall.  They have no protection whatsoever.  They are under pressure.  We meet them every day in our own clinics.  I held a clinic last night and was depressed leaving it, having heard some of the stories of my constituents.  These people are now facing another charge coming down the tracks.  I am not making a political point here.  I hope some mechanism can be built in for those who cannot afford to pay.  Perhaps an arbitration or appeals system could be set up so they can lodge an appeal, set out their reasons for not paying, show their incomes and so forth, so that their debts to Irish Water could be written off.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has said, according to his own figures, that there is a gap in funding for water services.  The expenditure is &euro;1.2 billion, with an income of &euro;200 million derived from corporate sources, although there is an enormous level of under-collection in that area, which must be noted.  There is also 34% wastage in the water system.  The fact is that Joe  and Mary Soap, listening to this debate and considering this issue, want to know what will happen to their bank balance at the end of the year.  They are already contributing, through taxation, to the &euro;1.2 billion that is being spent at present.  That is not going to be reduced, according to the Minister of State's comments tonight.  They will still be paying the same level of taxation, through the PAYE, PRSI and so forth, but they are now going to be asked to pay another charge.  Whether that charge is higher or lower than what has been estimated here is not really the point; families will be facing an extra charge going into 2015.  It is an extra tax really and to try to dress it up as a conservation issue and claim that the legislation is being introduced to save water and so forth is dishonest.  This is a tax being brought in to cover the gap in our finances in the State.  That is the crux of the matter here.</p><p>It is unacceptable that ability to pay is not being taken into account.  We had the same debate in the context of the local property tax and we have seen how people reacted to the fact that income levels were not being taken into consideration.  People out there are totally stretched.  They are trying to pay the new property tax, some have lost their medical cards, and they are facing rising costs at every turn.  I have met people in Galway who literally do not know how they will make ends meet.  The Government is introducing another charge on top of all of the others.  We have argued that the Government should use the money being spent on installing water meters to fix the leaks that are causing 34% of water produced to be wasted.  That would save water and support the conservation agenda.  The Government should also invest in schemes to enable people to install rainwater harvesting systems in their homes, thus further conserving water.  If the Government is really serious about conserving water, it would use the money being used for water meter installation on conservation measures instead.  A district metering system could have been used in certain areas, which would give us a sense of where water is being wasted.  </p><p>The Minister of State is not convincing any of us on this side of the House that this is about water conservation.  This is an extra tax being brought in to meet troika deadlines.  It is the wrong way to go.  Other options were available to the Government and my party is totally opposed to what the Minister of State is doing.</p></speech>

I hate repeating myself but I want to go back over the figures again so we are all clear about how much money the Government hopes to generate for the water system, because that will determine the charge.  Whether an ability to pay clause is included in the legislation is a separate issue.</p><p>The figure the Minister of State gave earlier was &euro;1.2 billion.  He also made reference to &euro;200 million coming from commercial water charges, although, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, not all of that is actually collected.  A sum of &euro;240 million comes from capital funding, according to the Minister of State, but capital funding has been cut consistently in this area in recent years.  We have already seen a reduction in capital funding for water infrastructure.  That leaves a shortfall of &euro;760 million that must be collected or made up from somewhere.  That figure is based on the assumption that the Government will continue with the current level of capital investment.  However, that is not what happened with other charges that were introduced in the past.  With bin charges, for example, the full cost of the service was eventually passed on to the customer and then the service was privatised.</p></speech>

I insist that I be allowed to make my point this time, because that is only fair.</p><p>There is a real fear that what we saw with other charges will also happen in this case.  Water charges will be brought in with a certain level of subvention for a period of time, but then the full cost will be levied on householders eventually.  In reality, this is not a progressive charge.  It is a tax but it is not a progressive one because there is no ability to pay clause linked to it.  That is the fundamental reason for my opposition to this legislation.  The same argument was had in the context of the household charge.  The Government maintained that it would be fair and progressive, but it was based on the valuation of the property.  Now we are being told the water charge will be based on how much water one uses.  No consideration is being given to how many people are living in a household or to their income levels.  There could be seven or eight people with low incomes in a single property paying exactly the same water charge as their neighbours with vastly higher incomes.  That simply is not fair.  We are moving away from fair, just and progressive taxation at central level towards a raft of individual, regressive charges like the household charge, bin charges and water charges.  People are sick and tired of it.  They are sick and tired of the unfairness of it and of the number of separate charges which are being imposed on them.  </p><p>The Minister of State still has not given me a good reason for obliging people to pay both property tax and a water charge.  He made the point himself earlier that in many countries people pay for water but they pay for it through a household rate that covers many different services.</p></speech>

We cannot have a discussion about this charge in isolation and not refer to all the other charges that people have been asked to pay by this and the previous Government.  It is impossible.  We must set the context for the introduction of this charge.  The context is, as I have said to the Minister of State already, the introduction of the universal social charge, more direct taxation than ever before, the introduction of the property tax to pay for local services and now the water charge.  Consideration has not been given to ability to pay at all.</p><p>The Minister of State made the point earlier that Irish Water can borrow money, which could make up some of the shortfall.  However, that money will have to be paid back.  Who will pay it back?  That will come from the charge too.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is possible to have a discussion on one charge in isolation from other charges or other issues.  That does not make sense and has hampered our ability to have a constructive debate with the Minister of State on the issue.</p><p>I have made my general point and will finish by saying that ability to pay is only one element of this issue.  What I would really like is for the Minister of State to address the core issue of why people are paying a property tax and water charges and why there is no ability to pay clause associated with either charge.</p> <p>How is that fair or progressive?</p></speech>

For sustainable development for our children, we must realise water is a finite commodity and we cannot give it for free to everyone who cannot afford to pay.  What does that do for the environment?  There will have to be a facility built into the ability-to-pay provision for those who use more water because of medical conditions or illness - for example, a child who may require four baths a day because of the need to change bandages due to a condition.

This is a tax.  In the tax system we have a tax free allowance, a standard rate and then a higher rate.  If we are substituting water charges for taxation, these principles should be taken into account.</p><p>  The &euro;740 figure for water charges comes from the website <i>www.moneyguideireland.ie</i>.  The Government stated it would be a smaller charge of &euro;370 in the 2012 IMF review and that it hoped to earn &euro;500 million, not &euro;1 billion.  The Minister claims we could invest money to bring the charge down.  It would take a quick turnaround.  For example, one can invest in larger aircraft to reduce fares.  I do not know what timeframe we have in mind over which investment in the water infrastructure would immediately result in a reduction of charges below the &euro;740 mark.</p><p>  The ability-to-pay provision is an attempt by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill to genuinely introduce an element of humanity to this legislation.  It is unfortunate, again, that we have chosen the electricity pricing model.  Every Member has a complaint about the electricity industry&rsquo;s prices and policies on pylons.  It is essentially not big on public or human relations.  We have to take account of ability to pay.  If Irish Water is not constrained to take account of people&rsquo;s needs, on top of all the extra taxation they have borne over the past several years, it will ride roughshod over them.</p><p>  Will the Minister consider a similar amendment on Report Stage?  Another poll tax will drive people to the brink.</p></speech>

If this is a fair test, then it should take account of ability to pay.  Water runs and, accordingly, it could be quite costly, with bills for households being open-ended.  The Minister spoke about an information campaign, with which I agree, because we are going to have to teach the public about behavioural change and water conservation.</p><p>I have concerns about the uncertainty of the size of water charges.  I accept that it is proposed to meter water usage, while in cases in which it cannot be metered there will be a flat charge.  I would see greater certainty in a flat charge according to family size.  If the option of a metered charge or a flat charge were in place, families would be better positioned in terms of ability to pay.  Will that choice be made available to people?</p></speech>

They have one bill on top of the other and ability to pay must be taken into consideration.  With all due respect, we are putting the cart before the horse.  We should have the water services plan before us to know how people&rsquo;s inability to pay water charges will be dealt with.</p></speech>

As I said on Second Stage, who regulates the regulator?  Will Members have a say in amending the plan, or will the regulator have the final say, as he has with other utilities?  We need to know how those who cannot pay their water charges will be treated, particularly at this point when we are dealing with the legislation.  I am concerned that when we are finished with this legislation, down the road we will have no say on whether the regulator decides the charge will be &euro;370 or &euro;740.</p><p>I cannot see any sense in Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s proposal.  Is he talking about paying separately for bin collection, water and property charges?  Does he want to do what they are doing in Northern Ireland - namely, paying &pound;1,500 straight out their pockets, irrespective of whether they can pay?  I do not want that system down here.</p></speech>

It is important that this does not head off into orbit, with the public being made to believe that these will be the exact charges.  There needs to be some sense of how the charges will be arrived at by Report Stage.  It is not fair that these figures are being put out there.  If they are not counteracted they will grow legs and people will believe them, causing further concern.</p><p>I accept what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said about people&rsquo;s concerns about these charges.  We are all public representatives and we meet people every day who are at the pin of their collars to pay their bills.  We do not want to give them any further undue concern about water charges.  I would appreciate if the Minister could put this charge into context by Thursday&rsquo;s Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that the primary function of the Commission for Energy Regulation is to protect the best interests of the customers of Irish Water and I have no doubt that will be the case.  I have referred to the document it placed in the public domain and there will be a second in which it will identify the issues it thinks will be important.  Irish Water's plan must be agreed by the commission.  Whatever view it might have, the commission must put Irish Water's plan out for public consultation and communicate its intentions.  There will be total transparency around the charges and how they are arrived at.</p><p>For those who may not have had the benefit of reading it, we are talking about not just the operating costs of Irish Water today but also the plan for the next five years or longer.  We must identify where there are deficits in the water supply.  Everybody agrees that in the greater Dublin area there is a major water deficit.  There are issues in Cork and with wastewater treatment plants.  There are towns where water is boiled.  While the number of boil notices is declining, it is a significant issue.  All of these things must be included in the equation.  The equation is simple in that one must examine the plans of the councils in County Waterford, County Tipperary or County Donegal for the development of their communities.  It is not just a matter of the water coming from one's tap but the infrastructure behind it.  There will be total transparency and the Members will be able to argue and discuss the issue in the Houses.  In this Bill the Minister has the power to direct Irish Water to do whatever he directs it to do.</p><p>Regarding the questions raised, I will not be political but factual.  From where did all this come?  I accept the conservation arguments, as no doubt others here do.  Fianna F&aacute;il, in the programme for Government in 2009, stated it would introduce water charges.  The deal it made with the troika was that it would introduce water charges in 2011, not 2014, as we are doing.  The Senator's arguments are based on the fact that his party brought us into this mess in the first place and we are cleaning it up.  That is a fact.  All of the arguments he can make are like water off-----</p></speech>

Hard as it might be, I ask him to listen to me.  </p><p>There are two facets to the household charge or its equivalent in the North: the regional charge and the national charge.  Belfast City Council fixes the regional charge and the record shows that last year every one of the Sinn F&eacute;in's people in Belfast voted to increase it by 2% in the context of an average household payment of &euro;1,200.  Sinn F&eacute;in can be against things in this jurisdiction, but in the other jurisdiction it is a different story.  If one builds even a small shed to improve one's house in Belfast, it adds to the tax one pays.</p><p>We have a situation which must be dealt with properly and fairly and where we must look to future employment prospects in our region and country to make Ireland a place in which to do business.  I have said there are water shortages in many countries.  Owing to climate change there will be increasing changes across the world.  We are in the lucky position that we are water-rich.  If we can have the infrastructure to supply water to the people who need it and when they need it for their employment projects, this will be a centre of investment.  We can do this only if we have the infrastructure in place and we can only do it if we have the money, part of which is raising funds.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy mentioned two figures, neither of which was mentioned by me.</p></speech>

There is clarity on the issue provided by me and Senator Maurice Cummins.  Let us not play games.  This is the real business of improving water infrastructure, creating jobs and providing for transparency in the process.  Let us go to the core of the issues raised.  Government policy is clear that every household will have a free water allowance.  People will be able to control the amount of water they use and reduce it, if they can.  As Senator C&aacute;it Keane said, if there is a medical issue, it can be dealt with in that context.  There is no issue about there being a free allowance for every house in the country.  There are no affordability issues.  There is no issue regarding health and those who have significant problems.  All of these issues will be dealt with.  I, therefore, refute and reject the arguments made.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has asked what is the point of installing meters and why we do not spend the money in repairing pipes.  There is evidence from across the world where water meters are installed that there is very significant water loss on the customer side.  I have various figures.  A figure of 25% is not unusual and I have seen figures of 40% and 50%.  People in County Mayo are talking about figures of 70% and 80% in some cases.  I ask every Senator to talk to people in the group water schemes in their counties and they will tell them exactly what is going on.  They will tell them how to conserve water and about the importance and effectiveness of metering.  They understand better than anybody else the cost of supplying water and know what is happening.</p><p>The other Sinn F&eacute;in question was why we had to pay for a service.  We pay because we are receiving services.  The household charge is to pay for the services the local authority provides.  It provides for footpaths, lighting, street cleaning, parks, libraries and other facilities.  The water service is separate.  I have a son in England who lives in a third floor flat and everybody pays &pound;60 per month for water and other local services.</p></speech>

That is the combined charge paid in the heart of London.  This is not something new coming out of the air to be imposed on mother Ireland.  We must do this and the system must be seen to be fair, transparent and accountable.  All the marks of transparency and accountability can be seen.  That is why I am happy to reaffirm that there will be capacity to take on board low-income families or families with health issues.  Every household will have a free allowance and it will be up to everybody to reduce his or her water use.</p></speech>

The charge can be thrown that a four-year plan was agreed with the troika but this is the easy way of stating one inherited a problem.  Had the agreement not been in place there would have been no funding for the programme for Government for which the Minister of State is claiming credit.  If it were the case the Government was in disagreement with the policy of charging for water why was no effort whatsoever made to re-negotiate this element of the programme with the EU or the IMF?</p></speech>

It was not the only amendment ruled out of order questionably, but this is a matter for another day.</p><p>The figures we are debating are not being thrown about by any of us.  Senator Barrett brought forward figures from independent sources.  On numerous occasions I quoted figures from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which received praise from the Minister on Second Stage.  According to its figures, if we were to take the average European rate Ireland would charge &euro;1.91 per 1,000 litres, leading to an annual figure of &euro;87.67 per person.  According to the CSO the average number of people living in each house is 2.78 and if we multiply &euro;87 by 2.78 the figure arrived at is approximately &euro;270.  Generating &euro;500 million would require a household charge of &euro;360.  It is not clear whether the Government's ambition is to derive the full cost of water from consumers.  If this is the case it would involve the &euro;1 billion spoken about by Senator Barrett and the &euro;740 mentioned by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service backs up what Senator Barrett stated.</p></speech>

Perhaps this is from where some of the money will come.  It is a debate we can have when discussing the local government Bill.</p><p>There must be an ability to pay clause.  One cannot force people to give money which they do not have.  People will be criminalised for not paying or they will be turned into debtors to the State if they cannot pay.  It is regrettable to force people into such a position.  The vast majority of Irish people want to pay their bills.  When they are not in a position to do so we in opposition must stand up because it is our job to protect them as best we can.  I know it is not easy to be in government and introduce new legislation, but where legislation on charging and taxation is introduced it must be progressive.  Allowances must be made for those who cannot afford to pay, and an avenue to have the charge written off must be available to people who can demonstrate they are not in a position to pay.  This must be built in to the legislation.</p><p>No independent arm is included the legislation whereby someone can write to an organisation, a Department, a local authority or Irish Water regarding ability to pay.  I suggest local authorities would be given such a remit to make representations to Irish Water on behalf of families who cannot pay.  The local authority could research the situation, based on information gathered from working closely with the Department of Social Protection, and make the case to Irish Water.  This should be considered.  It might alleviate the burden and provide a platform for people to genuinely make a case where they cannot afford to pay.  The Minister of State should give it serious consideration.</p></speech>

We do not know exactly what the level of the charge will be.  We do not know whether there will be an ability to pay clause.  We know it is the intention of the Government, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, to apply over time the full cost of water services to domestic users.  This will have a significant impact on people.  From listening to Senator Cummins there is confusion about the meaning of the ability to pay clause.  It is not about whether people can pay and how to get the money from them if they cannot do so; it is about how to calculate the charge in the first instance.  A fairness element is built in with regard to ability to pay.  It is based on income.</p><p>I reject completely the partitionist comment from the Leader of the House when he stated &quot;down here&quot;, as if the North of Ireland is not part of our country.</p></speech>

I stated we will end up with a raft of individual charges, all regressive, not based on ability to pay and moving away from direct taxation which I believe is deeply unfair.</p><p>The Minister of State also spoke about unaccounted for water which is a problem.  He also spoke about where the meter will be placed.  He stated only the first leak will be paid for by Irish Water.  On top of paying the charge, if there is a problem the householder will be expected to pay to fix it.  This is appalling.  People will be asked to pay the tax itself and will then be told the first problem will be paid for but then they will have to paddle their own canoe.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the huge cost of water charges in the North.  Let there be no doubt once the concept of a charge is introduced it only goes one way, which is up.  People will pay comparable rates to those paid in the UK after a very short time.  This concerns many people because it goes to the heart of the argument I make, that the full cost of water services will be passed on to the customer, the customer being the household.  A cash register will be placed outside their front doors in the form of a meter and they will be charged for the full cost.  It will be intolerable for many families who simply will not be able to pay.  The Government has no intention of introducing an ability to pay element.  It will not be based on income.</p><p>We heard the same about the household charge when we were also asked to buy a pig in a poke.  I remember the debate we had on the household charge.  The Government thought it would sail through, that as it was only &euro;100 or &euro;200 people would not resist it.  There was much opposition to it.  There will be far more opposition to the unfairness of the water charge because the Government is not taking into account ability to pay.  It will charge people for a basic and required resource on the back of an EU directive and the troika diktat and not because it is the right thing to do for the people of the State.</p></speech>

I feel that a flat charge will provide certainty and then they will know whether they genuinely can pay.  An open-ended meter charge could put many families in jeopardy.</p></speech>

I do not think there has been any shortage of tributes to the late Nelson Mandela since the news of his passing broke late last Thursday evening.  However, it is fitting that this House pays its own tribute to such a remarkable and iconic man.  No words of ours will do him justice, but some of those used over the last few days to describe the life of the anti-apartheid leader, Madiba, as he was affectionately known, have been &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;hero&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;giant of history&quot;, &quot;liberator&quot; and &quot;freedom fighter&quot;.  It is absolutely right that such words should be used.</p><p>  Mandela was a towering figure of South Africa's struggle for freedom who escaped the brutal apartheid regime, and was certainly a hero to many in the world.  I suggest that his struggle was everybody's struggle and I think that his transition from prisoner to president stands out as one of the greatest journeys to freedom the world has ever witnessed.  He was a global symbol of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence; a custodian willing to die for what he believed in.  To quote South African President Zuma:<blockquote>He leaves the people of the world who embraced him as their own beloved icon.  Most importantly, he leaves behind a deeply entrenched legacy of freedom, human rights and democracy in our country.</blockquote>He was born in a small village in the Eastern Cape and he became involved in activism against the white minority regime as a young law student, joining the African National Congress.  His peaceful means and his forgiveness are words that have been used more than most.  He was willing to forgive those who imprisoned him and those who inflicted hardship on him.  He was willing to move on, and that is a sign of a wonderful man.</p><p>  I know our own President described Mr. Mandela as &quot;one of history's greatest leaders, a man whose unprecedented courage and dedication broke down the cruel barriers of apartheid in South Africa.&quot;   Likewise, the Taoiseach stated that &quot;Mandela has now finished his long walk, but his journey has transformed not only his country, but humanity itself.&quot;  We ask that his spirit continues to inspire, guide and enlighten us as we strive to bring freedom and dignity to the family of man.  I think we saw that today at the funeral, where we had leaders from a wide range of countries.  We even saw President Obama shake hands with Fidel Castro's brother and embrace many other dignitaries.  That would not have happened if we were not celebrating the passing of a wonderful man.</p><p>  I doubt if we will see the likes of Nelson Mandela again.

Few have suffered as much as he has at the hands of an oppressor and had the capacity in his spirit to forgive those who imprisoned him.  He certainly personified the best of that line which has been attributed to many but is befitting for him, which is that he was a credit to his race, the human race.  He joins an immortal few who have triumphed under huge adversity against enormous odds.  He struggled and prevailed in the end.  In the history of mankind, hundreds and thousands have triumphed over adversity, but very few have triumphed against such enormous odds and such huge opponents, when they were being judged not on the content of their character, but on the colour of their skin.  We had examples in Frederick Douglas, Martin Luther King Jr. and President Mandela.</p><p>There is a sacred line in the American declaration of independence that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;.  That is a line echoed in our 1916 Proclamation that the Republic &quot;guarantees equal rights and equal opportunities for all its citizens&quot;.  Citizens like Frederick Douglas dedicated their lives to the abolition of slavery and although Lincoln emancipated the slaves during the course of a civil war where black and white men gave their last full measure for the attainment of that line that all men are created equal, I truly believe that such a pledge has not yet been attained.  Perhaps some day it may be within the capacity of humanity to fulfil that sacred pledge.  Martin Luther King Jr. was another man who gave his last full measure to attain the rights of others.  He did this so that the dream that those, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, could attain their full potential.  He did not live to see that dream fulfilled, but he wanted all men to be judged by the content of their character and not the colour of their skin.</p><p>President Mandela dedicated his life to the struggle of the African people.  He fought against white domination and he also fought to prevent black domination.  He was willing to die for his beliefs, for the ideal to see people living together as equals, with equal rights and equal opportunities, in a democratic and free society.  That was his achievement in South Africa.  It is our cause today and the cause of humanity into the future.</p></speech>

As we are more than aware, Nelson Mandela steered South Africa out of apartheid without recourse to widespread bloodshed.</p> <p>That is a testament to the man he was.  He was a man with an unwavering ability to forgive in spite of 27 years of arbitrary imprisonment by a minority white separatist regime.  He knew true freedom was multifaceted and recognised from the outset of his presidency that freedom without gender equality and a respect for children's rights was freedom denied.  At the opening of the first parliament in 1994 he declared: &quot;Freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression ... Our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.&quot;  Further recognising the role of the women of South Africa in bringing down the apartheid regime in 1995 at the time of the drafting of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, he said, &quot;As a tribute to the legions of women who navigated the path fighting for justice before us, we ought to imprint in the supreme law of the land firm principles upholding the rights of women<font color="#222222">.&quot;  </font><br /><font color="#222222"> On that note, I commend the role of Irish women in the fight against apartheid and, in particular, Mary Manning and her fellow Dunnes Stores colleagues who in the mid-1980s went on strike for two and a half years for the right not to handle goods from apartheid South Africa.  They were certainly before their time in taking such a principled stand.  Nelson Mandela said their stand had helped to sustain him during his imprisonment.  </font><br /><font color="#222222"> Equality and non-discrimination as the cornerstones of the new post-apartheid South Africa are exemplified by the constitution of the Republic of South Africa, being the first constitution in the world to prohibit expressly discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  South Africa was the fifth country in the world and the first in Africa to legislate for same sex marriage.   </font><br /><font color="#222222"> As a children's rights activist, I, of course, was very cognisant of Nelson Mandela's view of children and their importance in gauging the overall success of a society.  He said: &quot;There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.&quot;  He took political action to improve the lives of women and children.  For example, he introduced free prenatal and postnatal care for mothers in the public health system and free care for children up to the age of six years.  In the constitution of the Republic of South Africa he ensured children's rights were clearly articulated.  In fact, it is the standard bearer for children's rights throughout the world.  We should all keep in mind that he said: &quot;History will judge us by the difference we make in the everyday lives of children.&quot;</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.582" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="20:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000052#EEE00300"><p>I thank the Leader for arranging this debate.  I agree with everything that has been said by previous speakers.  We honour an amazing hero for our times.  When Nelson Mandela received his honorary degree in TCD, the Public Orator, Professor Luce, started with a quote from Lord Tennyson:<blockquote><br />Ring in the valiant man and free,<br />The larger heart, the kindlier hand...</blockquote>He described how, bereaved by the death of his father at a relatively young age, Nelson Mandela had been raised in the excellent formal education system in Methodist schools.  That branch of Christianity was shown in the way in which Nelson Mandela was such a brilliant orator, a great humanitarian and a humorist.  In recent days people have said that when he rang Buckingham Palace, he said, &quot;Hello, Elizabeth, how is the Duke?&quot;  He had a warmth that impressed President Obama, President Clinton and everybody who met him.  We think of his long spell of imprisonment.  As John Luce put it:<blockquote>During the long harsh term of his imprisonment he never lowered the stubborn guard of the Xhosa boxer, nor did the good hope of the gardener fail him.  In the face of heavier oppression he clenched his fist the firmer, and when at last a milder voice was heard, he was quick to proffer the hand of reconciliation.  He had known the loneliness of the leader but never failed to smooth the way forward for his followers by the eloquence of his words and the wisdom of his advice.   </blockquote>Eloquence and oratory were restored by Nelson Mandela.  </p><p>  We remember the wonderful gestures, him liaising with the Springboks rugby team which would have been a strong bastion of apartheid and wearing the Springboks shirt for the World Cup final.  I think everybody in the world hoped South Africa would beat New Zealand that day and it did.  Nelson Mandela wrote to the captain of the team afterwards saying it had been a great day.  We all know how sport can bring people together.  </p><p>  I was very pleased earlier when the current officers of the students' union came for the Order of Business.  They liked Nelson Mandela so much that when he was still in jail, they named their building after him.  I think in the era when all visiting rugby teams trained in the college park before international matched they asked the Springboks not to train there because it was a racially divided team.  We were delighted to honour him and he honoured us by his address on 2 July 1990.  </p><p>  We have had great orators visit the Houses, including John F. Kennedy whose speech is still repeated, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.  It is interesting that in the alcove we have pictures of the leaders from the Antipodes who addressed the Oireachtas, Nelson Mandela, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.  We realise that sometimes we run ourselves down, but Nelson Mandela built us up and praised us for our complete rejection of the apartheid crime against humanity: &quot;...your support to us for our endeavours to transform South Africa into an united democratic non racial and non sexist country, your love and respect for our movement and the millions of people it represents.&quot;  In praising Ireland he said: &quot;We know that your desire that the disenfranchised of our country should be heard in this House and throughout Ireland derives from your determination, born of your experience, that our people, should like yourselves, be free to govern themselves and determine their destiny.&quot;  He referred to the Proclamation of 1916 and said, as Senator Jillian van Turnhout has said, that we should cherish all of the people equally.  He quoted a former Member of this House who had said: &quot;Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart&quot; - it never did with him, which was one of his greatest characteristics - &quot;We are in a struggle because we value life and love all humanity.&quot;  He looked forward when people would be free to join any political party and have a multi-party political system.  He also praised President F. W. de Klerk who might be forgotten, but it took him and Nelson Mandela to deliver a multiracial and multicultural society which they were able to accomplish.  We also should remember Mr. de Klerk today.  During Nelson Mandela's address he said:<blockquote>We, therefore, salute your sportspeople, especially the rugby players, your writers and artists and Dunnes' and other workers.  They will not be forgotten by the masses of our people.</blockquote>We thank Nelson Mandela and will not forget him either for a very long time.  The then Ceann Comhairle said:<blockquote>Mr. Mandela, it is now my great privilege to offer you the profound thanks of this House for your most inspiring address which we will long remember.  Thank you also for your kind remarks about us.</blockquote>This was a man who made the world a better place and I am delighted this House is acknowledging him.  May he be in his heavenly abode, where I am sure he is already.  It is richly deserved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="20:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000052#EEE00400"><p>I thank the Leader for organising these expressions.  It is a privilege and an honour to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela.  We do so as public representatives on behalf of the thousands of Irish people who will be mourning his loss and celebrating the contribution he made to all of our lives and the world.</p><p>It is difficult to know where to start in talking about a man like Nelson Mandela, a giant of his time, a man of peace and justice, a man who gave his whole life to his country, for which he would have given his life.  Hardly anyone alive in the world could have failed to have known him or recognised his warm smile, his name or known what he stood for.  It seems difficult to believe he is officially part of history, that his long walk to freedom is over, that his story in some way has ended.</p> <p>What a story.  A man who made an impact with his words long before social media and the Internet, whose words and deeds made worldwide impact because of their simplicity and truth.  Nelson Mandela stood for equality &ndash; such a fundamental human right that the world stood with him until his own South African Government caved under the pressure.</p><p> It seems difficult to understand in a modern Ireland, in a modern world, that a whole country ran its system deliberately to exclude one group with a particular skin colour, to patronise, bully, destroy, ignore, neglect &ndash; and kill if necessary &ndash; those who were black or coloured and to allow white people to have the best of everything.  South Africa ran its apartheid system in a very public way.  There was nothing covert about the signs on buses, in shops and on streets or about the politics, the housing system, the appointments system or the beatings.  This racism was sewn into the fabric of South Africa by its own rulers.</p><p> Mandela was sentenced to a lifetime in prison for trying to stand up to such a regime.  The world held its breath when he walked out of jail in 1990 &ndash; 27 years after he had been sent there for political offences, including sabotage.  The world held its breath because no one knew what his release might bring.  Would it mean the start of the healing process?  Would it plunge South Africa backwards?  Would Mr. F. W. de Klerk&rsquo;s decision to release him be well received or lead to civil war?  The ANC appointed Mandela as its president and he called on the world to keep up the pressure on the South African Government until equality was achieved, until black and coloured people were free to vote and to live together.  Sense prevailed but it took time.  The greatest gift of all was Mandela&rsquo;s own capacity to forgive, reconcile, hold out a hand and show that peace and understanding comes when people hold hands, not when they fight.</p><p> Mandela spoke in the D&aacute;il, as Senator Barrett has reminded us, and I quote: <blockquote>The outstanding Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, has written that &quot;Too long a sacrifice/Can make a stone of the heart.&quot; He spoke thus because he could feel within himself the pain of the suffering that Irish men and women of conscience had had to endure in centuries of struggle against an unrelenting tyranny. But then he also spoke of love, of the love of those whose warm hearts the oppressors sought to turn to stone, the love of their country and people, and, in the end the love of humanity itself.</blockquote>Of course that is what Nelson Mandela will be most remembered for.  Also, the first democratic elections with universal suffrage held in 1994 and when he became the first black elected president of South Africa, with a new colourful flag and importantly with Mr. F. W. de Klerk as vice-president, who apologised for the part he played in the apartheid regime by saying: <blockquote>I apologise ... to the millions of South Africans who suffered the wrenching disruption of forced removals ... suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences ... who over the decades and indeed centuries suffered the indignities and humiliation of racial discrimination.</blockquote>Of course Mandela kept working after the election, and as others have mentioned, he used sport and music to reconcile people by wearing the South African rugby jersey and congratulated those involved on their efforts to bring people together.  He never forgot that sport and music were ways to communicate and enjoy life but above all to empower his young nation as it made its way as a black majority rule country and tried to get on with its white citizens who had ruled for so long.  </p><p> After Mandela retired as President, he convened a group of world leaders, including Mrs. Mary Robinson, Kofi Annan, Desmond Tutu and others.  He named the group &quot;The Elders,&quot; and its aim was to find solutions around the globe.  He never forgot that he still had something to contribute after all of the years and he had, by then, reached quite an age.  He still wanted to make a contribution and showed great selflessness.  </p><p> I do not forget that Nelson Mandela saw that the apartheid regime existed in a more fundamental way when he spoke about the rights and role of women in a modern democracy<font color="#2F2F2F">.  As Senator van Turnhout has said, </font>at the opening of the first parliament in 1994, President Mandela declared:<blockquote>Freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.  Our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.</blockquote>In that election the number of women increased from 2.7% to 27% and in the last election 44% of the South African politicians are women.  The aim was to achieve 50:50 parity by 2015 so the country has done well.</p><p>  In 1994, Mandela honoured the 20,000 black women who marched to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in 1956 to protest at having to carry passes in urban areas.  When Mandela became President he named 9 August Women&rsquo;s Day and a national holiday.  He said:  &quot;The women were courageous, persistent, enthusiastic, indefatigable and their protest against passes set a standard for anti-government protest that was never equalled.&quot;  That is an incredibly generous comment to make because that is what we might say about him.</p><p> Finally, we have much to be grateful for.  We are grateful for Nelson Mandela's generosity, perseverance, understanding, good humour and absolute belief in the idea of equality for all.  As he said at the end of his speech in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &quot;Together we will win.&quot;  Le ch&eacute;ile, indeed.  </p></speech>

He was a towering figure and an inspiration to freedom loving people the world over.  I extend to the family of former president Mandela, to President Zuma, to the people of South Africa and to the South African community in Ireland my sincere and heartfelt condolences on the death at Madiba.</p><p>Nelson Mandela is one of my heroes and in my view the greatest political leader of our time.  He inspired people to see a world beyond themselves and to be brave in the face of often enormous odds.  We should never forget the struggle of black South Africans against the apartheid regime and always honour their fight for freedom and dignity.  It is also fitting that we remember at this time in this State the brave workers from Dunnes Stores who played their part in the struggle.  Those Irish people seized the moral imperative and did what they could to challenge the apartheid regime in South Africa.  At a time when the anti-apartheid struggle was, to say the least, controversial in some quarters, the Dunnes Stores' workers stood firm on their refusal to handle South African goods even in the face of great adversity and sometimes visceral, unjustified condemnation.  They were able to carry on because they knew that they had right on their side.  Even some of the people who disagreed with them are now praising Mandela and what he achieved in his country.  Their stance against the insidious system is testament to the fortitude of ordinary Irish people and their keen sense of justice.  Their protest is rightly burned into the collective consciousness of this country.  The Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid workers are true friends of the South African people and Mr. Mandela.  He stated that their campaign helped sustain him during his imprisonment, as I am sure did all of the support he received from people the world over.  </p><p>In the hard years when the western powers were against him, when he was vilified as a terrorist and criminal he kept the faith.  He showed by perseverance and vision how to build peace out of conflict and a better and more equal future based on fairness and unity out of division. Those are lessons for all of us, particularly for the people of the island of Ireland as we continue the necessary and challenging task of building peace.</p><p>Madiba was also a friend of Sinn F&eacute;in's.  My comrades who met him on many occasions in South Africa, Ireland and Britain describe him as funny, engaging and modest.  He was greatly supportive of the Irish peace process.  Along with his ANC comrades, he was loyal to those, including Irish republicans, who had helped the ANC in very difficult times.  His outreach to Sinn F&eacute;in in the 1990s was resisted stridently by the British Government and criticised by sections of the media here in this State.  I am very proud of my party's decades long relationship with former president Madiba and the ANC.  It is a great honour that the Sinn F&eacute;in president, Deputy Gerry Adams, was invited by the ANC to attend the funeral and services of remembrance when they bid farewell to Madiba.  </p><p>Madiba's courage, humanity and decency has inspired us all.  The issues he struggled against have not disappeared.  Therefore, we should honour his memory by speaking out and struggling against oppression, racism and poverty whenever we discover it.  That would be a fitting tribute to such a brave and noble man.  Madiba shall be missed by freedom loving people around the world but his legacy shall live on.  Madiba shall continue to inspire and encourage oppressed people around the world.   </p></speech>

I have sat in the Chamber for six hours but I shall make a special effort to say a few words about such a special man who was a global symbol.  Mandela is a global symbol of reconciliation and peaceful co-existence.</p> <p>His heroic life is an example not just to everyone in his country, but in ours.  He had a remarkable influence across the globe.  More than 100 dignitaries from various countries attended his memorial.  He not only earned his place in history, but showed us all the way by leading by example.</p><p>Like others, I pay tribute to the Dunnes Stores workers who put their jobs on the line to ensure that the part against apartheid that he led was honoured and recognised throughout the world.</p><p>He led a life unlike any other.  He was most influential and courageous, one of the greatest human being ever, and worked tirelessly for peace, although not only in his own country.  The way he went about achieving it was an example to all.  His sense of decency in his work was profound.  He fought for freedom against discrimination for all, especially discrimination against women, as mentioned by Senator van Turnhout and others.</p><p>His great sense of forgiveness is an example that we can all take.  &ldquo;Forgiveness&rdquo; was on his tongue at every opportunity.  He triumphed against adversity.  I listened to a 25 or 26 year old being interviewed, who mentioned that Mandela had been in prison for longer than that person had been on the Earth, thinking that that was a long time.  This is what Mandela went through for peace.  It was not easy for him, but when he came out he was about to stretch out his hands in openness and forgiveness to work towards peace.</p><p>I thank Nelson Mandela for giving himself to us.  He led by his words and his actions.  He inspired so many.  May he rest in peace.  He was a great statesman and man of generosity. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

It is marvellous to reflect on his journey from student to lawyer to agitator to prisoner to statesman, peacemaker and humanitarian.  Nelson Mandela has rightly been classified as a statesman and visionary.  He certainly lived up to his reputation, but we must reflect on the journey that he was forced to undertake and ask what we can learn from it.</p><p>This is a week of tributes, but when people read the record and history books, we will need to accept in embarrassment that a different view of Nelson Mandela was expressed many times.  Perhaps it is not only the body politic that changed its opinion of Nelson Mandela.  Perhaps he recognised that his ideas and approach also needed to change.  Above all else, he demonstrated that reconciliation and a willingness and ability to let the past be the past formed the only way forward in disputes, be they domestic or international.  His reaching out to the minority and previously repressive community in South Africa must be an example to all of us.</p><p>Mention has been made of his comments on the politics of this land, his advice on the conflict in Northern Ireland and his connection with some of this island&rsquo;s political figures.  I do not want to be in any way disrespectful, but it must be stated that no one on either side of the political divide could in any way compare to Nelson Mandela.  Such people have neither the generosity nor spirit of humanity that he brought to the table of conflict resolution.</p><p>We must ask how we can progress as a nation unless we take on board what Nelson Mandela stated about forgiveness and reconciliation.  In the past ten days, we tragically saw an attempt to rewrite some of the history of this land.  We should never rewrite history, but learn from it and move on.</p><p>There is much that is good of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s life and legacy that we can take on board.  Above all else, we should recognise that his doctrine of reconciliation, forgiveness and willingness to reach out to the opponent must be at the core of any formula for long-term peace and reconciliation.</p><p>We have been discussing a truth and reconciliation commission on this island.  In this respect, we can learn from what happened in South Africa.  It cannot solve all of the problems or wash away all of the pain and suffering, but it can play a major part in allowing people to reflect on the past while building towards a better future.</p><p>I thank the Leader to the opportunity to say a few words of tribute to Nelson Mandela.  He will always be considered a statesman of the highest standing.  I hope that we can learn from his example of peace and good will.  Every parliament needs to reflect upon and learn from it.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that, on a day when world leaders gathered in Johannesburg to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela, the Seanad should have an opportunity to reflect on the life of an amazing human being, a description that has been said and written in recent days.</p><p>Nelson Mandela has been described as a giant of history, the last great liberator of the 20th century, a unique political figure at a unique moment in history and not only the father of democracy in South Africa, but also a symbol of democracy throughout the world.</p><p>Nelson Mandela was a freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of apartheid to stand in the way of the liberation of his people.  His activities saw him imprisoned in 1962 and he was to spend the next 27 years incarcerated by a brutal regime.</p><p>He had much to show from his time in prison.  He wrote many books while there and his main place of imprisonment came to be known as a place of learning.  Songs and poems were written about him and the call for freedom was heard around the world and responded to by many.  I, too, pay tribute to the Dunnes Stores workers who did much to highlight the injustice of apartheid and brought the case of Mandela to the attention of Irish people and people throughout the world.</p><p>Under President de Klerk he was released from prison in 1990, he was then returned as leader of the ANC and fought on for freedom.  It is hard to comprehend that within three years of his release he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with de Klerk.  Mandela's election as President of South Africa in 1994 was a victory for equality and a triumph for peace.  The world rejoiced that one man, who stood firm and worked with his enemies, could make a difference to millions of people.  </p><p>Nelson Mandela will forever be remembered as a man of peace, humanity and humility who saw good in everyone, was prepared to forgive his enemies and worked to achieve peace, equality and freedom.  He made the quotes over the course his life and they illustrate the kind of person that Nelson Mandela was.  He said: &quot;Man's goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished,&quot; and &quot;No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion.  People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.&quot;  He also said: &quot;If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy.  Then he becomes your partner.&quot;  &quot;It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur.  You take the front line when there is danger.  Then people will appreciate your leadership.&quot;</p> <p>He also said, &quot;Freedom would be meaningless without security in the home and on the streets.&quot;  In a few days Nelson Mandela will be laid to rest among his own people.  He was a colossus on the world stage, he was universally loved.  His legacy will live on and must be built upon.  The challenge for all political leaders is to follow the Mandela example and work together to bring peace, justice and human rights to the parts of the world that are currently ravaged by war and oppression.</p><p> I conclude with a short quotation from Morgan Freeman, who portrayed Nelson Mandela in the 2009 film &quot;Invictus&quot;, who said in recent days:<blockquote>Today the world lost one of the true giants of the past century.  Nelson Mandela was a man of incomparable honour, unconquerable strength, and unyielding resolve - a saint to many, a hero to all who treasure liberty, freedom and the dignity of human kind.  <br />As we remember his triumphs, let us, in his memory, not just reflect on how far we've come, but on how far we have to go.  Mandela may no longer be with us but his journey continues on with me and with all of us&quot;.</blockquote>May his gentle soul rest in peace. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000055#HHH00200"><p>I was listening today to Ronan Collins on Radio 1 who dug back into the archives to play a song by one of my neighbours from Keshcarrigan, County Leitrim, Eleanor Shanley, when she was with De Danann, called simply, "Mandela".  He remarked that it was one of the earliest manifestations of the commitment that Irish people had at a time when Mandela was still in jail and, as Senator Mullins has said, along with the Dunnes Stores workers to highlight the inequities in the apartheid system.  The Senator also referred to the film "Invictus".  That was to be the main theme of my contribution in the short time available to us.  I re-echo the comments made and thank the Leader for affording us this opportunity.</p><p>The legacy of Nelson Mandela has been mentioned.  I suggest one of greatest legacies was the manner in which he used sport to unify a divided nation in the immediate aftermath of his release from prison and his election as President and the manner in which he was able to bring the indigenous native population of South Africa with him in a sport they absolutely hated.  It is hard, at this remove, to understand the hatred the native South Africans had for rugby and the Springbok team which they saw as the epitome of white supremacy.  In fact the rugby stadia were divided during the apartheid era when there were special reserved places for the African population and for the white population.  </p><p>Irrespective of the opposition that the Springboks faced, the native population always cheered for the opposition.  They did not care who they were, such was the hatred they had for the Springboks.  While Nelson Mandela decided to use sport and rugby, which was the bastion of white domination in South Africa, as a tool to effect a form of reconciliation among the population of South Africa, he knew exactly what he was doing.  He called on the then captain of the Springboks, Francois Pienaar, to get him on side and he encouraged him to learn the new South African anthem rather than the Springboks anthem which was identified with white supremacy and the apartheid era.  It was a great tribute to the rugby team at that time that it learned the anthem and sang it at the World Cup in 1995.  When Mandela appeared in the stadium wearing the Springboks cap and the Springboks jersey the impact on the native South African population was immediate and they were in a state of shock.  He realised exactly what he was doing and he saw that sport could be a great unifying force.  From that period on, when certain elements of the white population were arming themselves for an imminent civil war he used sport in such an effective way.</p><p>When we reflect on the contribution that we on this island can make to other countries in terms of the peace process I think of the contribution that Mandela made in the area of sport.  For example, if we had a one island soccer team here, let us think of the unifying force that could be in the medium to long term in the same way as rugby.  Practically all other individual and team sports here are on an all-island basis.  It is sad that the Northern Ireland soccer team, in the main, is supported by one side of the community only.  That will be a continuing obstacle to peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland while that pertains.  I know that these are revolutionary words but it is not today or yesterday that I have advocated an all-island team.  Why would the people of this island not come together and support a team dressed in a green jersey?  It is done in rugby, cricket, golf and in all team and individual sports.  It is done in boxing, which is a working class sport.  One has only to think of the many great sporting heroes that have come out of Belfast from both sides of the community.  If there was to be a recurring theme of the legacy of Nelson Mandela it would be the way in which he used sport as a unifying force.  I wish that would happen here.  Maybe, just maybe, that day will come and then, truly we could say that Manela's legacy has had a resonance in this country.</p><p>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;mid suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; ar a anam agus gach rath ar a chlann, ar mhuintir na hAfraice Theas agus ar dhuine ar bith ar fud an domhain a raibh baint acu leis.</p><p>There is no point in me reiterating some of the incredible eulogies that have been given to Nelson Mandela but, perhaps, I can give a different perspective on some of his life and some of his work.  Much of the discourse I have heard, particularly in the Houses and in the Irish media, has tended to focus on when Mandela left prison and to forget about much of what happened while he was in prison and before that.  He was a freedom fighter and he would say that himself but he was demonised by many political parties and leaders for many a long year when in prison and before that.  It is right that we recognise the role he played in bringing about peace in South Africa but we need to look at where he came from and the system in which he lived.  It was an apartheid system.  I note my own leader in the other House said that the injustice of apartheid was an obscenity, an obscenity to humanity.  In terms of our own experience - he was speaking about the Six Counties - Vorster, an apartheid minister in South Africa once said, famously, that he would swap all of the apartheid laws for one clause of the infamous Special Powers Act in the North.  </p><p>We have to remember that the ANC, of which Mandela was a leader, was banned, censored and political actions were quashed.  That is the reason he had to be so strong in his leadership.  In the 1950s and early 1960s ANC activists debated how best to challenge the state.  Speaking of that period, Manela said: &quot;We have always believed in non-violence as a tactic.  Where conditions demanded that we should use non-violence we would do so, where the conditions demanded that we should depart from non-violence we would do so&quot;.  He also came to the opinion that the ANC had no alternative to armed and violent resistance.  They were his words, not mine.   </p><p>In 1961 with Walter Sisulu and Joe Slovo, Madeba co-founded and became chairman of the armed organisation Umkhonto we Sizwe, &quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;, known as MK.  MK engaged in military actions against the South African regime through the period of his imprisonment and following his release.  It would be interesting if we could get Madeba's thoughts on the Irish situation at present.  I believe many of the South African politicians have a much better understanding of the complications and the situation in the North than many of our Irish politicians.</p> <p>I do not say that with any disrespect for my colleagues, but I believe Mandela's reading of the situation was shown in the way he supported the hunger strikers when in his cell on Robben Island and marked on his calendar, on 5 May 1981, that IRA martyr Bobby Sands had died.  He was not as quick as some to jump to conclusions or to judge members of my party or others involved with the republican struggle, for example.  He also pushed for peace and reconciliation.  That is shown in the link the ANC has traditionally had with Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is a great honour for us to have, at every Ard-Fheis, a speaker from the ANC.  It is shown also by the fact that my party leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, has been invited to the full funeral in South Africa.  He is going to attend on our behalf.</p><p>It is time to end the revisionism associated with what is taking place.  We need to debate the past, but we need to debate all aspects of it.  It is hypocritical of the Irish establishment to eulogise Nelson Mandela on the one hand while, on the other, demonising people on this island who fought in the republican struggle.</p></speech>

We need a similar process to that associated with the truth and reconciliation process in South Africa.  It is important to consider what Madiba would say to us in Ireland today and what guidance he would give to us as politicians dealing with injustices that are happening.  It is good to remember the wonderful example of the Dunnes Stores workers but my recollection of their three years of protest is that they did not receive full support from across the political spectrum in their fight.  However, they won eventually.</p><p>A number of issues need to be raised today that we should be considering.  For example, we must ask whether there is a need for the Government to consider an embargo similar to the Dunnes Stores workers' embargo on goods from the occupied territories in Palestine.  Is there too much racism on our island in the form of statements directed at and actions taken against Travellers, the Roma community and other ethnic minorities?</p><p>Today is International Human Rights Day.  The Irish Refugee Council launched an important report on direct provision this morning called &quot;Direct Provision: Framing an alternative reception system for people seeking international protection&quot;.  It is scandalous that there are still people in direct provision who have come here looking for asylum from their home countries.  Many of them have fled from terrible circumstances.  We are actually putting them up in appalling conditions, which have been criticised by eminent figures.  Former Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly has been highly critical of the lack of independent oversight of the system and has stated that the treatment of asylum seekers may well breach international human rights conventions.  Retired Supreme Court judge Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness has warned that a future Irish Government could have to issue a State apology to and compensate former residents, particularly children.  As long as such events are occurring on our watch on this island, we cannot say we are honouring the memory of Madiba, an extraordinary man.  He would be asking us to live up to our human rights obligations, particularly regarding the refugee convention and the EU directive on reception conditions.</p><p>We must all agree that Nelson Mandela was a very inspirational figure.  However, we should not try to be too selective in analysing his legacy.  He came from a very challenging set of circumstances.  He came through those circumstances to be a great peacemaker.  It is incumbent on all of us to take inspiration from him to work for peace, human rights, fairness and equality and to provide a complete and true republic for people to live in.  I noted Senator Mooney's comments on an all-Ireland football team.  I would like to see a day on which we could work towards a united Ireland in which everybody on the island is treated equally and fairly, irrespective of religion, background, colour or race.</p><p>Ba iontach go deo an duine &eacute; Madiba.  When he was interviewed on coming out of prison, he was asked about having to sit down with F. W. de Klerk to work towards a compromise in order to try to overcome the apartheid regime and whether he had not felt this was impossible.  His answer was that if the people talking about compromise came to the table with an open mind looking for a compromise, anything would be possible.  That is true of the circumstances I have mentioned.</p><p>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och as an deis r&aacute;iteas a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &aacute;bhar iontach t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

I, too, wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Nelson Mandela.  He was one of history's greatest leaders.  His name was synonymous with the pursuit of dignity and freedom across the world.  He was committed to people and motivated by deep humanity and compassion that was delivered with modesty and simplicity.</p><p>I had the great privilege of being in South Africa in 1994 for the first democratic elections.  I was very struck by the presence of Mr. Nelson Mandela and the respect that existed for him during those elections.  I reported afterwards to the European Commission that, from what we could see, the elections were fair and free.  That was mainly due to the great respect for Nelson Mandela and the role played by a very brave man, Mr. F. W. de Klerk.</p><p>Mr. Mandela was asked how he got &pound;20,000 from Ms Margaret Thatcher for his foundation and he replied that he asked for it and got it.  He said that if one does not ask, one will not get.  It is quite obvious that Nelson Mandela had the art of both asking and forgiving.</p><p>It is through the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Mr. Mandela's legacy will continue to affect future generations.  Wherever there is conflict and where victims and their oppressors seek a way forward, such a commission is a gift to the world of politics, a gift Ireland will not forget following the Troubles and post-Good Friday Agreement reconstruction.  Mr. Mandela has played a very important part in the affairs of our island and he will play an important part in the future.  He is a huge icon in politics throughout the world.  He was an amazing man who, on his death at the age of 95, had the young people of the world in mourning for him.  That says so much about him.  I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Mandela family.</p><p>When is it proposed to sit again?</p></speech>

It arose during the annual meeting between members of both the Oireachtas and Cork City Council.  We discussed the issue of vacant local authority housing.  This is relevant to local authorities across the country.  There is a shortage of housing and many thousands of families are looking for local authority housing.  The number of vacant units in need of refurbishment so as to be fit for letting is increasing.  The figure from Cork City Council is that, in the first nine months of last year, 83% of available houses had been repaired.  This has now decreased to 51%.  In Cork city alone, there are 305 houses that are not being let because there is no funding to upgrade them.  It is a no-brainer that we should be making them fit for purpose, because there is no capital funding available to build.  There is no house purchase scheme so the local authorities are not adding to their stock.  Many of the vacant houses could fall into disrepair and be boarded up.  They can become a source of contention for neighbours.</p> <p>A sum of &euro;15 million was allocated in the budget for a project to address vacant local authority housing.  Perhaps the voluntary sector should be involved in this project given its ability to raise funds by means of loans.  Will the &euro;15 million be allocated on the basis of the housing stock held by individual local authorities?  If so, the main cities - Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford - would receive the largest amounts.  When will this money be made available to local authorities to ensure existing local authority dwellings can be made fit for occupation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1000" speakername="Dinny McGinley" time="21:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000057#KKK00200"><p>I thank Senator Clune for raising this matter.  The Department is committed to supporting local authorities in maintaining and improving the quality of the national social housing stock through a range of measures, including large-scale urban regeneration programmes, improving the standard and energy efficiency of dwellings, pre-letting repairs and improvement and refurbishment works on vacant properties to restore them to productive use as quickly as possible.  Making vacant stock available for re-letting was a priority in 2011 and 2012.  During that period, the Department focused almost exclusively on refurbishing vacant properties, with the objective of returning as many of these as possible to productive use.  As a result, approximately 4,700 units were improved at a cost of over &euro;52 million.</p><p>The latest value for money study on management and maintenance of vacant dwellings in local authorities by the local government audit service made a number of sound recommendations on issues such as maintenance and repairs, all of which should help local authorities in implementing improvement works programmes.  The best way to ensure that a property does not become void is to have proper, planned maintenance programmes in place.  One of the recommendations of the report was that Dublin City Council pilot a term maintenance and refurbishment works contract to significantly reduce the re-letting time for vacant dwellings.  This project has been very successful in reducing the average turnaround time from 27.82 weeks to 6.4 weeks.  More than 500 units have been completed under this programme to date.  In addition, more than 100 units are being refurbished with direct labour.</p><p>Given the concentration on vacant properties in recent years and in view of the substantial numbers of vacant properties that have been improved, my Department this year refocused attention on occupied and older dwellings which lack adequate insulation and draught-proofing.  On 5 June, the Minister announced a new &euro;50 million three-year energy efficiency investment programme for local authority homes.  More than &euro;10 million of this allocation will be spent this year, with a further &euro;25 million to be spent in 2014 and the remaining &euro;15 million to be spent in 2015.  This programme will target the 25,000 least energy efficient properties and result in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families.  It will also create approximately 1,000 jobs in the sector.  To date, almost 9,000 dwellings have been upgraded under this measure, a figure that exceeds the forecast for the year and is a strong endorsement of the measure.</p><p>The additional &euro;30 million Exchequer investment in social housing announced on budget day is expected to deliver some 500 local authority homes for families on the waiting list.  Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of new in-fill developments in areas with the highest demand for social housing.  Another &euro;15 million will be invested in bringing long-term vacant and boarded-up units back into social use.  Detailed arrangements for the implementation of the two measures are being developed by my Department.  It is intended to announce these arrangements as soon as possible, with a view to having the investment programme up and running as early as possible in 2014.  The Department will request local authorities to submit proposals for inclusion under both measures in due course.</p><p>The 2014 Estimates also include a provision of &euro;79.4 million for the national regeneration programme.  The priorities for 2014 include the refurbishment of a substantial number of houses and apartments in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and a number of regional centres.  The Minister is confident that the new &euro;15 million programme for refurbishing vacant houses in 2014 will complement the regeneration programme and deliver positive outcomes in terms of value for money and high-quality homes for persons on waiting lists.</p></speech>

ACC subsequently developed into ACC Bank and expanded its services to include finance for small and medium-sized businesses.  While it was in existence, the bank had loan agreements of up to &euro;310 million with 2,900 farmers and had 1,500 farmers among its 5,000 deposit account customers, who saved up to &euro;110 million.  As is clear from these statistics, ACC Bank was instrumental in assisting farmers.</p><p>The decision by Rabobank in 2002 to purchase ACC Bank from the State sealed the latter's destiny and it was subsequently announced that ACC Bank would close in 2014.  While Rabobank has given an assurance that ACC Bank will continue to hold its loans to the agriculture sector, a significant proportion of the bank's loans are in difficulty and have been outsourced to a collection agency.  This development poses obvious threats to farmers and their livelihood and places family farms at risk of repossession.  I am most concerned about this prospect. </p><p>Worse still, Danske Bank announced some months ago that it will close its branches in Ireland.  This means Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks will command 70% of the marketplace, a level of dominance by the two pillars of Irish banking that has not been seen since the 1980s.  To further bolster this uneven situation, I understand &euro;100 million from the European Investment Bank is being made available to AIB and its borrowers only.  While these funds are welcome, it is most unfortunate that they are being concentrated in a single bank and competition is not being allowed to thrive in the Irish banking industry.</p><p>The creation of ACC Bank in the 1980s helped alleviate the problem with banking competition.  We are on the verge of a similar problem and people are already suffering from its effects, including higher interest rates.  Closing ACC Bank hurt our farmers and business owners.  The current state of banking cries out for a new initiative, not only to provide finance to small and medium-sized businesses and farmers but also to become a competitive lever to force the major banks to improve their standards of customer service and financial products. </p><p>I propose that the Government consider buying back ACC Bank.  If that is not possible in the current economic circumstances, it should explore other avenues, especially given the widespread public support for action in the banking industry.  A Government initiative to take back ownership of ACC Bank or establish a similar bank would be welcomed on all fronts.  The Government could use some of the resources of the strategic investment fund.  This would be in keeping with the investment principles of the fund, which include the provision of commercial investment to support economic growth and jobs, investing in areas of strategic importance and recycling capital to enable continuous investment in new projects.</p><p>When the Agricultural Credit Corporation was formed its purpose was to finance agricultural development.  The original objectives and culture of ACC Bank, when in State ownership, would still hold good today.</p></speech>

The Government recognises that a strong agriculture sector is vital to our economy and plays a crucial role in employment growth.</p> <p>A key priority is to ensure an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs, including farms, in the real economy.  It should be noted that the agriculture sector has recently shown increases in turnover, profitability and employment according to the Red C demand survey for the period April to September 2013 which was published earlier this week.</p><p>As I am sure the Senator is aware, ACC Bank will close all of its branches and business centres to the public and give up its banking licence next year.  However, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses, including farms.  Both banks achieved their SME lending targets in 2011 and 2012.  The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit and the upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5 million in credit being made available, protecting 1,521 jobs.  This shows there is a strong prospect of success for SMEs going to the CRO and businesses refused credit are strongly encouraged to seek a review by the office.  In recognition of the crucial role played by the CRO, in the recent budget the Minister for Finance increased the threshold at which SMEs can appeal refusals from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million.  This will facilitate requests from a broader range of SMEs, as well as large requests for re-financing.  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interests of banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sums borrowed.</p><p>In June the Government announced its decision to establish the Ireland strategic investment fund which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund and activate the NPRF's &euro;6.4 billion of resources by making them available for investment on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  The Minister for Finance anticipates the enabling legislation will be enacted early next year.  Using the Ireland strategic investment fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place in which to do business and create employment.  Already in the lifetime of the Government, the NPRF has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing that collectively involve commitments of &euro;375 million.  The role of a strategic investment bank over and above the contribution expected from the strategic investment fund will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government's key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.</p><p>The Taoiseach has indicated to the D&aacute;il that he has held discussions with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and they have agreed that work will be undertaken to find ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with German and Irish authorities to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.  Officials from the Department of Finance have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.  Discussions with the German ministry have been held in Berlin and a meeting has also been held between Department of Finance officials and KfW personnel.  We will be moving forward with this work with KfW and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks both here and abroad.</p><p>With support from Chancellor Merkel, the Government's intention is to ensure an effective and successful initiative emerges from the process.  We will, therefore, be discussing any and all approaches that meet the strategic objectives of both states and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular SMEs in Ireland.  Although the precise form and delivery mechanism for any assistance has yet to be agreed, discussions with German colleagues will allow us to consider appropriate options for funding the recovery of the economy in the course of our work with KfW and the German Government.</p></speech>

I welcome the positive news about the credit being made available to SMEs and the farming community.  However, I urge the Government not to concentrate the funds coming from KfW in the two pillar banks.  We need choice in the banking system because a responsible banking sector will only come about as a result of competition.  We need more players in the market.  By concentrating the KfW funds in the two pillar banks we would create the risk of setting back the banking industry and the sector for years.  That would ultimately stunt economic growth.  I ask the Minister of State to pass my concerns to the Minister for Finance in order that they can be taken into consideration in discussions that take place in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There is a clear commitment from the Taoiseach and the Minister regarding the potential for KfW.  Equally, however, Bank of Ireland plans a major new initiative for the fourth quarter involving its prominent branch network engaging with farmers at marts.  As part of National Enterprise Week, the bank will be holding a series of agriculture credit clinics.  In respect of AIB, the edition of <i>Agri Matters</i> for summer and autumn 2013 was circulated to farming customers beginning in August.  <i>Agri Matters</i>is AIB's publication aimed at farming customers and has a circulation of 15,000.  Following the launch in July by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of AIB's dairy sector report which was prepared in partnership with the Irish Farmers Association, the bank hosted a series of engagements with regional key stakeholders.  The budget extended capital gains tax retirement relief to the disposal of farmland in certain circumstances to encourage older farmers to lease their land under long-term arrangements.  Relief for young trained farmers was also extended by adding three courses to the list of eligible qualifications.  The Government is conscious of the importance of the agri-economy and properly functioning banks.</p></speech>

Tuigtear dom go bhfuil thart ar 2,500 leabhar agus 350 p&iacute;osa ceoil foilsithe ag an Gh&uacute;m &oacute; buna&iacute;odh &eacute; sa bhliain 1926.  Is m&oacute;r an <i>corpus</i> litr&iacute;ochta &eacute; sin gan dabht.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="22:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000060#NNN00300"><p>I propose to share time with Senator Cummins.  The redevelopment of the courthouse in Waterford city is long overdue and the provision of extra courtrooms is to be welcomed.  I am concerned that the aforementioned works may lead to a loss of court services in Waterford city.  Any loss, whether short-term, medium-term or long-term, would be a disaster for Waterford city.  I will not mince my words.  It would be an intolerable loss of status for Waterford city as a regional gateway under the national spatial strategy.  We cannot allow it to happen.</p><p>It is estimated the redevelopment will cost between &euro;15 million and &euro;20 million and that the construction period will be up to two and a half years.  Alternative accommodation must be found, which I accept in the context of redeveloping the courthouse.  At this point, the Office of Public Works, OPW, is only looking at one replacement courtroom, which is what is being sought.  That is the problem.  If this is the case, the city of Waterford could lose both Circuit Court and High Court sittings.  The District Court already sits five days a week and only one court can sit in a room at any one time.  As matters stand, the courts and the people who attend them, including the members of the legal profession, their backup teams, civil servants, garda&iacute; and members of the public, bring essential and much-needed revenue into the city.</p><p>Through no fault of its own, Waterford city has a problem with high unemployment.  Any loss to Waterford city, even if it is short-term, would be a disaster and is something we must make provision against.  I ask the Minister of State why the OPW is not trying to rent an entire building.  It would make perfect sense, as we could continue to have all sittings of all courts, and the proceeds that come with that would remain in Waterford and would not be lost to elsewhere.  If the courts are moved to another location outside Waterford, the OPW will still have to pay rent for a suitable space, but we are not taking into account the loss to Waterford city in terms of jobs, revenue and morale.  Any savings made will be wiped out.  These are genuine concerns brought to my attention by solicitors, members of the legal profession, An Taisce and a number of other organisations.  I welcome the opportunity the Minister of State has to update the House on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-10a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="22:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121000060#NNN00400"><p>This is a timely debate.  I received an e-mail from a friend of mine suggesting that if court services go to Kilkenny, Waterford will lose the courts into the future.  Members employed in the Courts Service have made such suggestions even though people in the Courts Service also said there was no prospect of the extension going ahead.  There will be a &euro;31 million investment in the Courts Service.  We should embrace the good news and welcome the &euro;31 million investment.  I share the concerns of Senator Cullinane with regard to replacement courthouses while the new structure is being built.  It is essential that Waterford retain services in the short period of one and a half years.  The suggestion I have heard that the courts will never come back to Waterford if replacements are not found is scaremongering.  I am not suggesting Senator Cullinane is doing so, but those concerns are unfounded.</p><p>I do not know whether the Courts Service falls within the Department of the Minister of State, but railings have been knocked down in front of the courthouse for over a year.  We are trying to have them repaired and the Courts Service has been putting it off for a long time.  We are celebrating 1,100 years in Waterford next year and we hope to have the railings repaired by the Courts Service or the OPW so that we can celebrate our 1,100 years and embrace the changes, including the &euro;31 million investment in the courthouse and the &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million to be spent on the building housing the fire service, which the courthouse will take in.  The fire service is being moved to the Ballybeg area, which is in urgent need of investment.  We should embrace the &euro;50 million investment in Waterford and celebrate it, expecting that these services will be maintained in Waterford while awaiting the completion of construction.</p></speech>

I appreciate the interest in Waterford Courthouse and in the matter of its relocation pending redevelopment.  I am informed that this is an issue which has been raised previously in representations made to the Department of Justice and Equality by the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins.  However, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  The Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions - which, of course, include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings - and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has no role in the matter.</p><p>However, inquiries have been made and the Courts Service informs me it is aware of the importance of maintaining court sittings in Waterford during the period of construction for the refurbishment and extension of the city's courthouse.  At present, Waterford Courthouse hosts sittings of the District Court, the Circuit Court and, on occasion, the High Court, including the Central Criminal Court.  I am informed that the planned development will see major enhancement of court facilities in the city, with the number of courtrooms increasing from the current two to a total of six, which will provide ample facilities into the future for all court sittings.</p><p>The courthouse development project is one of seven courthouse projects to be delivered by way of public private partnership under the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.</p> <p>The procurement for these projects is being undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency and the procurement process will begin in the near future.  It is expected that construction work will commence by mid-2015 with the project being completed and the courthouse becoming operational during 2016 or early 2017.  As the Senator recognises, temporary courtroom and office accommodation will be required for the construction period as the courthouse will have to be vacated.</p><p>I am informed that the Courts Service, with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, is currently looking at possible locations for temporary court and office facilities for the duration of the construction period.  It is doing so within the limits of the budget available to it.  The Courts Service, in common with all other public service organisations, has been operating in a very difficult and challenging economic environment.  A major factor which must be considered is the potential cost of providing such temporary facilities.</p><p>The Courts Service has indicated that it is not clear at this point the extent of the temporary facilities which will be available during the construction period.  I mentioned that there are currently two courtrooms in Waterford Courthouse.  While it would be desirable that a temporary facility would also provide two courtrooms, factors such as the resources available and the affordability of a temporary location will have to be taken into account.</p><p>The Courts Service is considering whether any existing public facilities in the area could be used for court purposes and I am informed that there have been discussions with the local authorities in this regard.  They are also exploring potential commercial facilities that could be used.  However, it will not be possible to indicate what arrangements will be in place for any court sittings until the accommodation has been sourced.</p><p>There is a possibility that the fitting out of temporary courtrooms could potentially represent a significant cost element.  If any existing facilities were available to be used which would not require significant work and were available at little or no cost then, of course, this would clearly be welcome.  If the Senators have particular premises in mind I would ask that they bring these to the attention of the Courts Service.</p><p>I want to thank the Senators for raising the matter and I appreciate their interest in the administration of justice in Waterford.  I am sure the Senators will appreciate that, at this stage, it is not possible to say what arrangements will be in place for any particular court sittings until all options have been fully examined.</p></speech>

It would make no sense for the Government to invest in increasing the courtrooms and services in Waterford from two to six, and then lose the services altogether.  That is a nonsensical argument.</p><p>My argument was about the short-term potential loss of services.  The Minister of State said in his response that the Courts Service is not clear at this stage as to the extent of the temporary facilities which will be available and that it would be desirable that a temporary facility would provide the two courtrooms.  If we cannot find a premises that can provide two courtrooms, the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Central Criminal Court proceedings which take place in Waterford cannot continue on a short-term basis.</p><p>It is not fair to put the responsibility back on Senators to find alternative premises.  I am sure I can provide suggestions to the Minister and will do so, but it is an issue for the Courts Service and the Government.  I appeal to the Minister of State to be conscious of the loss, even if it is short term.  The overall package is to be welcomed, including the fire station, which is in a part of the city I represented as a city councillor, it is good that we are getting that investment at a very difficult time.  However, the concern of people is about the short-term loss.  They see a simple fix if we can find alternative premises that can hold two courtrooms so there is no loss of court services.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board the concerns of myself and Senator Cummins and bring them to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Courts Service.</p></speech>
