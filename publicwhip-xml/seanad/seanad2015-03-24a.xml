I just wanted to clarify that before I started.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan.  My matter is fairly straightforward in that I ask that a response be given to a resolution that was passed by Limerick County Council in November last.  As far as I am aware, Limerick County Council has received no response at all from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is not acceptable, when councils pass motions and they are forwarded to the relevant Ministers, that no official response comes back to them.  It shows a disregard for the work of elected representatives, in particular county councillors, if the Minister in charge is going to ignore them.</p> <p>I will give a brief history of the particular complaint.  I am calling for an independent investigation in regard to a couple of planning matters.  To be clear from the outset, the applicant himself does not dispute the fact that he was refused a planning application; that is fine and is accepted.  What is in question here is the manner and the method whereby that application was allowed to proceed.  There is a perception that there was maladministration on the part of Limerick County Council when it was dealing with the applicant, in that he was left to go too far along a stage with the application while the planners seemed to be of a view that it was never going to be approved in the end.  The argument the applicant is making is that, under the guidelines as set out by the former Minister, Mr. Dick Roche, in 2007, if something was going to affect the outcome of a planning decision, the applicant should be made aware of such a problem at the pre-planning stage.  The whole argument of this applicant is that this procedure was not followed.  This is not about the outcome and it is not the case that he was going to appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  He agreed with the outcome.  It is just his feeling that it should not have gone so far.</p> <p>This matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of the Ombudsman.  I am not sure if it was properly picked up that the guidelines as set out in 2007 by the former Minister do not seem to have been followed.  All the members of Limerick County Council, of all parties, to my knowledge, are in agreement that an independent investigation should take place because they feel there was certainly maladministration when it came to these particular applications.  I would like to hear the response from the Department to the resolution that was unanimously passed by Limerick County Council back in November.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#B00800"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am taking this Commencement matter for the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.</p> <p>Under section 255 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has certain investigatory powers in regard to the review of the performance by planning authorities of their functions under the Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These powers are, however, restricted to the review of the organisation and of the systems and procedures used by planning authorities in relation to their functions.  They do not extend to the review of individual planning applications.  </p><p>Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, the Minister is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in regard to any particular planning application with which a planning authority, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is or may be concerned.  Section 224 of the Local Government Act 2001 enables the Minister to authorise a person to prepare a report for him or her regarding any matter arising in relation to the performance of functions by a local authority.  </p><p>I understand that the matter raised relates to a planning applicant who has complained about the handling of two planning applications by Limerick County Council in relation in particular to pre-application consultations entered into by the person concerned with the council.  I further understand that the person in question complained about the council's handling of his planning applications to the previous Ombudsman, who did not find any maladministration by the council in this matter, and that this decision was upheld on appeal.  I also understand that the Ombudsman, as an exceptional matter, granted a further review of the case, following which the previous finding was upheld.  The person subsequently made a further complaint to the current Ombudsman who found that while there were some failings on behalf of the council in this case, these did not constitute significant maladministration.  </p><p>I am satisfied that the matters complained of have been already comprehensively investigated on a number of occasions by the Office of the Ombudsman on an independent third party basis and, consequently, I am satisfied that no further investigation of the matters which were the subject of the complaints is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1119" speakername="James Heffernan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#C00200"><p>I take on board the Minister of State's reply.  Many people have provided sworn affidavits in this case, including elected representatives and people who represented the applicant in his consultations at pre-planning level.  This is not about the final planning decision.  It is about what occurred prior to it.  The point being missed by the Department and the Ombudsman is that the guidelines as set out were not followed.  That is what the applicant is saying and what Limerick County Council elected members believe, and for that reason tabled the motion referred to.</p> <p>I understand this matter does not come within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, but I would urge that the Department reconsider the matter in light of the precedent that has been set in County Donegal whereby some applications, in terms of irregularities regarding planning decisions, are being looked into by a third party appointed by the Minister.  I believe a similar approach should be taken in this case because it may be that this is not an isolated incident and that there are other people who have suffered similarly as a result of pre-planning meetings not having adhered to the regulations as set out in the previous Act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#C00300"><p>If I understand the Senator correctly what is at issue is not the decision on the planning application but the pre-planning process.  Pre-planning meetings are often open to interpretation in that while one person says one thing, another person hears something else.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have dealt with some planning applications and put a lot of store in pre-planning meetings.  I would always advise people to attend pre-planning meetings, but I advise that the pre-planning meeting is not the actual planning process.  I am interested to know why, for example, the applicant did not go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will outline another avenue that could be pursued.  The Senator referred to elected members.  The elected members might like to debate such a matter in the chambers of the council in order to examine the guidelines, but perhaps that already happens.  </p><p>I would like to draw the Senator's attention to political interference in planning applications.  It is something we accept is not done in this country any more.  Political interference in planning applications led to a lot of tribunals, and long drawn-out tribunals.  I think sometimes a local solution to a local problem is a better idea.  I shall convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister.  It may be a wise course for him to speak to the local authority again.  As stated in the report, the Minister is not allowed to investigate individual planning applications.</p></speech>

The local area improvement scheme was introduced last year by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  To be fair, the Department operates many such schemes in conjunction with local authorities.  I am not sure how much was made available for this scheme, but I think it was &euro;7 million.  It equipped the local authority with small budgets so that it could engage in a co-operative fashion with local community groups in an effort to make the environment cleaner and improve public areas.  The scheme proved successful in Clare because it enabled Clare County Council to enter into partnership arrangements with community groups that improved public areas in a way that the council would not necessarily have had the resources to do.  The budget that Clare County Council got would have worked if it had been spent on one project.  Instead, it decided to split up the funding and distributed grants, as far as I am aware, to community groups.  As a result, the council got a much greater bang for its buck.  The scheme has been great.</p> <p>I do not believe there has been an announcement of a follow-on scheme for this year.  Given the fact that the scheme was so successful last year, I urge the Minister to announce a similar scheme for this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#D00400"><p>I thank the Senator for raising such an important scheme, of which I am a huge supporter.  I thank him for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on the success of the public area enhancement scheme.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, in March of last year the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced that a sum of approximately &euro;3 million would be made available to local authorities for a dedicated public area enhancement scheme.</p> <p>Following on from the success of The Gathering in 2013, towns and cities across the country were hoping for another successful tourist season in 2014.  Last year was a challenging year for local authorities in terms of managing their public spaces due to the exceptionally inclement weather conditions experienced.  In light of this, the Minister announced that additional once-off funding was to be provided to support the efforts of local authorities to maintain and present their public areas.  The Minister was conscious that this effort would maximise the economic benefits that would result from increased visitors to towns, cities and counties and enhance the overall experience of those visitors.</p> <p>The public area enhancement scheme supported community efforts by providing grant funding to local authorities for the purpose of enhancing public areas before and during the summer tourist season.  The scheme provided funding for such work which was additional to that provided in 2014 in local authority budgets.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The provisional grant to local authorities under the scheme was conditional upon 25% matching funding being provided by the local authorities themselves.  While funds were provided to city and county councils only, town and borough councils were also assisted in their efforts to improve and enhance their public spaces by the respective county councils.</p><p>The Department was not prescriptive in the works to be undertaken.  Suggestions included the provision of additional support for initiatives such as local tidy towns committees, improvement works to public parks and recreational walking areas, cleaning and tidying of older graveyards, and cleaning and making safe derelict buildings.  Local authorities were asked to undertake works in co-operation with local community efforts, wherever possible.  The scale and variety of work undertaken by councils demonstrated the success of the scheme, with all local authority areas benefiting from the enhancements.</p><p>As the scheme was conceived in response to the extreme weather experienced in 2014, it was designed to be a once-off intervention.  The question of whether the scheme may have a role to play in the future will be kept under review by the Minister, having regard to the needs that may arise and the available resources.</p></speech>

While she does not have full control over the Department's housing policy, her role as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development means the issue is very much on her agenda.  We all agree there is a very serious housing problem in Dublin, which is having a knock-on effect throughout the country.  While my question relates to a story which emanated in the media at the weekend as to how many units of housing it will be possible to build in the very near future in our capital city and a dispute between the Department and media outlets, I am asking the Minister of State to acknowledge that this is a crisis which requires a solution.  I have repeatedly expressed the view in recent years that we do not have a housing policy in this country.  We clearly have a policy for the construction industry and a policy to regenerate the role of developers.  Some of those developers have been tripping in to meet the Minister for Finance in recent times, which reminds one of the politics of the Celtic tiger era.  However, we do not have a clear, distinct set of proposals to house the more than 100,000 people throughout the country who are in urgent need of new accommodation.</p><p>The story in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>at the weekend was disturbing.  It referred to an e-mail from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Finance which contained an admission that there was a deliberate attempt being made to spin the numbers.  The e-mail stated: &quot;We have been spinning that there is sufficient land with planning permission/zoned for housing circa 46,000 housing units across four Dublin LAs but the reality is that this figure includes land not yet zoned for housing.&quot;  We need clarity as to exactly how much land is available in the short term for housing units in Dublin.  In addition, we need clarity as to how the Government intends not just to get the land zoned and obtain planning permission but how the houses are to be built.</p><p>The mortgage and debt crisis in this country is very profound and it feeds into the housing crisis.  The latter represents the greatest crisis facing the country, with more than 100,000 families seeking housing.  It is greatly remiss of us politically not to respond to it more robustly.  The nation continues to face economic difficulties and will do for some time.  I first entered local government politics in the mid-1980s when the country was in the midst of a profound economic depression.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I can only speak for Cork County Council at the time, as can the Leas-Chathaoirleach, where hundreds of local authority houses were being built per annum and, presumably, thousands across the country, because it was part of then Government's housing strategy.  We need such a strategy again.  One of the aspects I want the Minister to reflect on, which my colleagues and I in the new political movement Renua have been talking about, is that as of today more than &euro;100 billion in Irish pension funds is invested abroad.  Can we attempt to devise a scheme to bring some of this money back into our country to provide housing for the people?  That is an issue on which we need to reflect.  We certainly need new thinking, new solutions and new ways of investing to deal with the housing crisis, as we cannot wait five, ten or 15 years to provide housing for these families.  We all know the social knock-on effects arising from inadequate housing.  </p><p>The Minister of State will be aware from her constituency work that rent allowance in all its formats and mortgage subsidies are still being paid, so taxpayers' money is being spent, but it is not being well spent.  We need a new attempt to define a national housing strategy.  I have sought this debate in the House in the past six months and I hope we can have it in the near future.  However, today I am asking for clarity.  When one Department official is telling another that deliberate spinning is taking place, that is not a positive starting point.  Let us get a true picture of how bad the situation is, and let us plan to make it better.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's observations.  I acknowledge that she cannot make up policy on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  I watched the Minister on television last night, but he did not reveal any new information.  We have to take this problem seriously because it is ruining lives, livelihoods, families and communities across the country.</p></speech>

I would point out, as he has done, that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is directly responsible for the social housing strategy.  This gives me an opportunity to congratulate the Minister, with whom I work closely, on the determination with which he is pursuing the social housing strategy.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, housing supply, public and private, is one of the most significant challenges and priorities currently faced by the Government.  In this regard, the Government has set out a range of actions in the Construction 2020 strategy to support expanded housing supply and, in the social housing strategy, has set aside some &euro;4 billion to deal with social housing provision in the period to 2020.  The lack of supply of private housing is particularly acute in the Dublin area, where demand well outstrips supply, with consequential effects on house prices and also rents.</p> <p>To put the issue in context, at the peak of construction activity in 2006, more than 93,000 houses were built nationally, of which just under 20,000 were built in Dublin.  Further to the economic and banking crisis, activity declined very sharply.  Only around 11,000 housing units were completed nationally in 2014, of which 3,268 were in the Dublin area.  There is undoubtedly an urgent need to increase the level of housing supply, particularly in Dublin, in order to return to a market equilibrium whereby supply equals demand, having regard to the increasing population and changing household formation trends.</p> <p>To help address these issues, and further to the publication of the Government's Construction 2020 strategy for a renewed construction sector, the Dublin housing supply co-ordination task force was established last year with a particular focus on addressing supply-related issues in Dublin.  This includes the monitoring of trends in new housing developments, as well as the identification of any obstacles - including the provision of key infrastructure - to the bringing on stream of viable and market-ready developments.  One of the first actions of the task force was to analyse the stock of planning permissions and zoned land for housing developments in Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The first report of the task force, which is available on my Department's website, concluded that across the four Dublin local authorities, approximately 21,000 housing units already had planning permission, equating to three years' supply, which permissions do not have any infrastructural constraints.  The task force further reported that an additional 25,000 new homes are considered permissible on existing lands which are zoned for housing, and which do not have any infrastructural constraints.  Both of these figures are subject to change as planning permissions are lodged and granted.  Given a predicted housing requirement of approximately 7,500 new homes per annum over the coming years, as identified by the Housing Agency, the position is that there is sufficient land with planning permissions, and-or zoned for housing, to meet the predicted requirements for the next six years in the Dublin area.</p><p>The data on Dublin housing supply as published by the Dublin housing supply co-ordination task force is the most recent and up-to-date information available.  A further analysis of zoned lands with infrastructural constraints has been undertaken by the task force with a view to ensuring that further supply comes on-stream during that follow-on period.  The task force has recently submitted a second report to my Department focusing on this issue and the Minister will give due consideration to its conclusions in consultation with his Government colleagues.</p></speech>

There appears to be no joined-up thinking on finding a solution to these problems.  We do not have the investment capacity to build, in the short term, the number of social and affordable houses required.  I referred earlier to the local authority politics in which both I and the Leas-Chathaoirleach were involved in the 1980s.  It was a long time ago in one sense, yet at that time councils availed of schemes such as housing finance agency loans, share ownership loans and local authority loans and were exceptionally proactive in providing social housing.  There is a profound lack of imagination, new thinking and new ideas on how to solve this housing crisis.  We can argue about the statistics, whether 30,000 or 46,000 units are ready to go, but the problem is that nothing is happening and houses are not being built in the volumes required.  A new national plan is needed.  I repeat my request for a serious, in-depth debate on a national housing crisis here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, where at least some degree of serious reflection is allowed, in the near future.  Let us all work together to bring an end to the misery of the people who are waiting in endless queues for housing and who are living in substandard rented accommodation.  We are all paying a high social price for that.</p></speech>

While the question was directed to the Minister for Health, it is not at all inappropriate that it is being taken on his behalf today by the Minister of State, because of her remit with regard to rural development and rural areas.  While it is not directly under the aegis of her Department, one of the newest challenges facing rural Ireland is for rural communities, towns and villages, to retain their GP services.  This is a relatively new phenomenon.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Whelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to my information, the HSE is experiencing chronic difficulty in filling vacancies where GPs have retired in 30 to 40 towns and villages in various regions throughout the country.  In itself, this reflects a change of emphasis which we have seen manifested in other areas.  A GP practice is no longer necessarily a vocational pursuit.  Rather, it is often viewed as a career.  These days, it must stack up as a business and a sustainable proposition, it must be feasible, and it must meet the demands and lifestyle expectations of people and families.</p><p>In particular, I wish to raise with the Minister of State the anxiety and alarm developing in my county, County Laois, due to the ongoing process and the length of time it is taking to find a GP replacement for the village of Borris-in-Ossory.  The incumbent, Dr. Seamus Fitzgerald, a long-serving practitioner who has given sterling, loyal, committed and dedicated service, is retiring of his own volition.  I wish him a happy, healthy and lengthy retirement.  The process to replace him commenced as far back as last November.  I am heartened to learn that there have been a number of expressions of interest.  Indeed, perhaps up to four qualified candidates were interviewed for the competition to replace the incumbent, Dr. Fitzgerald.  However, the vacancy looms large and will arise within a week's time at the end of March.</p><p>I hope the Minister of State will have a positive reply today to the effect that the Borris-in-Ossory vacancy has been resolved and successfully addressed by the HSE.  In that context there is a wider issue that needs to be considered by the Minister for Health when he is negotiating the GP contract with GPs and the Irish Medical Organisation.  A new trend is developing whereby new and younger doctors and practitioners are no longer willing to embrace general practices in smaller towns and villages throughout rural Ireland.  As I have said, up to 40 vacancies exist at the moment, and this will accelerate unless it is addressed.  With respect, this needs to be addressed by ensuring that the rural practice allowance is restored and that it is sufficient to make the practice attractive, feasible and sustainable.  Moreover, we need to address the terms and conditions being sought from GPs, including the rents sought for the clinics they use in these town and villages.  Towns and villages such as Borris-in-Ossory are not as lucrative as larger urban areas in the city of Dublin and so on.  It is my understanding that the HSE is looking for an extortionate rent of &euro;25 per square metre from the new GP for the clinic in Borris-in-Ossory.  This is punitive.  It is not consistent with the current market value and it puts a great strain on any doctor trying to provide a dedicated and committed service in Borris-in-Ossory and its extensive hinterland.</p></speech>

I am taking this Commencement debate on behalf of the Minister.  Senator Whelan raises an important issue.  Given my role as Minister of State with responsibly for rural affairs, I can see why there are grave concerns in rural parts of Ireland where these situations may arise.  The HSE is committed to the provision of high-quality general practitioner services through the general medical services, GMS, contract for GPs.  GMS GP posts are filled in line with HSE human resources recruitment guidelines.  Periodically, challenges can be experienced in respect of the permanent filling of GP posts.  In areas where this challenge is experienced, every effort is made by the local HSE management to ensure the provision of GP services to all GMS patients.</p> <p>The retiring doctor in Borris-in-Ossory advised the HSE of his intention to resign from the GMS scheme in November 2014.  The GP practice is a single-handed rural practice with a GMS panel of approximately 830 patients.  The GMS panel was advertised by open competition and interviews took place in late 2014.  Two people applied, and both were placed on the panel following a successful interview.  Both successful candidates, however, declined the offer of the position.  The position was subsequently re-advertised by open competition in early February 2015.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Interviews took place in the first week of March 2015.  The HSE has engaged systematically with two successful candidates based on their panel position and I am happy to state that the first placed candidate has accepted the position and will commence work as soon as possible, something I know the Senator will welcome.</p><p>While GP numbers are keeping pace with overall demographics, this does not always prevent shortages occurring at local level.  GPs once qualified, tend to work for existing GP practices or as self-employed contractors and are free to decide where to establish their practices.  Isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, very often with limited private practice opportunities, may sometimes find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts, a point the Senator mentioned.</p><p>The HSE is actively seeking to address this issue with medical organisations with a view to developing practical measures, including reorganising lists with existing doctors in local areas and through the adoption of a more flexible contractual arrangement which would encourage young GPs to work in such areas.  The Department of Health and the HSE are currently in discussions with the IMO about the introduction of flexible or shared GMS contracts.  The possibility of extending the current GMS GP retirement age from 70 to 72 years of age is also being considered.</p><p>The introduction of shared GMS contracts would provide more family friendly working arrangements better suited to the increasing number of female GPs, thus making it more attractive to pursue working within the GMS.  Under the programme for Government, it is intended to develop a new contractual framework for GPs which will be more suited to current needs and will facilitate the planned development of primary care services.  Substantive discussions on a new GMS contract will commence shortly with the IMO.  Mechanisms for encouraging GPs to set up practices in rural and urban disadvantaged areas will be considered, as appropriate, in the context of these discussions.  In the meantime, where GMS GP vacancies arise in an area, the HSE will take the necessary steps to ensure that continuity of service to GMS patients is maintained.</p></speech>

It is heartening and positive news for the people of Borris-in-Ossory and surrounding areas that the HSE has managed to secure a replacement and that a new GP will take up duty imminently.  I welcome that.  However, it would be easier to recruit GPs to rural areas and other communities which are not as attractive for those setting up new practices if the criteria were more favourable and supportive of young GPs.  The rural practice allowance for GPs needs to be reviewed, revised and reintroduced to areas where it has been withdrawn, such as in Borris-in-Ossory.  It is scandalous that the funding has been withdrawn in this instance and others where it would help to make practices more viable, attractive and sustainable.</p> <p>The Minister of State has responsibility for rural affairs and development and has an important role to play.  One of the cornerstones of the viability of any village or rural areas is a GP practice in order that families can feel secure and safe and have recourse to such a service.  Without it, the sustainability of a rural community is undermined.  Will the Minister of State lend her voice and support to this issue?  The criteria being applied by the HSE to practices such as that in Borris-in-Ossory are punitive, such as the rent it is seeking for the use of the HSE facilities and clinic there.  The rate is &euro;25 per sq. m, which the price for prime real estate.  The clinic is not located in Dublin, and not everywhere is thriving in the same manner as the capital or is as prosperous.  There is a strong case to be made for the HSE in this instance and others to waive the rental costs, at least in the first few years, in order that a practice can become established, take root and become committed, dedicated and viable for people in communities such as Borris-in-Ossory.  The HSE needs to make a better effort and promptly review the criteria it applies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Whelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2361"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2361&amp;amp;pid=JohnWhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am glad to hear it is part of an overall review, but time is of the essence because the Minister of State and her Government colleagues, including the Minister for Health, are facing an ongoing challenge across the regions of rural Ireland to fill vacancies for new GPs as they arise.</p></speech>

I gave the Government advance notice that, from June of last year, people would have to pay for that drug.  Since then, I have raised the issue here on numerous occasions, including directly with the Minister for Health in this House, with other colleagues.  Everyone seems to agree that a drug which costs no more than &euro;270 per month should be available under the drugs payment scheme but there is still no answer from the Department.</p> <p>I remind Members there are 1,500 people with MS who are dependent on this drug, which has improved people's mobility and allowed them to go back into the workforce and lead a full life.  I have met people who can no longer take the drug and who have regressed.  Some are back in wheelchairs, they can no longer work and their mobility has disimproved greatly.</p> <p>I was a little concerned when the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, came to the House.  I got a sense from him - perhaps Senator Craughwell will agree with me - that he actually did not believe in the merits of this drug, even though he said he has no particular role in it.  I know of people who are willing to come here to meet Senators of all parties to tell them how important this drug is to them.  I again ask the Leader to try to use his good offices and I ask him and all other colleagues to continue to push for the release of this drug that is greatly assisting or had greatly assisted 1,500 people up to now.  At 2.15 p.m. today I am meeting MS sufferers who have given their own testimonies about how important this drug is.  We are talking about &euro;207 a month, not &euro;3,000 a month.</p> <p>I will conclude by asking the Leader to arrange, as a matter of urgency, a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality in regard to policing and crime across the country.  In my own area, both in its urban and rural areas, crime is now rampant.  Garda&iacute; are so under-resourced that they cannot do the job they are charged to do.  In the town of Rush, there is not a shop that has not been robbed by armed robbers over the past year.  Garda stations have been closed in both urban and rural areas.  It is not just the station closures, however; it is the level of resourcing.  In the Dublin metropolitan area, the drugs squad in R district is down 50% in numbers, from having 32 garda&iacute; focusing on the scourge of drugs two years ago, to 16 now.  The same type of figures apply in every other unit across the city and county, and across the country, with 40% to 50% reductions in Garda resources.</p> <p>It is not acceptable.  The situation is now at crisis point.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House next week with the Minister for Justice and Equality in order for her to tell us whether the Government is happy to leave the streets of the towns and villages of this country to thieves and burglars.  That is what is happening.  People are not safe in their homes.</p></speech>

It is very sad news indeed.</p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate at some point on the issue of undocumented migrants.  It was very good to see how successful the St. Patrick's Day events around the world were and how well received generally were the Irish Ministers and visitors.  However, as the Taoiseach was raising the very important issue of the undocumented Irish in the US with President Barack Obama, the Migrant Rights Centre was highlighting the plight of undocumented migrants living in Ireland who may have been living and working here for many years, but who are undocumented to the extent that they do not have legal papers and legal permissions.  A proposal was put before the justice committee in February by the Migrant Rights Centre to regularise the position of the undocumented migrants here in Ireland.  This is something we could usefully debate in the House, perhaps while also debating the plight of the undocumented Irish living in the US, for whom we all hope there will be some resolution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would also welcome a debate on child care which, along with a number of other colleagues, I have called for on a number of occasions.  I note in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>an article regarding a study which makes some important findings around child care, particularly the high levels of child care provided informally by grandparents, which will be of great interest to all of us.  According to that study, 42% of child care is being provided by grandparents.  The study also shows the relatively low level of women's participation in the workforce and the relatively high levels of women who remain in the home, which is another issue we might usefully debate.  This is particularly notable in Ireland as compared to our European neighbours.<br/><br/>I commend all those who took part in attempting to view the solar eclipse on Monday.  I was one of the thousands of people who gathered in the Front Square in Trinity College hoping to catch a glimpse of the Sun being almost entirely covered by the Moon.  We were not so lucky on the east coast.  I think west coast viewers were luckier.  It was a remarkable event.  What was really remarkable was the level of public interest in the science, physics and astronomy around the event, which bodes well for the future of science and science research in Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the additional resignation from that campaign.  The first resignation was by Dr. Ciara Kelly.  Some ten days ago, the organisation, MyMind, withdrew from the campaign and I have recently received confirmation that St. Patrick's Mental Health Services has withdrawn from it.  I call on the other organisations who are lending their credibility and reputations to a Diageo campaign to withdraw from it.  We know from the World Health Organization and from experience in Ireland provided by the substance misuse group that the drinks industry has no role to play in public health campaigns.  I believe that is a view which this House should stand over.  </p> <p>This afternoon and again on Thursday, the Joint Committee on Health and Children will hold hearings on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I call on all Senators to fully support that Bill which provides us with an opportunity to do something about the drinking culture in Ireland and alcohol-related harm.  I also call on my colleagues to sign-up to and support the Alcohol Health Alliance Ireland, which comprises the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and Alcohol Action Ireland and calls on Members to ensure they have no links to the drinks industry.  I ask Senators to check out the Alcohol Health Alliance and give it their full support.</p> <p>I congratulate the Irish men and women's rugby teams.  Last weekend was a very proud weekend for Ireland.  It was great to see sporting success on the field.  On that note, I ask that Irish women's rugby be given greater prominence and support by all, including our national broadcaster.</p></speech>

This was a man who founded one of the most successful states in the world, Singapore, and did so without any violence or war.  I got to know Lee Kuan Yew some 30 years ago.  We kept in touch and communicated a great deal.  Singapore, although tiny, is now one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  This was achieved by Lee Kuan Yew.  I take this opportunity to express our sympathy to his family and to the people of Singapore.  Lee Kuan Yew was a wonderful man.  When I was in touch with him some time back I expressed my disappointment that according to him he ate only half of the plate of food served to him because he was trying to stay healthy and do his bit for world hunger and told him that that was not good for the grocery business.  He later responded that he had changed his mind and would in future only order half a plate of food.  I wanted to express my sympathy on the death of this man whom I got to know well over the past 30 years.</p> <p>There is another issue I would like to raise today, which I have been raising twice a year for 21 years now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I refer to the brighter evenings campaign.  This coming weekend we will get an extra hour of daylight in the evening, which we will lose in October.  The problem would be easily solved by moving to Central European Time.  There is quite a movement in Britain to do so and I believe it would be possible for us to do so too.  One benefit to more daylight hours is a reduced number of road accidents.  There are also huge benefits to be gained in the sport, entertainment and tourism sectors.  We should urge the British to do the same, because it is unlikely that we will find it easy to make a move on our own without Northern Ireland joining us at the same time.  </p><p>I wish to make one last point.  People from Spain have told me they were impressed by our social welfare system, because in Spain they get the dole only for one year, and after that they must do social work.  Therefore, in Spain one will see people cutting grass, cleaning streets, sweeping roads and doing similar jobs, because they do not get the dole forever.  If a person has received the dole for a year, he or she must undertake social work to retain the payment.  We should consider a similar scheme here, because it would encourage people to do a world of good for the area in which they live as well as helping the nation.</p></speech>

Coupled with such wins, we had significant St. Patrick's Day parades throughout the country and the world, with Ministers going out into the field to sell the country.  They promoted business and enterprise and represented the country well.  I wish to pay particular tribute to the fantastic St. Patrick's Day committees at home, who laid on fantastic parades throughout the country.  I had the pleasure of attending two of them, one in Ballinasloe and another in Ahascragh.  On both occasions I saw at first hand what community groups working together can achieve.  It was a fantastic coming together of business, community and sporting organisations and schools.  The general feedback from around the country was that the parades this year were bigger and better than ever before.  They show that the country is vibrant and prove that rural communities are alive and well.  We need to encourage communities to build on what was achieved over St. Patrick's week and weekend.  We can revitalise many of the communities that have felt a little neglected.  I was delighted to see the work that has been done by the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan.  We should invite her to the House again to have a further discussion on the revitalisation of rural Ireland.  We need to discuss how we can all work together to make this country better as we attempt to attract more visitors here, given the launch of the plan for tourism for the next ten years.</p></speech>

I will briefly mention three cases.  Two of the cases concern farmers in receipt of farm assist who are being forced to get an assessment from the Revenue Commissioners because they are not in the tax net.  The Revenue Commissioners has told me quite clearly that it does not want to know these people.  The most it can do is issue a statement of affairs written on official Revenue Commissioners paper, which the HSE, at a top level, will not accept.</p> <p>The Leader might say to me that this is an appropriate matter for a commencement debate, but I have raised it here before.  In one other case I got Deputy Kelleher, who knew the family concerned, to table a question in the D&aacute;il, but he received the same response.  I was spurred on to raise this matter today following a call the other day from a man about his 93-year old uncle, who is a retired priest but is currently in hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This elderly man received a letter stating that if he did not reply within six or eight weeks, his medical card would be withdrawn.  He did not respond in time because he was very ill in hospital and did not know the letter was at home, and now he has lost his card.  This type of approach is appalling.</p><p>I have spoken to various Ministers about this, and after a number of inquiries I have established that the Revenue Commissioners is not at fault.  In fact, I am told, Revenue has been inundated with telephone calls from elderly sick people inquiring about these issues.  These are people who were never in Revenue's net and do not want to be.  It is appalling that one branch of the State, the HSE, will not accept an assessment by another branch, the Revenue Commissioners.  These assessments should not be taking place in the first instance.  Many of these people have spent &euro;300 or &euro;400 going to an accountant to prove they owe nothing.  In one instance, a farmer in his late 50s lost his card even though he was diagnosed by a consultant as having severe arthritis and advised to seek disability benefit.  In another case, a person suffering from high blood pressure is no longer taking his medication because he cannot afford it.</p><p>I am asking that the Minister for Health come to the House to debate this issue.  I have tried all other avenues to get it resolved.  It is unacceptable that the elderly and most vulnerable in our society are being affected by this practice.  Nobody at the top of the HSE dealing with medical cards can get a handle on it.  Under the old system, the officer in the locality would know about the priest in his 90s being in hospital.  Lives may be lost because people cannot afford their medication.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister come here today to debate this issue and undertake to get a handle on it.  I was blaming the Revenue Commissioners, but after several telephone calls it became clear that the problem is that the HSE does not accept what Revenue issues in these circumstances.  The system is like a revolving door, with information going in one way and out the other.  We must ensure people who are entitled to medical cards actually get them.  It is appalling that a man in his 90s lost his medical card because he was in hospital for several weeks and unable to respond to the letter he received.  When I complained on his behalf, the response was that he would be sent a new application for an over-70s medical card.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

I also take the opportunity to congratulate the Roscommon football team, whose members are playing out of their skins at the moment.  They will have an awful job to avoid promotion.</p> <p>Will the Leader agree to a debate on the future of psychiatric services?  Back in the 1980s, the strategy, as set out in a document called Planning for the Future, was to establish hostels and day care centres while we still had a good community-based psychiatric service.  When the elderly people concerned were no longer able to avail of those services, they were put into long-term care due to their age and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and paranoid schizophrenia.  Now the HSE is looking to move these people on.  In &Aacute;ras Naomh Chaol&aacute;in in Roscommon, for example, residents who have lived there for 25 to 30 years are being vetted with a view to discharging them either into the community or into the private nursing home sector.  There is a serious threat hanging over the future of our day care centres and hostels.  Effectively, we seem to be going down the road of privatising mental health services, and the word "care" has been taken out of any consideration when dealing with older people.  That is what I am hearing from psychiatric nurses across the board.  Elderly people are being tossed around like rag dolls just to save money for the HSE.  It is totally unacceptable and I will not stand for it.  We must have an urgent debate on the matter in this House.</p></speech>

It shows that leadership was provided in the work they have done in achieving successful results at the weekend.</p> <p>The week beginning 28 March is organ donor week.  One of the problems in Ireland is that more than 600 people are waiting for kidney transplants.  The number of medical consultants manning the national renal transplant programme is four, half the number it should be, which is eight.  There is a need to focus on the recruitment of suitably qualified personnel to bring the number up to eight.  In the past two to three years we have faced major problems in dealing with this issue.  The cost of having a person on dialysis is approximately &euro;70,000 per annum.   When that amount is multiplied by 600, it gives one an idea of the net cost to the Irish taxpayer.  The cost of performing an operation is of the order of &euro;30,000.  Obviously, the cost of care thereafter is considerably reduced.  There is a need to focus on this issue during organ donor week - the importance of organ donation, the recruitment of suitable staff and the upgrading of this facility.  The day of cutbacks is over.  The day of expanding the service is here, and let us not miss that opportunity by failing to recruit people with the required expertise who can perform these transplants.  Let us reduce the number of people who are on dialysis.  That is something we should strive to do in the next two to three years.</p></speech>

My own children and my granddaughter were also born there.  It is a fine hospital with dedicated staff.  Now its reputation and the public's confidence in the hospital are being dragged into an unsavoury row between the HSE and HIQA.  I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on the forthright, common-sense approach he has taken in saying that neither of these agencies, under the auspices of the State, should be taking lumps out of each other in public and threatening legal action to prevent the publication of the independent HIQA report into past shortcomings at Portlaoise General Hospital.  The report apparently confirms our worst suspicions: that Portlaoise Hospital, under successive Governments and Ministers for health, was underfunded, understaffed, under-resourced, and subsequently undermined, to the point at which the staff could not safely carry out their duties, work and responsibilities.  Now that HIQA has investigated this, the agony and trauma for the families who lost their children are being unnecessarily prolonged, due in particular to the HSE's attempt to prevent the publication of this independent report.</p> <p>I am calling on the Minister, and I ask all colleagues here to call on the Minister, to knock heads together so that HIQA can get on with its job and put into the public domain its full, unvarnished report.  Then we can see for ourselves what went wrong, why it went wrong and what the shortcomings were, and establish for certain that they have been addressed.  I commend the Minister for putting additional staff, a new management team and new consultants into Portlaoise so that the public can have confidence.  Hundreds of families go there each year to have their babies.  It is not acceptable for the HSE to attempt to dilute or to change the contents of an independent HIQA report.  It should be ashamed of itself for causing additional trauma to families that have suffered enough.  I ask the Minister to immediately bring this unsavoury row to a close and have the HIQA report published in full.</p></speech>

Whole-of-life assurance is where an individual purchases cover that would provide a lump sum for his family, usually his spouse, in the event of his death.  It is different from most other types of insurance in that it contains no investment benefit, or only a very minuscule one - there is no surrender value, as such.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problem is that whole-of-life policies are subject to review after ten years and subsequently every five years.  The review is carried out by the insurance company.  It has all the cards and the customer has no cards.  The policyholder has to cough up the additional premium.  I am not talking about a normal investment whereby every year we are given the choice of coming up a little extra with the cost of living or the price index or whatever.  Some of these jumps in premiums are extraordinary.</p><p>I offer one example involving a person who took out one such whole-of-life policy when he was 50 years of age.  His premium was &euro;90 per month.  The cover for his wife in the event of his death would have been &euro;250,000, a good substantial consolation for the spouse.  Some 12 years later, the amount payable to the spouse has risen to &euro;300,000, in other words, by the sum of &euro;50,000.  Yet, the premium has gone from &euro;90 to &euro;700 per month, an absolutely shocking swingeing increase in the premium for this unfortunate.  There are many others like him.  According to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Financial Services Ombudsman has received 836 complaints of mis-selling that he can be sure of.  There are probably many more but he is certain of that number.  These people are trapped.  They have invested so much money after ten or 12 years, upwards of &euro;80,000, &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000 in premiums.  Moreover, the premium could jump up next month or next year by a further couple of hundred euro per month.  Where does that leave the customer?  Most of them have to give up, bail out and stop paying.  There is no recompense whatsoever and no lump sum for the spouse in the event of policyholder death.  There is something radically wrong here.  The ombudsman seems to be wary of getting involved.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, should take a personal, hands-on approach in this matter.  Hard-working individuals, middle-class people in the main, who have worked all their lives, probably have a small pension and are keen to ensure a little comfort and something to look forward to for their families when they depart are being trapped into throwing away investments of &euro;100,000 plus with nothing to show for it.</p></speech>

The day was filled with drama and excitement.  It was nail-biting stuff all the way to the end and there was a real cliffhanger ending.  Then, on Sunday, the ladies followed the men.  It was a wonderful display by the ladies.  The athleticism they displayed and the passion to win was exemplary.  The positive image of the weekend sporting endeavour of Ireland that has been brought throughout the world is the type of publicity for Ireland that cannot be bought.</p> <p>It is another example of the Government's investment in sports through the Irish Sports Council.  The Government has invested in recent years in the women in sports programme.  The results are evident now, particularly with the great win of the ladies.  This is going to encourage more and more young ladies to participate in sports.  It is going to be a wonderful inspiration for all these young women coming through, whether they are on our boxing, soccer, GAA or athletics teams.  Women in sport in Ireland is alive and well.  It brings out the best in people and a very positive attitude in life.</p> <p>Senator van Turnhout's commented on RTE and encouraged the broadcaster to show more women in sports.  Believe it or not, RTE was the only national broadcaster in Europe to show the rugby this past weekend.</p></speech>

However, on this occasion I would like to ask the Leader if he would write directly to the Minister for Justice and Equality asking for clarification about the fate of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I raised this previously and I was given information that was inaccurate.  I was told it was being refurbished for use as a police station.  This is not the case.  Great secrecy surrounds it.  It is indeed being refurbished, but the people refurbishing it have been told to say nothing about what they are doing it for.  Once again, it is another hostel, as if Dublin 1 had not played its role in this area.  We are stuffed with such institutions and it is time for another area of Dublin to take on some of the responsibility.  I have great empathy with people who are homeless and I do what I can to assist them, but there is no information about this and we are being lied to.  We do not know what follow-up services will be provided or whether the hostel will be wet or dry.  We do not know what monitoring there will be.  As I said, this is not a "not in our backyard" argument.  Our backyard is full and the authorities are doing nothing for the central area of Dublin.</p><p>I would also like to refer to what was said about the Diageo campaign.  Of course it is a farce.  A drinks company is there to increase its sale of alcohol.  It is not there to restrain any damage being done to young people.  There is only one way of saving this committee.  I have great respect for Fergus Finlay; I do not know what led him astray on this issue.  Diageo should immediately turn its funding into a donation, pure and simple, with no strings attached.  The Diageo member on the board should be withdrawn immediately, thereby ensuing that the committee is properly financed and seen clearly to be independent.  Otherwise, it should be shut down.</p></speech>

I could not agree more that it is inappropriate for Diageo to be involved in a campaign entitled "Stop Out-of-Control Drinking" and it is somewhat cynical, to say the least.  His suggestion is a sensible one and would bring some credence and credibility to the campaign.  Perhaps he would make his suggestion directly to Diageo because it is positive and would give it some credibility for a campaign which, if it was independent, would be extremely welcome.</p> <p>I commend Diageo on a recent initiative it has taken, namely, to put information on calories on all of its beverages.  We have an absurd situation in this country whereby a food producer must put every detail known to man or woman about the food it produces on its labels.  I am in favour of this, not least the information on calories and everything else, but we can consume drinks without knowing what is in them.  The fact that calories would be shown on Diageo's products is very welcome and I hope other drinks companies would follow its lead.  It is one very small measure which will help with the obesity crisis in Ireland.  Nonetheless, it has been shown to have a significant effect in other jurisdictions.  </p> <p>I also join Senator Coghlan in acknowledging the tremendous achievement of the men's and women's Irish rugby teams at the weekend.  It gives us a great lift and I congratulate all involved.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to once again offer my commiserations to the Kilmallock senior hurlers who have had a fantastic year which ended in heartbreak on St. Patrick's Day.  It was another heartbreak for Limerick teams in Croke Park and things do not become easier the more often they happen.  </p> <p>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  A matter was brought to my attention last week by a concerned customer of the post office network.  The person received a letter from the Department of Social Protection encouraging him or her to abandon collection of a payment in a post office in a local town and instead have it transferred electronically into a bank account.  The Department is trying to take customers away from using the post office service and make them fork out for bank charges for welfare payments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Heffernan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are hearing platitudes from the Government.  The establishment of the post office business development group, the aim of which is to examine how to further develop the post office network, was well heralded by the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs.  At the same time, another Department is trying to pull customers away from the post office network.  As the Leader knows, there is tremendous fear in parts of rural Ireland that have lost certain services, including banks, Garda stations and creameries.  It seems that the post office network is being undermined by one Department at a time when another Department under the same Government is committed to it.  One hand does not know what the other hand is doing.  The Government seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.  We need clarity.  We need to hear a response from the relevant Minister.  I am not even too sure anymore who that is supposed to be.  He or she needs to come in here and express support for the Irish Postmasters Union, which has said that no further transfer of post office transactions to the commercial banks should be pursued-----</p></speech>

The whole sporting weekend was a truly magnificent occasion that put our country on the sporting map of the world and will also enhance our bid to host the Rugby World Cup in this country in 2023.</p> <p>I want to refer briefly to the new tourism strategy, which was launched yesterday by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the absolutely spectacular setting of Kilkenny Castle.  I have never been in anything like it.  I have to add that Kilkenny is a spectacular city on a beautiful day.  The new tourism strategy, People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025, sets out a range of objectives and aims to grow tourism over the next decade on a phased basis.  It is envisaged that the number of overseas visitors will increase to 10 million, from last year's figure of 7.6 million, and that they will spend &euro;5 billion in our country.  It is also envisaged that the number of people working in the industry will increase from 200,000 to 250,000.  As I have said on a few occasions, we have witnessed four years of growth in the number of overseas visitors.</p></speech>

T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; tuaithe.  It is important that we ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, to come back to the House to discuss the Leader programme and particularly the chaos that is happening at the moment in the rural development area.  I have heard many Government spokespersons lauding the amount of money that is being allocated under the Leader programme.  While every penny provided under that programme is welcome, the budgets in some counties are being cut by up to 70% compared with what was there previously.  I think the centralisation of the whole rural development programme under the county councils is a detrimental step.  In my own area of Connemara, we are seeing threats to organisations like Forum Connemara and Comhar na nOil&eacute;an, which have been delivering the Leader programme and previously delivered the local development social inclusion programme.  The future of such organisations is very much in question.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Health to come to this House to debate another issue, namely, the fact that the HSE in the west of Ireland owes approximately &euro;7.5 million to approximately 400 social care workers in counties Galway and Roscommon in respect of unpaid wages stretching back over a decade.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HSE has acknowledged that it owes the money to workers and has been directed by the Labour Court to pay the debt, but it refuses to do so.  The people in question are social care workers and leaders who have been working with the Brothers of Charity Services and Ability West - those who were formerly known as house parents.  This issue affects 400 workers.  The HSE has paid in full other categories of worker, including managers, nurses and care assistants, but have withheld these so-called twilight payments from social care workers.  In regions such as Dublin, their peers have been reimbursed, as is only right and proper, but it is unacceptable that a Labour Court recommendation has not been upheld by an organisation such as the HSE.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the issue with us and to explain to us what he will do to make sure these workers' rights are vindicated, as they should be.  It is unacceptable, and I hope other Senators agree with my call.</p></speech>

I do not agree with many comments made by Fergus Finlay, but it was clear that there was a written memorandum of understanding from Diageo that this group would act independently.  What I am concerned about is a certain bullying tendency to try to turn groups and individuals in our society into pariahs and not even allow them on board when it comes to assisting them to do good in some way.  My approach to Diageo would be to accept their money and then stun them with my ingratitude in proposing all sorts of policy measures that they would not like.  That would be the more mature approach to this initiative.  Let all companies be involved in helping to promote a culture that avoids out-of-control drinking, and let us decide separately on stringent measures to restrict their activities.  It is the same with tobacco.  Let us ban smoking or not ban smoking, but if we do not, we have to allow companies to do business in our society.  What should we say to a young woman working in a public relations firm that works for a tobacco company?  Should she be ashamed of herself-----</p></speech>

Let us stun the company with our ingratitude as we propose measures it will not like.</p> <p>I compliment the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on its excellent dialogue and engagement yesterday with different groups on the issue of farm safety.  It is a vitally important issue.  Although I am not a member of the committee, I took part in the meeting, and it was impressive to hear from young men such as Patrick Duffy and Peter Gohery, who is a farm accident survivor.  They have things of tremendous importance to say to us about how we need to provide resources for education in our schools and across society about farm safety and to assist those who have survived.  I compliment everybody involved.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to update the House on farm safety the next time he is here?  Will he also ask him to examine the initiatives that have been taken and to consider the report that will follow from this public consultation about what needs to be done now?</p></speech>

This is outrageous.  If one was a member of a residents' association and one of one's officers went off and had meetings and there were no records of them, there would be outrage among the community.  There was a call this morning to bring the Minister in here.  I believe it is time to bring the chief executive of Ireland to this House to explain and put clearly on the record what has taken place regarding these private meetings because I have no doubt that at some stage in the future, we will find this country in front of the courts explaining some verbal agreement made at these meetings.  It is simply not good enough.</p><p>Have we learned nothing in this country?  To have private meetings between the supplier of a service and a Minister is simply not good enough.  I am sorry for standing on my feet and calling this into question but I have received phone calls from friends and relations.  It is all over social media.  People talk about the demonstration on Saturday.  I had never attended a demonstration until the water issue arose.  I go there because I am interested in what people have to say.  I meet ordinary decent working people.  It is not about water in many cases.  It is about their total frustration with the way the world has gone.  I am calling for a debate with the Taoiseach so we can put on the record of this House exactly what took place between the then Minister and the chairman of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

I never heard a contradiction like it.</p> <p>I reiterate what Senator Heffernan said about the post offices and the general secretary and president of the Irish Postmasters Union.  I spoke about this in the media last week and I call on the Minister for Social Protection to come in here and tell us how many of these letters are being sent out and who they are being sent to.   They are being sent to pensioners to get them to transfer their pensions and social welfare payments to banks.  Once I hear that word, I know we are once again capitulating to the banks.  I know it might involve only a certain section of social welfare recipients because many people, including many single mothers, would not have a bank account.  However, I thought the post offices were going to be the heartbeat of our villages and towns and that we were looking at ways of making them the heart beat of our villages and towns.  Capitulating to the banks is not the way to go because most people who come into the post office to get their small pensions use the physicality of money to pay for their gas or electricity, buy their vegetables or go to the chemist so an element of community service is being offered by the post offices.  Instead of capitulating to the banks to give them tranches of money they can then bet on the markets with, we were supposed to be developing the post offices electronically so that they would be able to receive money and put it into accounts or process motor taxation.  This is very serious because it is a form of chipping away that happens under the radar.  Senator Heffernan is right about this.  Could the Minister come to the House to tell me the extent of this, who the letters are being sent to, who thought it up, who thinks it is a good idea, what banks will receive payments and why we are taking potshots at the very core of what we believe villages and towns to be, namely, the post office?  The post office carries out community service that is unparalleled across our country.  This is a very serious question so could the Minister come in here to answer it realistically?  </p></speech>

There is no doubt that the benefits of this drug are clearly evident from many people who receive it so I will try to get an update from the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Senator will be aware, the company provided this drug free of charge initially, but it now costs up to &euro;270 a month.  I will try to get an update from the Minister on that matter.</p><p>The Senator also called for a debate on the under-resourcing of the Garda.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has given a commitment to come to the House as soon as her diary permits following the passage of a number of Bills, some of which will go through the House later this week and next week.  The Garda network had been unchanged since 1922 before the closure of some Garda stations but we still have 564 stations, which is significantly more than in comparable jurisdictions such as Scotland and Northern Ireland, and there will be no further closures.  A total of 94% of the stations that were closed were open for only three hours or less a day.  Closures did not result in a reduction in Garda numbers but they facilitated 61,000 additional man hours for front-line services.  The force was given capital allocation of &euro;42 million and &euro;27.5 million will be invested in the Garda fleet between 2012 and 2015, including &euro;10 million for 370 new vehicles this year.  The Government has provided the force with at least &euro;414 million more than Fianna F&aacute;il proposed for the same period.  Templemore training college has reopened with 300 new recruits entering.  They are the first since Fianna F&aacute;il stopped recruitment in 2009.</p><p>Tackling crime and burglaries is a top priority of Government and the Garda will shortly publish an anti-crime strategy.  The civilianisation of many functions has begun, ensuring more garda&iacute; are on the beat.  The Government is also examining a law to deal with repeat offenders, including repeat burglars.  It is unfair to suggest the force is under-resourced because the data indicate that this is far from the case.</p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the horrific plane crash in the French Alps, which we only learned of in recent hours.  Our hearts go out to all the families affected by the crash.  She also called for debates on undocumented migrants in Ireland and on child care.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to come to the House for a debate on child care and I hope to have a date for that soon.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout and many others raised the issue of Diageo and the Stop Out of Control Drinking campaign.  Some Members urged people to step down from the campaign committee or called for the committee's abolition while others, such as Senator Mullen, suggested different ways to deal with this issue.  It will be addressed by the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with alcohol abuse and I am sure there will be many more comments on this.</p><p>Many Members, including Senator van Turnhout again, complimented our sporting heroes on the Irish rugby teams.  I am glad a Waterford lady, Niamh Briggs, captained the Irish women's team.  I am also glad our national broadcaster covered their game on Sunday.  These players are an example to all and I take on board Senator Eamonn Coghlan's comments on the work of the Irish Sports Council regarding the funding of women in sport, which is bearing fruit.</p><p>Senator Quinn mentioned the death of the founder of the state of Singapore and he highlighted his meetings with him.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Quinn also raised the brighter evenings campaign, as he has done on many occasions.  As he said, if it is to happen, it must happen in conjunction with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I know there have been ongoing negotiations in that regard.  I think Deputy David Stanton and the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality have been favourably disposed towards this move to join central European time.  </p><p>Senator Mullins complimented the St Patrick's Day committees and the great voluntary and community effort by all involved.  I think we would all agree with that.  Senator Mullins also called for a further debate on the revitalisation of rural Ireland.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan spoke about medical cards, the anomalies in the system and the need for more joined-up thinking between State agencies, in particular the Revenue Commissioners and the HSE.  I know the case in question is totally unacceptable.  Obviously, the solution to it will be giving medical cards to everybody over 70 but that does not solve the problem.  If we get the details from Senator O'Donovan, I will take it up with the Minister for Health today.  If we do not get a satisfactory answer, the Senator might proceed in respect of an amendment to the Order of Business but I will take up this particular case.  It seems ludicrous that the HSE does not look at a person's date of birth when it is looking for this type of information.  The person is 93.  Common sense obviously does not come into it when one hears of cases like that.  </p><p>Senator Kelly called for a debate on the future of psychiatric services.  I will try to arrange that with the Minister.  </p><p>I note Senator Barrett's points relating to the strategy for science.  He congratulated poet Michael Longley on receiving the freedom of Belfast city.  I know the issue of Aer Lingus has been debated at length in the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and I am sure it will continue to be debated in that forum.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke spoke about organ donor week and the need to focus on the recruitment of consultants in that area to bring the complement from four to eight.  There is obviously a need to focus on the recruitment of consultants in many disciplines because we are so short of consultants.  </p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to the Right2Water campaign and said that it was good that so many people took part and that it was a peaceful protest.  I think everybody agrees with peaceful protest.  Certainly, we will have another Bill relating to Irish Water and penalties and I am sure we will have ample time to debate that when the Bill comes before the House.  Over 1.3 million people - over two thirds of the population - have registered with Irish Water.  I am sure many others will register in the future.</p><p>Senator Whelan spoke about Portlaoise General Hospital and outlined the differences between HIQA and the HSE and the need for the Minister to intervene to ensure the publication of this report.  Senator Whelan also outlined the significant increase in investment in the hospital in recent times.  The Minister has outlined his disquiet at two State agencies threatening to take legal action against each other, which is not acceptable.  I am sure the Minister has his finger on the pulse in this regard.  When the report is published, we may be in a position to debate it in this House.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan outlined the difficulties and anomalies relating to whole-of-life assurance policies.  If he puts this topic down as a Commencement debate topic, he might get a clear message from the Department of Finance about those policies.  </p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke about the Irish rugby teams and complimented the Irish Sports Council on its work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Norris spoke about Fitzgibbon Street Garda station.  Perhaps the Senator might table this for a Commencement Debate in order to get the full details of what is going on.  I do not think we should have secrecy relating to this station or any place where hostels are located.  The public should be consulted in areas where such developments are taking place.  I suggest that a Commencement debate on that matter might give the Senator more answers than I can give.</p></speech>

Senator Norris argued that Diageo should turn its funding into a donation and withdraw its nominee from the board.  This may assist in clarifying the situation.</p> <p>Senator Noone also spoke about drinks companies, and mentioned calorie counting.  Diageo intends introducing this and urges other drinks companies to do likewise.</p> <p>In response to Senator Heffernan, they say all politics is local.  The Senator commiserated with the Kilmallock senior hurlers, who lost on St. Patrick's Day.  Senators Heffernan and O'Donnell spoke about An Post and about the Department of Social Protection sending out letters asking people to have pensions and social welfare payments paid into bank accounts.  It is despicable for the Department to send out such letters when we are trying to encourage people to use post offices the length and breadth of the country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#BB00500"><p>I certainly agree that the Minister should investigate that, and I will bring the matter to her attention today and try to get answers.  I would point out that 288 post offices closed down between 2005 and 2011 and that 22 post offices have closed since this Government came to power.  Those statistics speak volumes for the efforts of the Government to retain post offices.  However, I do not think the letters going out from the Department of Social Protection are doing anything to support that effort.</p> <p>Senator Brennan spoke about the tourism policy of the Government and the need to maintain the momentum.  He spoke about the 7.6 million visitors last year and the increase in jobs over the years because of this increase in visitors.  </p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about HSE social care workers.  He suggested that many of them have unpaid wages and that people in similar cases have been paid in Dublin but not in the west of Ireland.  The Senator might put down a topic for the Commencement debate.  If people have been paid in Dublin, I see no reason they should not be paid in the rest of the country.  </p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about how he differed from colleagues in respect of the Stop Out-of-Control Drinking campaign, dubbing comment from some Members "moral posturing".  That is his personal opinion.</p></speech>

The committee sat from 2 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.   It was an excellent day's work and I compliment the Members who attended.  I had hoped there would be more, but I compliment other Members who joined in as well.  When the report is complete, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will come to the House to comment on it.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about meetings between Bord G&aacute;is and the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the fact that some minutes were not recorded.  The Senator might put down a topic for Commencement debate to get the full details from the Department as to why the minutes were not recorded.  </p> <p>I referred previously to the point made by Senator O'Donnell about post offices.  The Senator sought information about the extent of the notifications that have gone out from the Department of Social Protection.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

It is a child-centred Bill aimed at addressing the legal situation of children living in diverse families, which delivers on the programme for Government commitment to "modernise and reform outdated elements of family law".</p> <p>Intensive work has been undertaken on the Bill since the general scheme was published for consultation in January 2014.  The general scheme was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and I thank the committee for the valuable work undertaken as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and for organising a public consultation process, which received approximately 38 submissions.  The general scheme was revised in light of the recommendations made by the joint committee and the Bill before the House is based on the revised general scheme published on 23 September 2014.  Since the Bill's publication on 19 February, I have organised a series of briefings for the political parties and Independent Members to inform them of its provisions.  I have also held specific briefings for Senators.  I would like, in this regard, to thank Senators for their constructive engagement with the Bill.</p> <p>The starting point in this legislation is the best interests of children.  This is the golden thread running through it.  The legislation sets out new and updated provisions on guardianship, custody and access for children living with their married parents, their unmarried parents, with a parent and the parent's partner or with a grandparent or other relative.  It also sets out the rules under which parentage of a child born through donor-assisted human reproduction may be established.  The Bill does not alter in any way the parentage of children conceived naturally or through fertility treatment which does not involve the use of donor gametes.  The parents of these children, who comprise the vast majority of children in Ireland, will continue to be their birth mother and their biological father.</p> <p>However, the technology of assisted human reproduction, AHR, has created a new reality.  Children are currently being born in Ireland to parents who have used donor gametes to enable them to have a child.  Ten years ago, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction alerted us to the need for action on this issue.  It noted in 2005 that, "The issue of legal parentage in Ireland of children born through donor programmes is complicated by the absence of legislation".  Under the law as it stands, the birth mother of a donor-conceived child has certainty as to her situation.  Case law confirms that she is the mother of the child, regardless of whether she is genetically linked to that child.  Under the provisions of the Bill, she will continue to be the mother of her child.  The Bill will not change existing provisions regarding the rights of a birth mother, including of a donor-conceived child.  She will continue to be regarded as the child's mother.  She will be recorded as the child's mother on that child's birth certificate.</p> <p>The Bill seeks to address the situation of the intending second parent of a donor-conceived child.  Under existing law, the situation of a second parent of a donor-conceived child is much more uncertain.  The law currently applies a presumption of paternity in favour of a married father.  This allows the married father of a donor-conceived child to be presumed to be the child's father, even if he is not biologically linked to the child.  However, if that presumption is tested such as in the event of a dispute between both parents and that man is found not to be the biological parent of that child, then he loses the right to be the child's parent.  At the moment, the only route by which that man can regain parentage of the child is through adoption, which also requires the birth mother to adopt the child.  This would not be possible if there is a dispute between the parents or if the child has attained the age of 18.  This example underscores the importance of making new provisions that can secure the legal relationship of that father with his child.  The situation even of a married man's fatherhood of a donor-conceived child is vulnerable to being overturned.  It is even more difficult for the second member of a female same-sex couple.  She has no means at present of being recognised as the parent of a child who she may be jointly raising with her partner.</p> <p>The Government has given certainty in the legislation to donor-conceived children regarding their parentage.  It will enable those who have brought a child into being in mutual love and commitment to each other and to the child to be recognised as the child's parents.  The Bill addresses the current anomalous situation whereby the second person, who may have shared in all of the joys and fears of pregnancy and birth, is recognised as a stranger in law to a child.  It rectifies this situation and provides a pathway to parentage for the second parent.  Provisions which recognise two people as the child's legal parents, with full responsibility for caring for and raising the child, are directly beneficial to a child.</p> <p>At the same time, the Bill recognises the importance of ensuring a donor-conceived child can know his or her genetic identity.  The Oireachtas joint committee strongly recommended that provisions be included in the Bill to safeguard the child's right to know her or his identity.  This was also a priority for the Ombudsman for Children in a submission she made at the time.  Accordingly, provision has been made for the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register, which will be the mechanism through which a donor-conceived child can trace her or his genetic identity.  Equally, anonymous donation of gametes is being prohibited, except for limited exceptions, which I will explain, to ensure that donor-conceived children will have the possibility of tracing their identity.</p> <p>I wish to clarify, however, that this Bill is strictly about the parentage issues that arise.  The broader regulation of assisted human reproduction will be undertaken by the Minister for Health in separate legislation, the draft general scheme of which is currently being developed.  It became clear, when developing this Bill, as was also indicated by the Oireachtas joint committee, that we could not safely include parentage provisions in respect of donor-conceived children without underpinning them with provisions on identity and consent and without addressing the issue of anonymous donations.  We have dealt with those issue but I emphasise that the Department of Health will deal with the broad issues that arise in respect of AHR and DAHR.</p> <p>I have had discussions with representatives of various clinics and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology about issues of concern to them.  There has been commentary in favour of continuing to use anonymous donations.  The argument has been made that prohibiting anonymous donations cuts across parental autonomy.  However, our experience, for example, on adoption has shown that it is important for a person to have the means of knowing the truth as to their origins.  Equally, there is a growing consensus internationally that it is best practice for states to ban anonymous donation and to provide mechanisms for a donor-conceived child to trace his or her genetic origins.  A number of jurisdictions have prohibited anonymous gamete donation, including Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.  Banning anonymous donations to safeguard the child's right to identity is part of the child-centred ethos of this Bill.</p> <p>Adoption is another critical child-centred issue addressed in the Bill.  As I have indicated previously, adoption law has never contained a restriction based on the sexual orientation of an adopter.  The important question is whether the proposed adoption is in the best interests of the child concerned.  The provisions in the Bill will, for the first time, enable civil partnered or cohabiting couples to adopt jointly.  Many people did not realise that cohabiting couples currently cannot apply to adopt jointly.  However, this can only happen following a full assessment while all the usual measures relating to adoption must be followed to ensure the proposed adoption is in the best interests of that child.  Adoption is a child welfare measure.  The suitability criteria in place will continue to apply.  Under these provisions, each couple will be assessed on whether they are suitable to raise the child and to fulfil all parental duties towards that child.  A single person will continue to be assessed on that basis.  No fundamental changes are proposed to adoption procedures, under which a child's birth mother has an extensive input into who may adopt her child and is involved throughout the process in outlining what she considers to be in the best interests of her child.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, many of the likely adoptions will be in-family adoptions in which the child's parent and the parent's partner jointly adopt the child.  <br/><br/>The provisions on guardianship are likely to have the widest application as they will benefit children living in a wide range of family situations.  The Bill makes provision for a step-parent, a civil partner or a parent's cohabitant of not less than three years' duration to apply to the court to become a guardian where he or she has co-parented the child for two years.  These guardians will generally have restricted powers limited to decisions on day-to-day matters, which we know often arise and cause great difficulty because the powers now being provided do not exist, other than where it is in the child's best interests for the guardian to have full guardianship powers.  As such, they strike a careful balance between the responsibilities of parents and the need for the person caring for a child on a daily basis to be able to take day-to-day decisions on behalf of that child.<br/><br/>During debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the guardianship rights of non-marital fathers more generally were raised by a number of Deputies.  As Senators will be aware, the Bill provides for a non-marital father to be automatic guardian of his child if he has lived with the child's mother for 12 months, including at least three months with mother and child following the child's birth.  A change was made in this area following committee discussion on this issue.  The period of cohabitation can of course take place at any time before the child turns 18.  This provision creates a new automatic mechanism under which non-marital fathers can become guardians of their children, in addition to the existing mechanisms, which will remain in place.  As Senators will be aware, these include the making of a statutory declaration, through which a non-marital father can easily acquire guardianship once the declaration has been signed by the father and mother, duly witnessed.  The other option is to apply to the court for guardianship.  As emerged during the D&aacute;il debate on this issue, with which I am sure Senators are familiar, many fathers are not aware of the statutory declaration option.  As a result of that debate I have taken a number of initiatives to try to deal with some of the issues arising in that regard.<br/><br/>I am conscious of the need to make it easier for non-marital fathers to acquire guardianship.  This is the intention underpinning the cohabitation provision.  It is quite a radical change in terms of the rights of non-marital fathers.  I have devised a new scheme whereby it will be possible for non-marital parents to sign the statutory declaration when registering or re-registering their child's birth.  Many non-marital fathers believe that if their name is on the birth certificate this gives them guardianship rights.  However, that is not the case.  They must also have signed a statutory declaration.  I felt that by bringing the two together it would be likely that more non-marital fathers would assert their rights at the point of registration.  I have arranged with the Minister for Social Protection that, at the point of registration of the child's birth, the parents will be informed that the inclusion of the father's name on the birth certificate does not in itself confer guardianship.  This is to dispel the mistaken impression of many non-marital fathers that their being named on the child's birth certificate is enough to acquire guardianship.  The couple will be given a copy of the statutory declaration.  It will be possible for them to sign the declaration in the presence of a registrar, at no charge, either at that time or within a fortnight.  Obviously, they can still make the declaration at any later time, but when doing so at the same time as birth registration, the timeframe allowed is a fortnight.  <br/><br/>With the agreement of the Minister for Social Protection, I have included in this Bill legislative changes to the Civil Registration Act 2004 which will give registrars the authority to witness statutory declarations for guardianship.  I have also removed the requirement in section 2(4)(<i>d</i>) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 which required the parents to have made arrangements in relation to custody of and access to the child prior to signing the statutory declaration.  Again, this is an attempt to remove barriers.  I am confident that these changes will make it much easier for non-marital fathers to avail of the statutory declaration mechanism to acquire guardianship.  I have also given a commitment that the Department will review these provisions within two years to ensure they are working effectively.  My objective is to facilitate as many non-marital fathers as possible to become guardians.  At the same time, it is important to ensure that a child's best interests are safeguarded and that neither the child nor the mother should be put at risk as a result of these provisions.  A number of Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il spoke about non-marital fathers acquiring rights but at the same time said there should be exceptions, such as in rape or domestic violence cases.  However, when it comes to defining what the exceptions should be the task becomes quite difficult.  Others argued that one should not make assumptions about all fathers because some fathers would be in those situations, which is also an important point.<br/><br/>Some organisations have raised the issue of a central register for statutory declarations.  The establishment of such a register requires advance planning so that adequate systems can be devised with regard to data accuracy, updating of information and data protection.  I want to prevent the register from becoming an additional element of red tape for a non-marital father, whereby a declaration would have to be registered for it to be valid.  It is preferable to have a repository in which non-marital parents could deposit a statutory declaration so they have security in terms of seeking additional copies of the declaration if the original copy were lost or destroyed.  It is interesting to note that we have not up to now had in place a mechanism to guard these documents.  Currently, people keep these documents themselves, which is in line with the arrangements for many other legal documents.  However, some people would argue that a central register is so basic that we should have had one in place.  It will be difficult to establish a register immediately, but I have announced my intention to develop a pilot project to establish a voluntary repository into which non-marital parents can deposit copies of statutory declarations.  The lessons from the pilot project will inform us on whether to proceed with the establishment of a national repository.  I have made some inquiries into the type of work that would need to be done, and it is quite substantial.<br/><br/>I will now turn to the description of the Bill.  Part 1 sets out standard clauses in terms of collective citation, interpretation and expenses.  On the issue of commencement, I have taken into account the concerns raised with me that couples currently undergoing fertility treatments might have their treatment suspended because of the move from anonymous to non-anonymous procedures.  Accordingly, I have agreed with the Minister for Health that the provisions relating to donor-assisted human reproduction will not be commenced for a minimum period of one year post-enactment.  This is to allow for couples currently going through fertility treatments in Irish clinics to complete those treatments.  Putting in place a transitional period of a minimum of one year will allow for an orderly transition to the new arrangements.  The Minister for Health, in advance of the establishment of an authority, will have responsibility in this area and for commencing these provisions, as the unit tasked with setting up the national donor-conceived person register will be under his or her auspices on an interim basis.  Similarly, the Minister will have responsibility for preparing the regulations that will underpin these provisions.<br/><br/>Part 2 deals with parentage in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction.  A number of important key conditions must be fulfilled if parentage is being assigned.  The donor-assisted human reproduction will have to take place in a clinical setting; the birth mother and the intending second parent must give consent in advance that they will both be the parents of any child born through donor-assisted human reproduction, and the donor will also have to state in advance of the procedure that he or she is a donor and does not intend to be a parent of the child.  If these conditions are fulfilled, the intending parent will be recognised as a second parent under section 5.  Detailed work needs to be done in terms of the consent forms and regulations, which work will be undertaken after the enactment of this Bill.  It will be for the Department of Health to work out the details in that regard.  Also, to ensure clinics can work with their international partners in this area, they will need advance notice regarding what will be involved in terms of consent forms and regulations.<br/><br/>The Bill makes provision for retrospective recognition of the parentage of certain donor-conceived children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where a child is born in the State as a result of donor-assisted human reproduction treatment carried out before the commencement of the Bill, sections 20 to 22 outline the procedure that will apply.  These are very detailed procedures.  There has been a lot of contact from parents who are in this situation.  I am sure many Senators have received letters from individuals who are in this situation.  Having considered the matter, we felt we should include the following mechanism.  If certain conditions are fulfilled, the couple can apply to the District Court or the Circuit Court for a declaration of parentage and the court can issue the declaration if it considers it to be in the child's best interests.  Each of these cases will be dealt with individually according to the provisions of this Bill and in a court setting provided certain conditions are met.</p><p>Part 3, which I will not go into detail about, sets out the obligations that will apply to donor-assisted human reproduction facilities.  They will be prohibited from using anonymous gametes other than in two exceptions.</p><p>Part 3 also sets out the procedure that will apply in terms of accessing information from the national donor-conceived person register.  A donor-conceived child, once over 18 years, will be able to seek, from the register, all the information held on the donor.  I amended these provisions on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure they fully reflected the objective of enabling the child to trace his or her genetic identity.  I was not given legal advice but I had to allow for an exception.  For example, there could be an exception if providing the information totally compromised the safety of the child or the donor.  I would consider that to be truly exceptional if that situation were to arise.  Of course, if it were refused, the case could still be appealed in court.  That means there would still be the possibility for the person who had that information refused to go to court.</p><p>Part 4 sets out the provisions that will apply with regard to guardianship.  In addition to the provisions already mentioned, a guardian parent will be able to appoint a temporary guardian, where the parent is suffering from serious illness or injury which prevents him or her from exercising his or her guardianship responsibilities in respect of the child.  This is a practical arrangement that would help families where this situation arose.  The appointment can only be activated through a court-based process to ensure the best interests of the child are properly considered.</p><p>Part 4 also enables a relative to apply for custody of a child.  A parent's spouse or civil partner, or a parent's cohabitant of not less than three years' duration, can apply for custody where she or he shared parenting of the child for two years.  A person can apply for custody if she or he has parented the child for a year and if there is no parent or guardian willing or able to exercise the powers and responsibilities of guardianship.  That means we are allowing for the range of different situations that can arise in families and where issues of custody and guardianship emerge.</p><p>Important provisions have also been included to enable grandparents or other relatives to have access more easily to a child in the context of relationship breakdown.  That means we have simplified the process for a grandparent to seek access or custody.  Obviously the process would still be done in a court setting but is now a single procedure.  Before this it was a two-step process which put a lot of grandparents off even thinking about doing so.</p><p>The Bill requires the child's best interests to be the paramount consideration in any of these decisions on guardianship, custody and access.  For the first time in legislation we have outlined a series of contexts and criteria for making a decision on a child's best interests.  We have also gone into details about the range of issues a court should consider in making a determination, for example, the quality of the relationships with those involved and whether there is any question of household violence, which is very important because of the potential impact on the child's safety and well-being.  Provision is also made for the child's views to be heard either directly in the court or by using an expert to speak to the child.  For the first time in legislation there is a set of enforcement procedures on custody and access.</p><p>Part 5 makes technical amendments.  Part 6 amends the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.  There are also some changes to the Status of Children Act as well.  Part 8 amends family law to enable the court to order maintenance payments by the cohabiting partner of a child's parent for the benefit of the dependent child and to make associated provisions.  I have already spoken about the changes to the Civil Registration Act which provides for registration.  Section 93 inserts a new section in the Civil Registration Act which I mentioned.</p><p>Section 95 deals with the situation of donor-conceived children who are born through a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure that has taken place before the Act is commenced.  If the parents have secured a court order under section 21 or 22 declaring them to be the parents of the child, they can have the child's birth re-registered.  This provision will enable the second parent to be registered as the child's parent on the child's birth certificate.</p><p>Part 10 amends the Passports Act.  It enables the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in certain circumstances to issue a passport to a child living outside the State and without the consent of a guardian.  Part 11 amends the Adoption Act.  I have already spoken about the changes in this section.</p><p>Part 12 amends the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 to extend the protections of that Act to dependent children of one or both civil partners.  These protections relate to maintenance and the protection of the family home.  They provide for a civil partner to have a potential maintenance liability in respect of a dependent child of the civil partners.</p><p>Part 13 makes a number of changes to other Acts stemming from the provisions of this Bill, for example, legislation on adoptive leave and maternity protection which are a consequence of the changes in the Bill.  We are amending the Bill in order that various people will be entitled to apply for leave.</p><p>The Children and Family Relationships Bill is a child-centred and family-centred Bill which will benefit hundreds of thousands of children.  It will give stability and certainty to the children of atypical families in terms of their parentage and guardianship.  It will place, as I hope I have illustrated, a child's best interests at the heart of key decisions concerning a child's life.  It will give the child a voice in the process.  I am proud and pleased to be associated with a Bill which sets a child-focused blueprint for family law.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#HH00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  There is no doubt that Irish family law is totally out of date and does not reflect the diversity of modern families.  It is focused generally, as the Minister has said, on marital families and does not provide adequate protection or support for those living in other forms of loving family environments.  That is a huge gap given that one in four children live in a non-marital family, 215,000 families are headed by single parents, 49,000 families are headed by cohabiting parents, 230 families, which is a relatively small number, are headed by same-sex parents, and many other families are headed by grandparents, foster parents and others who have taken the place of the child's biological parents.  For too long, Irish family law has treated non-marital families as invisible and, as a result, has denied children the legal protection and support they deserve.</p> <p>The fact that many people parent without guardianship rights causes a wide range of problems.  At the most basic level, it means non-guardians cannot make simple day-to-day decisions such as signing a letter to give permission for a child to go on a school trip.  They cannot consent to medical treatment.  In the event of a biological parent dying, the child has no legal relationship with their other parent.  This means, for example, that someone who has been a parent to the child on a full-time basis for 15 to 17 years of that child's life is deemed not to be their parent in the eyes of the law.  This is also the case in family breakdown situations and is extremely distressing for all concerned.  The legislation is welcome in this regard.  As the Minister has said, the Bill alters substantially the existing guardianship arrangements to address those issues.</p> <p>The legislation clarifies the parentage of children born through assisted human reproduction which is long overdue.  It also provides for a range of other improvements in family law, including provisions for easier access for grandparents, which is important.  When a relationship breaks down, it is important for a child to have as much stability as possible in his or her life and to maintain relationships with all of those in his or her wider family circle, which is in the best interests of the child, regardless of how the two adults want to fight it out.</p> <p>The legislation will affect a wide range of families and, therefore, it is important the legislation is given proper scrutiny both inside and outside of this House.  I am somewhat concerned about the media coverage given to the legislation.  Due to it progressing at a similar time to the marriage equality referendum, some groups have deliberately misrepresented the Bill.  In fact, having listening to some of the debates one would think we were debating a same-sex adoption Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reality is that same-sex families make up a minuscule proportion of the families that will be affected by this legislation.  In fact, assisted human reproduction is mostly availed of by heterosexual couples, while the vast majority of adoptions involve step parents or other relatives.  Moreover, the adoption rate in Ireland is very low.  Of the 70,000 children born here last year, only 122 were adopted domestically, most of them, as I indicated, by step parents or other relatives.</p><p>In all cases, the determining factor under Irish law, before and after this Bill is enacted, is the best interests of the child.  I have a huge personal interest in this area, as have others in this House, and it is important to reiterate that the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration.  No adult, gay or straight, has a right to adopt; all they have is an opportunity to be considered.  The courts will always consider what is best for the child and that will continue to be the case after this Bill passes.  It is unfortunate that some people have deliberately sought to portray the legislation as something it is not, which has distracted from a broader consideration of the overall impact of the provisions.  That is a shame because it is important that all those affected by it understand how the Bill will affect their lives, be they single parents, step parents, grandparents, foster parents or others affected by the various issues involved.</p><p>Overall, the Bill is a very progressive provision that will be of huge benefit to a wide range of families.  It is a welcome and important step forward.  I take this opportunity to record my appreciation of the Minister's willingness to meet with Senators in recent weeks to deliver a face-to-face briefing and tease out the issues with us.  I have written to her on several occasions regarding specific provisions and she has responded to all my queries.  I was not necessarily happy with all the answers but I appreciate her making herself available in that way.   She has taken an open approach to her brief since taking over as Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is a good way of doing business.</p><p>Although I welcome the Bill on the whole, I do have some concerns about certain provisions.  At present, unmarried fathers have no automatic right to guardianship regardless of the closeness of their relationship with their child.  They can only acquire that right if the child's mother agrees to sign a voluntary statutory declaration or by going to court.  Many fathers do not realise this is the case until there is a problem such as a relationship breakdown and they are left in a very precarious position when difficulties do arise.  That is very unfair not just to the men involved, but also to their children.  Moreover, the current arrangements are totally out of step with best practice internationally, which aims to have both parents as involved as possible with their children, even where there may be a difficulty in the relationship between the two adults. </p><p>We should always encourage both parents to strive to have the best possible relationship with their child.  I appreciate that the Bill improves on the current situation by providing guardianship rights to one set of unmarried fathers, namely, those who have been cohabiting with their child's mother for 12 months, including for three months after the birth.  However, this does not go far enough and is problematic for several reasons.  First, the criteria set out in the Bill focus on the relationship between the father and mother even though the provisions in the rest of the legislation are very strong on the best interests of the child.  Second, the cohabitation requirement is problematic.  As Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, has pointed out, it could throw up strange situations where the parents are in an intimate relationship but the father is living away, perhaps because he is in the Army and has been posted abroad for a period.  Another example of an anomaly that might arise is where parents are living apart while one is looking after a sick relative.  Third, I am concerned that cohabitation is not defined in the Bill as it is in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act.  In short, the criteria are simply not clear enough for such an important issue.</p><p>I would favour a system of presumptive guardianship such as that which operates in the United Kingdom, with appropriate safeguards to deal with the minority of situations where a child or mother might be at risk as a consequence of the father's involvement.  We should be legislating on the presumption that children benefit from having both parents involved.  We are doing it backwards, however, which is to the disadvantage not only of fathers, but also of children.  I appreciate the Minister's positive response to the proposal tabled by my D&aacute;il colleagues about encouraging mothers to sign the statutory declaration earlier and making fathers aware of their rights at the very start.  That is a positive step and will help to alleviate some of the difficulties.  However, I urge her to look again at the overall position on fathers' rights.  Penalising all fathers because of a minority, and thereby penalising their children in turn, is wrong.</p><p>Will the Minister re-examine the proposals for a register of guardianship agreements?  She has indicated her intention to consider initiating a pilot scheme, which is welcome.  I note her concern about the red tape that might be involved in a compulsory national system, but I do not expect it would be overly cumbersome.  It is important that there be as much clarity as possible in family law and that we keep these issues out of the courts.  There will be saving in terms of court time if we can ensure documents are properly recorded on a national register in the first instance.</p><p>In regard to assisted human reproduction, I welcome the increased clarity in respect of parentage for children born after the Bill comes into effect.  It is unfortunate that so many children have been born in the past ten years in the absence of our dealing with this issue.  What is contained in the Bill is a positive step forward.  I also welcome the decision to outlaw anonymous sperm donations.  It is extremely important that all children have their right to their identity vindicated.  We have had difficulties in this regard, as discussed here previously.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout and I are trying to address those issues as they relate to adopted persons in legislation we will bring forward.  It is vital that we do not inflict the same hardship and pain on children born through assisted human reproduction.  Some of the clinics have claimed the restrictions will lead to a decrease in donations.  My response to that is, "So what?".  The primary interest here must be the rights of the child, and children are entitled to know the identity of their biological parents.  If it is the case that people seek to circumvent the restrictions by travelling to other European countries, then we need to address the issue at a European level.  I would like to see all the countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights honouring the protection it provides for family life, in Article 8, by agreeing collectively to outlaw anonymous donation.  This should be dealt with as a human rights issue.</p><p>The assisted human reproduction provisions do not go far enough in providing protection for children conceived in this way.  I understand that under the first draft of the Bill, as brought forward by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, all donor-conceived children would automatically have had their intentional parents recognised as their legal parents.  Under the current provisions, children conceived in Irish fertility clinics with the assistance of donor sperm will automatically have their intentional parents legally recognised.  Those conceived in foreign fertility clinics or in Irish clinics prior to the enactment of the Bill with the assistance of donor sperm will have the opportunity for a court to set out the situation, but only if the identity of the donor is unknown to the intentional parents.  Children conceived with known donor sperm, whether in a clinic or outside a clinic, are completely excluded from any opportunity to have their intentional parents legally recognised.  That is problematic.  All children should have a right to their identity and I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.</p><p>I also have concerns regarding the adequacy of the information that is being collected about donors.  I would like to see more information included on the register, including the type of medical information that is extremely important to the individual.  People conceived through assisted human reproduction should have more access to non-identifying information about the donor, which could be helpful to them as they grow up.  As I said, the lack of retrospective rights for those born before the legislation comes into effect is a cause for concern.  The Minister indicated that in some circumstances, a Minister may refuse to release information about the donor to his or her son or daughter.  The courts can look at this, we are told, but I am strongly of the view that the Bill should set out the criteria that will be considered.  There is reference to well-being as a standard but it is not clear what exactly that means.  It is a very important right to know one's identity and we should be clear on these matters.</p><p>Another cause for concern is the lack of provision for step parent adoption.  The Minister indicated that the Minister for Health will look at that issue in due course, but it is something we expected to be addressed in this Bill.  While I understand why the surrogacy provisions were taken out of the legislation, I am concerned the issue might not be dealt with in the lifetime of the Government.  We have children who do not know where they stand because they were born through surrogacy.  That issue has been considered in the courts but, as it stands, it is all up in the air.</p><p>Finally, if this legislation is to be as child centred and positive as intended, there is an urgent need to reform the family law courts.  As Dr. Geoffrey Shannon said at the conference the Minister and I recently attended, there is no point in having Rolls Royce legislation if we do not have the machinery to enforce it.  I urge the Minister to make that a priority.</p></speech>

Governments right across the political divide are at fault in this regard.  The situation in regard to guardianship and the law relating to it is outdated, but not for long.  The legislation before the House reflects a new Ireland in which, as Senator Averil Power has rightly said, where there are different types of family units, and there are children in these family units.  All children deserve to know both their parents.  I share Senator Averil Power's concern about certain limitations.  Most will agree that we will be 80% to 90% of way with this legislation.  It is an enormous start.  It is a reflection of what the Government has achieved by having created a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2011 followed by the children's rights referendum.  The Government's legacy certainly will be that it is bringing all matters relating to children up to date, which is only right and proper.</p> <p>I look forward to a constructive debate as the Bill goes through its various Stages this week.  What we are doing is crucial not only for people now but for generations to come.  I will not detain the House any longer.  An e-mail has come forward in recent minutes indicating that a number of amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage.  We need to debate these and our obligations to children and children's rights will be put centre stage in terms of the legislative process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-24a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032400002#KK00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and her officials to the House.  I thank her for the consultation in advance of the debate and the opportunity for pre-legislative hearings on the general scheme of the Bill in committee.  My colleague, Senator Katherine Zappone, was very active in the committee on that issue.</p><p>As a person who has advocated for children's rights for many years and has the privilege of being a voice in the legislative process, this feels like a really important day, and I believe it is.  The Children and Family Relationships Bill will bring about essential and long overdue reform, modernisation and legal clarity to many aspects of family law, particularly to diverse parenting situations and diverse family forms.  When I say overdue, that is not a criticism of the Government.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, her predecessor, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the officials in the Department of Justice and Equality on their courage and expertise in drafting the Bill and bringing it before the Houses.  It is an indictment rather of many previous Governments that it has taken us all until now in 2015 to introduce what will be the greatest reform of child and family law for a generation and finally to put children at the heart of family law.  It is the first major reform of guardianship laws since the 1960s.  I read an article by Colette Browne in the <i>Irish Independent</i>in February in which she noted that 3% of births in the 1960s were to an unmarried mother.  I looked at figures in preparation for today's debate solely in regard to these areas as married families can break down and issues can happen.  Figures which I received from the Children's Rights Alliance show that 308,000 children are living with 186,000 lone parents, 104,000 children are living with 60,000 unmarried cohabiting couples, 43,000 children are living with 29,000 lone fathers, and there are 230 same-sex couples with children.  I want us all to have a perspective on the figures and to understand that these are many of the children we are talking about in debating the legislation.</p><p>As indicated by the figures, an increasing number of children live in diverse parenting situations and diverse family forms other than the traditional model of a household headed by married parents.  I could use all my time to outline the areas I think will significantly contribute to children's lives and their positive outcomes.  For me the Bill is very much based on children's rights.  It is based on the best interests of the child being the paramount consideration and ensures issues such as continuity of care, right to identity, and the voice of the child are all becoming normalised and part of the legislative process.  That is welcome.</p><p>I will use my time to indicate the areas where I think we could go further.  For example, the Bill does not include definitions of guardianship, custody and access which would be essential to reduce the level of family conflict that may take place when relationships break down and to avoid the existing confusion among the public, professionals and the Judiciary.  I understand the options about guardianships and the different levels of guardianship, but will it be difficult for the public to understand which levels of guardianship one person has <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>another?  In future Bills, perhaps we should be look at the Law Reform Commission report of 2010 which examined the legal aspects of family relationships.  It suggested new terms such as parental responsibility, day-to-day care and contact rather than the word &quot;access&quot;.  These are much more child-friendly terms and state the roles the adult would play in the child's life.  However, I recognise and support the Bill as a monumental step in the right direction and the foundation from which child and family law can continue to be developed and bolstered to meet the needs of our ever-evolving society.</p><p><i></i>Given the breadth of the Bill, it is disappointing that the debate around it has been limited to a few narrow strands, albeit challenging and emotive issues by <i>nouveau</i>children's rights proponents, whose premise I do not always agree is children's rights centred.  I am especially saddened by the talk of a hierarchy of family structures or some sort of Olympics of family structures meeting gold a medal standard where we now have silver and bronze who do not even get to compete.  I am conscious that there are children who will listen to parts of the debate.  I am not suggesting that they would be tuning in to the Seanad, although they come and visit us regularly, but I am concerned that in some way we are putting affirmation on one sort of family form or another.  There are many different reasons for different family forms.  We do not need to look too far beyond our families to understand the different types and diverse types of families in which children are living.</p><p>On Committee Stage I will be looking at section 63 which deals with the best interests of the child, particularly in relation to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  It provides a new and detailed definition in Irish law of the best interests of the child.  The factors and circumstances enumerated thereunder are not exhaustive, and therefore the court will be capable of looking beyond them in making a determination concerning the child.  The Bill will allow the courts to consider the physical, emotional, psychological, educational and social needs of the child, including his or her need for stability, having regard to age and stage of development.  That is welcome.</p><p>As has been mentioned, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, special rapporteur on child protection, suggests that in tandem with this welcome legislative development, structural reform also needs to take place, namely, we need to establish a distinct and separate system of family courts.  I am aware that is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide a fair and effective forum to vindicate the rights of children and families.</p><p>The Child Care Act 1991 is silent on the qualifications, roles and duties of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.<i></i>A properly funded guardian <i>ad litem</i>agency in Ireland is long overdue.  We have a blueprint for this in the Children Acts Advisory Board report of 2009 which gives a voice to children's wishes, feelings and interests.  I hope that as we progress the Bill, we can ensure the voice of the child is certain and guaranteed.</p><p>An issue that has been raised with me by Barnardos is the court welfare service.  This service would provide a crucial link between the family and the Judiciary, offering services such as mediation, undertaking assessments of the child's welfare and best interests, ascertaining their view through a child view expert, guardians <i>ad litem</i>and conducting family risk assessments.  It would ensure judges received up-to-date holistic information on each case to help them in making their decision.  The service would also provide, where appropriate, support such as child contact centres to assist the children in highly contentious and acrimonious splits.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Perhaps we should look at other systems in operation, such as the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service in the UK.  <br/><br/>I will move on to the issue of the right to identity, which my colleague Senator Power has raised.  When I see all our colleagues raising the issue of right to identity, I wish many of them had been here when we were debating the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, but we will wait and see.  I am concerned that people are misrepresenting and misconstruing the principle underlying a child's right to identity to fit their own agenda.  They are talking about the child's right to identity from the mother's and father's perspectives, rather than from the child's perspective.  This Bill approaches the issue from the child's perspective, based on children's rights.  We had a good debate in the Seanad on the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill, during which I tabled an amendment on the child's right to identity.  Hopefully, as we evolve in our thinking, we can assert this right to identity more and more.  The focus of these groups is often selective, to further an ideological end, rather than a genuine concern for the vindication of the child's right to his or her identity.  This is the crux of our continuous failure on the issue of a child's right to identity.  Historically and culturally, we have constructed a hierarchy of rights, a veil of secrecy, to deny children the right to their identity.  What the Minister is putting forward in this Bill and in the Bill on assisted human reproduction is to be welcomed.  There are groups that wish we would go further or that we would allow for anonymous donation.  The Minister has struck the right balance.  I have sympathy with the position of Senator Power in that I would like to see the right to identity here.  We have a history of not acknowledging it, but this is a welcome start.  The transition period the Minister has proposed is fair and pragmatic.  I would prefer that a child have a right to his or her identity, but I am willing to accept what the Minister is putting forward as a strong change, with a focus on children's rights and ensuring they have their right to identity.<br/><br/>I also want to raise the issue of unmarried fathers.  I am worried that we still have a long way to go on this issue.  We often feed into the negative stereotypes of unmarried fathers as feckless, irresponsible flakes.  It is all too easy for us to do this.  Worse still, the justification for not granting automatic guardianship rights to fathers appears to have been conflated with concerns about domestic and sexual violence.  These heinous crimes can happen in any type of family, not just unmarried ones.  It is wrong, prejudicial and discriminatory to link it exclusively to unmarried parents.  The law should presume that the majority of unmarried parents are responsible and reasonable.  Where they are not, this should be addressed through relevant legislation.  The solution is not to penalise the majority.  Colette Browne, in her article on the Children and Family Relationships Bill, says that it compounds our unfair treatment of unmarried parents.  She says that currently unmarried fathers have zero legal rights over their children, which means that:<blockquote>[...] if your partner is away and your child falls ill, you cannot authorise medical treatment.  It means that if your relationship breaks up and your partner decides to move abroad with your child, you are powerless to stop her.  It also means that you have no automatic right to custody or access to your child.  By law, the mother is entitled to sole custody of the child if the father has not been made a guardian.  Imagine a worst-case scenario in which your partner dies and you are left alone to care for your child.</blockquote>How can we make it more natural and how can we ensure that guardianship rights are there?<br/><br/>I have much more to say, but one of the issues I want to raise relates to statutory declarations.  All of us have lost precious documents.  For example, I lost my driving licence years ago.  We are talking about a piece of paper.  If one loses it, it is gone and one's rights are extinguished.  I welcome the Minister's suggestion of piloting a repository.  I wonder if we need to do more than that.  I acknowledge what she is saying - that she does not want to make it compulsory and add another hurdle - but we have to find a way in which those statutory declarations can be lodged.  <br/><br/>I want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no misunderstanding, in saying that I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  I support it and I will do everything I can do ensure it is brought into law.  Its potential is manifold, but at its heart it is about children's rights.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I will share my time with Senator Quinn, who has indicated that three minutes would be sufficient.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has quite rightly said, and I know this comes from the heart, that the starting point is the privacy and the best interest of the child.  Everyone in this House agrees with this.  She made reference to a Supreme Court judgment regarding the birth mother of a donor-conceived child.  That seems to be one of the maddest decisions of the Supreme Court.  It is absolutely daft.  A mother who is a host to a fertilised egg is the mother of the child, despite having no biological connection with it?  I do not understand it.  We will leave that to one side, however.</p> <p>The Minister said that anonymous donation was being prohibited so as to ensure that donor-conceived children would have the possibility of tracing their identity.  I want to make this point very strongly, because it is an issue the Minister might look at.  It is actually not opening up the possibility; it is forcing the information on the child, because this information is contained in the birth certificate.  I ask her to look at that again.  She is quite right when she says that a child should have the possibility of accessing the information, but it should be only the possibility.  There may well be some children for whom this comes as an unwelcome piece of information.</p> <p>Then there is the question of the interim period, the kind of flow-in period of 18 to 24 months.  That is inadequate.  The Minister probably had correspondence from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which makes this very plain.  There is a considerable difference of opinion here.</p> <p>Senator van Turnhout quoted many statistics.  I welcome this.  I have received the same information from the Children's Rights Alliance.  It is worth putting on the record that 500,000 children are growing up in different types of family.  That is a significant number of children.  It is not only the 308,000 children living with unmarried, cohabiting parents, lone mothers and so on, but also those living with the 42,960 people who have divorced and remarried.  Of these, 56% of remarried women and 22% of remarried men are living with children.  Some 6,454 children are living in State care.  There are no statistics for children who are living full-time with grandparents.  Approximately 70% of heterosexual couples using donated sperm or eggs have opted for anonymous donation.  That is a substantial majority of people who are in this situation, and this will be violently altered.  Some 40% of single women or lesbian couples also go for anonymous donations.  In addition, 2-4% of fathers raising children are not the biological parents of the child.  </p> <p>Many of us may not have realised that there is no sperm donation in this country.  All sperm donated and used here is imported, mostly from Denmark, and donor eggs used to come mostly from Ukraine.  Denmark allows both anonymous and non-anonymous donation, while donation in the Ukraine is all anonymous.  The majority of couples having egg donation travel to Spain or the Czech Republic, where donation is anonymous.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This practice will undoubtedly continue for quite a number of years.  It will take a slow cultural change for the majority of Irish heterosexual couples to move to open donation.  Again, there is a strong argument for this long link-up period.<br/><br/>Another point that needs to be made but that has not been made so far relates to the language in the Bill.  In reference to prohibition on anonymity, the Bill refers to procedures taking place in the State &quot;leading to the implantation of an embryo&quot;.  We need some clarification in this regard because the whole question of facilitating is so general that it opens up a very wide area.  As we know, an increasing number of couples travel abroad for this treatment and this will expand considerably when the Bill passes.  It would be a great shame if people who provide scans, obstetric and psychiatric counselling and so on were inadvertently criminalised by this Bill.<br/><br/>I forgot to say well done to the Minister earlier for bringing in this Bill.  The political arithmetic guarantees it will slide through.  It will tear the hypocritical veil away from people like those in the Iona Institute who are making out that the equality referendum is all about children, but that has nothing whatever to do with it.  When this Bill is finished, that one will be gone to hell forever.  Let it never be confused: the equality referendum is about equality.  The other side had better lump it because this Bill deals with adoption and guardianship of children.<br/><br/>I put it to the Minister that I would not have voted for the Civil Registration Bill.  It did not go to a vote in this House - I believe the Minister was a Member of this House at the time - but I said I would not vote for it because of the way it completely and scandalously neglected children.  This Bill, and well done to the Minister, is the antidote to that legislation.<br/><br/>There is a question of the run-in time, time limits and exceptions.  Correspondence I have from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states that those who already have gametes or embryos donated anonymously and frozen before the commencement date will be allowed to use these gametes and embryos for three years after the commencement date.  The institute &quot;feels that this period is medically inappropriate&quot;, a very strong sentence.  The correspondence continues with the view that if a person or couple wishes to have several children, it would not be possible to fit these pregnancies into a three-year timeframe.  It is common for several surface embryos to be produced in a donor egg <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation cycle.  Best practice is to transfer a single embryo with a view to a singleton rather than multiple pregnancy and to cryopreserve the rest.  A time limit of three years on embryo use will raise a clinical and ethical dilemma.  It may pressurise parents to undergo transfer of their frozen embryos in a shorter timeframe than medically advised.  It may also encourage a transfer of more than one embryo, leading to multiple pregnancies and higher risks for mothers and babies.  For patients who are not in a position to use their embryos within the three-year timeframe, the ethical dilemma of destroying embryos will have to be faced.  Now let us hear the pro-life brigade on the matter of forcing embryos to be destroyed.  The institute strongly believes that the duration of the time limit of exceptions outlined in head 12 should be extended from three to ten years.<br/><br/>I have received a very disturbing letter on this point from a man who is unable to have children because he does not produce sperm.  He and his wife decided to accept a sperm donation anonymously and they had a son, who gave radiance and beauty to their life.  They wanted to continue and have another child who would be a sibling child for their existing child.  The clinic held some of their donor sperm and last year they started again.  They were unsuccessful.  However, they are on the routine again.  The crucial paragraph in the letter states:<blockquote>We were devastated to hear this morning that our clinic would not proceed as we had planned due to the new Bill.  Our next opportunity to conceive will be after the legislation is due to come into effect on 24 March.  The legislation, as it is proposed, will not allow our son to have a true genetic sibling and force us to use a different donor, if we can find one.  This is a terrible blow to my wife and I.</blockquote></p></speech>

This blocks a pathway to parentage that other donor children are being offered.  Guardianship offers far fewer rights for the children.</p><p>Finally, I have received another communication that states:<blockquote>Children conceived in Irish fertility clinics with the assistance of donor sperm will have their intentional parents legally recognised.  Children conceived in foreign fertility clinics can apply to the court, but children conceived with known donor sperm, whether in a clinic or outside of a clinic, are completely excluded from any opportunity to have their intentional parents legally recognised.</blockquote>That is another point.</p></speech>

I agree entirely with Senator Norris when he referred to the Minister's enthusiasm.  The Minister and I were together at the Project Arts Centre on Thursday last.  It was great to hear her enthusiasm for the legislation.  I might not agree with all of it but certainly her enthusiasm is worthwhile.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's efforts to take into account how the family structure has changed dramatically in recent years.  However, I have some reservations about the Bill as it stands and certain amendments could improve the Bill substantially.  The vast scope of the Bill means that the changes should have been put to a referendum.  I know the Government is highly unenthusiastic for referendums now but let us consider the fact that we have put more minor changes to referendums in the past.  Indeed, the sheer number of changes that this law will bring about is likely to mean there will be changes and challenges to the Bill.  When I have introduced legislation in this House, one of the major Government arguments is that my Bills may interfere with the Constitution or may be unconstitutional.  However, this Bill, which runs to 114 pages and 180 sections, is supposedly completely watertight.  I find that somewhat hard to believe, but let us see how it goes.</p> <p>A man was on the radio on Saturday week last discussing adoption.  He impressed me.  He was gay, but he was going to vote "No" in the referendum.  His reason was that he believes every child should have a mother and a father.</p></speech>

When he went to his father to explain that he was gay, the father found it very difficult to take, while his mother was very sympathetic.  He was of the opinion that every child would be better having a mother and a father.  That has certainly influenced me to think in a way that I might not otherwise have thought.  Professor Ray Kinsella has argued that the legislation would promote arrangements where children are intentionally denied either a mother or a father.  Whether that is correct, I do not know.</p><p>I got a letter only this morning.  I am not going to read the entire letter but I can offer a flavour of it:<blockquote>We are writing to ask your help with a proposal regarding fostering and adoption.  In 1989 my husband and I long-term fostered two brothers who were three years old and one year and eight months old when they came to us.  We have no other children.  They are still with us at age 29 and 28.  When they were small we asked several times to adopt them but their birth mother would not give consent.  Now that they are adults we still wish to adopt them and the boys themselves also wish it.  As far as I understand, it is not possible for an adult to adopt another adult in Ireland at present.</blockquote>Perhaps the Minister could handle the matter privately rather than in the Chamber but the letter continues: &quot;It is done in other countries, the United States being one.&quot;  Specifically, their proposal is that long-term foster parents be allowed to adopt their adult foster children:<blockquote>We feel that it would ensure that they are full members of the family, especially in terms of inheritance rights, decisions on elder care, and, I am sure, the many other aspects that would emerge.  This seems to us infinitely more than just the situation which now prevails.</blockquote><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know the situation, but the last sentence was, "So with change in the air because of the upcoming children's Bill we are hoping that there is still some time that you can help us."  They gave their names, addresses and telephone numbers.  I will give the Minister the letter and she can follow it up.  It seems to me that this Bill needs a lot of debate.  I regret that we will have a short time to deal with it, but that is our fault.  The Minister will welcome a good debate on this.  There was a good debate in the other House; let us make sure we have a good debate here.</p></speech>

In a survey of several thousand people, it found that 96% were strongly in favour of gay marriage, 2% were a little confused and 4%, a tiny number, were against it for some daft reason.  Where these nutcases are fished out from I simply cannot imagine.</p></speech>

I strongly welcome this Bill, which is a very progressive reform of family law.  It is long overdue and is child- and family-centred reform, which for the first time properly recognises the diverse forms of family life in Ireland.  Others have commented on the figures which show that the use of the term &quot;atypical&quot; is no longer appropriate, something the Minister acknowledged in her speech.  It is extremely positive for many of us to have the Bill recognise that there is no longer any typical family form, which is what is reflected in the Bill.</p><p>Others have commented on the Bill's long genesis.  It is indeed long overdue, and the Government is to be commended on its introduction.  An original general scheme was introduced in January 2014.  I was very privileged to be a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which examined the Bill, held hearings on it in April 2014 and published a report last May, which, as the Minister said, fed into the Bill.  I will mention some of our recommendations and the way in which the Bill took on board much of what we said at the time.</p><p>I very much welcome the fact that the Minister has engaged so closely with many of us who were interested, from the time the new scheme of the Bill was published in September to its publication and passage through the Oireachtas.  It reflects some of what was said in report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005, as the Minister said, which shows how overdue it is.</p><p>The Children's Rights Alliance has said, very succinctly, that this Bill is to be welcomed for two key reasons.  It protects the child's right to family life and ensures decisions are made in the best interests of the child.  That encompasses the range of aspects of child and family law that are covered in the Bill.  A broad range of issues are covered, including donor-assisted human reproduction, parentage and pathways to parentage for children, guardianship and adoption.  The overarching theme of the best interests of the child runs through the Bill.  </p><p>Some have commented on the Bill's relationship with the Constitution, but this is a Bill which does not require a constitutional referendum and is entirely separate.  That is very clear to anyone who reads the Bill closely.</p><p>The Bill was broadly welcomed by the many stakeholders who made submissions to those of us on the joint committee.  As we said, it is intended to create a legal structure to underpin diverse family forms.  A nice way of putting it is that it creates a new architecture for family forms and guardianship, custody and access to children.  We know our current law is rather dated, as the 1964 Guardianship of Infants Act still governs this area.  Much of the Bill will amend the 1964 Act, the Status of Children Act 1987 and other pieces of legislation.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout commented on the language of the Bill.  The joint committee recommended that new and revised forms of wording should be used to better reflect our day-to-day language.  Instead of guardianship we should speak about parental responsibility, instead of custody we should refer to day-to-day care, and instead of access we should speak about contact.  I appreciate that the Bill is primarily amending existing legislation and what is needed in the future is a much larger piece of codifying law to bring together all of the relevant legislation into one global statute to deal with this area.</p><p>I am also conscious that until the Supreme Court rules on the children's referendum there are other aspects that cannot be dealt with, such as the right of adoption for children who were born into a marriage.  Some things will still need to be done.</p><p>As others have said, we know that family forms have become much more diverse.  Some 35% of all children are now born outside marriage, and 500 couples participate in civil partnerships every year.  Many couples, predominately straight couples, avail of IVF or assisted human reproductive facilities, something of which we are all aware.  This Bill will reflect all of that.</p><p>I want to mention a couple of aspects of the Bill in more detail.  I refer to donor-assisted human reproduction, which is set out in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Like many others, I have been contacted by individuals and couples who are concerned about some of the provisions in the Bill, on which Senator Norris had a briefing earlier.  It is a difficult and complex task to balance the interests of the people who contacted us with the pre-eminent right of a child to access information concerning his or her genetic identity.  In the joint committee report we emphasised that the right to identity should be acknowledged and recognised in the Bill.  That is the genesis of sections 24 to 38, particularly the introduction of a register of donor-conceived persons.  Recommendation 22 of the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005 was about the need to ensure a right to identity.  That balance has been achieved effectively in this Bill.</p><p>I appreciate the real concerns of couples who have children born through donor-assisted human reproduction and want to have a genetic sibling.  The three-year exemption will deal with that for some people.  It may take some time to conceive a child through this method, and therefore some people are concerned that the period is too short.  I am grateful to the Minister for her agreement to delay the commencement of those provisions, which will address many of the concerns of those individuals, families and clinics.  Some lead-in time will be needed to establish the new procedure whereby certain information will be required for donations.</p><p>There has been a little bit of scaremongering around the idea of people travelling abroad.  They are already doing so to avail of assisted human reproduction facilities in other countries for all sorts of reasons, something of which we have to be aware.  A careful reading of section 24 gives some comfort to people who are concerned about this.  I understand embryos formed pre-commencement will not be subject to the three-year time limit, but we need to clarify the effect on people of the provisions on access to information for children conceived in this way.</p><p>Issues in respect of guardianship have been raised.  Section 49 is greatly improved and reflects a recommendation from the joint committee.  The original provision in the Bill for unmarried cohabitant fathers was that they would have to cohabit for at least 12 months prior to a child's birth, which has been changed.  The new provision is much more flexible.  A careful balance has to be struck, as the Minister said, to ensure that the child's best interests are safeguarded.  I am glad she said there would be a two-year review of the provisions on automatic guardianship.</p><p>It is very welcome to hear the Minister say that, in a non-statutory way, she has also arranged for procedures to be made simpler for people to sign a statutory declaration.  Currently, many of us who have gone though a statutory declaration process do so with a solicitor, who keeps a copy, as do the individuals concerned.  It is done in a very <i>ad hoc</i>way by individuals who are aware of the process.  The simple method whereby at the point of registration of a child's birth parents will be informed of the existence of a statutory declaration procedure will go a long way to ensuring greater recognition of guardianship rights for non-marital fathers, and this is very important from a child's perspective.</p><p>The joint committee recommended that a central register be established.  I listened with great interest to what the Minister said about it, the difficulty of establishing it and the danger that it would result in more red tape.  The idea of a pilot project for a voluntary repository will address the issue of people losing documents, wondering where the copies are and so on.</p></speech>
