I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health comes to the House as a matter of urgency to discuss the crisis in our accident and emergency services, in particular those in our flagship hospital, Beaumont Hospital.  On 8 September last the CEO of that hospital went public because he said it was unsafe for patients.</p> <p>He said it was in the interests of the safety of all patients that the hospital should regain stability as a matter of urgency.  One wonders why the inaction since 8 Septembers, as Beaumont Hospital, the flagship for neurology and other disciplines, had to be taken off being on-call for the first time in its history.  What has led to this crisis in which a most important tertiary hospital had to be taken off being on-call?</p><p>What has happened since the CEO flagged these problems?  The Government has cut funding to acute hospitals, such as Beaumont.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar has his head in the sand and is interested in convincing the Seanad to support the Government's flawed Water Services Bill next Thursday and Friday.  He needs to focus on outlining how this crisis will be dealt with.  Before I came into the Chamber I checked the number of people around the country who are waiting to be admitted to hospital through the accident and emergency service.  Some 385 families have a member who is waiting to be admitted to hospital.</p><p>People have been advised over the airwaves in the past couple of day not to come to Beaumont hospital because the hospital is no longer able to admit patients.  The CEO said this on 8 September 2014 but the Government, inept and unable to listen, is not hearing what is being said.  It has cut funding to acute hospitals such as Beaumont in the recent budget announcements.  This is completely unacceptable.  Serious action needs to be taken.  How many hospital wards are closed?  If ever there was a case for the immediate lifting of the embargo, it is now when a major hospital has to cease being on-call as it is no longer able to admit patients.</p><p>Serious action has been taken in the past few days to deal with the homeless, let the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, call for an urgent commission within 48 hours to deal with the situation in Beaumont Hospital.  As with the abuse of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta in County Mayo, it is no less abuse for people to be told they cannot come to a hospital and, if they do attend they will be left on a trolley.  Let the Minister tell that to the 386 families who have a member who needs to be admitted to hospital.  What has happened since 8 September when the CEO of Beaumont issued a warning?  Nothing.  Blinded by the paralysis of inaction, the Government has cut services.  We have not had a cold spell.  Even before a possible flu epidemic, we are cutting services.</p><p>I ask Members who are considering how they will vote later in the week, to reach their decision in the knowledge that the Government can be beaten on this issue next Friday.  I ask them not to listen to the veiled and disgraceful threats of a Minister who is reported in the media as having said if the Seanad does not support the Water Services Bill 2014, then the people will pay higher charges.  That is rubbish.  As Members of an institution of this State, we listen to the people, not a Minister trying to ram unfair legislation down the throats of the public.</p></speech>

It is not yet clear whether a date will be announced following today's meeting, but it is very welcome to hear it is on the agenda.  We all await the announcement of the date of the referendum next year as well as an announcement of the other issues that will be put to the people in a referendum on the same date.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the other matters that are likely to be voted on around the same time as marriage equality, such as the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention on the age of voting, which it recommended would be reduced to 16 years, and on the proposed removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution, which the convention also recommended should be put to the people.</p> <p>Could I also ask for a debate on the recommendations of the low pay commission after it has given its advice to the Government?  I welcome the announcement this week by the Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment, Deputy Nash, that a low pay commission is to be established.  He has called on interested parties to apply for membership of the new commission.  The low pay commission is hugely important because it will enable an evidence-based assessment of appropriate levels of the national minimum wage to be undertaken for the first time.  It will advise the Government generally on low pay issues.  I understand these positions are being advertised on the State boards website, with a closing date of 12 January 2015.  It would be good to see a healthy level of applications for the membership of that commission.  I welcome the establishment of the commission.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate its recommendations in the House after it has produced its report.</p></speech>

I am absolutely astonished at the emergence of Dick Cheney.  It is quite incredible that such a discredited blackguard should dare to raise his head.  He should hang his head in shame.  He should dig a hole, creep into it and hope to Christ that the rest of the world forgets about him and his dirty filthy tricks.  He endorsed torture.  He called the torturers "heroes".  This was the attitude of Heinrich Himmler.  We know the man is a thoroughgoing blackguard.  I could use other words, but I would be ruled out of order.  He leaked against his own staff during the Iraq war.  He was such a coward that he got an exemption from the Vietnam war, which he stoked up from the sidelines.  I wonder what is happening to his colleagues, Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Karl Rove.  I notice they have kept their heads down.  It would be interesting to hear if they have anything to say about this.  Mr. Cheney is not a stupid man.  He is a filthy coward and a blackguard, but he is certainly not stupid.  He knew perfectly well that Iraq had nothing to do with the bombing of the Twin Towers.  He used his pal Rupert Murdoch's company, Fox News, to mislead the American people.  Much of this was done for gain.  This is a man who was the head of Haliburton.</p></speech>

The health service is not in chaos.  Services are being delivered and there are more than 100,000 people within the health service who are extremely dedicated and committed to delivering a quality service.  I accept there are issues, and there are issues that we have inherited and need to be tackled which I raise here consistently in regard to how we treat and employ staff.  The Government has changed the position in regard to the embargo and nursing staff are being recruited and the number of medical consultants and doctors is being increased.  If we want to have a debate on the issue, let us have it on all the issues in the health service and let us give credit where it is due.  For example, in regard to maternity services for 2015, it is proposed to add ten new consultants in that area.  This is a long way from the Hanley report of 2003.

The loan to values from 80% to 95% are running far in excess of what they were in the past decade.  This is what the 80% loan to value proposal from the Central Bank was designed to correct.  The 20% deposit which would be the remainder is opposed by people in the property sector and in financial services.  There is a warning in <i>The Irish Times</i>today, referring to the United States, from Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize winner, where the people who brought the economy to its knees are seeking the chance to do it all over again.  I ask that early in the next session the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, come to the House to debate these issues.</p></speech>

There are outrageous delays in securing funding for elderly people discharged from hospitals to nursing homes.  In my own county there are 15 week delays in securing funding for a nursing home.  Whereas the hospital funds the first four weeks, the person has to wait for 11 weeks without funding and when it is granted, there is no retrospective payment.  This is a crisis for many families.  In rural Ireland, elderly people have to come up with between &euro;7,000 and 8,000 to fund that period for which they do not receive HSE funding.  I am sure the cost could be double that amount in the capital city.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and ask him to put funding in place from 1 January 2015 to clear all the waiting lists into future in order that there are no delays in proving funding for the elderly.  Given that we have an ageing population, once they go into nursing homes, funding should be available from day one.</p></speech>

We have seen it several times attempt to trample all over the rights of the Seanad, one of the institutions of this State.  We saw it with the botched referendum campaign.  We saw it with the botched by-election campaign.  This was one they could not lose but they did, and Senator Craughwell is sitting here today as a consequence of this monumental failure on their part.  Now the Government is attempting to blackmail Independent Senators to vote for a Bill which is flawed and which the vast majority of citizens do not want to see passed.  It is disgraceful behaviour for Ministers, who are again attempting to subvert the democratic process and the independence of the Seanad, to try to blackmail people by saying that if we do not vote for their flawed Bill, people will end up paying higher charges.  It is nonsense.  The Government could bring forward emergency legislation to prevent this from happening if it wanted to do so, and that is what it will do if the Seanad, as it should, defeats the Water Services Bill.</p><p>I appeal to those Independent Senators who campaigned for the retention of the Seanad and for a Seanad that could be a second check and balance when passing legislation.  If the D&aacute;il passes the Water Services Bill against the will of the people, the eyes of the people of this State and those who marched in their tens of thousands will turn to the Seanad.  They will be hopeful the Seanad will do what the D&aacute;il refused to do, because the Government has such a big majority.  I hope that the Seanad can show its worth, defeat the Government on this Bill and stand up for ordinary citizens.  What a day that would be for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the citizens of this State.  I therefore appeal to people not to be taken in by any blackmail attempts of Ministers and to recognise that we are an independent Chamber in this Oireachtas.  We can, as it were, stand on our own two feet.  We can and should make our own decisions without interference from any Minister in the D&aacute;il.  I hope this will happen, if not this week then next Monday, if we have to sit next Monday as well.  I hope the message that we send out to the Government is that we will not be blackmailed and that we will debate the Bill independently of whatever any Minister says or does.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that people will not be taken in by the huge U-turn his party took in recent weeks on the water issue.</p><p>I join the Deputy Leader in extending our sympathies to the families in Australia who lost loved ones yesterday in the most unfortunate hostage situation which occurred there.  It was a very worrying day for many Irish people yesterday who have loved ones in Sydney.  I had some worrying moments myself.  I have a niece who was evacuated from her place of work yesterday, which is located right behind the restaurant in question.  We also all wish to remember in our thoughts today all the families of the 100 children in a Pakistani school who are dead as a result of an attack by the Taliban in recent hours.  It is a most horrific situation.</p><p>Will the Leader arrange a debate in this House next term with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on oil prices and why it is we are not seeing a bigger drop in the price of oil at pumps and in the price of home heating oil, despite the fact that Brent crude oil has dropped below $60 a barrel for the first time since 2009?  It hit &euro;59.75 today.  Oil prices have taken a 50% plunge since June of this year.  We are only seeing relatively minor adjustments at the petrol pumps.  We need to have a full debate on the reasons for this.  We could also debate all the economic reasons oil prices are dropping so significantly.  It is very interesting to see that overnight in Russia, key interest rates increased by 6.5%, bringing interest rates to 17%.  There are some people in this House who will remember the bad old days when interest rates were 17% in this country.</p></speech>

The Seanad must do its business, irrespective of what Ministers tell us we should do.  We cannot and will not be browbeaten into taking any particular decision.  Over 12 months ago the Irish people decided to keep Seanad &Eacute;ireann, not to have a second axis of Government but to have an independent Chamber for democratic debate and decision-making.  Let us act on that and not be browbeaten into taking any particular decisions.  I look forward to a substantive debate on substantive amendments to the Water Services Bill 2014 and hope we have the time and space for that.</p><p>While I appreciate that this week&rsquo;s schedule appears rather full, if it is possible and if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, is available for one hour it would be helpful to have a briefing from him and a short debate on the political developments, or lack of development in Northern Ireland.  Last week the all-party and governmental talks did not succeed as we would have wished.  It would be helpful to hear from the Minister and make our own views known and make our contributions.  The political developments in Northern Ireland and the discussion surrounding them should not be confined to a few political parties in Northern Ireland.  They are of interest to every political party on this island and every politician in this House.  I am sure the Minister&rsquo;s diary for the week is busy but if he was available for one hour between now and Friday afternoon we could have a very useful and constructive debate on the Northern Ireland peace process.</p></speech>

We keep hearing calls to make sure the minimum wage is maintained or increased.  There is a definite link between the minimum wage and unemployment.  We have the second highest minimum wage in Europe but we ended up with a very high unemployment rate, particularly among young people.  Let us not automatically assume that the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s decision on minimum wage will seek to reduce the minimum wage.  If that means fewer jobs it is not healthy.  It is not the right way to go.</p><p>We should also in the new year debate young people&rsquo;s access to pornography on the Internet.  There must be some way of protecting children, particularly teenagers or younger children from the amount of pornographic material coming through.  There are ways to do it.  While I do not know the technique for doing this but I understand that in one method parents could identify every message their children receive on mobile phones or on the Internet.  It seems worthy of consideration because it is a frightening thought.  I do not have experience of this but I understand that some of the pornographic material on these sites is very dangerous.  We as a nation should be able to protect ourselves. </p><p>To add to Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point, the people last year voted to maintain the Seanad.  It will be the focus of attention in the coming days.  Let us make sure that our decisions are worthy of the decision of the people last year whose vote said they want an independent second House.  Let us not be browbeaten or bullied into making decisions we do not want to make. </p></speech>

The Seanad was retained as an independent House and I deeply regret the words of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and various other people.</p> <p>I also will not be intimidated by the group e-mails I am receiving that seek to force my decision-making one way or another.  I will make up my mind in due course and will have more to say about that during the debate on the Water Services Bill.<br/>Last week, I called for an urgent debate on rent controls.  This morning, Threshold also called for the introduction of rent controls.  Fr. McVerry has also called for rent controls.  I cannot understand why nothing is being done about this issue.  I am last the person to want the micro-economy to be interfered with by any Government but, unfortunately, because there has been no property development in this country of any worth over the past eight years there is a shortage of property.  Reference is made in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>and <i>Irish Independent</i>to the shortage of property in this country.  Whether we like it or not - I said this the other day - the animal instincts of capitalism will kick in very quickly as people try to cash in on the shortage of housing.  I intend to propose an amendment to the Order of Business tomorrow morning to ensure a debate is held on rent controls.  For me, this issue is more urgent right now than the water issue.</p></speech>

I ask that the Leader request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, come to this Chamber prior to the recess to brief us on the shambles of the collapsed talks last week between the democratically elected British and Irish Governments.  A recent article in the <i>Irish Republican News</i>by Mr. Brian Feeney, an esteemed observer and journalist in the North, whose opinion is well regarded states: <blockquote><br />The responsibility for yesterday's debacle at Stormont lies scattered around the feet of our clueless proconsul.  The slightest glance at the paper presented to the parties at 11pm on Thursday night - 'Paper for the Parties, a draft Agreement at Stormont' - shows conclusively that she was daft to encourage the Taoiseach and David Cameron to come to Belfast.</blockquote>The issue of flags, parades and the past were never a priority of the draft agreement presented by the Secretary of State.  The &pound;1 billion offer by Prime Minister Cameron in respect of the North turned out to be a loan to be repaid with interest.  In this regard, Mr. Peter Robinson said, &quot;To bribe us with our own money is a bit short of what is required&quot;.  Deputy Gerry Adams, described the talks as the most amateurish, hamfisted episode in which he had ever been involved.</p></speech>

This is a very serious issue for those of us involved constantly on issues relating to the North.  The elections in the North will be held soon.  I believe the two main parties will hang in there together and, hopefully, a Labour-led coalition Government, which will not impose cuts as brutal as those being imposed by the Conservative Party, will be returned.</p></speech>

There are many replicas of the incidence which occurred in Sydney.  I believe in freedom of religion and the right of a person to be a Muslim, Jew, Baptist and so on.  I have previously called for a debate on this issue in the House.  A debate on this issue has never been more timely as we approach the Christmas season.  However, I do not expect that the Leader will be able to provide for it prior to the recess.</p> <p>I urge him to find time early in the new year when our schedules may not be as busy as they are this week to have a two-hour debate on the persecution of Christians, which is becoming a serious issue in many countries.  It is an issue that we in this country should not ignore.</p><p>The Minister with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy Simon Coveney, will be away in the next few days at an annual event in Brussels negotiating quotas for next year.  In this respect, every year our backs are to the wall.  If we are to listen to and believe the concerns of the fishing organisations from Donegal to west Cork, there is deep concern about this.  If the quotas suggested by Europe were to be imposed on this little country, we would lose 700 jobs, either directly or indirectly, in the fishing industry.  It is an industry that has been under severe pressure in recent years, and some of the issues are historic.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister our support from this House in the negotiations and ask him to be strong and fervent in support of the Irish fisherman?  We have lost enough jobs in this industry.  Our fishing fleet is about one third of what it was 30 years ago.  We need the Minister to be very strong and to demand appropriate quotas for our Irish fishermen that are supported by science and the Marine Institute, which know where the weaknesses and the strengths are.  I wish the Minister good luck but warn him that he will have to hold steadfast.</p></speech>

We have seen that with the water services legislation and we are already on the third or fourth version of that Bill due to mistakes and U-turns.  The Road Traffic Act is another disgrace where we are now trying to row back on a mistake that was made.  To show that this is a democracy and a Parliament of which the people can be proud, the Seanad should seriously consider not deciding on the Water Services Bill before Christmas.  There should be a period of reflection and we should not rush it through.  We have rushed this legislation through on a number of occasions before at the whim of the Government and the result has been confusion, street protests and a Government nearly collapsing.</p><p>Let us give  this legislation the time it deserves and not pass it before Christmas.  I respectfully ask the officials of the House not to communicate with us about Bills currently before the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il can take its time dealing with legislation and when it comes before us, we should consider it carefully then and not before that time.  The Water Services Bill is before the D&aacute;il.  Let us leave it with the D&aacute;il for the Members of that House to debate it, to go through each of the provisions, in which I see quite a number of flaws already, and let us not be rushed into something before Christmas that we will later come to regret.  Unfortunately, there are too many precedents on this Bill alone and a number of precedents this week of mistaken legislation.  Let us not do it this week or before Christmas.</p></speech>

Whoever deals with such matters in the Lower House should have a good look at how they do business.  Perhaps that is the question that should have been put to the people on the previous occasion, and not whether this House should be retained.</p><p>An important project that will happen in the new year is the public consultation process on farm safety which has been initiated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I called for that on the Order of Business some time ago because of the dramatic increase in the number of deaths on Irish farms.  I thank the CPP for agreeing to hold a public consultation on farm safety and I was delighted to be asked to be a rapporteur for that committee.  I notify Members of the House that the closing date for submissions from organisations and members of the public is 9 January.</p> <p>Perhaps Members might alert individuals or organisations with an interest in farm safety to the fact that this process is under way and that they should have their submissions in by 9 January.  That would be a great help.  I can provide further information on the matter to interested Members.  I look forward to the public consultation process, because ultimately it is utilising the experience and opportunity we have in the Seanad to deliver a report that will hopefully save lives.  That is a very worthwhile endeavour.  I look forward to the co-operation and support of all Members across the House on the project.</p></speech>

Senator MacSharry called for a debate on the health service and he proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  He spoke about the statement made on Beaumont Hospital on 8 September.  We had a very comprehensive general debate on health with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on 4 November in which 15 Members took part.  I am sure all the points Senator MacSharry raised today were raised with the Minister at that time and I see no point in having an amendment to the Order of Business to bring the Minister in to discuss the same subject again only a couple of weeks later.</p><p>A number of speakers raised the Water Services Bill.  I assure the House that I will not be browbeaten, as has been suggested, by a Minister or anyone else.  We will run this House in a proper businesslike manner, as we usually do.  I have not been browbeaten by any Minister on the issue.</p><p>Senator Cullinane mentioned blackmail when he was present.  Independents will decide what way they wish to vote on the Bill.  I suggest they will not be bullied by anybody.  They will not be bullied by the comments this morning of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  I have the utmost confidence that Members will make a decision based on the Bill before them and its contents.  Many people are trying to exert pressure on Independent Members in particular in regard to the Bill but people will make up their own minds.</p><p>Senator Bacik expressed sympathy to the relatives bereaved in the siege in Sydney.  Senator Mullins expressed sympathy to the families of children killed in a school in Pakistan.  I am sure we would all like to express our sympathy in that regard.  Senator Bacik also sought information on the dates of the various referenda.  I am sure we will have them very soon and we will provide the information to the House at the time.</p> <p> Senator Bacik also called for a debate on the low pay commission report, when it is complete.  Senator Quinn, on the same subject, raised the link between the minimum wage and unemployment, etc.  That will form part of the debate on the low pay commission report.</p><p>Senator Zappone raised the issue of the Water Services Bill 2014.  The previous Bill on the matter was not rushed in this House.  We spent 16 or more hours debating it and I can assure the Senator it will not be rushed this time in the House.  Ample time will be provided.</p></speech>

Senator Barrett raised the issue of mortgages and the Central Bank and called for a debate with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  We will try to arrange that early in the new year.</p><p>Senator Kelly raised the issue of the delays in funding for the fair deal scheme.  I note an additional &euro;25 million was provided for the scheme but I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister again.</p><p>Senator Michael Mullins raised the question of oil prices and the need for them to be reduced even further at the pumps.  In my city, it is down to 127 cent or 128 cent for diesel.  If it is that way in Waterford, there is no reason it should not be that way throughout the country.  Neither am I saying that we in Waterford have the lowest prices.  Obviously, taxation makes up a large amount of the price of a litre of petrol.</p><p>I already addressed Senator Bradford's issue.  On Northern Ireland, which is something Senator White raised as well, and the request that we try to get the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to the House to have a debate on the breakdown in talks in Northern Ireland, I will certainly try to get the Minister in this week if at all possible.</p><p>Senator Quinn also called for a debate on young people's access to pornographic images on the Internet.  The Minister is about to publish the sexual offences Bill and that will be covered in that Bill.  We will have ample time to debate that important issue at that stage.</p><p>In response to Senator Craughwell, I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to come to the House for a debate on the property situation and rent controls.  As the Senator will be aware, the Minister is busy on other issues at present but I will continue to ask him.  I note Senator Craughwell will propose an amendment to the Order of Business tomorrow.  I have continued to try to do something about it.  It is proving difficult to get the Minister to come to the House on the issue when he is dealing with other matters in the other House.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on the persecution of Christians worldwide.  We will certainly try to hold a debate on that.  On fishing quotas, the Minister has said he is unhappy with the proposals that are before him currently.</p> <p>I note Senator O'Donovan's point that he must remain steadfast and I am sure we all wish him well in the negotiations.</p><p>I agree totally with Senator Byrne that parliamentary democracy is paramount and we will do everything to ensure parliamentary democracy will work in this House.</p><p>Senator Conway spoke about farm consultation on farm safety and the closing date for submissions on 9 January next year.  We are very thankful that Senator Conway has agreed to act as rapporteur on this issue.</p></speech>

This is a sensible recommendation and I hope he will consider it.  To give just one example, the cut in the respite care grant in last year's Social Welfare Bill left disabled people with a 30% reduction in their payment.  This reduction affected 5,000 families, for many of whom it is the only payment they receive.  In bringing forward this legislation, the Government is able to claim there are no further cuts in provision and, in fact, &euro;5 is being restored to the child benefit payment.  There is no reference, however, to what was done in the preceding years.<br/>Any government must be concerned with reviewing its priorities.  The area of disability, which saw the largest percentage cut in any allowance, should be one of those priorities.  The reduction in that case was more than &euro;300 out of a &euro;1,700 payment.  I recall it very well, but it is just one example.  We are seeking, in this amendment, to place a statutory obligation on the Minister to report back on cuts imposed in previous budgets, how those payments might be restored and, if they cannot be restored, why that is the case.  I am sure my colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, wishes to comment on the proposal.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's view.</p></speech>

This recommendation represents our attempt to go at it from a different direction.  I look forward to the Minister of State taking the opportunity in his reply to outline what the indications and sentiments are within the Department.</p><p>It is of course welcome that &euro;5 is being restored to recipients of child benefit, but that measure obscures the reality of the impact of reductions in a range of important social welfare provisions which impact the vulnerable in our society.  Lone parents, for instance, people on jobseeker's allowance and many others are really hurting.  We hear stories almost every day of the week about families who are finding it very difficult to survive.  In my own part of the country, I have been amazed to discover that households I assumed were surviving quite well, relatively speaking, are actually relying on the assistance of non-governmental organisations to get them through the Christmas period.  It is a very sad reality and I am sure the Minister of State has encountered similar cases in his own constituency, which includes a broad mix of demographics, economic and otherwise.</p> <p>From that point of view it would be important if the Minister were to outline the Government's views in his response.</p></speech>

By way of comment on the Leas-Chathaoirleach's observations, it is utter lunacy in a democracy that this House cannot make amendments to finance Bills but I discovered to my horror the other day in the newspapers, and the Minister might confirm if it is true, that Members of the D&aacute;il are not allowed make amendments either.  Only members of the Government can do that.  In a democracy that is absolutely asinine.  For what are we elected?  The civil servants, saving the presence of the two fine gentlemen behind the Minister, made a thorough balls of the economy, as did the other House.  I do not know why on earth we should not be allowed our hand's turn.</p><p>I support this amendment.  Senator O'Brien and his colleagues are not looking for a reinstatement of the savage cuts that were made and I imagine the Minister of State, as a member of the Labour Party, would want to restore these cuts as soon as possible, as would I am sure the Minister, Deputy Burton.  To keep the matter under review with the intention of ameliorating the situation is a reasonable demand and I hope the Minister will feel able to accept it.</p></speech>

In terms of all the reports, even the right wing ESRI, which is so-called independent, has indicted the Minister's Government with regard to the past four budgets.  The ESRI report on the recent budget showed that the top 40% benefited the most and the bottom 60% benefited the least.  The previous three ESRI reports on the Government's three previous budgets were even worse in that they found they deepened inequality.  That is the legacy the Minister, her party and this Government have left behind, namely, more people in poverty and more inequality.</p><p>In recent days we had the tragedy of two homeless people found dead in Cork.  A few weeks ago, unfortunately, Jonathan Corrie was found dead only a few yards away from Leinster House, the seat of Parliament.  We have children in this State who go to bed hungry and go to school hungry.  Families cannot afford to pay basic bills.  If we look at some of the cuts made by the Minister's Government in recent years, it is giving a small amount - crumbs from the table - in terms of a meagre increase in child benefit in this Bill but it has cut child benefit twice.  It does not make up for the cuts made.  The cut in the respite care grant was seen as cruel.  There have been cuts in benefits for older people, the telephone allowance and lone parents allowance.  The Minister should know that the rental cap is causing huge difficulty for families in Dublin and across the State where people cannot get access to housing.</p><p>I am appalled at the society we have now where children are in poverty, people are dying on the streets, there is structural inequality and low pay, and people who put in a week's work do not have money to provide basic needs for their family.  That is the society we have now.  When we raise these issues the Minister, his party and the Government say the money is not there.  The money is there but they are not prepared to tax wealth and the people at the top to get that money to provide the services people need.  I thought that was what they were elected to do.  That is the promise the Labour Party made to the people of this State.</p><p>It is a shame on this Government, and on all of us in the Oireachtas, that we have a society in which there is so much poverty and suffering for those at the bottom.</p> <p>If I was in government, if I was in the place of the Minister of State, sitting in his chair, I would look at those ESRI reports, and not just those reports but the reports from Social Justice Ireland, the Irish League of Credit Unions and others.  All of the independent reports which have been done in regard to his party's participation in government have consistently shown that more people are living in poverty and we have more inequality, and this budget has not done anything to make up for all of the cuts we have had since 2011.  While I will reluctantly support the Bill today because it gives something back to people, and I would not want to be voting against an increase in child benefit because those families need whatever extra income they can possibly get from the State, the Minister of State has to accept that all of the independent analysis, on which he might comment, has shown there are more people now in poverty than there were when his party and this Government took office.  I accept it took over in very difficult economic circumstances but that is still the legacy of the Minister of State and his party.</p><p>We need to review all of these policies.  One of the things my party has called for, as have some Independent Senators, is that all budgets should be equality proofed and poverty proofed.  We should not be passing budgets that increase poverty.  I would have thought that is a basic principle of the Labour Party, namely, it would equality proof and poverty proof budgets so we would not end up with a budget where a right-wing organisation, such as the ESRI, is saying the top 40% have benefited the most and those at the bottom have again taken the hit.</p><p>I wonder sometimes do politicians in government really care about those at the bottom and the suffering that is out there.  Are they even conscious of it?  Is it something they just pass over and are they just immune to it at this stage?  I am not.  I see it every single day in my constituency office, as I am sure we all do, but I am prepared to do something about it.  I am prepared to argue for a fairer society.  I am prepared to argue for fair, just and progressive taxation.  It sickens me that we have budget after budget which increases inequality and poverty, while at the same time does not ask the wealthy in society to make any contribution at all - not one red cent extra in income tax did the Minister of State's party seek from the top earners in society.  There were regressive taxes like the property tax and water charges but not one extra cent in wealth tax or higher taxes on higher earners, yet we are happy to allow children go to school hungry and have more adults in poverty.  We are happy to see that happen and allow it to continue, but let us not talk about increasing taxation on those who can afford to pay it.  Then there is this nonsense that if we do it, it will cost jobs.  It is low pay and poverty that is driving the inequality and the injustice that many people have to put up with in this State at the moment.  Unfortunately, this Government has done nothing to address it.</p><p>While I will support the Bill, the legacy the Minister of State and his party have left the people of this State is shameful.  We reluctantly support the Bill because it includes provisions for Waterford Crystal workers as well as the increase in the child benefit.  However, the Government cannot be applauded for bringing it forward today because of the cuts it has imposed on people over and over again in the past four budgets.  I am sure we will have a lot more to say on all of these issues.</p><p>Senator Norris pointed out we cannot even make amendments to the Bill and most of the recommendations are again ruled out of order.  This is a consistent theme.  We go to the trouble of putting down recommendations and we are then told they are ruled out of order.  Where is the debate?  Where is the political reform and the new politics that the Minister of State's party promised us?  There is no evidence of it at all.  The Government has trampled over the rights of the Seanad time and again, and then, when we in an earnest way try to put down recommendations and have a debate, we cannot have it as they are ruled out of order, as is the case with many of the recommendations today.  Anything that is in any way critical of Government is ruled out of order.  It is more nonsense from the Government.</p><p>This is a clever recommendation tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il which I am prepared to support.  It gives us an opportunity to remind the Government of its past failures and of the deep inequality and poverty which is in this State because of policies the Government has pursued - not as an accident but because of the policies which it has pursued and supported.</p> <p>It is a shame on all politicians and the Oireachtas that so many people are in a desperate situation but the Government is not prepared to do anything about it.</p></speech>

Thankfully, the ESRI has published a report on income distribution and the effects of the budget.  The Government used to have such a report in the budgetary documents.  It used to tell us who gained and who lost, but it stopped doing so this year because we would have gone to that page and immediately seen that every budget the Government has put forward has hit the poorest hardest.  Its own figures show this so it has stopped publishing them.  We now have the ESRI to thank for giving us the details.</p><p>The graph in the report shows the bottom 10% lose the most under the budget and the top 10% gain the most.  The ESRI found the top 30% gain and the bottom 70% in the country lose under the budget.  One difference between this and the previous Government is this would have been completely reversed.  We did not like passing the budgets we did, and the Opposition bitterly opposed them at the time, but the top earners lost more than the bottom earners.  The Government has done completely the opposite.</p><p>The Labour Party has completely abandoned all of its principles.  Why support a Government which consistently hits the poorest in society the hardest?</p></speech>

It is not what we think Governments are meant to do.  Irish Governments are meant to bring people together in one society in which those who can contribute most pay most and those who need most gain most.  The Government has turned this on its head to look after a narrow bunch who, unfortunately for the Minister of State, will predominantly vote for Fine Gael.  They will thank Fine Gael and the polls continue to show this.  It is working out for Fine Gael in the polls.  In the recent poll the top 10% very much favour Fine Gael returning to power and it is no wonder because it is gaining under successive governments.  The Minister of State can shake his head, but this is what the ESRI says.</p></speech>

One would probably find these figures somewhere on a shelf in the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as they used to publish them and tell us their own view, but they had to stop doing so because it was so embarrassing for the Government.  With all this talk of giving this and giving that, in reality the Government is taking away much more from the poorest in society.  If the Minister of State wants to know why there are huge demonstrations on the streets and why the Labour Party poll ratings have come down dramatically, the graph in the ESRI report tells him all he needs to know.  He does not need to go any further.  He has hit the poorest hardest.</p><p>I compliment my colleagues Senators O'Brien and Mooney on tabling this recommendation.  Like other speakers said, and I heard Senator Norris say it, I do not see how it can be opposed.  If the Minister of State were to suggest going back a couple of years prior to 2011, I certainly would not object to it.  It could be amended on Report Stage but at least it would be done.  There is too much political spin about what people will gain without speaking about the losses.  We have had this consistently since day one of the Government.  Its mantra has always been that there has been no change to the basic social welfare rates, but everything else has been changed and there have been some dramatic cuts.</p><p>The Government has divided society and, unfortunately for him, the Minister of State will pay the price for it.  Small groups of people have been hit really hard.  For example, the respite care grant, which is the subject of another recommendation by Senator Cullinane, has been reduced dramatically.  The previous approach was that while everybody faced a cut, those who could afford it were cut most of all.  We did not divide society into little sections.  The Minister of State in trouble now.  He states a reduction in USC was given to low earners, but he never says the six day week for social welfare was reduced, which removed the entire benefit of the USC change.  This is why no one is thanking the Government.  People can see it in their pay packet every week and they know.  Those who earn little enough to pay this low rate of USC are, by and large, part-time workers who would have benefited from the dole but it was cut to pay for the USC.  The USC was cut but so was social welfare, all to give a bit of a spin that low earners are being helped, but this is not happening.</p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will speak about the low pay commission.  There is also the National Competitiveness Council, and there is tension between the Minister and the Minister of State.  We will wait and see what happens.  I and my party believe in a society where everyone is brought together and we do not divide society between left and right.</p> <p>We are saying we are one country, we are one people coming together and we will all muck in and do our bit in accordance with how we can do it and our means to do so.  It is very important for that voice to remain at the centre of Irish politics and I think it will.  </p><p>This recommendation surely is unarguable, from a Government point of view, and I hope we can do this without playing the blame game.  I am more than happy to go back to 2009 because, in fact, in that last Government the decreases in social welfare during the period were a reversal of the increases given from the start of that Government.  The decreases were terrible and it was awful voting for them for which I paid the electoral price, as did Senator Darragh O'Brien.  We definitely tried and our Minister's guiding philosophy was to charge the high earners more and that is why there is a high rate of USC.  That is why the civil servants at the top were cut most of all.  That is why the USC higher rate is not likely to be reversed as a straightforward cut because higher earners would benefit because they are the ones that were targeted by it - those at the very top. </p><p>This Government's legacy in regards to keeping society together and keeping everyone mucking in together, is disgraceful.  The whole thing is falling apart.  The centre is not able to hold because of the policies which have led to the ESRI graph.</p></speech>

I have great sympathy with his point about not being able to make amendments to money Bills.  For his information, the money Bill provisions are set out in the Constitution.  He made an excellent point and it should be considered for both Houses.  I would support his suggestion if it went to the Constitutional Convention or for further debate in both Houses.  He made an excellent point and I agree that there is an argument for change in regard to this matter.  I thank him again for pointing that out in the way that he has done so.</p><p>In regard to Senator Byrne's comments, there are different reports and different elements.  One can also point to the ESRI report which states that income inequality has changed.  One can look at the ESRI's recent report and its remarks on the last budget.  The reports do not take into consideration the money spent on benefits, the &euro;2.3 billion that has been invested in social housing or the additional money that is being spent on the homeless sector but it is &quot;Yes&quot; when it is done.</p><p>In terms of an analysis of the budget, the Department is preparing a social impact statement on the main welfare tax and other measures in the 2015 budget.  It will be finalised when the switch model is updated by the ESRI to take into account the measures relating to water affordability.  It is intended to publish the analysis as soon as it is feasible or when available.  That model will be published.  I hope my response answer's the Senator's query.  </p><p>I wish to point out that the Department of Social Protection conducts a pre-budget submission forum.  One of the key areas of the pre-budget forum, comprised of different voluntary groups, was that we should in some way acknowledge the living alone allowance.  That was done and it is the first time the allowance has been increased since 1996.</p><p>Child benefit elements were also highlighted.  While only &euro;5 has been recouped from the original &euro;10 cut I still think the measure is welcome.  As somebody said in the Seanad when I appeared here last, a &euro;5 reduction would have been considered to be massive but when it is a &euro;5 increase it is considered to be only crumbs.  The measure is a step in the right direction which I hope will be acknowledged. </p><p>It is very important that older people are acknowledged and, therefore, the 25% Christmas bonus is welcome.  It was unfortunate that the Christmas bonus was abolished in 2009 in its entirety so a reintroduction of 25% is welcome.  </p><p>There has also been a post-budget forum comprised of the same groups which acknowledged that the key points were, in some way, taken on board.  There has been that level of consultation and there has been a review in the process.</p> <p>In many ways, I find it difficult to take some of the remarks made by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am not going to get into this party thing of "You done this and we done that" because the list we could read out of what happened in the early periods would be a multiple of any list of our failings.</p></speech>

It has been difficult and there have been difficult decisions.  I do not deny that.  The Labour Party, as we are constantly reminded, is paying a price at the polls, but so be it if we can get this country moving again and get people back into their jobs.  The shortest way out of poverty is back into employment.  There are a number of elements.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  As I have outlined, there are areas in the pre-budget forum, we have a post-budget forum and there is the switch model that is being tabled.  I thank Senator Cullinane for his support for the social welfare Bill.  It is important that those payments are made and are made on time and I thank the Senators for what is sometimes constructive criticism, although sometimes it is just scoring party political points and I want to move away from that.</p></speech>

I have great empathy with the Minister of State at a political as well as a personal level, because I could not help but be reminded, as I was listening to him talking about the decisions taken by this Government in the national interest, of the exact same rhetoric, which I listened to in the dying months of the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration.  Keep in mind that the Administration that Brian Cowen took over in 2008 was faced with the virtual economic collapse of the country.  What happened before that was a prior Government's decision.</p><p>What has been lost in the argument and the justifiable anger of the electorate in recent years, is that from 2008 on, that Government attempted to rebuild the nation's finances and get us out of penury.  In the closing months, when the Green Party decided to pull out of government, there was great debate within the Government as to what direction to take - whether it would go to the country at that time, October-November 2010, or stay in power in the national interest and put forward a budget.  We know what happened.  The budget was framed and it was passed, in the national interest.</p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party was then decimated because of the decisions it took, not in a selfish way, but from its patriotic duty and responsibility to ensure the country would get out of the economic mess it had got into.  I am not putting that forward as a reason for the Government to pull back from the patriotic decisions it is taking in the national interest, and I have no doubt that is its motivation, but the electorate can be very cruel.  While both of us can argue about the merits or otherwise of that Administration, there is no doubt in my mind, and I will be convinced until I leave this House and beyond, that the decisions taken by that Government, with Brian Lenihan as Minister for Finance, helped to provide the framework from which the new Government, when it took over, was able to carry on its economic agenda.</p> <p>It is equally ironic that the four-year plan published by the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il Administration in its dying months was effectively the model used and implemented by the current Government up to and including the point at which the troika left.  I am sure we could have a very interesting debate about it but it is important to put it on the record.  Around Christmas, in particular, I reflect on those months because it was at Christmas time that all of this happened.</p><p>While I welcome the increase in the living alone allowance from &euro;7.90 to &euro;9 per week, this increase works out at &euro;0.20 per day.  That is the reality of it.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il went into great detail about the various decisions taken by this Government.  I do not want to be ultra-political about it, but in the context of the Government's own presentation of the improvements in social welfare and the increase in payments, I wish to point out that although &euro;196 million is being put back into social welfare, the Government took almost &euro;2 billion out of it in the three preceding budgets.  Outside organisations and NGOs have indicated that this has widened the gap between rich and poor by a minimum of &euro;500.  As a result of the budget, a single unemployed person gains &euro;46.80 per year.  A couple with two earners on &euro;125,000 per year gains &euro;1,226, which is nearly 30 times more.  The budget gives about &euro;0.90 per week to an unemployed single person, and &euro;14.30 per week to a single person earning &euro;75,000.  That does not sound like a progressive policy to me and it is impacting on the vulnerable.</p><p>I have a lot of other statistics before me here but am taking my cue from the Minister of State and will not go into them all.  I will stand over the record of previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations in the area of social welfare.  The primary reason there was a grand alliance of the electorate from the left, centre and right was the policies pursued by successive Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations aiming to help the poor and the vulnerable.  If we sound a little sensitive in this area it is because it is in our party's DNA to protect the vulnerable at all times.  That is why we are critical of this Government and this Department in terms of how they are addressing the most vulnerable in our society. </p></speech>

I commend the Minister of State for his commitment to the regeneration of the country, despite sectoral party interests.  I believe that is genuine and I salute the Minister of State and the Labour Party for it.  I believe they are going into the wilderness but they are doing so in what they see as a good cause.<br/>The Christmas bonus is very welcome but it is only 25% of what was there before and is therefore a small amount.  It is a case for one hurrah rather than three cheers.  <br/>I would like to ask the Minister of State about the explanatory and financial memorandum as a matter of information.  It states on pages 1 and 2: <blockquote>The following other social protection measures which were announced in Budget 2015 relate to non-statutory schemes and do not require any legislative amendments-(<i>a</i>) The new Water Subsidy worth &euro;100 per annum for all recipients of the Household Benefits Package and for all recipients of the fuel allowance who do not already receive the Household Benefits Package,<br />(<i>b</i>) the doubling of the number of employees supported by JobsPlus from 3,000 to 6,000,<br />(<i>c</i>) additional funding of &euro;12 million in 2015 for the introduction of new employment services (JobPath), and<br />(<i>d</i>) additional annual funding of &euro;2 million for the School Meals Programme.</blockquote></p> <p>That is telling us what the Bill does not address.  I do not see the point in that unless it is a kind of political advertisement: "We gave this" and "We did that".  One might as well say this Bill does not address climate change.  It does not because it is not about climate change.</p><p>I do not think I have ever seen in an explanatory memorandum before a recital of things that the Bill does not do.  Is there an explanation for that?</p></speech>

Very often when Ministers are trying to bat away criticism, the notion of a party political debate is peddled.  It very much depends on what side of the Chamber one is sitting on.</p></speech>

This recommendation goes back to 2011 and asks for a review of all the reductions that have taken place and the impact they have had on citizens.</p><p>The Minister of State said in response that getting people back to work is the best way to lift people out of poverty.  I agree with that.  In reality that should be the case, but in Ireland it is not the case because many in low paid employment are in poverty.  Many people in work are in poverty and cannot afford to pay basic bills.  They fall into poverty traps.  They may have an income up to &euro;300 a week but they do not qualify for any of the benefits they would qualify for if they were on social welfare.  We end up paying family income supplement and so on, which can be called corporate welfare because it subsidises employers who do not pay their staff enough.  We have a significant difficulty with low pay and the Minister of State should be reminded and should be aware of the recent OECD report that showed that of all of the OECD countries, Ireland had the second highest number of people in low-paid employment.  That is another international report which has indicted this State in terms of pay.  We have a significant disparity in pay from those at the top to those at the bottom, both in the public and private sectors.</p><p>This is an issue that the Minister of State, when in Opposition, would have been talking about as well.  I am sure if the Minister of State were standing where I am, and a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister were sitting in the Minister's chair, and we had done what the Minister of State's party has been doing for the past four years, he would be criticising us.  He would not be doing what he is doing now, which is looking for credit.  The Minister of State says that it is the responsibility of his party and the other party in Government to rebuild the economy.  We are all interested in rebuilding the economy and the country.  Unfortunately, what we have been left with is a country that has deep and structural inequality and more people living in poverty.  We have a two-tier economic recovery and all of the evidence that we pointed out to the Minister of State has shown that to be the case.  There is something fundamentally wrong with rebuilding the economy on the backs of people on welfare and at the expense of people in low-paid employment, with the people at the top benefiting the most.  There is something fundamentally wrong with that.  I am in favour of fairness in our economy.  I want to see the issue of low pay dealt with.  I know there is a commission on low-paid employment which will publish its report.</p><p>I brought to the attention of the Minister during the Second Stage debate that I took on the responsibility of drafting a report for the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, acting as a rapporteur to look at the concept of a social wage, that is, a living wage and the relationship between low-paid work and access to public services.  The Minister of State made this point when responding to the ESRI report.  There are people who might earn &euro;250 per week working full time.  I met 17 people who work in a cr&egrave;che, looking after children, who earn &euro;250 a week.  They had taken an 8% pay cut because of cuts in funding to the cr&egrave;che.  It costs them more to work, but they are prepared to work because it gives them dignity.  Let us not suggest that those people are better off in work.  They are not better off in terms of their access to services.  They do not qualify for most of the benefits.  They find it difficult to get access to health care for themselves or their children.  They must pay for education at primary, second, third and fourth level.</p> <p>We do not have access to services.  We have a housing crisis, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  All of these issues are important in the context of the recommendation before the House.</p><p>I would like to speak about the rebuilding of the country.  In recent years, some &euro;90 billion has been put into the banks so that bondholders could be repaid.  They have got their money.  They are away on their toes.  That is them paid.  We borrowed the money from the troika.  We emptied the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  All of that money is gone.  It was spent on putting it into failed banks.  Some &euro;30 billion of it was put in by this Government.  On the other hand, we have all the cuts about which we have just spoken, including those that are affecting older people.  I will give a final example.  The Minister of State spoke about how older people will benefit from this budget.  The bin waiver that was in place in Waterford city for many years has been abolished by the local authority.  When the waiver was in place, older people had to pay &euro;50 to have their bins collected, but they now have to pay &euro;300.  That is another example.  I suggest that the conservation grant that is being applied to the water charges will go the same way.  Older people know they have not benefitted from this Government, which has cut many of their allowances since 2011.  Older people and their families feel those cuts in their pockets.  There is something fundamentally wrong when all of these cuts are being imposed, and inequality is deepening, after &euro;90 billion of our money was put into the banks to pay back bondholders.</p><p>Members of the Government have said they do not care about their seats.  People do not care about anybody's seats, but they care about fairness.  They see something fundamentally wrong with all of these cuts.  I am sure the Minister of State sees the poverty and the suffering out there.  All of this is happening after money was being pumped into the banks to pay back bondholders.  There is something fundamentally disgusting about what is happening in our society.  It does not matter to me who is in power.  If there are people dying on the streets, children going to bed hungry and people living in poverty, it should not matter who is in government.  If Sinn F&eacute;in was in government, I would be here criticising them as well.  It is wrong that we have such a two-tier society.  As I have said, all the evidence shows that the Minister of State, his party and the Government as a whole have deepened that inequality.  In James Connolly's famous phrase, the quality of a nation should be judged on how it treats the poorest class.  The Government has treated the poorest class in this State very shabbily.  I hope the Minister of State will support this recommendation, which gives us an opportunity to provide for some sort of poverty-proofing of previous decisions made by this Government, including when it cut social welfare.</p></speech>

We must listen to people who do not agree with us and accuse us of doing certain things.  We cannot just say that the Christmas bonus was brought back in and that it was terrible when it was abolished by Fianna F&aacute;il.  People should read the ESRI study, which goes through the entire list of austerity measures that were introduced from the budget of October 2008 onwards.  Significant income tax changes were made.  The progressive tax measures that were introduced had the hardest effects on the wealthiest people.  The hated universal social charge is a progressive tax measure that hits the wealthiest the hardest.  The elimination of the PRSI ceiling by this Government hit all workers exactly the same, regardless of whether they are wealthy.  That is the difference.  That is how that happened.  I could also mention the changes in welfare rates and the reduction in child benefit rates from that period.  I meant to refer to the removal of the PRSI allowance.

I apologise for causing confusion but the progressive measures were introduced by both Governments.  We brought in two thirds of the austerity but we tried to do it in a way that hit the wealthiest the hardest.  I did not like the way the changes to child benefit were made.  I would love to have seen a means test brought in.  No Government has had the courage to deal with that.</p><p>The reduction in the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for the young unemployed was started by the previous Government and continued by this one.  The public sector pension levy hit the public service but it was highly progressive because the highest earners paid the most and the lowest earners the least but it was very difficult for them.  There were cuts in public sector pay in 2010 and again under this Government with the Haddington Road agreement.  The public service pension cuts were a huge issue but that was a progressive measure.</p><p>The property tax was not progressive because it does not affect people according to their income but according to the house they live in or the location.  The abolition of the Christmas bonus in 2009 and its partial restoration are included in this study and the cutbacks in the household benefits package, which were insidious because they benefit people over the age of 70, the disabled and carers.  While this was being cut the Government was saying basic social welfare rates have not changed but those receiving the benefits could see exactly what was being changed.  All these matters are included in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, study including the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus this year which we welcome.  That shows the cumulative, relative impact of austerity and that the poorest suffered comparatively the least in percentage terms and the wealthy suffered the hardest.  One can make that case only by going back through all the measures brought in since the famous budget in October 2008.</p><p>The measures this Government has brought in have hit the poorest the hardest.  The Minister of State should examine this and try to change course by supporting this recommendation, consider the expenditure cuts and restore them to the level they were at before the last Government cut the rates.  Other Departments have a role as well.  He could consider the options for changing the graph because the poorest in society have been hit very hard by the choices this Government has made.</p><p>The Government talks about the International Monetary Fund, IMF, agreement forcing it to do this or that but there were many things in that agreement that were not done, including some progressive taxation measures, reform and regulation of the legal profession, of the medical consultants and the top levels of various other professions.  This Government decided to hit the poorest hardest and to let the wealthy away relatively lightly in comparison.</p></speech>

This does not need to be dealt with in legislation but it is important that it is there for the information of the Seanad.</p><p>I take Senator Byrne's comments in the spirit they were made.  This is an extremely difficult time.  When the last Government was in power, 1,000 jobs were lost per week.  We are in a better situation now when 1,000 jobs a week are being created.  The Senator said that this Government has cut the social welfare budget by &euro;2 billion.  The amount is actually &euro;1.6 billion.  Much of that is reflected in the number of people who have returned to work, meaning there is a lower pay-out which has given us some flexibility.  </p><p>I take all the Senator&rsquo;s points on the bank bailout.  The Labour Party and the T&aacute;naiste voted against that.  I will not remind the Senator of his own party&rsquo;s history in that respect.  The Senator constantly brings up the ESRI report.  I do not agree with the element in the report that stated older people took less of a hit because many factors were not taken into consideration.  That is why 25% of the Christmas bonus and the living alone allowance were included.  The Senator is right to say that the living alone allowance is quite small.  There has not been an increase in the allowance since 1996, the last time the Labour Party was in government.  The increase is approximately 17% of the living alone allowance.  It is important to recognise that because it is as costly to heat a home for one person as for two and often there is no income.  I would like the allowance to be acknowledged more in the future, to help people.  Sometimes cooking one dinner is as cheap as cooking two.  None of this is taken into consideration for older people.  There are contradictions in the ESRI report and I do not think Senator Byrne would agree with what it states about how austerity measures have hit older people.  Senator Byrne probably feels, like me, that they were hit harder and that was not captured by the ESRI study.</p><p>The switch programme is being carried out and will be published as quickly as possible and made available.  I do not intend to accept the recommendation.</p></speech>

The issue relating to recommendation No. 3 was debated extensively in the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage and Report Stage, but we feel it is worth restating the position.  The lough payment scheme is something on which we were lobbied by MABS.  In 1997 the household budget scheme, HHB, was extended to include the lough payment scheme.  The lough payment scheme was jointly managed by The Lough credit union and Cork MABS and was established to facilitate MABS clients nationwide to pay additional creditors other than the local authority and utility companies.  In early 2014, approximately 25 MABS services supported more than 400 clients to pay debts via the lough payment scheme.  Examples of debts being paid via the scheme include credit unions and Garda fines.  Levels of financial exclusion are higher in Ireland than in 12 of the 15 EU countries.<br/>In the past ten years, in an attempt to promote access to legal financial services and reduce the reliance of many on illegal moneylenders, the National Traveller MABS, NTMABS, has promoted the use of the lough payment scheme.  NTMABS has worked extensively with a number of partner organisations, local MABS, Clann Credo, Dublin City Council, Wicklow County Council and the Parish of the Travelling People to provide small loan and loan guarantee schemes in an attempt to provide alternatives to illegal moneylenders for members of the Traveller community.  All of the loan and loan guarantee schemes use the lough payment scheme as a method of repaying the loans.<br/>As part of the criteria of each of the schemes, the lough payment scheme was identified as the sole method of repayment by the participating organisations.  They include credit unions and the organisations I previously listed.  The Social Welfare Act 2012 made changes to the creditors that can be paid under the HHB scheme.  It requires An Post to have an agreement in place with all relevant creditors to make deductions from an individual's social welfare payment.  In future, reductions can only be made for the following creditors - local authority rent, ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Eircom and Airtricity.  The change impacts on the current MABS arrangements with The Lough credit union and the lough payment scheme.<br/>A lengthy presentation was made to us by the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  I read some of the transcripts into the record.  The recommendation is straightforward.  The provisions in the 2012 Act resulted in changes that excluded the option for Travellers to repay loans or pay fines by the previous method, which was proving to be successful.  MABS has lobbied us and we feel it is important to keep pushing the issue, including to a vote, because it impacts on vulnerable people.  I have made the argument and I will listen to the response of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

This is an old chestnut in one sense, but in the context of the Government&rsquo;s reforming zeal in recent years I would have thought there would have been more success in the area.  I have spoken to colleagues in the House informally about the various areas of the social welfare system that are creaking under the weight of the appeals system.  There must be some positivity about it.  I hope the Minister of State will give some indication of what efforts are being made within the Department to address delays in appeals, in particular for invalidity benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance, which appear to be among the more long-running sores, if I could put it that way, that are experienced by public representatives at all levels throughout the country.  The reason we tabled the recommendation was to try to bring order to the appeals system.  That is why we asked that an appeals officer would decide an appeal within a prescribed time of 60 working days from the date of receipt of the appeal.  I do think that is too short a time.  It is two calendar months.<br/>We also ask that an appeals officer may apply to the chief appeals officer for an extension of time to consider the appeal in exceptional circumstances.  We are introducing some flexibility into the recommendation.  An appeals officer would have to demonstrate the reasons for the delay and the appellant shall be informed of the reasons for the delay in writing.  The last part of the amendment is the most controversial.  It is a bit like when one is standing on a train platform waiting for a train or waiting at a bus stop for a bus.  I accept the situation has improved with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in that regard, but there was a time not that long ago when one could be standing at a bus stop or waiting for a train to come and not be told the reasons for the delay.  Interestingly, it still happens in airports, in spite of all the modern technology available.  Time and again, one gets airlines that do not inform the public of what is happening.<br/>The biggest single issue that arises is not so much the inconvenience of the delay but it is the fact that there is no communication.  Nobody has any idea of what is going on.  In this day and age it is not the function of either county councillors, Senators or Deputies - certainly not a Minister - to have to be the person who is communicating back to a constituent the reasons they believe there is a delay because they got a response from the relevant civil servant in the section to say they are really sorry but there will not be progress for at least two months or three months or the appeals officer is out sick, or the case is with the appeals officer and the case file is overloaded and the person is saying off the record that it will take longer than the Government has specified.  Public representatives have heard all of those reasons.  Irrespective of the other aspects of the recommendation, communication is vital.  Surely a system could be put in place for communication with clients to let them know the reason for delays.  It could be nothing more than a simple letter to say the delay is due to A, B or C.<br/>Having done that, there is a need to address a long-running problem, which goes back to the core of the recommendation.  I appreciate the Minister of State inherited the problem and it is not necessarily a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s actions but it is long past time to deal with the matter, in particular in light of those who increasingly receive social welfare benefits, especially those in vulnerable areas.  While I do not wish to categorise those on social welfare, it could be a matter of economic life or death that appeals for invalidity benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance are addressed as quickly, efficiently and expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600025#CC00100"><p>I second the recommendation.  We all have experience, as I am sure the Minister of State and other Members of the House do, of people getting in touch with us who experience extraordinarily long delays in getting an initial decision on their application and then an appeal.  The motion proposes 60 days or two months which should be long enough.  It is extraordinarily unfair when people end up waiting between six and eight months for a decision.  I have cases of this happening where people sought the carer's allowance, disability allowance and invalidity pension.  These people are really sick but they have had to wait this length of time to hear the result of an appeal.</p><p>There is a sense in some respects that in pushing out the timeframe, the Government hopes for attrition.  People have often said to me that the Government must hope 10% will drop out of the process due to getting fed up with the requests for extra information.  People get exhausted by delays, particularly when ill and in receipt of an illness payment or where they have a serious disability.  If a person gets a favourable decision at the end of an appeal, he or she must be paid anyway so there is a cost to the State.  The recommendation is about timing and ensuring people receive a decent and efficient service, to which they are entitled, and are not made to wait for excessive periods for decisions to be made.  The proposed timeframe is extremely reasonable.  Two months is not a difficult target to meet.  As Senator Mooney has pointed out, the recommendation contains the provision that when there are genuinely exceptional circumstances, the timeframe may be longer, but at least reasons must be given for doing so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600025#CC00200"><p>I support the recommendation.  As Senator Power has said, any public representative who holds clinics or assists people with social welfare applications or applications for payments will inevitably have dealt with people who have been waiting for very lengthy periods for their appeal to be heard.  Part of the problem is a communication failure between the appeals office and the person concerned or even between the social welfare office and the person concerned.  I do not know how many times I have had to make representations in these cases.  We are quite limited in what we can do.  All we can do is make sure that a person's application has been properly looked at and that the officers have all the information they need.  It is not our job to do their job.  We just make sure that they have all the information.</p><p>I have found it frustrating at times when I have phoned the appeals office only to be told they are waiting on documentation, something that was not communicated to the individual.  That is the reason a claim or appeal is held up.  I commend the Minister on introducing the Intreo service which has some level of public interface, but it is not enough.  The service has been rolled out and is a much improved service.  Many people get very frustrated, however, when they go to the local social welfare office.  They must queue up to find out information, but when they get to the counter they must deal with staff who are frustrated and under pressure.  People do not get the information they need which leads to them feeling very distressed, and then they have no choice but to approach politicians about the matter.  There is no privacy for them either.  There is no real place, forum or space for them to go to and get the information they need.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we must empower people and not have situations where people are forced to go to politicians.  We must empower people in order that they can get the information they need from their local social welfare offices.  Unfortunately, they cannot do so and then they phone the numbers provided which takes God knows how long to get through.  When people do get through on the phone, they leave a message which goes into the black hole that is the answering service, one where 99% of messages are never answered.  I took up this matter with a community welfare officer in Waterford.  She told me that staff cannot respond to the messages because they do not have the time or resources to do so.  That is the reason so many claims go to appeal.</p><p>It is also not communicated properly to people that they do not have to appeal directly and can call for a review of the decision instead.  Such information would help people and should be made clear or put more simply to them.  That is an option, but unless one understands it, the word &quot;appeal&quot; jumps out so people opt for an appeal and not for a review.  Many improvements could be made in communicating that fact which in turn would improve the situation.  The Minister has gone some way to change the system along those lines but a lot more must be done.</p><p>The logic behind this recommendation is correct.  People should not have to wait such a long time to have an appeal heard.  Some examples have been given of people having to wait 12 months or more for an appeal, which is an outrageous period to wait for a payment.  Therefore, I support the recommendation.</p></speech>

I have dealt with the appeals office and found on numerous occasions that the office was not waiting for documents from the client but it was the case that the Department of Social Welfare had not returned a file to the appeals office.  The appeals office had written, I had been on to them about the matter, and they had also sent reminders to the Department.  It is the process in the Department that needs to be tightened up.</p><p>The Minister has appointed a number of new appeals officers and I am sure the Minister of State will update us on what their appointment has done for the appeals system.  If an appeal goes straight to the appeals office and the office feels the Department can deal with the case better than it can, the case is sent back for a review which is a much quicker option than an appeal.  The problem is a lot of the time the right medical evidence is not submitted with medical application-based appeals.  The delay is within the Department.</p><p>The Senators are right that we should communicate more, and let me explain why.  It is okay if I ring up and the appeals office says it has not got the file back from the Department in Killarney, Galway or wherever the case may be, but the client should be told that the appeals office is still waiting for a file from the Department.  It is the Department that must tighten up more than the appeals office.  Will the Minister of State update Members on the impact of the appointment of new appeals officers on the length of time taken for appeals?  I have found that some appeals have become a bit quicker to issue.</p></speech>

The period laid out in the recommendation is not viable because it can take up to six weeks to organise an oral hearing and, therefore, a 60-day element is impractical.</p><p>We have a very flexible system because, at every stage, it is open to the client to give additional information.  Where a strict time period operates, the appeals system normally operates only on the basis of the information that is supplied in the first instance.  In our system we allow additional information to be submitted at every single stage, which is a much more flexible position.  I would hate to lose that flexibility.  On many occasions I have seen people benefit in the review from additional information that was provided rather than going back to the beginning again to submit a whole new application.</p><p>As many as 15 additional appeals officers have been appointed.  I acknowledge that during the period from 2010 to early 2013 there was an unacceptable delay in the appeals process due to a dramatic and unprecedented increase in appeals numbers which placed considerable pressure on appeals officers.  Prior to 2009, the average number of appeals received per year was in the region of 15,000.  By 2012, the number of appeals received had more than doubled and peaked at 35,000. </p><p>The number of appeals currently being received remains high.  In 2013, the social welfare appeals office received a total of 32,777 appeals, or the second highest annual number of appeals received since the office was established.  However, significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming and improving the appeals system.  An extra 15 appeals officers have been appointed and ten former community welfare service appeals officers joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of appeals officers to 41.</p><p>Let me give examples of the improvements made.  I know one can always build on those improvements and we all want the system to be as speedy and fair as possible.  For example,  the time taken for an appeal involving an oral hearing has dropped from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 29 weeks at the end of October 2014, which is a reduction of nearly six months.  The time taken for a summary decision has reduced from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 21.6 weeks in 2014, and I can list further reductions for the Senators.</p> <p>It must be remembered that the social welfare appeals mechanism operates on a statutory basis and social welfare appeals officers are required to be quasi-judicial in the performance of their functions.  Certainly we would all like to hit the target of 60 days for many reasons.  If it was to be done, the system would have to be reformed out of all recognition.  I do not know whether one could continue to add additional information once the initial application was made.  I am not proposing to accept the recommendation but I am committed to trying to improve the times further and to getting that information out better.  For example, one does not necessarily always have to seek an appeal but a review which often proves as successful as a full appeal for a fraction of the time involved.</p><p>I thank the Senator whose points are well made.  He understands the system well enough to realise that we probably cannot hit that target of 60 days for many reasons.  However, we have to strive to improve the time element for applicants.  I thank the Senator for his comments in respect of the Intreo offices.  I have visited a number of those offices, where I have witnessed a much better service for the customer.  All the information is available at one location.  I expect to see a roll-out of further Intreo centres in the new year.  The removal of the glass barriers in the reception area enables queries to be dealt with there and then.  The Intreo offices in place are good but we need to expand the service around the country as quickly as possible.  I thank the Senator for his positive comments in respect of the centres.</p></speech>

I am somewhat reassured by his continuing commitment and that of the Department to try to reduce the appeal time.  I am interested to know whether the appointment of the 15 new appeals officers is coming from within the Department or if they are new employees.  I am aware that a public service embargo is in place.  I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am wrong but I understand from recent comments by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that there has been a loosening of the public service embargo in the sense that where there is a real need within Departments it will be addressed.  It would appear that if one is taking 15 people out of one area of the Department and moving them to another, one has to make up the gap.   Perhaps he would clarify that issue.</p><p>It would be helpful if the Department's press office was to issue, say, quarterly updates of the nature the Minister of State has provided here to reassure the general populace.  Irrespective of all the good work he has outlined - I will not be critical of it - why is it that there is still a continuing flow of people to constituency clinics who have a problem with the appeals process?  Given what the Minister of State has said and the complexities surrounding the appeals process, to ensure fairness and equity, because, as he correctly pointed out there is a quasi-judicial aspect to this also, perhaps the issue is about communication.  I do not have the answer but if there is some way of communicating to the general public about an issue which, on an individual basis, is probably very painful for people who are waiting in certain categories, it might help to assuage them in some way.  Perhaps it could be done through a structure for Deputies and Senators.  I thank the Minister of State for the information he has provided.</p></speech>

Some of the staff are F&Aacute;S employees who have come in to the Department of Social Protection.  Some of the additional 15 staff are from F&Aacute;S and some are from a reallocation within the Department.  There is a great deal of reform taking place in the Department and staff are being deployed to pressure areas.  We would certainly like to see the numbers reducing.  The Intreo offices will have access to the public and will be in a better position to give information to the public.  The Intreo offices will play a strong role in ensuring that people understand the process.  There is always room for improvement and we have to strive to improve the service to the public.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the officials they have been doing their utmost to reduce the numbers.  That is clear from some of the figures I have given in percentage terms.  While progress has been made I am anxious that further progress be made.  I will look at any avenue where we can help to improve that.</p></speech>

As part of this package, the Department of Social Protection will administer a new water conservation grant of &euro;100.  Arising from the revised charge structure which is simpler and more affordable, Irish Water will no longer require PPS numbers.  As a consequence, there will no longer be a need for Irish Water to be listed as a specific body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 for the purpose of using PPS numbers.  Therefore, the only time householders will have to provide their PPS numbers is when registering for the &euro;100 water conservation grant to the Department which is the official agency that issues the PPS numbers.  This will allay many of the concerns that have been expressed on this matter.</p></speech>

He referred to the water conservation grant which this recommendation is about.  This is not a conservation grant at all - let us be honest about it.  Let us accept what this is - it was a partial climbdown by the Government in regard to the charge.  On the one hand the Minister of State said the cost at &euro;160 for an individual and &euro;260 for a family will be reduced to &euro;60 and &euro;160 through the so-called water conservation grant.  However, water conservation has gone out the window.  While I disagree with SIPTU and Jack O'Connor's position on water charges, he was right when he said we have a bizarre situation where we are paying for the water we use but nobody is paying a penalty for the water that is lost in the system.  That is what we have ended up with, a cap system.  To call it a water conservation grant is nonsense.  How does providing a grant of &euro;100 conserve water?  Will the Minister of State explain how that grant will save one single solitary drop of water?  It does nothing of the sort.</p><p>This follows the complete mess made by the Government on water charges.  It is trying to clean up the mess and do its best to allay people's fears but that has not happened.  We have ended up with the convoluted system of a change on the one hand and a water conservation grant on the other and a relationship between the Department of Social Protection and Irish Water.  It is all a complete mess of the Government's making.  Our recommendation seeks to remove that element of it from the Bill because we are opposed to the charges.  This makes a mockery of the notion that water charges were about conservation because it has been proven, given that the Government has capped the charge up to 2019, that it is about establishing the principle of the charge, getting the revenue in and getting people accustomed to paying for it.</p> <p> The final point I wish to raise with the Minister of State is the issue of the bin charge waiver scheme in Waterford, which I raised earlier.  I am sure it is not the only area that has had such a scheme in place.  It was abolished at the last council meeting by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael but not by Sinn F&eacute;in who voted against it.  I want to set the record straight on that.  People were given the same logic when charges for waste collection were first introduced, namely, that there would be a nominal fee that would be quite small but then the charges went up and up every year.  We were told it was not about privatisation, rather it was about improving the service and that the State could not be a regulator and a provider of the service.  All those excuses and arguments were made.  The charge increased to a certain amount and all the local authorities withdrew from providing that service, the private operators came in and now I do not believe a single local authority in the State provides the service.  It was privatised and the bin waiver scheme, which was in place to protect the vulnerable, has been abolished and now there is no protection for them.  It was interesting that the chief executive office of Waterford City and County Council, Mr. Michael Walsh, when supporting the abolition of the waiver, asked why does the Department of Social Protection not have a bin waiver scheme for everybody, that it is its job and should not be the job of a local authority.  The Minister of State might want to respond to Mr. Walsh on that.  I saw that comment as a cop-out by the council.  We can see the same is happening with the water conservation grant.  That is a temporary measure - that is all it is.  It is a con job on the people.  I will be pressing this recommendation because I believe this is a complete mess for the Government and entirely of its own making.  For that reason, I do not accept the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am not boasting about the fact but just pointing out that it was something that the overwhelming majority of Members of both Houses and all parties did not pick up on at the time.  I was somewhat taken aback by the fact that first, this was being introduced in a social welfare Bill and, second, that when I raised the issue in an exchange with the Minister of State's line Minister, Deputy Burton, it was pointed out to me that the main reason PPS numbers were being sought was to ensure the allowances that were to be given to children under the age of 18 would be accurately calculated.  It seemed, on the face of it, a fair response if it was going to mean that households would be paying less and that such information was needed in that respect, but I was deeply uncomfortable about a semi-State agency - at that stage we were not sure exactly what the status of Irish Water would be - would have detailed and intimate information in order to provide this allowance.  I was concerned, and I raise it again in the context of this recommendation, that there was real danger that Irish Water could sell on or could give third parties access to those numbers, even though the Minister assured that would not be the case.  As it transpired the Data Protection Commissioner became very exercised about this issue, so much so that he raised serious concerns about it.  That was the background and the context.<br/>Like all public representatives I am lobbied and receive representations from a wide variety of both individuals and organisations but in all the time I have served in this House I have never received as many e-mails on the Irish Water issue as I have in the past three days.  I stopped counting them at 2,500 e-mails and they are still pouring into my e-mail account.  The same is the true for all Senators and particularly Senators because the issue is being addressed to Senators as this matter is coming before us later in the week.  My initial reaction was that this was a concerted lobby from some vested interests but it is not because I have replied to some of these people.  It is impossible to physically reply to all of them but I have replied to some who have raised particular issues about the Irish Water legislation.  Some very sad cases of family circumstances have been outlined to me in those emails.  </p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Kelly, was not able to provide that information.  It is not within the Minister of State's brief to do so but I am anxious to know how this &euro;100 grant will be implemented.  What costs will be incurred on the Department for it, and will it even happen?

I do not have much more to add because if I do that I will be getting into the Irish Water debate.  I would say, however, and Senator Cullinane mentioned the bin charge waiver in Waterford at length, that I served on Dublin City Council from 1999 until I was elected to this House and we were able to maintain a bin waiver while providing the service.  We lost the service because those in People Before Profit were intent on ensuring that nobody would pay for that service and it was no longer financially viable for Dublin City Council to carry it out.  I believe it was an important service.  If people had been more constructive in the anti-bin charge campaign, many more local authorities would still be providing the service and a waiver system would be in place.  The outcome of that People Before Profit campaign has worsened the situation for many people across the State because local authorities provided a very good service but, unfortunately, the financial viability was removed by protestors for the sake of protesting, with the result that people were led up the garden path.<br/>I will not go into the Irish Water debate-----</p></speech>

We had a very interesting debate with the Minister of State prior to the vote.  This discussion is going to be a continuation of that.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste may not be up to speed on what was said earlier.  In that context, a number of recommendations relating to section 3 were ruled out of order, which is fine.  However, we engaged in a discussion on a number of issues.  One of those relates to why recommendations or amendments are continually being ruled out of order.  Another matter that arises is why we are dealing with recommendations rather than amendments in the context of the Bill before us.  The question of Opposition Deputies and Senators being in a position to table recommendations or amendments to Money Bills should be considered in the context of political reform.  Before he left, the Minister of State provided a commitment to the effect that he would have the matter examined.</p><p>Section 3 presented the Government with the opportunity to reverse many of the cuts it made previously.  The Minister of State made an interesting point about an advisory group or commission that has been put in place to examine alternative budgets or pre-budget submissions.  When we discuss the budget and the Finance and Social Welfare and Pensions Bills each year, I make the point that there should be much greater pre-budget scrutiny in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We end up debating the relevant issues after the fact, in other words, after the budget has been presented rather than beforehand.  If we could consider all of the relevant issues prior to the budget's introduction, we could examine the impact of measures that were put in place in the past and, potentially, what might be contained in-----</p></speech>

The Leas-Chathaoirleach, when he was in the Chair, allowed for a proper and free-flowing debate.</p><p>When we seek to highlight such issues, namely, the need for proper pre-budget debates, we are informed that we should raise them when the legislation comes before the House.  When we do that, we are informed that our amendments or recommendations have been ruled out of order.  When are we to raise the issues?  I would argue that this is the time to do so.  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill is currently before the House and it presented the Government the opportunity to make changes in respect of social welfare, which it has not done.</p><p>The first of the recommendations that were ruled out of order related to the respite care grant.  We could have focused on any of the cuts made by the Government in recent years but the one to respite care grant is seen as being particularly cruel.</p> <p>The cut to the respite care was seen as a particularly cruel cut on people who do a very good and very difficult job.  Yet the Minister cut the respite care grant in the last budget.  Through the amendment in this section we sought to overturn the cut to the respite care grant.  That was one of the amendments we tabled.</p><p>I wish to speak about two other amendments on overpayments that were ruled out of order.  That is a very important issue because as the Minister knows many people are in poverty.  We set social welfare rates at the minimum amount of money people should be living on.  I do not know if the Minister read the submission made to the Department by the round table discussion on social welfare law that was commissioned by the Community Law and Mediation Service.  It made two recommendations.  I will be brief on this because I accept we need to move on to the other amendments.</p><p>Its first recommendation was that section 13 which was amended in previous Social Welfare Bills be reformed through amending legislation and that at a minimum the previous position where no one is forced to live below the State's minimum level of basic income based on the supplementary welfare allowance rate of &euro;186 be restored.  As the Minister knows that is no longer the case because of changes made in the past.</p><p>For example in the case of a single person the allowed deduction amounts to &euro;28 per week compared with &euro;2 before the enactment of section 13.  That means if the personal contribution of &euro;30 per week for those on rent supplement is taken into account, a single person is expected to live on &euro;130 a week if they have to make an overpayment.  That is even below the supplementary welfare payment.  The first recommendation is that we would deal with that.</p><p>The report's second recommendation called for the introduction of a statute of limitations.  It recommended that a limitation period be introduced whereby the Department of Social Protection must act to recover an overpayment within a specified time period after which the Department is stopped from pursuing such a recovery process.  It recommended a limitation period similar to that contained in the Statute of Limitations 1957, which is six years in the case recovery of a debt from the date on which it first becomes due.  If this period is deemed too short it further recommended that the limitation period should not exceed 12 years which is the limitation period applicable to the enforcement of the judgment.</p><p>That covers the amendments that were ruled out of order.  I am sure the Minister will accept that the Community Law and Mediation Service put a lot of work into this report.  It made some interesting observations.  If the Minister is not in a position to accept its recommendations this year, I hope she will consider them for future budgets.</p></speech>

Why is the Minister retaining the references to Irish Water in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which is referred to in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill under the definitions in section 1, which specifies that the &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005?  Why is the Minister leaving that in if it will have no relevance whatsoever?  I do not understand the sense of leaving in references to Irish Water and the PPS numbers, a matter that the Minister and I discussed in the House at the time.  As it is irrelevant, why is it not being taken out?</p></speech>

As the Senator is aware, the Government has announced a revised package regarding Irish Water.  It is a much more modest and affordable system for water charges.  It puts in place the potential for the vital investment that has to go into improving our water system, providing everybody with clean healthy water and providing for very significant capital investment for water treatment plants.  I know many Senators are rightly very concerned about the environment.  Raw sewage going into watercourses, rivers harbours and lakes is a national scandal.  As Senators know, over the next ten years investment of approximately &euro;10 billion is needed to address those issues.  Irish Water affords a very good mechanism for doing that.  Otherwise that necessary investment, as most Senators know, would need to come from education, health and other areas of expenditure, which are very dear to Senators' hearts.</p><p>Regarding the references to Irish Water and PPS numbers, with the new structure the PPS number is no longer required.  It was only ever required for simple validation purposes, but that is no longer required and therefore it is not necessary to be there.  The only time that householders will need to provide a PPS number is when and if they decide they wish to receive a water conservation grant, as is the case with all services from the Department of Social Protection and indeed with the Revenue Commissioners.  As I am sure the Senator knows, a PPS number is required as the unique identifier for the person or household seeking a refund.</p><p>On a point of information-----</p></speech>

That is an increase of 7.2%.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, overall the number of caring recipients has increased from just over 76,000 in 2010 to almost 84,000 in 2014.  This is an increase of 7,815 recipients or 10.3%.  The number of respite care grants will have increased from 75,351 in 2010 to 88,710 in 2014, an increase of more than 13,000 or 17.7%.  The Government is expending very significant additional resources on the respite care grant.</p></speech>

In the context of all the debate that has taken place, Senator Cullinane tabled an amendment seeking the deletion of references to Irish Water under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  If, as the Minister has pointed out, it is the Revenue Commissioners and her Department that will be dealing with PPS numbers, why is there a continuing reference to Irish Water in the legislation?</p> <p>That is all I am asking.

It was presumably just an oversight, and I ask that she would come back to me on that issue and the report I cited.</p><p>To pick up on the previous discussion with Senator Mooney on this section, Irish Water is still referenced in the Bill and it is linked to the water conservation grant on which the T&aacute;naiste spoke.  I questioned the Minister of State on this and he was not able to respond or, if he did, it did not make any sense to me.  How in God's name is this a water conservation grant?  How is this about conservation at all?  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can explain to the citizens and the people why this &euro;100 grant, as she is calling it, has anything to do with conservation.  Can she explain to me how a single drop of water will be conserved by this grant being put in place?</p></speech>

The Seanad has not yet even seen the Water Services Bill.  The D&aacute;il has not passed it yet.  We were giving the opportunity to the Government to go ahead - quickly - with the recommendation by Senator Cullinane.  It has refused.  We are assuming the Water Service Bill will pass through the D&aacute;il unamended.  We are assuming it will then come to the Seanad and that the Seanad will deal with it.  I do not think the Seanad will deal with that Bill before Christmas.  Perhaps we should come back on Report Stage on the PPS issue, simply to reverse what the T&aacute;naiste did here.  I compliment Senator Mooney.  He was the only person in the Oireachtas to raise this issue at the time the legislation was going through.  If we had people who did this on the Road Traffic Bill or other flawed legislation that has come from the Government, we would not be rushing everything before Christmas, as has happened.  It is a very simple recommendation.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste should come back on Report Stage on this Bill.  We are only on Committee Stage now.  We are not dealing with Report Stage yet.  Just delete it.  Get it over and done with.  Forget about the Water Services Bill for the time being.  We will deal with that in due course.  As I am sure the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the Seanad is independent and not controlled by the Government.  Senators are willing to co-operate on issues like this.  We will support any recommendation she puts forward on this and urge the T&aacute;naiste to bring forward such a recommendation.</p></speech>

In the case of a serious fraudulent debt, the Senator is in effect proposing that money that has been defrauded from social welfare to the serious harm of other social welfare recipients - people such as pensioners who rely on their social welfare income - would, in the case of a debt of &euro;7,500, be repaid over a 72-year period, as it would not be possible to recover, as the Senator well knows, more than &euro;2 a week.</p><p>I suggest to the Senator that the principle on which social welfare operates is that people make contributions out of hard-earned income through taxes and PRSI and they rely on the Department of Social Protection to ensure, as far as is possible, that this goes to the people for whom it is intended in the correct amount.  Almost everyone who uses social protection claims only the correct amount, nothing more, nothing less.  Almost all of the people we deal with are, thankfully, extremely honest.  The Senator is suggesting that instead of recovering very significant losses, as we do now, at the rate of 15% of the individual's principal payment, and nothing else, we should revert to a situation of recovering fraudulent payments such as the &euro;7,500 I have suggested over a 72-year period.  If the other people living on the same road with someone who had been doing this discovered it, they would rightly feel that the person from whom the overpayment was being recovered was perhaps putting up two fingers to the people living beside them, people who work to pay their taxes and their PRSI or, in the case of people getting a social welfare payment, people who deal with 100% honesty with the Department.  As the Senator is aware, almost everyone who receives social welfare deals with 100% honesty with the Department.  I do not propose to accept the Senator's recommendation.  We have had this discussion before.  It is appropriate to make appropriate collections.</p><p>On the Irish Water issue, the Government announced a more modest and affordable system for water charges.  As part of that package, the Department of Social Protection will be administering on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the new water conservation grant of &euro;100.  Arising from that revised charging structure, which is simpler and more affordable, Irish Water no longer requires PPS numbers.  I see the Senator nodding his head, so I think that is agreed.</p></speech>

Therefore, the only time that a householder will have to provide his or her PPS number is when, and if, he or she is registering for the &euro;100 water conservation grant to be paid through the Department of Social Protection.  As I have said, the Department of Social Protection is the official agency, over a long period, for the issuance of PPS numbers and dealing with any other related matters.  I am very confident that this will allay any concerns expressed on this matter.</p><p>There are a number of related changes that need to be borne in mind.  Provision is being made for the supply of information by Irish Water to the Department of Social Protection for the purposes of the water conservation grant.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is currently progressing the Water Services Bill 2014, which provides for all of the changes on Irish Water announced by the Government, through the Houses.  As the Senators know, that legislation is before the D&aacute;il and is due to come before this House before the end of this week.  Section 11 of the Water Services Bill provides for the deletion of Irish Water as a body specified to use PPS numbers.  Section 11 also provides that this change will come into operation by way of a commencement order to be made by the Minister for Social Protection in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

I found the T&aacute;naiste's response to be somewhat flippant and in stark contrast to the Minister of State's, who was quite engaging on the issues.  The T&aacute;naiste knows full well from previous discussions we have had on this that there is a clear distinction between those who are engaged in fraud and criminality and who are trying to defraud the social welfare system and situations in which genuine mistakes were made by the Department or individuals themselves resulting in overpayments.  We are trying to be fair and to ensure there is a fair process.  There are many people who, because of genuine mistakes, sometimes not of their doing, end up living below what is the minimum threshold because of the 15% reduction.</p> <p>The final paragraph of the Community Law and Mediation report, which for me sums up the argument, reads:<blockquote><br />Based on our experience of dealing with clients who have received overpayment letters and have been subjected to deductions of 15%, and on the feedback of attendees at the roundtable, we submit that these cuts are indeed forcing people into destitution and poverty and are in clear breach of the Department's own threshold of a &quot;basic minimum income&quot; in the form of the [social welfare assistance rate].</blockquote>This potential effect was flagged in the joint Community Law and Mediation-Free Legal Advice Centres submission in December 2012, which is referred to in the document.  It further reads:<blockquote>Many participants at the roundtable, in particular those working with the Citizens Information Centres and the National Advocacy Service spoke of their first hand experience of the hardship caused to their clients as a direct result of the deduction of &euro;28 from their basic payments.  In many cases, the overpayments related to historic debts, some over 20 years old.  Clients had received letters from the Department simply advising that the deduction of 15% would be made from the relevant payment and providing neither evidence as to how the debt arose nor the original decisions from Deciding Officers.  In many cases, given the age of the debt clients could not recall the existence of the debt nor any details regarding the amount.</blockquote>This is the basis for the two recommendations, namely, that people not be allowed to fall below poverty levels and the introduction of a Statute of Limitations.  I would go further.  I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that there are people who defraud the social welfare system.  Those people will get no support from me and should be dealt with harshly because what they do impacts on people who genuinely need payments.  I am speaking in this regard about people in respect of whom the Department might have made a mistake or who themselves may have made a genuine mistake.  That clear distinction should be made.  Instead, what is being provided for is a one-fits-all rule which I do not believe is fair.</p></speech>

We are not trying to hold up the Bill unnecessarily.  The provision to allow Irish Water to demand PPS numbers was introduced by way of a social welfare Bill.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste's officials, they dealt very protectively and carefully with the PPS numbers.  By all accounts, they were reluctant to provide them to Irish Water except when forced to by legislation, and even when they did so, they ensured certain protections were adhered to.  I pay tribute to the T&aacute;naiste's officials in that regard.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Water Services Bill, the Bill before us is the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2014.  The T&aacute;naiste could by way of amendment delete what has been provided for in this Bill.  I urge that she do so, thereby immediately removing the power in relation to access by Irish Water to PPS numbers.  There is considerable doubt about the Water Services Bill.  I say that based on what is being said by Senators and in the media.  Fianna F&aacute;il calls for this change to be effected immediately.</p></speech>

With regard to the question of clawbacks in respect of overpayments and so on, my guiding source in economic theory is the game of Monopoly.  One of the cards one gets when playing Monopoly states: "Congratulations an error has been made in your favour by the income tax; collect &euro;200."  It does not say, "Bad luck, old bean.  You've received a &euro;200 overpayment; give it back at once", which seems to be the Government's attitude.</p></speech>

I have debated a number of these points with the Minister on a number of occasions, including during the debate on amendments tabled by me and Senator Power to the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013.</p><p>Recommendation No. 8 provides that a solvent firm shall not be allowed to close a defined benefit scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard, which is the standard applied in other countries.  The T&aacute;naiste rejected a similar amendment to last year's Bill.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste will be aware of what has happened with regard to the Irish aviation superannuation scheme pension arrangements, that members of the Retired Aviation Service Association, RASA, are taking a six-week pay cut by way of a 2.53% levy per annum, that deferred members, many of whom the T&aacute;naiste met and gave some hope to a couple of weeks ago, will be hit by 50% to 60% cuts to their pensions, and that current members have been bullied into an inferior pension scheme, all of which was agreed at the Aer Lingus EGM last week.  The irony is that none of the 15,000 members of that scheme had an opportunity to vote on these arrangements.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, is responsible for the introduction of single insolvencies and for providing profitable employers with the ability to shut down their pension schemes and wipe out any pension liabilities.  She is also the Minister who, along with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and her constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, presided over the doubling, by almost &euro;750 million, of the deficit in the IAS scheme over two years in that she provided the Dublin Airport Authority and Aer Lingus with the roadmap that allowed them to wriggle out of their responsibilities.  The Government and previous Governments also had a part of play in that regard.  The T&aacute;naiste will probably refer in this regard to the 2009 Act.  I have tabled an amendment in relation to that Act because the usual response of the T&aacute;naiste and her officials on this issue is to cite that Act.  I am attempting to fix the situation.  I thought the T&aacute;naiste was at one stage going to try to fix this, and in that regard met the deferred members in particular.</p> <p>I am very interested to hear what she said to them.  They were under the impression she would do something.  Everybody knew there would be an element of cuts, but the Minister and her officials seems to have met these people and gone through proposed amendments with them to no particular end.  Nobody considers it fair that people who are retiring next year will have 50% of their pension cut.  It would not be done to a member of this Government, that is for sure.  It would not be done to the Minister or any of her predecessors, but it is fine to do it to people who have given 30 or 40 years of service to these companies, one of which was a semi-State entity.<br/>Unfortunately, what is being done in respect of this particular scheme will have an impact on many other pension schemes in this country.  In fact, I have already seen evidence of private pension schemes using the provisions the Minister has brought forward to unpick their defined benefit schemes.  There is a bonanza for employers because even though schemes were under pressure during the financial crisis, with double digit losses in investment, nobody is talking about that fact that in the past three or four years - not specifically with Irish equities but internationally, in the case of standard management funds - there has been double digit growth.  That is all forgotten because there is an opportunity for employers - in this instance, Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority - to say that &euro;500 million has been wiped out from the fund and it is the people who were compelled to join the scheme - they were obliged to do so; it was not an option - who must carry the can for it.  As I said, I am aware of other private schemes which are already being wound down, but at least in those instances, people are being given the option to get out of the scheme.  Defined benefit schemes are no longer what people thought they were and there will not be a single one left five years from now because of what the Minister has done.<br/>Recommendation No. 9 proposes that the 1990 Act be amended by inserting the following provision:<blockquote>An appeals mechanism for pension scheme members shall be put in place where trustees have decided upon reduced benefits for members, and such appeals mechanism shall ensure that any category of such pension scheme members have not been unfairly treated in any restructuring arrangement.</blockquote>This is an eminently sensible proposal given that the expert panel which was set up did not take the views of people such as retired staff and deferred beneficiaries into account or have them around the table.  Employees will always have an additional ability to negotiate because they have industrial relations tools at their disposal.  On the other hand, people who have left a particular company and are yet to draw down their pension or those who already are drawing it down do not have the same ability.  In that context, recommendation No. 9 proposes the establishment of a proper appeals mechanism that will take their concerns into account.<br/>Our objective in recommendations Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, is to offer the Minister another option in the form of scaled reductions in benefits in order to avoid another situation such as that which has arisen in Aer Lingus.  Recommendations Nos. 13 and 14 relate specifically to the IAS scheme.  My view is that it is not useful in general to table proposals relating, in this instance, to a specific pension scheme.  However, it was the Minister's constituency colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in his previous Ministry, who brought forward the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 which, for the first time in the history of the State, made provision in law to change a private pension scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, agreed to that at Cabinet.  The irony of all ironies was that she sent a back bench Labour Party Member, Deputy Brendan Ryan, to talk to the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on the day he was signing the commencement orders on the pretence that she was even remotely concerned about what was happening.  Of course, we all know now that she led people up the garden path and did not intend to do anything for them.  Our recommendation No. 13 proposes to amend the 1998 Act by inserting the following provision:<blockquote>The IAS Scheme shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90 per cent funding standard.</blockquote>Unfortunately, this provision probably comes too late, because the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues - the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, certainly - circumvented the whole process by moving forward with the signing of the commencement orders in advance of our dealing with the legislation before us today.<br/>Recommendation No. 14  proposes the amendment of the 1998 Act by the introduction of the following provision:<blockquote>The IAS Scheme shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where all pension scheme members are treated in an equitable manner on the winding up of that Scheme.</blockquote>We realise that what is happening here is effectively not a wind-down, but this recommendation was tabled before the latest developments.  Nobody can say that what has happened here is fair.  I did not expect in a million years that the Government could come up with &euro;700 million to plug the hole in the pension fund, but I likewise did not expect that such drastic cuts would be brought about in such an arbitrary manner to people's promised standard of living.  Members of the scheme who were due to receive pensions of &euro;16,000 or &euro;17,000 per annum - not the &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 the Minister will be able to draw down after the next general election should she not succeed in being returned to the D&aacute;il, but approximately one quarter of it - will see their payment reduced to &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000.  That is not fair but, unfortunately, the Minister did nothing to try to change it.  I expected more from her.  If she checks the Official Report she will see that more than two years ago, during the debate in this House on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which introduced the change in the priority order and brought in the single insolvency provision, I made specific reference to the Aer Lingus scheme.  I flagged my concern at that time that we would end up in precisely this scenario.<br/>I will be pressing each of these recommendations.  I hope the Minister might, at this very late stage, take them on board.  This issue is affecting people in Dublin West in the same way as it is affecting people in Dublin North.  I am sure she has been contacted by constituents and, indeed, by people from all over the country.  To be fair, some of her party colleagues did their best to try to convince her and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to take action.  There is no point in her coming in here and saying she could not do anything else; of course she could have done something else.  What she has done is shown those, including, in particular, some of her Fine Gael colleagues in government, who might want to sell certain State assets into the future exactly how they can wipe off a deficit in a pension scheme, increase the value of that company and sell it off.<br/>We have been raising this matter for nearly two years and it is quite depressing to see what is happening to the 15,000 members of this scheme.  These are normal working people - not people with massive pensions - who paid into the scheme all their lives and gave great service to the company for which they worked.  The Minister and her colleague, Deputy Donohoe, have taken the legs from under them.  She has a final opportunity now, before the cuts commence on 1 January, to do the decent thing by rowing back from this.  I have debated these issues with the Minister before and I could talk about them all afternoon.  I hope she will see some way of addressing the matter at this late stage.  I do not understand why she spent time meeting groups from these schemes when she apparently had no intention of doing anything.  I do not get it, but perhaps she can explain.  I appeal to my colleagues on the Government side to do something decent before the end of the year by supporting these recommendations.</p></speech>

We are facing a type of cliff having wasted the National Pensions Reserve Fund on paying off the debts of the German and French banks.  I wonder who was responsible for the administration of the Aer Lingus pension fund; I am not sure whether anybody has asked that question.  How did this situation arise and why did nobody see it coming?  There is an absolute moral imperative on Government to safeguard the interests of employees in respect of pension funds.  Aer Lingus should never have been taken out of national ownership.  Its privatisation was a disastrous mistake and not in the interests of the people.</p><p>Like colleagues, I have had a large volume of correspondence from people about this issue, including from one man who is facing retirement with a 60% cut in his pension.  It is unimaginable that any Government, particularly one with a Labour Party component, would stand over a cut of that magnitude in people's retirement income.  Retirement in and of itself involves a fairly drastic cutback in income.</p> <p>However, to have that sliced by 60% is appalling.  I cannot see any objection to an appeals mechanism.  That is part of natural justice, but I can understand why the Government is afraid of it.  It is because it is grotesquely wrong and unfair to treat pensioners in this manner, and I imagine that any independently appointed appeals officer would find as such.</p><p>Recommendation No. 14 asks that employees be treated in an equitable manner.  What has Government got against people being treated in an equitable manner?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Before I deal with the deferred pension issue and the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, I want to commend the Minister for reaching an agreement with the former Waterford Crystal workers.  I know Kevin Mulvey was involved as well in terms of trying to get a resolution for those workers.  This was a case of a double insolvency.</p><p>What we are talking about in terms of the last discussion are single insolvencies but regarding the double insolvency, we have now transposed the EU directive, which should have been done in the past, and we have a resolution for the former Waterford Crystal workers, which was unanimously adopted by the workers themselves.  I want to put on the record my appreciation for the work the Minister has done in this area but full praise must go to the workers themselves who, unfortunately, were forced to take a court case, not relating to this Government but the previous Government.  They had no choice but to take the State to court.</p><p>I wonder if the European Court of Justice had not ruled the way it did would the workers have got the settlement awarded to them.  Unfortunately, they were forced to take the State to court but they should never have been forced to do so.  There are lessons to be learned from that in terms of the way we deal with pension schemes.  I commended the Minister for the Waterford Crystal payout, which is good news for the workers, but the Minister would appreciate the desperate situation in which deferred members of the IASS are being left, not just those in Aer Lingus.  Deferred members of defined benefit schemes are vulnerable generally, given their exclusion from the industrial relations process, and the current legislation offers grossly inadequate protections.</p><p>I support any amendment which ensures that the deferred members are not impacted on disproportionately in any scheme restructuring.  There has to be a fair way to restructure the scheme.  I have no difficulty with an associated appeals mechanism - that is only right and appropriate - and also enabling participation of representatives of deferred members in such appeals.  We have had lengthy debates on this issue in the past.  Last year we debated it also, and there have been lengthy debates in the D&aacute;il as well.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's office put a great deal of effort into coming up with an alternative scheme which we felt would be a fair way to deal with this issue.  In terms of our priority order and what we believed should be introduced to govern the restructuring or wind-up of deferred benefit schemes, first, a PRSI contributions record that is sufficient to ensure eligibility for the full State pension should be purchased from the Social Insurance Fund for every scheme member who has not attained such a record.  Second, provision should be made for 100% of pensioners' benefits below &euro;12,000, excluding post-retirement increases, which deals with the point raised by Senator O'Brien that people on pensions of &euro;12,000 will get much less.  That is despicable.</p><p>Third, active and deferred members under the age of 55 years should have disbursed to them the lower of 50% or &euro;6,000 of their benefits or, if they are aged over 55 years, the lower of 75% or &euro;9,000, excluding post-retirement increases.  Fourth, we made a suggestion regarding 75% of pensioners' benefits exceeding the initial &euro;12,000 up to a maximum of &euro;30,000, excluding post-retirement increases.  We also suggested that 75% of active and deferred members' benefits exceeding the initial sum up to a maximum of &euro;30,000, excluding post-retirement increases, be the fifth round, as it were.  The sixth round entailed the remaining benefits for pensioners, excluding post-retirement increases.  The seventh round entailed the active and deferred members' remaining benefits, and the eight related to the remaining pensioners and active and deferred members.</p><p>This is a complicated subject.  There is no easy way out of it.  There is a responsibility on companies to make sure that pensions are solvent.  We cannot have a situation where the State has to pick up the tab every time a pension scheme goes into insolvency.  We know that in the case of double insolvencies there is an EU directive which has now been transposed, but there is an obligation on companies to make sure that these schemes are profitable.</p><p>The effect of the priority order I have outlined to the Minister that Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed would ensure a much fairer distribution of funds for everyone in the event of a wind-up or restructuring, regardless of whether a pensioner was in payment, a deferred member or an active member, and it would offer greater protection to deferred members of, for example, the Irish airlines superannuation scheme or any of the other schemes in a similar position.</p><p>I urge the Minister to consider changing the Bill.  We wanted a separate social welfare and pensions Bill to arise out of this Bill to deal with the issue in a more substantial way.  I accept it is complicated and there are no easy solutions but the proposal we have made, the details of which I have read into the record, is in recommendation No. 10 which, unfortunately, was ruled out of order.  However, I have made my point.  I will conclude by commending the Government for doing the right thing at long last for the former Waterford Crystal workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600034#MM00500"><p>I will begin by addressing recommendation No. 8, which is the crux of the issue in terms of the IASS and other schemes, namely, the single insolvency situation.  As Senator O'Brien said, it stems from the legislation the Minister brought through the House which we opposed at the time, namely, the Social Welfare Bill.  The OECD has made a recommendation that a defined benefit pension scheme should not be allowed close unless it has received a minimum of 90% funding standard.  We put forward this amendment last year as well in anticipation of what would happen with the IASS.  The Minister rejected it at that stage but I hope that given the consultations she has had with IASS members and the correspondence she has been receiving, and meeting with the members personally, she will come to this debate with a more open mind.</p><p>Whatever about a double insolvency where both the scheme and the company are insolvent, to be able to close down a scheme in a single solvency situation, against the advice of the OECD, which recommends that there be 90% funding, is wrong.  There is no minimum funding requirement in our legislation, and we are seeing the impact of that now.</p><p>I agree with the comments made earlier.  The IASS is the first scheme that has been hit by this but the template set out in the Minister's legislation, and in the Shannon Airport Bill brought forward by the Minister for transport, provides for future savage cuts on members of other pension schemes.  That is a dangerous departure.  It is extraordinarily unfair.  In terms of the IASS scheme it is unfair to pensioners who are losing six weeks pay every year.  That is a phenomenal cut more savage than any of the social welfare cuts or other cuts brought before this House.  Six weeks pay is a huge amount for people on a pension to lose when they are already on a reduced income.</p><p>Active and deferred members are losing 50% to 60% of their pension.  That is extraordinary, particularly for people who are on low income.  These are not well-off pensioners.  Many of them are on very modest incomes who worked for a long time and made contributions.  Many of the active and deferred members were persuaded to leave the company and assist with its restructuring on the basis that their pension benefits would be preserved, but now they find out that that promise was not worth anything and that they will lose 50% or 60% of their pension.  I know the Minister met some of the individuals involved.  I hope she will show some heart and do something about this.  It is within her power.  I do not know how the Minister or anybody else could listen to their story and not be moved by it.</p> <p>It is absolutely incredible that any Government, but particularly one including the Labour Party, would preside over such a savage cut to people's pension entitlements.  These are people for whom it is too late to make up the income elsewhere.  Many active members are within months of reaching retirement age and their pensions are being cut by 60%.  This is extraordinarily cruel and unfair.</p><p>Senator Cullinane mentioned the resolution to the Waterford Crystal matter and I welcome the fact that this issue has finally been resolved.  We now have a bizarre situation whereby the Waterford Crystal workers, who were in a double insolvency, are now better off than Irish airline superannuation scheme, IASS, members.  The Waterford Crystal workers had to fight through the courts to get their entitlements and reach this position, but after all of this they are better off than the IASS members.  The Minister should pause and reflect on this.  Does this mean the only way IASS members will get their entitlements is to take similar legal action against the State?  I was at the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, AGM last week where this was spoken about as one of the options on the table.  It will take legal advice on taking on the State on this issue.  The direct facts of the Waterford Crystal case are different, in that it was a double insolvency rather than a single insolvency and referred to active and deferred members rather than pensioners, but many of the principles are the same and there is EU protection for pensioners in cross-border schemes.  Has the Minister taken this into account in the wake of the resolution of the Waterford Crystal issue?</p><p>As Senator O'Brien stated, ideally we would like to see the Government row back on this and see the injustice in cutting people's pensions so severely, particularly in insolvency situations.  If this is not possible and the Minister is not willing to implement the OECD recommendation for the IASS scheme to be 90% funded, we have tabled fairer alternatives with regard to the distribution of pension benefits which would ensure fairer protection for people.  In recommendation No. 11, we set out criteria which would apply instead and would give people fairer protection.  It would amend the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act introduced last year to ensure the reduction in preserved benefits for members with accrued service in excess of 20 years would be made as follows: where the annual amount is &euro;12,000 or less no reduction would be made as this is a very modest pension; where the annual amount is greater than &euro;12,000 but less than &euro;60,000, the reduction in such an amount would not exceed 10%; and where the annual amount is &euro;60,000 or more, the reduction would not exceed 20%.  We believe this would be much fairer.  It would be in line with how much money people actually have.  It would provide stronger protection for those on the lowest incomes.  The recommendation also provides that where the reduction to which I referred would result in the annual amount being reduced to less than &euro;12,000, it would be reduced to &euro;12,000; and where the reduction to an annual amount of &euro;60,000 or more would result in it being reduced to less than &euro;54,000, the reduction would operate to reduce it to &euro;54,000.  This is based on ensuring greater fairness.  It would be much fairer than what the Minister has in place.</p><p>The other recommendation deals with an appeals process, which is an important aspect of natural justice under our Constitution.  People have an ability to appeal decisions which affect them and should not have to go to the courts to do so.  We should provide in our procedures an open and fair appeals process, and recommendation No. 9 sets out to do so.  I second the remarks made by Senator O'Brien in respect of each of these recommendations and I hope, that having consulted with the members of the IASS scheme and listened to how these changes affect them personally and the great unfairness being introduced, the Minister will act before it is too late and have a proper debate with us, find a fairer solution and find a way which does not leave people on low incomes losing 60% of their pension.</p></speech>

Last week, when the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was in the House I articulated very same points which I will make now.  I hate having to repeat myself, but unfortunately it seems to be necessary.  I will vote with the Government on the recommendations but I assume and hope the Minister is listening because it is an injustice of an appalling nature.  People were persuaded by their line managers to take early retirement and were presented with paperwork outlining their initial entitlements and their entitlements when they reached retirement age.  However, the trustees messed up and pensions were cut.</p><p>I have no problem whatsoever if a pension or deferred pension is cut, so long as it is fair and equal to everybody.  However, where somebody with a pension sees it reduced by 10% but a deferred pensioner sees a reduction of 60%, this is not what I espouse in politics, and I certainly do not think it is what the Labour Party espouses in politics either.  The sad reality is many of these deferred pensioners voted for Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the last general election and they feel betrayed and let down.

I have sympathy for anybody suffering any reduction in their pension entitlements.  It is a very great difficulty for many of the people involved.  As has been said, when we had the discussion last year we set out to seek to protect in so far as possible defined benefit pension schemes, many of which have been in severe deficit for reasons which may have to do with the performance of equities, general disturbances in financial markets in recent years and other reasons which may have to do with the way in which particular pension funds are managed and organised.  I heard in some of the contributions suggestions that people were offered deals on their pensions, as Senator Conway stated, to leave the company.  The issue is whether these deals were funded.  This is the critical problem with regard to this.  As people referenced, unfortunately the deficit involved in this particular pension scheme is just under &euro;800 million.</p><p>With regard to defined benefit pension schemes funding in general, in 1997 there were 2,242 defined benefit pension schemes which were subject to the funding standard.  At the end of 2007, the number had dropped to 1,319.  At the end of 2013, the number of schemes was 890.  I want to be clear that 96% of the schemes either meet the funding standard or have submitted a funding proposal to the Pensions Board and the remaining schemes are in dialogue with the Pensions Board.</p> <p>Part of the reason for the legislation which was passed last year was to seek to get those pension funds over the line to protect to the maximum extent possible the very important pension benefits which members of the fund expected to get.  I reiterate that the changes in the structure set out in last year's Act was that anyone with a pension of under &euro;12,000 would have 100% protection.  In addition, most people who are in a defined benefit scheme would also have a social insurance contribution record which would entitle them to a State pension valued in the region of &euro;12,000 to &euro;14,000.  Therefore, the protected payment, between the defined benefit scheme and the State contributory retirement pension, would amount to something above &euro;24,000.  The actuarial information relating to Ireland shows that the average figure is &euro;11,000 in defined benefits or in many cases is significantly below that amount.</p><p>The second element of the scheme relates to people with an income from a pension of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000, where the reduction would be in the range of 10%, if necessary.  For people with a pension of above &euro;60,000, the reduction would be 20% or up to 20%, as necessary, to get the scheme back.</p><p>I accept Senator Cullinane's comments and approval of the Waterford Glass scheme.  It is ironic to listen to the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators because Waterford Glass, which was the iconic industry of the south east, became insolvent and came to an end in 2009.  Unfortunately, the pension fund was insolvent.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il Government-----</p></speech>

This time last year I set out to see if a mediated negotiation could be achieved.  The details of the negotiation will show the various arrangements which the Waterford Glass workers accepted.  I thank the chairperson of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, for his work in acting as the agreed nominee for my proposal and he was accepted by the unions.  I congratulate the workers and all concerned for the achievement of a mediated outcome.  If we could have more mediated outcomes in disputes rather than recourse to the courts, it would probably save the State very significant costs and in many cases would provide for a better outcome.</p><p>In the case of the Waterford Glass workers there were no funds.  The company was insolvent and so too the pension fund to a significant degree.  The purpose of the 2013 Act was to get as many as possible defined benefit pension schemes over the line with a view to providing the maximum protection for the members of those schemes.  The previous Government abandoned the pension funding standard so there was no standard.  This is all fact-----</p></speech>

I wish this never had to be and that all of these defined benefit schemes would have been significantly and healthily funded, but the purpose of the Act was to get those schemes over the line in so far as possible.</p><p>The Irish aviation superannuation scheme has 5,000 currently retired members and approximately 5,000 workers.  An important element is that the companies and the employment that those companies provide currently to 5,000 people is of some significance so that the continuation of that employment is a significant element and also the protection of the existing pensioners is a significant element.  I acknowledge the great difficulty for the people who are deferred members.</p><p>I refer to recommendation No. 10 proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I had a similar discussion with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The recommendation proposes an alternative wind-up priority order and to give first priority to awarding the full State retirement pension.  This legislation deals with the distribution of an occupational defined pension scheme fund.  I reiterate and stress that there is no direct connection between the contributions made to or benefits received from an occupational defined benefit scheme in the private sector and the actual payment of the State pension. The provisions contained in this legislation have no impact whatsoever on any entitlement to the State pension or to the PRSI contributory system.  The contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between social insurance contributions made and a resulting entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right is an underlying principle of Ireland's pay related social insurance scheme.  The contributory State pension is paid from the Social Insurance Fund to any individual from the age of 66 who meets the qualifying criteria on his or her State and occupational pensions.  It is important to recognise, however, that the benefits of current and former employees who have made contributions to the schemes are also protected.  That is why my priority with regard to pensions and payment was to ensure the greatest level of protection was afforded to those on low to moderate pensions.  Therefore, it was decided to maintain 100% priority for pensions and payment of up to &euro;12,000 a year and to protect pensions up to this level in the event of the restructuring of scheme benefits.  The determination of this benchmark was informed by pension data which indicated that the median pension in the private sector defined benefit schemes was &euro;11,000.  This approach facilitates the rebalancing of the distribution of scheme resources between pensioners and current and former scheme members while providing full protection for pensions below &euro;12,000.  I emphasise that this is the way the 2013 legislation operates.</p><p>Section 50 of the Pensions Act was reviewed in 2009 by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government and again in 2013.  I have just set out the changes to the 2013 Act.  The changes to 2009 essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme under-funding across all scheme members, and this was the basis of the 2009 Act.  The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of the pension schemes.</p> <p>I just want to repeat what I said at the beginning.  The Pensions Act does not prevent the action desired in the proposals and in recommendations Nos. 11 and 12.  The trustees decide how provisions are actually implemented.  I want to stress that this is a matter for the trustees and I believe Members should give this point consideration.</p><p>The provisions in section 50 of the Act do not differentiate between active and deferred scheme members as these members are participating in a scheme during periods of employment where members accumulate pension rights.  It is a matter for the trustees of a scheme, who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries, to deliver a fair and reasonable solution which will secure the sustainability of the pension scheme.  It would not be the practice to make a change to the Pensions Act, as Senator O'Brien correctly acknowledged, because of a difficulty in a particular scheme, unless it was apparent that it applied across schemes generally.  Some 11% of defined benefit pension schemes had used this provision by the end of 2013 to reduce scheme benefits.  Most of these adjustments to scheme benefits applied to post-retirement increases in pension benefits.</p><p>As I said, I appreciate very much the difficulties for people in regard to this pension scheme.  Unfortunately, as was said, the level of the deficit in this particular scheme is extremely high and the members, deferred and active, have had to deal with proposals which were put forward, and which, in the Act and in pension law, are put forward by the trustees of the scheme.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection is very good at filibustering when she wants to.  What she will do is read out a script and go on and on but she will not answer the specific questions that were put to her.  Then, when I get a chance to respond to the T&aacute;naiste, she is gone.  I know she is the T&aacute;naiste and she may have other engagements.  The Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, who is now in the House, being from Dublin will have a fair idea what is being done to this cohort of people.  We are giving the Government an opportunity to rectify it.  The Minister of State's party leader does not seem to want to know, which is fine.  However, it will not stop here.<br/>I was baffled, listening to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, nearly trying to take credit for what happened with the Waterford Crystal workers.  The Waterford Crystal workers had to go to Europe.  All the Government did was accept a judgment in Europe and it put an extra levy on other defined benefit schemes to pay money that the European Court said was due, and rightly so, to the members of Waterford Crystal.  She did not do anything about it.  Let us be straight about this.  There is no point in her coming in here to say: &quot;Isn't the Government great?  Look what we have done for Waterford Crystal.&quot;  It did nothing for Waterford Crystal.  By the way, when it had a chance to do something, it brought about single insolvencies.  Waterford Crystal was double insolvent and single insolvent.  Does the House know how much money Aer Lingus has on reserve?  It has nearly &euro;800 million in cash.  Now, it is being given an added bonus of nearly &euro;400 million and perhaps up to &euro;500 million that it has been able to walk away from.<br/>I want to move towards a vote on these recommendations.  I thank Senator Conway for his positive remarks in this regard and all my colleagues have been supportive because they see this as an injustice.  I did not politicise this at the start but, unfortunately, the Minister did so in her response to me.  I am not surprised because she does that a lot and it is part of her <i>modus operandi</i>, which is fine.  As I said to the T&aacute;naiste, no one is going to touch her pension of &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or whatever she gets after the next general election.  There are people in this case on &euro;20,000 who are losing &euro;8,000.  That is worth talking about.  This is not the end and we will continue to fight in this regard for the rights of these workers.  I guarantee my colleagues that, in two or three years time, this will happen to a raft of other pension arrangements, given the legislation the Government has passed in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I am sorry the T&aacute;naiste is not here to engage with us but I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, has come back to the House.  While I do not know if it was deliberate, in her brief remarks before she left, the T&aacute;naiste completely missed the point we were trying to make when she said it was a matter for the trustees to decide what the individual distribution is between the active and defined members.  Of course that is the case, but they can only decide within the legislative framework that has been put in place.  As we proposed in our recommendations, the OECD recommendation is that, in a single insolvency situation, where the company is still profitable despite difficulties in a scheme, that scheme should not be allowed to fold unless it is 90% funded.  It was a legislative decision of this Government in the Social Welfare Bill last year not to give effect to that and to bring in legislation where, in a single insolvency situation, a profitable company can opt to fold its pension scheme and, in doing so, there is no protection for the members.</p><p>Again, we accept that the trustees are operating within the system but what we are proposing in these amendments is that, at least, we would ensure through legislation there is a minimum level of protection and that the distribution is fairer.  I do not understand how anybody could possibly think it is fair for somebody to lose 60% of their pension.  We have debated this issue so many different times over the past year.  I know there is sympathy among some of the individual Members on the Government side because they have also been contacted by people affected by it.  However, in all of the debates we have had, and on the amendments we have put forward to successive Bills in the past 18 months, nobody is able to tell me, and the T&aacute;naiste did not tell me before she left, how it could possibly be fair for somebody on a &euro;20,000 pension to lose &euro;8,000 of that pension.  That is shocking and is a direct result of the legislation.</p><p>At a superficial level, it is a decision of the trustees, but it is the decision of the trustees acting within the legislative framework the Government has put in place.  If the legislative framework were otherwise, the decision would be otherwise, because certain options would be off the table.  If they had to protect people according to the minimum protections we have set out here and ensure fairer distribution and fairer protection, then the decision would have to be otherwise.  That is the simple fact of the matter.</p><p>I was hoping the T&aacute;naiste would respond more directly to the specific recommendations we have tabled instead of just dismissing them and saying the decision has been made by the trustees.  That is an abdication of responsibility.  As we have made clear in several debates on this issue, we accept there are difficulties with the scheme and that there is a funding problem.  This is accepted by Senator O'Brien and Senator Conway, a Government Member who has left the House in disgust at the fact the T&aacute;naiste did not stay-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600039#SS00500"><p>Group 1 refers to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  I will begin by saying some words on each of them.</p><p>The objective of section 9 is to provide for the establishment of a new register of ships, which will consist of different parts for the registration of different types of ships, and also to allow registration to take place for different purposes.  Section 9(9) confirms that registration on the register may be granted for an initial period of up to five years with subsequent renewal periods for up to ten years each in duration.  They may be subject to ongoing compliance with registration requirements or conditions attached to registration as provided for in section 18(10) of the Bill.  </p><p>The first amendment, amendment No. 1, is a technical amendment.  It corrects a section cross-reference in section 9(9) by replacing the reference to &ldquo;section 18(8)&rdquo; with a reference to &ldquo;section 18(10)&rdquo;.  The change there is to change a subsection from (8) to (10).</p><p>Amendment No. 2 relates to section 9(10) of the Bill.  This was prepared for the purpose of making regulations in relation to the access to the register, as well as fees for such access.  The provision was drafted with a view to providing as much possibility as possible in respect of such access, given the move to a new central and electronic register of ships which will be addressed in a separate IT project.  The principle of access and continued access to the Irish register of ships has been clearly stated since the outset of the development of the Bill and there is no proposal to change the level of public access.  This Bill, with the amendments that are there at present, looks to maintain public access as it stands.</p><p>I made clear in the D&aacute;il, where I was responsible for the Bill on that Stage, that it is my intention to make this register as visible and open as possible.  I have to recognise, however, that there are certain limitations and needs that may arise in terms of commercial sensitivity or private or secure information.  The mechanics or process of obtaining such access or information may change as we move to an electronic working environment and a single centralised register.  In response to points that were made by colleagues in the D&aacute;il, this amendment aims to make the intent of public access more explicit.  I am looking to make clear that my objective is that this Bill should be public and accessible insofar as is possible.  Accordingly, amendment No. 2 substitutes subsection (10) to provide that a person will have access to the register in accordance with the access regulations that will be made under section 9(10) of the Bill. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1164" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600039#SS00600"><p>I thank the Minister and call on him to speak on the subject matter of amendments in group 2.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600039#SS00700"><p>Group 2 refers to amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 16.  The objective of these amendments is to improve the clarity of the sections involved with regard to language used and the nature of the penalties applying where offences arise.  Section 23 provides for the temporary registration of recreational craft under 24 m in load line length in particular circumstances.  Section 24 establishes a requirement for visitor registration of personal water craft, recreational craft 24 m in load line length and greater, small fast-powered craft and small commercial angling boats, for example craft owned by persons that may be visiting the State and operating domestically for short periods of time not exceeding three months when the craft is not registered in another country.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment involving subsections (8) and (9) of section 23.  In the case of subsection (8) it reinforces the meaning of the subsection to make it clear that the certificate of registry of temporary registration must be carried on board the ship to which the certificate relates.  What we are looking to do is to make clear that if somebody does have a certificate of temporary registration, it should be carried and made available on the vessel to which the temporary registration applies.  The wording of subsection (9) is being revised to clarify that where there is a failure to carry the certificate, the owner or master of the ship concerned will be held responsible for the offence and the penalty is a summary conviction for non-compliance is a class C fine, namely, a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500.</p><p>Similar to amendment No. 3, amendment No. 4 revises the wording of section 24(6) to clarify that the penalty on summary conviction for non-compliance with subsection (5) is a class C fine, namely, a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500.  This penalty level in both sections 23 and 24 is consistent with the provisions on non-compliance with certificate of registry requirements generally as contained in section 28(13) of the Bill which also provides for a class C fine.  What we are looking to do there is to bring consistency to the fines that are in place, bringing those ones into the group of a class C fine.</p><p>Section 28 provides for the issuing of a certificate of registry by the Minister when a ship is registered on the Irish register of ships.  Provision is made for different types of certificate of registry for different registration purposes as well as for duplicate and replacement certificates.  Subsection (2) provides for the issuing of a certificate of registry of provisional registration to the owner of a ship that is under construction where provisional registration has been granted under section 18(2). </p><p>Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment to reinforce the meaning of the wording of the subsection to make it clear that it is the owner of the ship in respect of which the certificate of registry has been granted who may apply to the Minister for an extension of the certificate of registry concerned.  We are making clear that it is the owner of the vessel who can then apply for an extension of the certificate of registry.</p> <p>Section 64 provides that except when provided otherwise in the sections of the Bill listed in brackets in this section, a summary conviction for an offence under the Bill will result in a class A fine, which is a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000.  The sections listed in brackets in this section provide for fines other than class A fines.  They provide for class C or D fines on summary conviction or higher fines on indictment.  Amendment No. 16 amends section 64 to add references to sections 20(9), 23(9) and 24(6) to the saver provision.  Sections 23(9) and 24(6) provide for a class C fine on summary conviction where the owner or master of a ship fails to comply with the requirement to carry a certificate of registry of temporary or visitor registration, as appropriate, on board the ship at all times.  Section 20(9) provides for a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 on conviction on indictment where a person alters the particulars of a ship or gives an inaccurate statement of the particulars of a ship, such as its measurement, to a third party.  This group of amendments seeks to bring clarity and greater coherence to the nature of penalties that may arise if certain offences are committed.  It also seeks to clarify where responsibility for having a certificate of temporary registration on board a vessel rests.</p></speech>

Section 28 provides for the issuing of a certificate of registry by the Minister when a ship is registered on the Irish Register of Ships.  Amendment No. 6 inserts a specific offence provision, a new subsection (5), where there is a failure to comply with the general requirement in subsection (4)(a) to carry a certificate of registry on board a ship at all times.  The amendment clarifies that where this requirement is not complied with, the owner or master of the ship concerned will be held responsible for the offence.</p><p>The related technical amendment to the renumbered subsection (7), amendment No. 7, ensures that a specific offence provision for non-compliance with subsections (4)(b) or (4)(c) and the renumbered subsection (6) is contained in the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 8 is a further consequential technical amendment to the renumbered subsection (13) to include a reference to the new subsection (5) and make it clear that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of the subsections listed in subsection (13) is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine.</p><p>Section 65 allows for the prosecution of both the owner and the master of a ship in the case of specified offences under the Bill where it is shown that the owner or master, as the case may be, consented to, approved of or connived in the commission of the offence.  Amendment No. 17 arises from the insertion of the new subsection (5) in section 28 and adds a reference to an offence under section 28(5) to the list of offences for the purposes of section 65.  The offences in section 28(5) relate to failure by the owner or master of a ship to comply with the general requirement to carry a certificate of registry on board a ship at all times.  The inclusion of a reference to section 28(5) in the list of specified offences in section 65 brings consistency to the section, which already includes a reference to sections 23(9) and 24(6), which provide for offences relating to failure by the owner or master of a ship to carry the certificate of temporary registration or of visitor registration, respectively, on board the ship at all times.</p></speech>

The original wording of section 49 did not specifically allow for circumstances in which a bill of sale is not produced during a transfer of a ship, nor did it allow for the acceptance of a description of a ship based on a declaration of measurement, as proposed in the case of registration on certain parts of the register.  In the cases of some smaller ships, where the owner may have difficulty in producing a bill of sale, it is proposed to accept a declaration of ownership.  This refers to some circumstances in which an actual bill of sale might not be available.  It could have been lost, or it might not be available in different circumstances.  This amendment proposes that in such circumstances, a declaration of ownership will be accepted in the place of a bill of sale.  Amendment No. 9 recognises that there will be exceptions to the requirement to have a bill of sale and allows for the acceptance of alternative documents of transfer, such as a declaration of ownership in some cases.  The detail of the documents of transfer will be set out in ministerial regulations.  Amendment No. 14 arises as a consequence of the previous amendment and introduces a new subsection (6).  To remove any doubt, the new subsection (6) confirms that any reference in section 49 to a bill of sale includes a reference to a document of transfer prescribed under subsection (1).</p><p>Section 49(2) establishes that one of the requirements for a bill of sale is that it must contain a description of the ship.  This involves consistency with the certificate of measurement relating to the ship.  It is proposed to allow for declarations of measurement in the case of some smaller ships that will be registered on certain parts of the register.  The specific details and requirements in this regard will be set out in regulations.  Amendment No. 11 amends the wording of subsection (2) to recognise that the description of the ship may in certain prescribed circumstances be set out in a declaration of measurement rather than a certificate of measurement.  Amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 13 are technical amendments to section 49.  Amendment No. 10 amends subsection (2) to clarify that the requirements in relation to a bill of sale or other document of transfer apply equally to such documents in respect of a share in a ship as well as documents in respect of a ship.  Amendment No. 12 corrects the placing of the last comma in subsection (2).  Amendment No. 13 corrects the wording in the first line of subsection (3) to replace the word &quot;therein&quot; with &quot;in it&quot; and the word &quot;subsection&quot; with the more accurate &quot;subsections&quot;.</p></speech>

Let me provide the rationale for introducing it.<br/>The Bill involves technical amendments to existing road traffic legislation to close off issues relating to the endorsement of penalty points on driver licence records and contains a provision to address the implications of doing so.<br/>While we will consider the very important matter of the implementation of the law and how it will work, first and foremost, the Bill deals with road safety.  We want to build on the progress we have made in making our roads safer in recent years.  While we have reduced the level of injury and loss of life, every life lost is one too many.  Crucial to our efforts to reduce this loss of life and to make our roads safer is the integrity of the fixed charge notice and penalty points system.<b></b>This is a core issue of the Bill.<br/>Senators will recall that, in the Road Traffic Act 2014, which was passed by the Seanad earlier this year, we made provision for the adjustment of penalty points for certain offences.  These included the endorsement of penalty points on the record of foreign driver licence holders and for the reduction of the disqualification threshold for learner and novice drivers from 12 to seven penalty points.  As is normal with road traffic legislation, different sections of the Act were commenced at different times.  Among the penalty points adjustments in the 2014 Act were provisions for bringing in the offences of using a vehicle without a valid NCT certificate and parking a vehicle in a dangerous position into the fixed charge notice system, with the consequent endorsement of three penalty points on the person's licence record.  I commenced the relevant sections of the 2014 Act for these and other adjusted penalty point offences with effect from 8 December 2014.  Prior to commencement, these were straight to court offences attracting five penalty points on conviction.  In other words, people who committed these offences could not avoid a court appearance by paying a fixed charge. <b></b>This is an important point because some of the commentary on it could have created the impression that we were bringing in entirely new offences.  In fact what we were doing was changing the penalty point regime in respect of those offences, to give people the option of paying a fixed charge notice and avoiding a court appearance. <br/>When preparing the Commencement Order, an oversight in the legislation was detected in my Department.  The 2002 Road Traffic Act, which first established the fixed charge notice and penalty points system, provided for the endorsement of the relevant number of penalty points on the records of those who made payment on foot of fixed charge notices for offences listed in the Schedule to the Act.  It excluded from this provision the offences which were straight to court offences including using a vehicle without a valid NCT certificate and parking a vehicle in a dangerous position.  When the 2014 Act was being drafted, these two offences should have been removed from the exclusions contained in the 2002 Act.  If the Senators were to look at the table of offences in the 2002 Act, they would see in the section of the table that refers to these two offences a blank space.  That is at the heart of the challenge we faced with this provision.  When the 2014 Act was being drafted, these two offences should have been removed from the exclusions in the 2002 Act.  Due to an oversight, this did not happen and I am proposing to rectify the position in this Bill.  There are no implications from this oversight so long as it is closed by the provisions of this Bill.  The other issue the Bill addresses also relates to the endorsement of penalty points.</p> <p>Section 2 of the 2002 Road Traffic Act provides the basis on which penalty points can be endorsed on a person's record following the payment of a fixed charge under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  Section 8 of the 2014 Act amends section 2 of the 2002 Act by substituting a reference to section 37 or 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 for section 103 of the 1961 Act.  So the 2014 Act anchored reference to the implementation of penalty points for fixed-charge notices in sections 37 or 44 of the 2010 Act.  So the 2014 Act made direct reference to those two sections in the 2010 Act.</p><p>In other words, with the enactment of the 2014 Act, penalty points would be endorsed on payment of the fixed charge under those sections of the 2010 Act.  Section 8 of the 2014 Act was commenced with effect from 1 August.  Unfortunately, because sections 37 and 44 of the 2010 Act have not yet been commenced, the commencement of section 8 of the 2014 Act removes the power to endorse points on the licence record.  That is the heart of the difficulty.  The 2014 Act made reference to sections in the 2010 Act which actually had not been commenced.</p><p>Section 2 of the Bill seeks to address both of the issues to which I referred.  The section also provides clarity where an offence has been committed but the appropriate penalty points associated with the offence have been increased before the fixed charge is paid.  The section reflects the current practice of endorsing the number of penalty points that were applicable on the date the alleged offence took place.</p><p>The concern that arose when this error was detected was that there might be a question mark over the penalty points endorsed since 1 August following the payment of a fixed charge.  I contacted the Office of the Attorney General on this point and have received comprehensive advice.  The advice points out that the legal vacuum caused by the commencement of section 8 of the 2014 Act cannot be said to reflect the intention of the Oireachtas, which can be taken to have been that there would, at all points, be some mechanism for endorsing penalty points on the driving licences of persons choosing to make a fixed-charge payment in lieu of potential prosecution.</p><p>On the basis of the advice, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to provide that those penalty points that have been endorsed following the payment of fixed charges should be retained on licence records.  The effect of section 3 of the Bill is that penalty points endorsed since 1 August following payment of a fixed charge are deemed to have been lawfully endorsed.  I believe this is appropriate.  The drivers involved will have received a fixed-charge notice for the alleged offences and will have made payment on foot of it.</p><p>The fixed-charge notice will also have advised the person of the number of penalty points that would be endorsed on their licence following payment.  By paying the charge involved, therefore, the person accepted that penalty points would be endorsed on their licence.  This concern applied only to drivers who had paid the fixed charge.  The penalty points applied to drivers convicted by the courts were not affected as endorsement in these circumstances is provided for in a separate section of the 2002 Act.</p><p>For the information of the Senators, I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in section 3 on page 4 between lines 23 and 24.  I will elaborate on it then, but the purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the section is not intended to infringe the constitutional rights of individuals.</p><p>When the fault in legislation was detected on the week before last, I instructed my Department immediately to cease issuing to drivers who had paid the fixed charge notifications that their licences would be endorsed.  With the enactment of this Bill, endorsement of licences will recommence.  However, in order to remove any doubt that the penalty points that were not endorsed in the two and a half week intervening period may be now applied, the Bill provides in section 3(b) for the endorsement of these points.</p><p>The fixed-charge notice and penalty-points system has played an important part in enhancing road safety and has been very effective, since its introduction in 2002, as part of a suite of measures in addressing safety concerns on our roads.  The main objective of the penalty-points system is not to penalise but to raise awareness of unsafe practices, improve driver behaviour and, as a result, reduce the number of deaths and injuries on our roads.  The system is widely accepted by the public, as evidenced by the fact that over 70% of those served with a fixed-charge notice pay the stipulated amount without recourse to the courts.</p><p>The Bill I am presenting today provides a means of addressing inadvertent errors that took place in recent months.  I am satisfied that enactment of the Bill will correct these errors and will provide, as is the previously stated will of the Oireachtas, a clear legal basis for the endorsement of penalty points when a fixed-charge payment has been made following a road traffic offence.</p><p>The provisions of the Bill will also ensure that penalty points endorsed following the payment of a fixed charge since 1 August will remain on the licence record.  I again thank the Seanad for facilitating the Bill.  I am sure Senators will appreciate the urgency of the matter and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I will give a practical example, which I raised on the Order of Business here last week or the previous week.  My old jalopy of a car is due for NCT on 1 March.  When I applied on 1 December, three months ahead, I was told it would be mid to late March before I had any hope of getting a date for an NCT.  Under this legislation am I, living in west County Cork and the most remote Senator from this House, supposed to park up my vehicle and wait three weeks?</p><p>I know of one young fellow, whose father came to me three weeks ago, and he has been waiting five months for an NCT.  There seems to be no moratorium for someone who has genuinely applied.  The first thing to be fixed is that no person should have to wait three months for an NCT, which is ridiculous.  As a consequence of this legislation, from 1 March I would be forced to either park up my vehicle or wait for three weeks during which I could not go to Dublin to attend the Seanad or go elsewhere.  That practical difficulty must be overcome.</p><p>The Minister may not revert to this matter; I actually raised it a week or two ago.  However, there should be some excuse.  I may have to appear before a District Court judge and point out that I applied three months earlier for a NCT but was yet to get an appointment.  It is not my fault, but the fault of the system that is either overloaded or it is different in different areas.  If that is the case I have serious concerns over the Bill.  Those are just two practical cases of a young fellow who was waiting for five months.  Thankfully the law was not in place at the time and he continued driving - he had to do so given that he was 23 or 24 miles from his place of work - but it was a concern to him and nobody wants to drive a vehicle without NCT.</p> <p> I know the Minister has contacted the Attorney General and received advice on the retrospective nature of this Bill.  From my days as a young law student, I have always had a deep concern where any legislation is retrospective.  I was trained to think in the Aula Maxima of University College Cork that retrospection does not rest lightly with our Constitution or the courts and is to be avoided if at all possible.  I know the Minster has a job to do and I do not wish to be critical of him personally.  Nevertheless, I have deep concerns about this, and my colleague, Senator Byrne, may elaborate on the issue.  We also have concerns about the amendment but rather than repeating ourselves, Senator Byrne will concentrate on the inherent flaw of the amendment as put before us.</p><p>When we consider the extra penalty point offences, we might all be worried.  By and large, the system works well, and it is not that I am critical of it.  One must also reflect on the strong assertions of the former chairman of the Road Safety Authority when he indicated there is a lack of resources contributing to a problem.  Two years ago saw the fewest number of road traffic deaths and although nobody likes to see it, last year saw an increase and this year it looks like the figure will be up again.  If there is a lack of resources in introducing penalty point offences relating to the national car test or speeding, there could be a serious flaw in the system.  I am not sure how the Minister can respond to this but it would be remiss of me not to bring it to his attention.</p><p>Another issue relating to the NCT was brought to my attention by a public representative from the west.  A lady sold her clapped-out car for scrap and got &euro;450 for it.  She ended up in court in Cork with a serious number of charges relating to parking offences around Cork city, although she never even thought the car could get to Cork.  The car had been towed away.  Although it is not directly related to this legislation, there is a duty imposed on a person selling a car to go to a local authority and get the ownership certificate transferred and so on.  Perhaps the Minister and his departmental officials can reflect on this with respect to the NCT.  The vehicle was towed away as scrap but two or three weeks later, these non-national people had got the car going.  They took it to Cork and parked it wherever they liked.  I am thankful that the judge in this case, when the facts were outlined to him, struck out the summons, but she could have been facing &euro;800 in fines.  The woman sold the car for parts or scrap but if we pursue the issue to its end, she could be seen to have allowed a vehicle to be driven on the road without a valid NCT as she was technically the legal owner.  That is something that also concerns me.</p><p>We support the thrust of what the Minister is trying to do but we cannot ignore the issue.  I respect the Attorney General but in the past that office has made mistakes.  When doctors differ, patients die, but with the Attorney General and lawyers, as I was told once, if they are paid enough and one asks the right questions, one will get the desired answer.  I am not clear that we can overcome this issue of legislation being retrospective.  For the past few months, what is done has been done.  One could say that from 1 January the legislation would take effect and we might have to ignore the lacuna.  We must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I do not want to come in here completely opposed to the legislation, although I have deep reservations about it.  I have had them from day one.  I am touching on a few points and my colleague, Senator Byrne, might expand concerns about it as well, particularly the amendment which the Minister proposes.  It is a constitutionally dangerous process and it is flawed.  We might end up opposing the Minister's amendment and voting for the Bill.</p><p>It is difficult but we are not trying to be obstreperous, as that is not in my nature.  Most of my colleagues know that when I have something to say, I say it, and if I have deep concerns, it would be wrong of me to bury or ignore them.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is one of the new young Ministers who are doing very well and I wish him a peaceful and good Christmas and new year.  I hope we will see safe driving for all of us.  It is important that we highlight and promulgate our concerns.</p></speech>

He probably did not want to be here to deal with this issue as we thought it had been dealt with in the 2014 Act.  As the Minister has pointed out, this stems from the Road Traffic Act 1961, which has been amended numerous times, most recently in 2014.  Due to the nature of road traffic legislation, it is always a work in progress, with the two main drivers of change being policy developments and amendments, which are regularly required as experience demonstrates a need for change to existing legislation.  Given the numerous pieces of legislation that have been enacted since 1961, the Department plans to consolidate the Acts.  This is a significant undertaking which has been deferred on occasions as a legislative priority to bring about improvements to road safety, particularly regarding drug and drink-driving.</p><p>I commend the Minister, as he only found out about this issue last Wednesday and he has brought the legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas immediately.  I accept Senator O'Donovan's point regarding retrospective legislation, and one could say the horse has bolted.  The Minister and Members of the Oireachtas have the job of putting legislation in place, and it is up to the courts and judges to enforce that law.  We must ensure legislation is proper.  If people win cases on appeal, we cannot do anything about it.</p><p>Road safety is a very emotive issue and all communities have been affected by either fatalities or injuries.  Since the introduction of penalty points in 2002, with different legislation bringing in different offences, road safety has improved.  Last year, unfortunately, we had more fatalities at 190 than the 162 in the previous year.  It is important that we continue to produce legislation to ensure our roads can be safer places.  It is interesting that an EU survey of the 27 European capitals indicates that Dublin, Lisbon and Oslo are the safest capital cities with regard to road traffic fatalities.  This indicates that our penalty points system is working.</p><p>This legislation must be introduced because a commencement order was not signed in the 2010 legislation.  It relates to driving without an NCT certificate and dangerous parking.  These offences had to be dealt with in the courts previously and the punishment was more penalty points.  The court should not have to deal with a case of somebody driving without an NCT certificate.  If garda&iacute; feel a vehicle is defective, they can impound it, and we should not be giving court time to such an offence.  It is the same with dangerous parking, which may cause fatalities and accidents, but the offence should not have to be dealt with in court.  This is a way of freeing up court time, as we are always complaining that the District Court is overly burdened and does not deal with the offences it should be dealing with.  This streamlines the process.</p><p>I commend the Minister as he and his officials were courageous in immediately alerting the Members of the Oireachtas and the Attorney General while getting the best advice.  That advice is that we must introduce retrospective legislation, which is before us today.  We must support the Minister and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We will probably get the fatality figure down to 200 this year, compared with the figure of a little over 160 in our best year.  We must keep the legislation up to date with what is happening.  The Minister indicated that a commencement order was not signed and referred to "inadvertent errors" in this regard.  We all make such errors from time to time and I appreciate fully the Minister's bona fides in this matter.  He is trying to correct those errors and is doing so urgently.  We must be vigilant to ensure commencement orders are signed.</p><p>Some 75,000 offences are affected by this error, 70% of which relate to speeding.  Senator O'Neill noted that the offences also include dangerous parking and driving vehicles that have not been tested.  These offences contribute to a lack of safety on the roads.  We must always keep an eye on where the next improvements in safety is coming from and keep the momentum up, because it moves to other activities.  We were all rightly shocked by the death of a gentleman near this building recently.  We know the human toil and misery road accidents cause and we have met the groups campaigning against drink driving and so on.  Likewise, we all have seen the progress that was made in recent years.</p><p>In the spirit that the Minister saw a situation that needed to be addressed and is seeking to raise awareness of unsafe practices and deal with those practices, he is right to bring this legislation forward before Christmas.  The seasonal road safety campaign is not just an exercise for the cameras.  Where it is necessary to change laws urgently to address a particular issue, I support the Minister in that.  While I appreciate the human rights emphasis of the Irish legal profession, it sometimes seems that the rights of people to conduct themselves in an unsafe manner on the roads are vindicated much more strenuously than are the rights of the victims of that behaviour.  I feel a certain sense of despair when I see yet more transport cases being dismissed by judges up and down the country.  There is a huge cost to that.</p><p>The Minister is trying to address a problem of safety and he deserves the support of the House in that effort.  I agree with Senator O'Neill that we probably do need new and comprehensive road safety legislation rather than repeatedly adding new provisions to existing law to address loopholes and errors that were made.  It is a major problem.  For young males aged under 35, the leading cause of death is road accidents.  With that in mind, I broadly support what the Minister is proposing to do here.  I also support Senator O'Donovan on his point regarding the national car test.  If it is to be a serious offence for drivers not to display a valid NCT certificate, then we must facilitate those who are genuinely trying to have their vehicles tested by ensuring there is no waiting list.  I am sure the Minister already has that issue in hand.</p></speech>

Senator O'Neill explained very clearly the technicalities of what this Bill seeks to achieve.  I have concerns regarding the retrospective aspect of the legislation.  I hope it works, but we will not know that until such time as we see whether there is a legal challenge to it.  Perhaps the way around this problem would have been to wipe any penalty points given between 1 August and the enactment of this Bill.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan made a very valid point in regard to NCTs.  In some parts of the country, one will get an appointment within a fortnight, while in other locations there could be a wait of five months.  A solution might be to oblige motorists either to have a valid NCT or be able to prove they applied to have the test done before the expiration of the previous certificate.</p><p>I am being opportunistic in raising the issue on which I will conclude.  It relates to the renewal of provisional licences, particularly for older drivers.  I met two elderly people in the past two months, one aged 72 and the other 77, who never had a full licence in their lives.  In each case, a provisional licence was repeatedly renewed.  However, because one does not get notification that one's licence is about to expire, these individuals did not notice that the time had come and now they are both obliged to sit a theory test.  I can guarantee I would not pass that test and I suspect the Minister might not pass it either.  The only people who are able to pass theory tests are 18 year olds applying for licences for the first time.  They are so anxious to get on the road that they will put in the required study time.  Will the Minister consider making some provision for older people in the circumstances I described and looking sympathetically at their cases?  They might not pass the theory test but they have been driving all their lives, they are careful and do not get into accidents, and they can fulfil any other requirements, medical or otherwise.  They should not be put through a theory test that they simply will not be able to pass.  In the meantime, the two individuals to whom I referred are currently without a licence and off the road.</p></speech>

None of us likes getting penalty points, but the system has been tremendously successful in ensuring fewer people are killed on the roads.  It is a system that is working and we must maintain its integrity.<br/>It occurred to me last night while searching for other legislation that it is very difficult to find commencement notices.  This presents a difficulty not just for Oireachtas Members or members of the public but also, I am sure, for Departments.  We must have a different system whereby it will be easier to identify which sections of a particular Bill have been commenced and which have not.  Alternatively, perhaps we should end the current system altogether and set out in legislation itself when its provisions will be commenced.  As it stands, it is difficult to know what is law and what is not, a difficulty that clearly is also being encountered by experts in the Department.  This issue needs to be examined at Government level.  The fault rests ultimately with the Department in this instance but we, as legislators, also must take some responsibility.  This Bill should make us cautious and wary about rushing legislation.<br/>I understand the Minister is meeting spokespersons today, presumably to discuss the amendment he proposes to bring forward on Committee Stage.  I can think of no other word to describe that amendment other than &quot;weird&quot;.  It does not read right and I do not know what the Minister is seeking to achieve.  I do not use &quot;weird&quot; in a derogatory sense but to convey how strange it is; perhaps &quot;strange&quot; is the right word to use.  The Oireachtas does not set out to make unconstitutional legislation and there must be a presumption that the laws we enact are constitutional.  We are often told when we bring forward Private Members' Bills that something cannot be done because the advice is that it is in conflict with the Constitution.  However, the Minister's amendment No. 1 states: <blockquote>If this section would, but for this subsection, conflict with a constitutional right of any person, the operation of this section shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force and effect.</blockquote>I am not sure there is any precedent for that.  I wonder whether a lawyer panicked and urged that it be included just in case.  If this issue only arose today, I would be urging the Minister to seek further advice and omit this provision if at all possible.  If a particular provision is unconstitutional, the courts will find it such.  It is not for us to put in a &quot;just in case&quot; clause.  I am sure the Minister will elaborate further on Committee Stage, but these are my initial thoughts.</p></speech>

Several legal practitioners contacted me to express concerns in respect of the retrospective element of this Bill.  I understand the Minister has taken the advice of the Attorney General in this matter, but there are concerns about penalty points issued since 1 August.  I warned about retrospective legislation on a previous occasion.</p> <p>Fortunately the Supreme Court held it to be unconstitutional.  The entire Bill was thrown out in 2004.  I have concerns about it because I come from a legal background.  I fully understand that the Minister is trying to follow the correct course to deal with the problem.  I believe that it will be challenged.</p><p>The penalty points that result in a driver being put off the road have been reduced from 12 to seven.  A legal colleague has raised with me question of offences that occurred when the 12 point rule applied, but by the time the matter came to court, the seven point rule applied.  Where does that leave the person involved?  Will that be considered?  The legislation made that retrospective too.  Our role as legislators is to ensure that all legislation stays within the provisions of the Constitution.  My legal colleagues have expressed genuine concern about these issues.  We all in the legal profession like a good legal challenge that starts off in the High Court and goes to the Supreme Court.  These are the checks and balances we are fortunate to have in our Constitution to deal with these concerns.</p><p>My office and another legal office in Cork identified a problem regarding nursing homes and emergency legislation was rushed through.  It is amazing that this always happens in December.  We highlighted the problem in December 2004.  It went into the High Court which decided not to allow a judicial review because we had not given adequate provision to the health board to deal with the issue.  The Department's response was to rush emergency legislation through the Dail and Seanad in three days.  The President was concerned about it because it made legislation retrospective.  She referred it to the Supreme Court which in February 2005 found it to be unconstitutional.  Since then I have always been concerned about legislation coming through in December, particularly if it goes through the Houses in three days.  There is always someone there are waiting to make sure the t's are crossed and the i&rsquo;s dotted.  This needs to be carefully considered before we sign off on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600045#YY00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The penalty points system was a great success in terms of road safety between 2007 and 2013, when there was a 44% reduction in road fatalities across the State, going from over 330 in 2007 to a low of 162 in 2012.  That was a massive achievement, given that the Government target for that year was 100 more than the final outcome.  Unfortunately, there was a rise in fatalities in 2013 and 2014.  As of now, there have been 183 deaths on the roads, and the Christmas holiday period is upcoming.  This highlights the importance of getting legislation right and maintaining the effectiveness of the penalty points system in legislation and in practice, as well as ensuring that motorists and pedestrians know that it is in place.  It is not the failure of the idea that has led to this rise or the problem we face today.  It is human error, which we must change and protect against.  I have no intention of hammering anyone about the problems in the legislation which led to this.  It was a mistake and should not have happened, and might have shaken the structure that we use to improve road safety.  The Minister recognised it was a mistake and owned up to it and it is admirable that he sought to deal with it swiftly.  If other Ministers and Departments had acted similarly, in other respects, the Government would have had a smoother time in the first half of 2014.</p><p>This legislation does deal with the issues that have arisen.  Simply passing this Bill will not put an end to the matter, but it will go a long way towards resolving the problem, although it might be challenged by some people.  Most of those who might feel disgruntled or hard done by in this case only do so in light of the discovery of our legislative mistake.  None would have been aware of this had they not been driving in a manner which put themselves or others at risk, to a lesser or greater extent.  People who held up their hands and took fines and points on their licences cannot expect to have them pulled following the passage of this Bill.  That is how it should be.  Road safety is too important an issue to allow anything else to happen.  Penalty points have been too valuable a tool to suffer greater damage.  Killer behaviour, as the Road Safety Authority, RSA, calls it, must be challenged and in Ireland we have shown a great willingness to adopt common sense policies on safety, for example, the smoking ban.  People no longer accept drink-driving or other practices that put drivers, passengers, and other road users at risk.  This is due to the effective use of a public awareness campaigns which have brought home the seriousness of such behaviour to the public.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention resources.  We have passed several Bills which have imposed new responsibilities on the Garda in respect of road safety.  We have all highlighted that while we support those changes, the Garda may have been less equipped to carry out existing responsibilities and the legislation we are debating would not be as effective as we had hoped it would be.  The previous head of the RSA was very clear, as I expect the new one is too, that enforcement is the key to the effectiveness of penalty points and Garda resources are very important.  I implore the Minister to make sure this issue is prioritised at Cabinet level and to ensure that providing better Garda resources is a major plank of future road safety strategy.  We will support this legislation.  I thank the Minister for his work on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600045#YY00300"><p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  Senator O'Donovan and others raised the status of the regime requiring a driver to have a valid NCT certificate.  It was an offence before the Road Traffic Act 2014 and before this Bill.  The 2014 Act changed the penalty point regime on the need to have a valid NCT certificate.  A driver now has the option of not going to court, paying a lower fine and having a different number of penalty points imposed on the licence.  It was not that a new offence was brought in but that the existing offence was changed to make the option of a fixed charge payment available.  The more significant change, however, is the degree of advertising support and awareness that this change commanded.</p> <p>It has been something that has been the focus of a significant amount of support and advertising from the Road Safety Authority and there has been a huge increase in awareness of this changed offence, which has led to an increased demand for NCT certificates.  </p><p>On the points the Senator put to me, I will give a set of figures which have influenced how I view this issue and what I have done on it.  These figures show that at the end of November the Road Safety Authority carried out approximately 25,000 NCT tests.  Of those, 9,000 were either late or very late, and 1,450 of the tests refer to vehicles that should have had an NCT in 2013.  A significant minority of vehicles which are being tested for an NCT should have had the certificate in place for a long period of time before the examination actually happened.  This is directly relevant to an issue everyone has touched on, namely, the issue of road safety.  The safety of a vehicle and how roadworthy it is can have a potential impact on safety on our roads.  That is why this measure was introduced and why I support it.</p><p>There has been an increase in the amount of public comment on what the Road Safety Authority and I have done with regard to this.  The average waiting time at the moment for NCT test centres is 11 days.  On foot of getting that national average, I requested a regional breakdown.  The Senator made this point in relation to his constituency.  The average might look okay or good, but there could be particular distortions or unacceptable waiting times in particular centres.  I have requested, and got, the waiting times per NCT centre across the country.  This information showed me, when I last checked it, which was last week, that the waiting time for most centres was inside what is acceptable.  The Road Safety Authority has since told me that it has now hired an additional 50 staff, approximately, to deal with this, and, in particular centres, it has made more services available to deal with the demand for NCT certificates.  I will continue to request that information on a weekly basis to see where the situation stands.  </p><p>Drivers who had valid NCT certificates are seeking to renew them and their perception is that it is more difficult to get an appointment because of the increased number of people who are coming in to test vehicles.  This is causing concern.  I have raised the issue with the Road Safety Authority and it tells me that people must call the centre.  I have said this here and in the other House also.  If they call the centre, in the overwhelming majority of cases, a test will be provided.  Further, if a test cannot be provided within 28 days, there is a provision in place stating that it should be provided for free.  I have also raised this issue with the Road Safety Authority.  At the moment, the free test is only being provided in the case of 2% of NCT tests.  I am happy to respond further to the Senator on this point later on in the debate, but I note for now that I will continue to get this information.  I know it is an issue of concern at the moment.  Further, I will specifically look at the waiting time per NCT centre and I will work with the Road Safety Authority to ensure that additional resources are deployed in the best way possible.  </p><p>The Senator put some other points to me.  I am going to conclude with the common theme of the retrospective nature of this legislation, because I think it is the major theme people have raised with me.  On the issue of resourcing, a point also made by Senator Reilly, and making sure that we have an adequate number of garda&iacute; and personnel available to support the law that has been supported, given the resources that are currently available, the Garda is doing a very good job on this issue.  However, I have raised the matter directly with the Garda Commissioner myself.  This might also answer the point put by Senator Reilly to me.  I have argued that with an increase in the number of garda&iacute; being recruited and active - this change is happening this year - we should see a similar increase in the number of people who are in the traffic corps and involved in running enforcement tests and checkpoints to make our roads safe.  Ultimately, the body of law that we have in place will only be safely and properly implemented if there is an enforcement regime in place that people believe is credible.  I have made this point to the Garda Commissioner.  As the number of garda&iacute; grows, as it will, this area is one that should be better resourced in the future.  </p><p>Senator O'Neill put a number of points to me.  One is a point that was also touched on by Senator Byrne.  The law in this area is weighty and complex and this has led to an issue on the implementation of the commencement order.  I would draw a parallel between this area of law and company law.  Road safety legislation has been more highly prioritised in recent years, but there is a huge body of road safety law in place dating back to the main Act of 1961.  There is a large degree of complexity in it with a large number of different Bills referring to different subsections in other Bills, some of which have now been in operation for a long period of time.  To my mind, there are two necessary next steps that have emerged from this issue.  We should begin the process of consolidation of road safety and road traffic law.  That will take a long period to do, a period well beyond the lifetime of this Seanad or D&aacute;il.  In my Department, I have requested an audit of any other potential areas of non-commencement.  We will look at all of the recent sections of road traffic law and ensure that this specific error does not happen again.  Road safety law is very important and an area that is tested regularly.  </p><p>Various Senators have touched on the effect of penalty points in improving safety on our roads.  We have gone from a situation where life was being lost every day to a situation that is much improved but in which too many people are still losing their lives, as the last number of days have illustrated.  I believe a very credible and strong penalty point regime has contributed significantly to this.  </p><p>Senator Barrett touched on similar areas as well.  He also acknowledged, and it is a point worth making again, the absolute misery, heartache and grief that is involved in all of the statistics to which we referred.  Very early in my time as Minister, I met a family which lost a life.  Their young boy was tragically killed outside their home.  To sit down and hear a family talk about their grief and how this changed the course of their lives brings home, in a way no statistic can, the need to continue to do all we can to make our roads as safe as possible.</p><p>The point was made that there is a need to look, in as comprehensive a way as possible, at all the different areas of road safety.  I chair a group that meets twice a year to look at all of the different agencies that are involved in road safety legislation, the status of each of the actions under our current road safety strategy and what actions are not happening and how they need to be changed.  The most recent meeting of that group happened within the last two weeks.  This is a forum in which we look at the implementation of different points.</p><p>Senator Kelly put to me that I should have considered the raising of penalty points between 1 August and the point at which this issue was detected.  I decided not to pursue that course of action because my own belief was that something like that would significantly undermine the credibility of our penalty point regime in the future.</p> <p>I was also aware of the sheer number of actual offences that were committed.  My view as Minister is that I should do what I can to ensure a system is in place that delivers the sanctions to the offences that have been committed.  In the interests of transparency, because it is important that the Senator is aware of the figures, from 1 August until the point at which this issue was detected and action taken, 78,504 people were affected and the total number of penalty points affected by this is 206,030.  This is a very significant number of offences and people, which was crucial in the decision I made to look at how we would put in a place a continuous regime since 1 August and not to go down the route of erasing penalty points, due to the figures that were there.</p><p>I have touched on the point in regard to regional NCT centres and I note the point made in respect of individuals who have had a large number of provisional licences built up over time and what can happen when they realise they cannot get another one.  I accept that this is an issue, particularly for elderly people who have had many provisional licences.  That being said, as the Senator will appreciate, the main issue I have to consider is what we need to do to make our roads as safe as possible and to ensure that the people who are on our roads have gone through the right level of testing, both theory and test.  It is for that reason that a theory test was required, but I might get some more information for the Senator on that particular issue after this.</p></speech>

On the point put to me regarding the legislation being rushed, I am seeking to have it passed in an afternoon and evening.  I appreciate the fact that I am allowed to bring it into the House at this stage.  I am struck by the last piece of road traffic legislation, the 2014 Act, which went through a huge amount of scrutiny and was debated extensively in the House, in the Committee and in the D&aacute;il.  While responsibility rests with me as Minister - I am not seeking to divert that in any way - it was the basis of commencement notices.  In fairness, I could not expect any Senator, no matter how aware he or she is of road safety legislation, to know the commencement status of every section in the Bill.  That is a lesson that I and my Department have learned from this debate.  I have already said what we are doing in that regard.</p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne raised a point in regard to the amendment which I will discuss on Committee Stage when we go through each part of the Bill.  The sole purpose for bringing this to the House is to make clear that the constitutional rights of any person will not be infringed in any way by the passage of the Bill.  I will discuss that issue on Report Stage.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke made a point in regard to emergency legislation which I have touched on.  Senator Kathryn Reilly mentioned trends and penalty points in regard to collisions and noted the position this year versus a year ago which shows an increase, particularly after the events of recent days.  We will be introducing a further change in terms of the sanction regime on our roads when we bring in greater facilities for drug testing next year in respect of the devices that will allow that to happen.  When that is done, there will be an amount of road safety legislation in place and at that point we will have to consider other issues, such as what can be done with vehicles, what else can be done and needs to be done in respect of driver awareness, the education of drivers and so on.  Given the number of changes made to the penalty points system, there are a large number of specified offences that carry penalty points or for which other consequences are available.   We will need to look at other areas for next year.</p><p>I have touched on the point in regard to the resourcing of the Garda in the comment I made to Senator Denis O'Donovan.  The work of the Road Safety Authority in terms of enforcement and advertising is crucial.  It is an independent body of my Department, to which I was pleased to appoint Ms Liz O'Donnell as chairperson.  She is an independent and vigorous chair of that organisation.  An important change that will take place in that body is that it will soon be self-financing.  Given that, it will have the ability to make its own independent choices in terms of the issues it seeks to raise and the advertising campaigns it wants to commence.  I commend its present advertising campaign for the Christmas period and particularly the impact the consumption of drugs can have on one's ability to drive.</p><p>I turn to the most substantive point Senators have raised, which is the issue of retrospection.  The issue was raised by Senators O'Donovan, Burke and Byrne in respect of their concerns in this area.  In addressing these concerns I wish to make two points that the Senators may wish to consider as we go into Committee Stage that have been crucial in my taking this course of action.  I want to take a step back and explain the process overall when one gets penalty points.  When an offence is committed, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will stop a person and decide that, for example, penalty points is the right sanction and will choose to go down the fixed charge notice route.  To be clear, we are not talking about offences that go to court but which incur fixed charge notices.  The Garda will communicate that to the individual who will then be asked by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they accept the penalty points on their licence.  The person will indicate their acceptance of the penalty points and-or payment of the fine.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will then notify the national driver vehicle licence database and it is at that point the penalty points are applied to the licence.  It is at that stage of the process that we have this issue.  We are not talking about creating a new offence retrospectively, but when the person has admitted the offence, we are talking about the right-footing, as it were, for the application of the penalty points.  We are not seeking to create a new offence but to deal with the implementation of an existing offence for which the driver has accepted liability.  That is why this course of action and this Bill is being pursued.</p><p>We are referring to a sanction that is civil in nature.  Unless they are appealed to the courts, they are not a criminal matter.</p> <p>The two reasons that led to me bringing this Bill forward are the fact that we are dealing with the administration of an offence as opposed to the creation of an offence and the fact that the offence is civil in nature.  These are among the points made to me in the advice I received from the Attorney General, but it is up to me to decide how to act on that advice.  The two points that led to me bringing the Bill forward concern the application of the points and the fact that the application occurs in regard to a civil offence.  I have done my best to respond to the different points that Senators have raised.  Obviously, if Senators have more detailed points to put to me on Committee Stage, I will do my best to respond to them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.378" nospeaker="true" time="17:15:00" ><p>Government amendment No. 1:
In page 4, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:&ldquo;(4) If this section would, but for this subsection, conflict with a constitutional right of any person, the operation of this section shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force and effect.&rdquo;.</p></speech>

Its purpose is to insert a new subsection in section 3 to clarify that this section is not intended to infringe the constitutional rights of any individual.  This is to make provision in regard to the judicial review proceedings which were granted by the High Court yesterday, 15 December, in which the applicant has challenged the endorsement of six penalty points on her driving licence in November resulting in her disqualification.  The constitutional separation of powers prohibits legislative interference in proceedings before the courts.  This provision will ensure that the section cannot be interpreted in a manner that would interfere with proceedings pending in the courts.</p></speech>

This section seems to imply that if the legislation is unconstitutional, we do not mean it to be such.  It is like a just-in-case clause.  If one were attempting to do what the Minister is attempting, one would state this section is not intended to affect any cases currently before the courts, or something like that.  However, the amendment seems to point to possible unconstitutionality.  It is almost an admission of this by the Government.  I have mentioned this on Twitter and a few barristers have reverted to me on the possibility of its being unconstitutional.</p></speech>

We are already interpreting the law through this Government amendment.  I was thinking of calling a vote on this but have decided not to as we do not want to stand in the way of the passage of the legislation in the interest of road safety.  I have serious concerns that the Government or somebody in the Attorney General's office has suggested the provision might be unconstitutional, yet we are going ahead with passing the Bill.  It is just very strange and seems to conflict with the established principles of constitutional interpretation and what we do here.  As I said on Second Stage, we do not pass unconstitutional laws.  Despite this, the amendment refers to a possible conflict with a constitutional right.  What if we implemented a law allowing torture and included a provision stating that if it conflicted with a constitutional right, it would not be affected?  What if we made a law to bring everyone into custody without trial and said that if it conflicted with the constitutional right of any person, it would be subject to such limitation as is necessary to ensure it did not conflict.  The provision strikes me as really strange.  It strikes me that somebody believes it is unconstitutional.  At the last minute - this seems to have come up at the last minute - it was it was suggested that this amendment be tabled just in case.  I do not know what effect it will have in the courts.  If the section is unconstitutional, it is unconstitutional.</p></speech>

I sure that, as day follows night, it will be.  I understand that the error is one of administration rather than one involving the introduction of new legislation.  Since it is so serious, it is important that we test this.  When the time comes, I will press this to a vote.  Not doing so would leave me, Senator Byrne and others, and even Senator Colm Burke on the other side of the House, red-faced in four, five or 12 months if the legislation were challenged and overturned on a point of law in the Supreme Court.  It would be asked whether we were doing our job in opposition.  The least we can do is push this to a vote.</p></speech>

If somebody challenges this in the High Court or Supreme Court, so be it.  If he is successful, that will reflect what the court has decided.  The Minister has to bring this legislation before the House.  There are commencement orders from 2010 that were not signed so we have a flaw in the legislation we passed in 2014.  That is why we had to bring this to the House.  While I accept what the Senators are saying, we cannot have this tested before we make the law.  We have got to make the law and let somebody test it in the courts later if he wishes.  We cannot wait until next January, February, March or April to do this; it must be done now.  Legislation was needed immediately.  I acknowledge that the Senators have concerns but it is important that we pass this legislation today.  Let somebody make a constitutional challenge if he wishes.</p></speech>

First, in presenting this Bill for Senators' consideration, I am absolutely confident that it is constitutional and meets all the requirements and constraints that the Constitution confers on it.  Second, the amendment is making explicit that nothing in the Bill shall in any way seek to interfere with a matter that is currently before the courts.  We are seeking to recognise very explicitly the fact that there is separation of powers with independent judges and, within that system, appellants who can make any decisions they see fit on new or existing law.  The purpose of this is to make clear that what is in this section does not in any way seek to impede any matter currently before the courts.</p> <p>I suggest to Senators O'Donovan and Byrne that while I appreciate and accept totally the principled manner in which they address this, we seek via this amendment to make very clear this section does not in any way seek to become involved in or interfere with the separation of powers which is embedded in the Constitution, from which the Bill ultimately flows.</p></speech>

It simply does not.  It is strange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600049#CCC00300"><p>I take the point the Minister is trying to make, which is that while the courts are dealing with the proceedings of a case, legislation cannot be changed to affect the outcome of the case.  It is a genuine point and I would certainly support it, but I wonder whether the Minister might consider that what he has put forward is incredibly broad.  I did not realise this is what it meant.  It is with regard to the operation of the section conflicting with a constitutional right.  How it is written is very broad.  It is fair enough to say the legislation will not in any way impact on cases currently subject to the judicial process, as this has been a standard aspect of Irish law all the way back to the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case.  The Legislature cannot introduce legislation to affect court cases which have already started.  However, this is not the what the amendment states.  Perhaps the Minister will consider being more specific on Report Stage, because a section on interfering in any way with any constitutional rights in an unspecified manner would be extraordinarily broad.  It could fall foul of the rules on vagueness as it is not clear what is intended by the wording.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600049#CCC00400"><p>The challenge I have is this regard is that by definition the constitutional rights of people are very broad.  If I were to introduce anything to specify what aspect of their rights we are looking to protect, it would leave me open to the accusation that I am weakening other aspects by not specifying them.  The very nature of the amendment I am introducing is to make explicit that the rights people have under our Constitution are not in any way impeded or interfered with by the Bill, which is obvious.  I am also looking to make very clear that any matter which could be considered by the courts is separate to the courts and a matter for them, and nothing in the Bill seeks to interfere with this in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600049#CCC00500"><p>I understand this, but the Minister has explained the purpose of the amendment is to deal with court cases.  He also stated there are things he has not thought of which we have not thought of that could be covered by it.  This gives me the same concern as Senator Byrne as to whether there is an issue with regard to the legislation which is not clear to us, and the Minister or his officials have concerns that it could potentially be unconstitutional.  The specifics the Minister has mentioned are fair enough, but the case he has argued could be made with regard to any legislation, that if it has unforeseen consequences which interfere with constitutional rights the people's rights will be upheld.  The Minister's point would involve such a provision being included in every piece of legislation, when the only difficulty the Minister can think of is court cases.  A specific issue with regard to a court case would be fair enough.  Of course I want to see language which protects people's constitutional's rights but I am concerned, as is Senator Byrne, as to why it is necessary, whether we have been given the full story and why the Minister thinks it is a concern.</p></speech>

As I stated when I introduced the amendment, it flows from a recent appeal on a number of penalty points, and the person absolutely had the right to make the appeal.  In this amendment I seek to make very explicit the rights the person has and the independence of the courts.  I assure the Senator there is absolutely no other motive or rationale behind the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600050#DDD00300"><p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br />In page 4, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:&ldquo;<b>4</b>. The Minister shall, by 15 January 2015, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out his proposals to address the backlog in NCT testing to ensure that people are not unfairly penalised with penalty points because they could not get an appointment for an NCT test within a reasonable timeframe.&rdquo;</blockquote>This amendment is intended to deal with the delay in NCT testing.  In some test centres, people are currently waiting up to four months for an appointment.  This is bad enough if they want to get their cars tested, but with the new regulations that have come into play they are also liable for penalty points.  If they do not know there is a four-month delay they may book the test two months in advance, thinking they are well in time for an appointment.  It is incredibly unfair that somebody in that situation would be hit with penalty points.  When this was questioned last week, it emerged that it does not even matter that people can show a garda evidence that they have booked a test once they have missed the deadline.  <br/>This amendment provides for the Minister to lay a report before both Houses by the middle of January indicating how he intends to deal with that unfair situation and ensure the centres are adequately staffed.  The new penalty points offence should not have come into place at all until that situation was addressed.  It is fair enough that cars need to be roadworthy but it is unfair to bring the points in when there are huge delays for testing.</p> <p>Everybody is entitled to get their car tested within three or four weeks of applying for a test.  One should not have to wait months for a test.  My amendment seeks a review of the situation and for the Minister to report to the Houses on how he intends to address the matter so that people are not unfairly penalised.  People want to obey the law but for reasons outside of their control such as the staffing in centres they are unable to do so. </p></speech>

He should reiterate his commitment that nobody will wait more than 28 days for a test.  Unfortunately, people have had to wait for longer.  As mentioned, it is crazy set up that people whose NCTs are lapsed since 2013 are looking for tests.  When I applied for my test I thought I was doing things correct by applying three months prior to its expiration and I corrected the matter on the record since I raised the point.  I hope my comment did not act as a catalyst in this case.</p><p>Nobody should have to wait for a test.  I ask the Minister to reiterate his commitment, and that of the RSA, made in response to the very valid points made by myself, Senator Power and others and we might be reassured about this issue.  We do not want to be frivolous, vexatious or pushing votes on issues.  The Minister gave a lot of information in the past hour that I was unaware of.  I thought that when people in my area were waiting for between three to five months that it was a general waiting time.  He made the point and I am inclined to accept the commitment he gave to the House.</p></speech>

It is a matter more suited to the Order of Business and I ask Senator Power to withdraw her amendment.</p><p>The Minister pointed out the average waiting times.  We have also experienced waiting.  I have gone online and tried to book an NCT only to see a waiting time of between four and six weeks.  The Minister did say that if one rings a centre more than likely it will facilitate an applicant with a test.  This problem is also the result of the Irish psyche because we leave everything until the last minute.  The onus is on a person to make sure that his or her car has its NCT just the same as the onus is on a person to have his or her road tax in order.  The Minister cannot help it if somebody only applies for the NCT the day before it is due to expire.  The Irish psyche is at play.  I compliment the RSA on its advertisements for the past few weeks which highlight the fact that NCT centres will be very busy in December and January because a lot of cars are sold in January and its a busy time for testing.  I compliment the RSA for pointing out this fact to people. </p><p>I ask Senator Power to withdraw her amendment.  The Minister can give a report to this House on the Order of Business or as an Adjournment matter.  I do not think the motion should be included in a serious Bill that calls on the Minister, by 15 January, to lay a report before the House.  He has pointed out that he has carried out surveys, through his Department, on waiting times at different test centres for the NCT.  I do not think this matter should be put into legislation.</p></speech>

Having said that, I totally understand Senator Power's motivation for tabling her amendment, especially given the recent history of NCTs.  If the Minister was to commit, at a date in January, to issue a report to the media or even lay it before the Houses, not requiring this as an amendment in the legislation, it would be welcome not just by Members of the House but by people in general.</p><p>When the Minister responds I hope he will tell me what is the story with people who do an NCT but believe they have not been fairly treated and their car should have passed.  Perhaps there is some reason or whatever---- </p></speech>

I know of two different individuals who feel there is some sort of a personal vendetta against them by an individual who works in an NCT centre.  Is there a mechanism for appeal in such an instance?  Can people appeal a decision or highlight something that they believe is not right?  Perhaps there is a solution available or structures already in place and I ask the Minister to advise me accordingly.</p></speech>

I did not hear the Minister's response to this issue on Second Stage and look forward to hearing his reply.  I hope there is a fair way of addressing the matter.</p><p>I wish to say to Senator O'Neill that I was not referring to people only applying for a test the day beforehand.  As I said, there is a four month delay.  There are people who try to book an NCT test two months in advance but cannot get an appointment before their test which is unfair.  By any objective measure that is unfair.  I appreciate if the Minister is taking measures to address the problem.  My difficulty was that if someone shows the Garda that he or she booked a month or two ago would they still have to wait another three or four weeks.  It should count for something but under the existing system it does not which is unfair.  I am not suggesting that people should be able to get a test at two or three days notice.  </p><p>Senator O'Neill gave the examples of road tax and road insurance but one does not have to pay either four months in advance or pick a particular date a month in advance that is suits one's work schedule and everything else.  We need to provide people with a decent and efficient NCT service.  People pay for it at the end of the day and it is a commercial service.  Therefore, people are entitled to a service that is fair and consistent.</p><p>We have all received complains which are more than anecdotal about inconsistencies between centres and individual testers.  In the same centre people are often failed for things they think are insignificant.  People must have faith in the system, feel that the job is done right and that it is effective.  People pay for this service but there is no other service where one expects to wait four months for a service.  That is the reason this issue is worth discussing.  I welcome the opportunity to hear the Minister's response about his efforts to reduce the delay.</p></speech>

We will put this to a vote because what Senator O'Neill has said, with all due respect, is nonsense.  I outlined a situation which applied to myself.  My NCT is not due until 1 March.  When I telephoned my local centre two weeks ago to the start of this month I was told the earliest appointment I could get would be 18 March.  That meant I would be in the serious position of not being able to drive for 18 days from 1 March and if I did I would get three penalty points.  I was very reassured by the Minister saying nobody should have to wait for more than 28 days.  He has talked a lot of sense but Senator O'Neill seems to want us to call another vote.</p></speech>

This has always been an offence.  Prior to the change earlier in the year it was five penalty points and direct to court but that has now been changed so that people have the option of a fixed notice payment and three penalty points.  The whole objective has been to take things out of the courts system which we do not believe should have to deal with this matter.  The big change that was made here was not the introduction of a new offence; it was the bringing in of a new phase of a lower penalty point sanction and giving people the option of settling it before it got to court. </p> <p>The more significant change that has happened in respect of this, and this is a point that Senator O'Donovan and I were discussing earlier, is the sheer amount of advertising that took place in the run-up to the change.  The Road Safety Authority was very proactive in communicating this and it has led to a significant increase in the number of people seeking to book their NCT.</p><p>I will again go through the figures I received that led me to support the course of action as it stood then as hopefully they will indicate the scale of the challenge we face in this area.  In the last week of November, 25,000 NCTs were done.  Some 9,000 of those 25,000 were either late or very late.  Of those 9,000, 1,450 were for NCT certificates that were due in 2013.  That shows the scale of the challenge that motivated this change in the penalty points regime.  As the Senator has said, this is a matter of road safety.  It is all about making vehicles safer.  That is why this change was brought in.</p><p>We have made a number of changes to deal with the spike in demand.  The first is that an additional 50 staff have been deployed to carry out the testing.  In NCT centres that currently have a particular waiting list, changes have been made to matters like opening hours and the number of services provided.  Those two changes took place.</p><p>I obtained figures about current waiting times myself, because I have been getting the same level of contact from constituents as Senators have.  The average national waiting time is 11 days.  I then looked for the regional centre breakdown.  This showed that most centres were well inside that 11-day period.  The challenge at the moment is that because so much of the booking is done via the Internet, when people go onto the website and see the next available slot, they understandably assume that it is the only available slot.  The Road Safety Authority has been saying, and I have been aiding it in its efforts, that the best thing for people to do is to ring up and look for an appointment, for the reasons the Senator has described, namely, the need for their cars to be legal.  In the vast majority of cases, the Road Safety Authority is able to facilitate that.  Why do I believe that?  There has been a great deal of contact about this matter.  The reason I believe it is that, as we said a moment ago, if a test cannot be given within 28 days, it must be given for free, and only 2% of recent tests have been given for free.  This shows that the vast majority of them have been delivered within 28 days.</p><p>I am not in a position to accept Senator Power's amendment because the matter could be tackled in other ways and, given the importance of this legislation, it is not appropriate that this particular issue resides within the Bill.  However, if the Leader is amenable to it, I will return to the House in the middle of January, and perhaps in the context of a debate on road safety, transport policy or some such matter, I could give the House a specific update on where we stand by the middle of January on this point.</p></speech>

On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to come to the House in January.  We all want to see that the system is effective.  I was coming from the perspective that if someone could at least show that they had booked the test over a month ago, it should be waived.  I appreciate the Minister saying that the NCT would be free, but one would still be stuck with the three penalty points.  I welcome his assurance that he will come back and brief us on this topic in a month's time.</p></speech>

We were prudent on the issue concerned and put it to a vote.  We said at the outset that we support the general thrust of the legislation.  The days of penalty points are here to stay.</p><p>Regrettably, too many people are still dying on our roads and I wish everyone safe driving from here to the new year.  It is very sad to lose anybody in a road traffic accident, but for somebody to be involved in a fatal accident or to be killed in or around Christmas time is far more poignant and regrettable, not that it is ever easy.  The RSA is doing a good job.  By and large, all the NCT centres are doing a very good job.</p><p>Many years ago, when the NCT first came out, I had a four or five year old Mercedes.  I went for an NCT and it failed, even though I thought it was a pretty good car and I have not been able to afford one since, a Mercedes anyway.  They pointed out that there was a small hose pipe, which, I presume, forced the brake pads to work against the hub of the wheel when one pressed the brakes.  I had never noticed it leaking, but I was not annoyed and it was a very wise thing to do, because they said that if that brake fluid kept leaking, I would have no brake in an emergency.  I was very glad that they pointed it out.  I had to get it fixed and came back and it was passed.  They do an excellent job and must be complimented.  I hope that by raising this issue here, nobody will get a belt of a stick down in west Cork, but it is important to have these debates.</p></speech>

It was very important that this would be dealt with immediately when the Minister realised last Wednesday that there was a problem with the previous legislation, and I commend him on that.  We had a bit of banter here today, but I remind Senator O'Donovan that he might be able to get the Mercedes when he gets back to the other House.  I am not trying to fill the Minister's shoes.

I need to bring in this legislation promptly to deal with the issues we described earlier, and Senators have been exceptionally considerate of that.  The issues that were raised about the amendment were raised on the grounds of prudence rather than on the grounds of opposition.  Senators O'Neill and O'Donovan spoke about road safety at Christmas and how it is so difficult to lose someone in a road accident.  There is more traffic on our roads at this time of year, so there is a need for people to be safer.  Bringing this Bill through the Oireachtas, as I aim to do this week, will ensure that a very important part of how we keep our roads safe, namely, the integrity of our penalty points system and how it is implemented, will be maintained across this period.  I thank all Senators for their support in that.</p></speech>

I have discussed this issue informally with the Minister previously.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to put my thoughts on the matter on the record of the House this evening.  I come from a very rural part of County Kerry.  Many young people in the area work in nearby towns that are 15 or 20 miles away.  As the Minister knows, it is illegal for a learner driver to drive without being accompanied by a qualified driver.  This is causing many problems in parts of rural Ireland where there are no DART, Luas, bus or train services.  Young men and women who have no public transport options are finding it difficult to get to work.  Many of them have to get their parents, brothers or sisters who are qualified drivers to drive them to work.  A great deal of expense is incurred by driving someone 15 miles to work and returning home, before making the same round trip again in the evening.</p><p>I did a little research before I came to the House for this debate.  I was trying to find some statistics with regard to learner drivers.  I learned than in 2013, the most recent year for which statistics are available, some 6% of all fatal collisions involved learner drivers and 94% of such collisions did not involve learner drivers.  Similarly, 6% of collisions in which serious injuries were sustained involved learner drivers and 94% of such collisions did not involve learner drivers.  It seems from those statistics that we are coming down very hard on learner drivers.  I would not come in here to advocate that people should break the law.  I ask the Minister to see whether this problem can be addressed in a way that would alleviate the hardship that is being experienced by young people in rural Ireland as a result of this requirement.</p><p>I have been trying to think of a way to come around this.  I did not want to come in and demand something without sitting down to think about it.  Learner drivers have a logbook that is signed every time they take a professional lesson.  I suggest that in the case of a learner driver who has spent more than 12 hours under the professional supervision of an approved driving instructor and has applied for a driving test, the current restriction could be confined to the hours between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.  That would give people a chance to go to work.  For the last 30 years, learner drivers have been driving without being accompanied by qualified drivers.  I suggest we could make more use of the approved driving instructors.  Maybe they could assess learner drivers as they make progress through their lessons and judge whether they have reached a specific standard.  There is a huge waiting list and timescale for a driving lesson.  I will wait for the Minister's reply.  I will see if he has anything to offer me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600053#GGG00600"><p>I thank Senator Moloney for raising this issue, which we have discussed already.  I am pleased to respond to the topical issue she has raised.  As she will be aware, the driver licensing system is one of the most important foundations of safety on roads.  Driving is not a right.  It is a privilege which must be earned by learning and proving a capacity to control a mechanically propelled vehicle safely on public roads.  The system of driver licensing we operate in Ireland has come a long way over the past decade.  Ten years ago, anyone could fill out a form and get on the roads without prior testing of any sort.  We allowed learners to drive unaccompanied.  As a consequence, an enormous number of drivers did not seem concerned with the need to take the driving test.</p><p>A system of graduated driver licensing is now in place in Ireland.  This stepped approach to the driver learning process focuses on the acquisition of skills and experience, rather than simply on passing a test.  The first step in the introduction of graduated driver licensing was taken in the Road Traffic Act 2006, which replaced the old provisional licence with the learner permit.  This was not just a change of name.  Under Irish law, it is an offence to drive without a licence.  A provisional licence was a licence, but a learner permit is not.  It is a permit to drive while learning, subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include displaying an L plate and having a qualified accompanying driver.  It is worth remembering that a learner permit holder who is not complying with his or her permit conditions is not covered by it.  Since 2006, we have progressively introduced other graduated driver licensing measures.  These include lower blood alcohol limits for learners and recently qualified drivers and compulsory lessons for learner drivers.  I introduced measures earlier this year to require each novice driver to display an N plate.  I set a disqualification threshold of seven penalty points for learners and novices.  This was an increase on the threshold of 12 points that previously applied.</p><p>I emphasise that the ultimate purpose of graduated driver licensing is to save lives.  We have seen a dramatic reduction in road deaths over the past decade.  Unfortunately, this trend was reversed last year.  Current indications are that the death toll for this year will be at least similar to last year's toll.  Graduated driver licensing aims to improve the quality of driving of our young drivers and, in time, of all drivers.  We know that there is a particularly high risk of collisions, deaths and injuries among learner drivers, particularly the high-risk category comprising those between the ages of 17 and 24.  Graduated driver licensing systems generally place a range of restrictions on learner drivers.  These restrictions usually apply for a period of two years after passing a driving test.  Learner drivers are vulnerable road users.  They face greater risks and challenges due to their inexperience.  Evidence suggests that the best way to reduce risk is to introduce measures that are designed to protect them until they have built up enough experience.</p><p>The regulations to give effect to the learner permit system were made in October 2007.  These regulations provided for the replacement of the provisional licence with a learner permit, required each learner permit holder to be accompanied by a driver who holds a full driving licence for at least two years, removed the entitlement of first-time learner permit holders to undertake the driving test for six months after gaining their learner permits and obliged learner motorcyclists to display the letter L on a yellow fluorescent tabard.  The changes which came into place on 8 December last do not create a new offence.  Since the learner permit was created, it has always been an offence to drive without an L plate and without an accompanying driver.  What has changed is that people committing these offences will now receive penalty points.  The purpose of these regulations is to improve road safety, to save lives and to reduce the number of collisions, deaths and injuries among inexperienced drivers.  I appreciate that the restrictions on learners may create difficulties for some people.  However, our overriding consideration must always be the safety of learners and other road users.</p></speech>

I reiterate that by concentrating on just 6% of those who cause fatalities and collisions, and particularly by applying penalty points to this offence, we are coming down very hard on learner drivers.  Does this really necessitate the imposition of penalty points?  Things were hard enough for these drivers before this was done.  I remind the House that many parts of rural Ireland are very isolated.  I am not referring specifically to the Minister when I say it is very easy for people living in Dublin and other urban areas to say they can manage.</p> <p>It is, however, proving difficult in rural areas.  Minister, is there a possibility that some people drawn from expert groups such as driving instructors or the RSA could have one more look to see if there is anything we can do to alleviate this problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600054#HHH00200"><p>I have listened very much to what Senator Moloney has said.  I take her point that 6% of road accidents involve those with L plates are in the learner driver category.  To really understand that figure further, we would have to look at the share of learner drivers as a percentage of the total driving population and to compare that with the figure of 6% of learner drivers who are involved in accidents to arrive at a ratio that will show whether they contribute proportionately or disproportionately to the number of accidents on our roads.  Other figures I have seen give me food for thought and lead me to think this is the right course of action.  In 2013, 26% of car drivers who were killed were under the age of 25 years.  If I consider how we focused on that issue in the past, for example in 2012, the figure was 30%, so in that two year period between 26% and 30% of deaths on our road were of men and women under the age of 25 years.  Half of all the drivers killed at present range from 16 years to 35 years.</p><p>These are the statistics that lead me to believe that the change in this measure was correct.  As I have said already it was always an offence for a learner driver to drive unaccompanied, but as the Senator said, the recent change was that penalty points were applied to the offence.  I have to be unambiguous, I believe this is the correct course of action to look after a young group of drivers across the country.  I fully appreciate the fact that it has different consequences for people who are living in rural areas as opposed to those who live in urban areas.  We will keep all of these measures under review.  I do not want to signal this measure out in particular because I do not want to weaken our commitment to the implementation of it in any way.  I will certainly look at this measure as I will look at the other recent changes and look at the impact it is having on road safety and any consequences it could have.</p></speech>

The word &quot;Aonad&quot; is the Irish translation of unity, which is indicative of the centre being a resource for all the people in the area.  The overall objective of Aonad Resource Centre has been the empowerment of local people by providing supports and services which meet their needs in an accessible, respectful, family friendly and confidential manner.  Essentially the centre aims to improve the quality of life for those living in the wider Ballygar area.  It provides adult education and training such as yoga, English for migrant workers, computer skills etc.  The staff have also facilitated the establishment of new community and voluntary groups, such as the parent and toddler group who meet a number of times a week, the active retirement association and so on.  The centre is also actively linked with the local adult training centre, schools cluster programme, Ballygar MABS outreach service, youth services centre, community playgroup and social services, a number of which have been cut back in recent years.  The centre had an up-to-date information until recently but what has happened is that the Aonad resource centre has been closed in the past two weeks by the board of the company.  </p><p>Ballygar has been hit by a number of closures, with the VEC training centre, the Youth Work Ireland youth centre and the community welfare office closing.  This has resulted in a huge loss of services and revenue to this rural area and the region cannot withstand the closure of the resource centre.  I am told there are more than 400 local signatories to a petition against the closure of the centre, that there are letters from the doctor's clinic, the public health nurse and the local supermarkets to name but a few who are supporting the retention of this centre.</p><p>Through its main funding body Tusla - through Tusla's community services programme funded by Pobal and other grants awarded - Aonad brings in up to &euro;250,000 into the area.  It is an important economic initiative for the area.  If Aonad Resource Centre is allowed to close there will be a loss of seven full-time jobs and other jobs losses through the T&uacute;s, F&Aacute;S and intern programmes.</p><p>I appreciate there may be local issues with the board of the company in question.  What people have asked me to raise with the Minister is that the services that are being funded by Tusla and other State organisations be continued in whatever way is possible.  I understand there is a question of whether the company will fold in the next couple of weeks.  I have been asked if there is a possibility that the programmes that are being funded, which are important in the local area, could be transferred as undertakings to another organisation, or a new organisation be set up to continue the good work that has been done to date because the community is very concerned that it will lose the continuity of all the good work that has been done since 2003.</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag tn&uacute;th go m&oacute;r lena fhreagra.</p></speech>

In 2014 the agency has provided funding in excess of &euro;12 million to support the work of these centres.  Family resource centres, funded by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provide a range of universal and targeted services and development opportunities that address the needs of children and families.  Family support forms an integral and central part of the remit of the Child and Family Agency.  The establishment of the agency, a key priority for Government, brings together family support services which previously were the responsibility of two State organisations - the HSE and the Family Support Agency.  It provides a platform for better integration of these services.</p><p>The issue raised by the Senator relates to the level of funding provided by the Child and Family Agency to Aonad Resource Centre.  The centre has been in receipt of funding under the family resource programme since 2002.  The budget allocation to the centre for 2013 was &euro;140,220 with &euro;138,400 available in 2014.  I am advised by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency that in September 2014, the voluntary board of directors took a decision to close the centre.</p><p>Arising from the board's decision, the Child and Family Agency undertook a review last month of the operation of the centre.  One of the key conclusions from the review was that Aonad Resource Centre Ltd., was not functioning as a fit and proper family resource centre for the benefit of the whole community.  I understand that the current directors of the company are in agreement with this view.</p><p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has accepted the decision of the voluntary board of directors to close the centre.  The board has advised Tusla that the centre closed on 1 December 2014, as the Senator has pointed out.   Tusla has indicated that if a future application is received in regard to service provision in the area, it will be considered in the context of the agency's overall approach to the commissioning of services.</p> <p>The Child and Family Agency will continue to support the work of the many family resource centres around the country in providing valuable support services to families in need of support.</p></speech>

There is a concern about the continuity of services particular to the local community.  To ensure continuity, will the Minister ask Tusla to engage with the local community to determine whether the latter can put in place an alternative structure into which the projects that have been funded by the Department to date can be transferred as soon as possible?</p></speech>

Like me, the Senator knows of certain issues that there is no need to go into in detail now, but all agree that Aonad was right to close.  I share the concerns of the Senator and others about ensuring that services continue.  We would look on any proposal to reinstate them under a more fit-for-purpose organisation in a favourable light.</p></speech>

Will he outline the action that is being taken to prevent the use of performance enhancing drugs in greyhound racing?  What measures will be put in place to implement regulatory controls in that regard?  The recent Indecon report highlighted many problems with governance and financial issues in the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  However, the greatest flaw highlighted was that of the prevalence of positive drug tests in racing greyhounds.</p><p>The use of drugs in any sport brings the reputation of the game into disrepute.  It is vital that this issue be dealt with in order to restore confidence in greyhound racing, given its importance to Ireland as an industry.  The IGB employs 10,000 people and provides indirect employment for thousands more.  There are 17 greyhound tracks across the country and more than 26,000 people go racing every week.  It is important that the integrity of the industry be upheld.</p><p>The Indecon report recommends that rigorous procedures and processes for regulatory control must be implemented.  The current legislation and regulations on the provision of integrity services are not good enough.  When will more stringent legislation be in place?  Indecon's analysis of the divergence between the number of positive tests and adverse findings has shown that this situation was in part due to previous decisions of the control committee, which ruled to dismiss a significant number of positive tests on the basis that, in its opinion, certain internal laboratory protocols concerning storage and temperature were not reflected in the handling of test samples before they reached the laboratory and that there were deficiencies in respect of the samples.  Undoubtedly, this has had a negative effect on the perception of the industry.  This practice had to be stopped.  All processes in the testing of banned substances need to be transparent.  We need to determine whether better testing facilities are available, results need to be publicised and greater penalties need to be imposed.  Only then can we restore credibility to the greyhound industry.  Will the Minister of State outline what he will do about this situation and how soon can we see the Indecon report's recommendations put in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-12-16a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1089" speakername="Tom Hayes" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121600055#JJJ00600"><p>I thank Senator Comiskey for the opportunity to attend the Seanad and to brief it on where we are as regards the Indecon report.</p><p>The control, administration and regulation of the greyhound industry are the responsibility of Bord na gCon under the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.  Two statutory committees of Bord na gCon, namely, the control committee and the control appeals committee, are central to the regulatory process.  These committees operate independently of Bord na gCon.</p><p>When appointed as Minister of State in 2013, I identified the need to carry out a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon.  The organisation faced major challenges.  In this regard, I arranged for consultants to be commissioned to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise the commercial income of Bord na gCon, with a view to assisting the greyhound racing industry in reaching its potential.</p><p>On 7 July 2014, I published a report compiled by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the completion of its &quot;Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon&quot;.  The terms of reference for Indecon included the requirement to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems operated by Bord na gCon with regard to the regulation of the industry and to make recommendations on any change required.</p><p>The Indecon report made 27 recommendations aimed at addressing the challenges facing the board.  Eleven recommendations related to regulatory controls.  These are as follows: the Minister would appoint the members of the statutory independent greyhound racing control committee and control appeal committee, which would constitute a major change; rigorous procedures and processes for regulatory control must be consistently implemented; mandatory penalties including exclusion orders and disqualification orders would be imposed for breaches of regulations; regulations and procedures should be introduced to ensure effective enforcement of penalties; Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club should be able to serve exclusion orders and disqualification orders independently; off-track testing for prohibited substances would be implemented, representing another major change; data on the number of tests undertaken, the number of positive tests and the number of adverse findings would be published; all adverse findings would be published within predefined periods subject to rules for adjournments and appeals; consideration of laboratory testing would be transferred to independent laboratories over time to ensure economies of scale; licencees to disclose on an annual basis any adverse finding and any information regarding matters under investigation as part of their licence applications; and formal information-sharing arrangements to take place with enforcement agencies, including Customs and Excise and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Bord na gCon has indicated that it accepts all of the report's recommendations, including those dealing with the regulatory aspects.  It submitted its response to the report to me on 10 October 2014.  This included an action plan that contained timelines for implementing the various recommendations.  The action plan is published in the news section on the Bord na gCon website for all to see.  Bord na gCon has indicated to my Department that it is on track to meet the majority of its objectives.</p><p>In the area of regulatory reform, Bord na gCon has confirmed to me that it is involved in a public consultation process with stakeholders with a view to putting in place legislation that will enable the publication of details of all adverse findings after positive results have been returned by the laboratory and prior to consideration of such cases by the control committee.</p> <p>It is envisaged that the information to be published will include the identity of the greyhounds, the owners and the trainers involved.  In a move towards greater transparency, Bord na gCon has recently confirmed a finding of positive results after the analytical phase and prior to the hearing of the control committee.  The complete details in regard to the owners and the greyhounds will be available when the control committee and the appeals committee, if appropriate, have concluded their deliberations in regard to findings which are upheld.</p><p>Bord na gCon has embarked in a stakeholders' consultation process on regulatory reform and it has commenced a review of standard operating procedures in the areas of sampling at race night operations and also in regard to track maintenance and race track security.  It has begun formulating new policies and procedures to enhance regulation, welfare and engagement with stakeholders.</p><p>Bord na gCon has launched a review into anti-doping and medication controls under the direction of an international expert in this area.  Following the review, Bord na gCon will consider amendments to legislation, modify practices and policies, as appropriate, and assess whether any improvement can be made to the current structures in place.  The objective is to ensure Bord na gCon will conform with the best international practices.</p><p>Bord na gCon launched the first phase of off-track testing for prohibited substances, like testing at trials.  It launched an online resource centre to facilitate the enhanced publication of testing information.  It has commenced interviews with licensed applicants, with a view to attaching conditions to licences, where necessary; a process of information sharing with other regulatory bodies; development of intelligence-led strategies in various areas, in particular, anti-doping; a process to introduce mandatory penalties, including exclusion orders and disqualification orders, for breaches of regulation; and regulatory reform concerning prohibited substances, in particular, working on developing an improved regulatory definition of prohibited substances as well as non-exhaustive lists of prohibited substances.</p><p>I have been assured by Bord na gCon of its commitment to ensuring that the regulatory system within the industry is aligned with best international practices founded on integrity, education and transparency among all stakeholders.  In order to augment this regulatory system, Bord na gCon has appointed a director of racing, governance and compliance.  Furthermore, I have appointed a person to the board who has particular expertise in veterinary and related matters.  Officials from my Department have already commenced an examination of the greyhound legislation and are liaising  closely with Bord na gCon to identify any legislative changes required to underpin a robust and effective system of regulation, including the appointment of members of the control committee and the controls appeals committee by the Minister.  </p><p>The greyhound sector makes a significant contribution to the Irish economy and I am confident that implementation of the Indecon report can help to ensure Bord na gCon can continue to make a significant contribution to its development into the future for the 10,000 people who work in it.  This industry has gone through extreme difficulty but I have no doubt that following the very timely Indecon report, it industry will last into the future.</p><p>On 19 February 2014, during a debate on the greyhound industry in the Seanad, I made reference to Mr. Brendan Moore, a former member of the board of Bord na gCon.  I advised the House that Mr. Moore had written to me and told me that day that he was not fit to be on the board.  In fact, I had received a letter from Mr. Moore dated 21 July 2013 in the course of which he acknowledged that he did not have all the skills or experience necessary to turn a company around that was so indebted.  </p><p>I went on to state that for a six-month period, Mr. Moore had not attended any of the meetings of the board of Bord na gCon and indicated that when some moves were being made within the Department to effect his removal from the board, I received a letter of resignation from Mr. Moore prior to Christmas.  In fact, I met Mr Moore on 25 July 2013, subsequent to receiving his letter of 21 July.  Mr. Moore's letter, confirming his resignation from the board of Bord na gCon, was dated and sent on 22 January 2014 and that being so, I obviously did not receive it prior to Christmas, as I stated in the Seanad.  I acknowledge that statements made by me to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 19 February 2014 were not factually correct.  I express my regrets to Mr. Moore for that and I am happy to correct the record.</p></speech>

Ennis in County Clare beat off stiff competition from about six or seven other towns to win that competition and it became an IT capital, certainly of Ireland.  The intention was that an IT hub would develop in the town of Ennis and its environs.  That cost the people of Ennis quite a lot of money in that businesses spent up to &pound;100,000 campaigning and preparing for that.</p><p>The upshot was that every home in Ennis received a computer but that was not all.  Job creation was promised, as was a third level institution specialising in computers and IT, but the latter never happened in spite of numerous political commitments and promises that Ennis would be considered as a location for an institute of technology.  I do not have much hope that it will happen in the future.  </p><p>What happened was that Limerick Institute of Technology set up a pilot campus, or a sub-campus, in Ennis in the old museum.  It offered a higher certificate in business computing - level 6.  I would not be very familiar with the specifics of that but what I am familiar with is that students attended first and second year of that degree course in Ennis and then transferred to Limerick for third and fourth year.  That resulted in access to education for a cohort of people who would not otherwise have had access to education, in particular mature students, possibly housewives and house husbands, in the economic climate that existed, where people found themselves being made redundant or unemployed and who may not have had access to a car and the financial support to travel to Limerick to do a course.  The numbers were small and it conditioned the students so that when they moved into year three and to a larger campus, they were well-conditioned and well-prepared to successfully complete the course.</p><p>The facts speak for themselves in that a number of students who went through the Ennis campus became students of the year and received first class honours degrees.  In the Minister of State's county, there is a similar campus.  The numbers there are a much smaller and it has not had the same success, possibly through no fault of its own, but that campus will remain open.</p> <p>What disturbs me about this is that it has been closed and the course has been withdrawn with unilateral effect.  Those currently in second year will be able to complete that year, but those in first year will not be able to complete their second year.  They will have to move into Limerick to do their second, third and fourth years, which they did not budget or account for.</p><p>Even more disturbing is the fact that we are seeing yet again the centralisation of education.  No respect or due diligence is being paid to providing accessible, higher education in towns like Ennis.  It would not break the bank if Limerick Institute of Technology were to leave in place this course, which has proven to be successful.  It seems irrational and illogical that anyone could make a budgetary case for getting rid of the course.  In fact, they should not only retain the course but should also be offering more courses in Ennis.</p><p>Institutes of technology have a responsibility to provide facilities and educational opportunities in smaller towns such as Ennis, Tipperary Town, Nenagh and Clonmel.  That is part of their remit.  They were given enormous development resources by the EU on the understanding that they had a regional remit.  They started off as being regional technology colleges and then became institutes of technology, but they seem to have forgotten their responsibility to be regional as well as providing a holistic education, access to which is evenly spread to towns within their nucleus.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State will have something positive to say about this.  It seems nonsensical to close down this successful course.</p></speech>

I apologise that the Minister for Education and Skills cannot be here as she has to attend other functions this evening.</p><p>At the outset, it is important to note that institutes of technology are autonomous institutions within the meaning of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006.  This means that the management of their academic affairs, including the selection and delivery of courses, are matters for individual institutions and not for the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>All institutes of technology receive a block grant from the Higher Education Authority and it is a matter for each institution to determine how it is allocated internally, in line with defined needs and priorities.  The Limerick Institute of Technology Ennis Learning Centre, formerly Ennis Regional Learning Centre, is a third-level outreach centre based in Ennis, County Clare.</p><p>The centre was founded in 2009 as a Shannon Consortium initiative.  The Shannon Consortium is an education partnership between the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, Mary Immaculate College and the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  The centre was funded under the Strategic Innovation Fund Cycle 2 initiative which was administered by the Higher Education Authority.  The aim was to provide flexible access to higher education for the people of County Clare.  The higher certificate in business computing level 6 was delivered under this funding.</p><p>However, all funding for Strategic Innovation Fund stand-alone projects concluded at the end of 2011 and both the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College ceased their involvement at that time.  In September 2011, the Ennis Learning Centre was taken over by Limerick Institute of Technology.  The Institute is reviewing its involvement in Ennis in light of decreasing student numbers and high costs.  For example LIT must rent the building and pay for a full-time administrator.  LIT has reported that the intake to the higher certificate in business computing level 6 in 2014 was only 16 students.  I understand from the Higher Education Authority that LIT will continue to provide support to the current cohort of students who will complete their two-year course in 2016.  The higher certificate in business computing is offered by LIT as a CAO-listed programme on their main campus in Limerick.</p><p>More generally, it is important to say that the LIT provides a vital role in providing higher education on a regional basis, including to learners from Clare.  LIT has over 2,000 students from Clare enrolled on various programmes on their Limerick campus.  LIT works closely with the second-level system and with post-leaving certificate/education and training board schools throughout Clare to ensure their programmes meet their demand.</p><p>In addition, there are excellent student pathways for learners with diverse backgrounds and age profiles.  Servicing the needs of students from Clare will continue to be a strategic priority for LIT at its main campus in Limerick.</p></speech>

He has been given a script and must respond accordingly.  What I find most curious, however, is the sloping shoulders approach whereby the institutes are independent.  The bottom line is that they receive a block grant from taxpayers' money.  I note LIT's commitment, but access to education is important.  There are practical issues such as being able to commute, access for those without cars, and the problems facing people who cannot afford to travel to and from Limerick.</p><p>If the Minister for Education and Skills and her Department are that removed from running institutes of technology, do they no longer appoint people to the boards or governing bodies?  Are there ministerial appointees on the governing bodies of institutes of technology and, more specifically, Limerick Institute of Technology?</p><p>Based on what the Minister of State has read out, one would have to suggest that ministerial appointees to the LIT board are redundant and should not be there.  Maybe they are not there.  Perhaps the Minister of State in his own good time could convey that point to the Minister of Education and Skills.  I want to know what ministerial appointees on the LIT board are doing.  Do they have any interest in County Clare at all?</p><p>As regards the high costs argument, was any effort made-----</p></speech>

I can understand where they are coming from.  I will make a point about the building, however.  Senator Conway is active politically and knows what is happening in Ennis.  He should therefore try to locate cheaper accommodation in that town.  It is costly to have 16 students in a big building like that, which accommodated larger numbers in previous years.</p><p>If the Senator could come back with a cheaper building, maybe then we could talk to the Minister for Education and Skills.  I assure the Senator that she would channel that information to her Department.  That would be a practical way of trying to do something for them.</p></speech>
