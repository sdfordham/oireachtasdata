    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600002#A00500"><p>I regret, as my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, mentioned yesterday, the fact that we have a light work programme in the House this week.</p> <p>Today we have the Order of Business followed by an address, albeit a very important one to which we are all looking forward, by Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP.  As Senator David Norris rightly pointed out yesterday, the Order Paper was never so full of legislation as it currently is, both Private Members' Bills and Government legislation, yet we are presented with a superficial filling of the schedule of business for the week.  Moreover, the Leader has, apparently, ignored our calls for a debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on the report published this week which has caused great concern throughout the country.  The newspaper headlines today refer to the issue I raised yesterday in the House, namely, that in the west there are the lowest response times in providing cardiac care.  The new hospital groupings will do nothing to enhance the north-west region in the context of the provision of the much celebrated clinical programmes.  That is borne out by the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>which tells us that people in the north west are at a direct disadvantage when it comes to cardiac care and cancer services.  This is merely the latest addition to the litany of broken pre-election promises with which people have become all too familiar under the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.</p><p> In this context, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to include a debate on the announcements made this week on health care provision.  The Minister must come to the House to explain how centralising management and budgeting for the entire north west in Galway will in any way enhance services in that region.  I note that my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne,  has tabled a motion for debate on the Adjournment today on the future provision of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The Senator undoubtedly recalls that before the general election, the Minister attended a rally of more than 10,000 people in the town and met GPs, consultants and stakeholders in the area to deliver a guarantee that the accident and emergency service would not be withdrawn.  This week, however, we learned that the reorganisation of the delivery of hospital care would include ridding Navan of that service.  In fairness to the Leader, his political lobbying is evidently of sufficient effect to ensure there was no downgrading of Waterford Regional Hospital.  In the case of Navan, on the other hand, the sum of the electoral parts of the Fine Gael Party did not, apparently, match the Leader's potent input in influencing the report on hospital groupings.</p><p> What are the people of Navan, the north west and other areas in which services are effectively being downgraded to do?  The centralisation of budgeting and management will do nothing other than exacerbate the already difficult situation at certain locations, including the accident and emergency service in Navan and cardiac and cancer services in the north west.  In response to my questions in this regard at the briefing on Tuesday evening Professor Higgins could only observe that in the fullness of time the road between Galway and Sligo would be upgraded.  Is that what we are reduced to?  The brightest minds in the country are saying that for 20% of the population, comprising the largest geographical area among the proposed hospital groupings, there is no need to worry about cardiac response times as reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>today - response times which suggest it will be a case of moving closer to a centre or risking almost certain death in a cardiac emergency - because the road will be upgraded in the fullness of time.  That is what the people of the north west are left with.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House today to answer these points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600003#B00200"><p>I welcome the useful debate we had last night on the Bill introduced by Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn setting out proposals for Seanad reform.  Their Bill and the legislation brought forward by Senator John Crown have passed Second Stage and been added to the Order Paper.  It is a welcome development that these proposals will now inform the debate leading up to the referendum to be held later this year.</p><p>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the report published yesterday by the Garda Commissioner on the investigation into alleged irregularities in the cancellation of penalty points?  This issue has been the subject of a great deal of debate in the other House and various media.  It is very important and welcome that this investigation was undertaken.  It is essential in terms of public confidence in the Garda that we have proper oversight and transparency procedures in respect of any such process of discretionary decision-making.  The very serious allegations made are not borne out in the report, but it does raise several questions.  I assume the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will examine the report, but we should also have a debate on it in this House.  In the light of the allegations, the process that gave rise to the report and the report itself, Transparency Ireland has called for a review of internal whistleblower procedures within the Garda.  Certainly, the treatment of the whistleblowers and the extent of the allegations made by them are worthy of further consideration.  In short, a number of serious issues remain to be debated arising from the report.</p><p>Tomorrow, 17 May, is International Day of Action Against Homophobia, IDAHO.  I understand that in Britain various Government buildings will be flying the rainbow flag to mark the occasion.  Here in Ireland Dublin City Council flies the flag during Pride Week, but we might consider ensuring in future years that as many State buildings as possible will do so on IDAHO Day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600003#B00300"><p>I join Senator Ivana Bacik in welcoming the splendid debate held last night.  It is a significant development that the two Bills are now on the Order Paper and can be fully debated in the House, with the co-operation of the Leader.  It is regrettable, however, that this significant development did not make the news.  All we had were a few rather pallid interviews and a discussion on &quot;The Late Debate&quot;.  There was no participation by any Senator in that discussion and the participants did not seem to know what they were talking about.  One person from the other House stated the Bill was defective because it would require constitutional change.  That is completely wrong.  The Bill was deliberately framed - it has the fingerprints of Joe O'Toole all over it - such that its provisions would not require any constitutional change.  As we all know, it was the legislation that followed the re-establishment of the Upper House in 1937 which weakened this forum and corrupted it politically at the behest of the political parties.</p><p>  As a result of all this misinformation and the deviousness of the Government in this matter and in light of the excellent leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which I commend to colleagues, I am issuing a challenge to the Taoiseach.  I will be happy, as father of the House, to debate the matter with him in any public forum of his choosing, whether it be the Mansion House, in Government Buildings, in the AV room or elsewhere, and in the full glare of the media.  I will answer any question put to me and challenge him to prove his case to the people.  As it stands, he is abusing his position as Taoiseach to launch one-sided campaigns full of misinformation.  I challenge him to meet me in debate.  Let us have it out and let the truth be told.  I will be happy to expose what I consider to be his mendacious position.<br /><i>The Irish Times</i> today also carries an excellent letter from the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, in which he raises a point that I have made repeatedly in this House on a particular difficulty in the proposed legislation on abortion.  As a very pro-choice person, I find it obscene that a child who would be, to use that horrible word, &quot;viable&quot; outside the womb, could be safely delivered and easily live, could, under these provisions, possibly be deliberately killed.  That is what is being suggested, because there is no time limit for terminations.  The Archbishop is correct in this.  This awful prospect is a consequence of the people who call themselves pro-life shoving an amendment that was disastrous, sectarian and wrong-headed into the Constitution.  There must be clarification on this issue.</p><p>  There was understandable anger on the part of a very conservative group when excrement was left outside the door of its office on Capel Street some time ago.  Will those same people condemn the attacks on Deputy Regina Doherty who was extremely courageous when she spoke on television during the week about the threats she had received as a consequence of her intention to vote in favour of the Government legislation?  She has been warned that her home will be burned down with her family in it, which is absolutely unconscionable.  I want to hear some concern expressed for the Deputy by those people who have loudly condemned the actions of virulent pro-choice activists.</p><p>  I am very disappointed at the lack of progress made in the establishment of the national children's hospital.  I supported the holding of a proper inquiry on a point of principle and accepted the decision to locate the new facility at St. James's Hospital rather than the Mater Hospital.  However, absolutely nothing has happened since.</p> <p>Ms Norah Casey who was on the board said on Newstalk that there was no board and no design team and that there had bee no site clearance.  The date has been put back again, this time until 2019.  It was supposed to be done to celebrate 2016.  This is a disaster.  Perhaps the Mater hospital site, on which tens of millions of euro have been spent, should be considered again.</p><p>I agree with what has been said about IDAHO Day, which is very important.  Tomorrow is also the anniversary of the arrest, detention and mistreatment of the leaders of the Baha'i movement in Iran.  We should also remember that event.</p></speech>

I also hope we will also a successful outcome to the Croke Park II negotiations.</p><p>A few weeks ago the Department of Health issued Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025, a framework for action aimed at improving our health and well-being in the coming generation.  It sets out a clear vision of a country where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health and well-being to his or her full potential.  It is important for this House to discuss this comprehensive document which is a roadmap and a framework for the next decade.  I ask the Leader to schedule such a debate.</p><p>I was tempted to raise this issue after attending an enjoyable function in the Mansion House last night.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach was also present at the celebration.  I refer to the launch of a passport and a series of stamps to mark O'Sullivan Beare's historic walk from the Beara Peninsula to County Leitrim in 1603.  A greenway that straddles ten counties and four provinces has been developed along a route of more than 600 km following real collaboration between State agencies, farmers and many communities.  It was a really special event.  We want to promote this greenway and all other greenways that have real and tangible benefits for our communities.  They offer recreational opportunities to young and old alike, connect people in communities, provide major tourist attractions, bring much-needed accommodation and food business into rural communities and promote healthy exercise and outdoor activity.  I pay tribute to everybody involved in this fantastic project in all the communities along the route.  I refer particularly to Mr. Jim O'Sullivan from the Beara Peninsula who has done tremendous work and those involved in many communities in my own county of Galway from the bridge at Portumna through Aughrim, Ahascragh and Ballinasloe and up to Glinsk.  This is a real opportunity for us to do something positive.  It is a really good news story which I am very pleased to raise this morning and ask for it to be promoted.  It dovetails nicely with the Government framework launched recently.</p></speech>

That will not happen until the people make their decision.  If they decide to abolish the Seanad, we will have to vacate this Chamber.  I do not see why we are vacating it next Tuesday to accommodate any joint committee dealing with any issue.  I register my protest in this regard and absolutely resent what is being done.</p><p>The Leader of the House proposed some time ago that the Order of Business in this House would be covered live on television.  Has any progress been made in that regard?  The coverage given to the Seanad on &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; is excellent.  A very balanced approach is taken to all Members.  Each side of the House is given due recognition when there is a report on the Order of Business or other business dealt with.  While I have not timed it, I would definitely say the Seanad is not given the same percentage of coverage given to the D&aacute;il.  Given that both Houses are equal in the Oireachtas at this point, they should receive the same amount of coverage.  As &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; is broadcast so late at night - it is usually broadcast between 11 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. - I suggest it be rebroadcast the following morning also.  According to figures released some time ago, approximately 60,000 people watch &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;, quite a high percentage.  The point is that the public would have a better opportunity to view it if it were broadcast the following day also.</p></speech>

I have no personal worries that the matter will be one that cannot be addressed.</p><p>I refer to the positive economic forecast issued by the ESRI today.  It is to be noted that the economy is forecast to grow by 1.8% this year and 2.7% next year.  This far exceeds the gross expectations for our EU colleagues and is to be welcomed.  It demonstrates that the economy is back on the road to recovery.  I also note the comments by the ESRI that there is a significant and serious problem regarding lending to the SME sector.  I ask the Leader if we could have the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, here for a debate on the matter.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has come here on many occasions.  In this instance, we need the Minister to come to discuss the inability of the country's banking sector to serve the needs of the people.</p><p>I have every sympathy for Senators on the other side of the House who have called for the Minister for Health to come here for a debate.  However, I have no doubt that it would be technically impossible for him to come today.  I concur that he should be invited at the earliest possible opportunity.  When he is here, perhaps he might address an issue that has been raised by an eminent medical professor.  I refer to the inappropriate billing of VHI and other insurers for patients on trolleys in the State hospital system.  At a time when people who are in genuine distress are giving up their private health insurance, or are going without essentials in order to pay for such insurance, it is outrageous to think private insurers are being charged for what should be a State service.  If the professor's suggestion is accurate, it amounts to nothing less than fraudulent practice on the part of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600004#C01500"><p>Obviously, substantial attention has been paid to the issue of breast cancer genetics in recent days.  I would like the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health the current circumstances that pertain with respect to genetic testing for patients in Ireland.  Most breast cancers are not genetic.  A small minority of breast cancer cases are caused by well recognised genes which can be diagnosed on the basis of a blood test.  In a typical scenario, when a doctor takes a careful and detailed history from a patient with breast cancer, it will emerge that there is a substantial or suspicious history of breast or other cancers in the family which would indicate that the person in question might be an appropriate candidate for genetic testing.  This has important health implications for the patient.  Not only does she need treatment for the cancer she has, but she is also at substantial risk of developing new cancers which can be prevented by making appropriate, albeit difficult, decisions about preventive surgery.</p> <p>As well as that, their close family, their sisters and daughters, have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene which causes breast cancer, if they have the gene.  It is important to know this.  It is not a tremendously common problem but it is an important one.  If it is managed correctly, lives can be saved and the State can be spared costs.</p><p>Approximately one in 1,000 people carries the gene and approximately 5% of breast cancers are caused by these genes.  The problem is as follows.  There is a 12-month waiting list to get a genetic assessment and the only statutory unit in the country that is doing this for public patients is the one situated in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, run by an extremely gifted medical geneticist, Professor Andrew Green.  Professor Green, with great vision, set up the service, not with health service money, but with money from research, and from that defaulted into running a clinical service which is, I would say, grotesquely underfunded.</p><p>I suspect there is &quot;grotesque underfunding&quot; fatigue when people hear me talk about the health service.  Parenthetically, I do not believe it is in general underfunded as I believe it is mal-funded, but this is a case where it is clearly underfunded.  However, lest I be seen as somebody else who is whinging and shroud-waving about a deficiency in a health service which is full of deficiencies, in a public service which is underfunded, in a country which is broke, I make the point that this decision is costing money.  What happens to the patients while they are on the waiting lists for a year?  They are getting multiple expensive MRI scans, gynaecology tests, specialist ultrasounds of their ovaries and extra evaluations, but, not only that, their extended family may also be getting these while they are waiting that one year for the blood test.  I have no doubt about this.  The blood test has come down substantially in cost and it is now several hundred euro rather than &euro;1,000 to get one test done.  Clearly, part of the bottleneck is that the staff in Crumlin do not have national specialist unit funding and this is being absorbed in the general costs of that hospital which, as we know, has had its allocation cut in recent years despite its national status in so many areas.</p><p>I can understand how we all have to grit our teeth when we see deficiencies in the health services, but it makes no sense to impose a deficiency which is costing us money.  I would ask that this be brought to the Minister's attention.  I understand the Taoiseach made reference to genetic testing in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  When the decisions are being made, I ask that it be taken into account that there are real cost savings to be made.</p><p>I am honoured to make this speech on the one-year anniversary of the death of a good friend and patient of mine, Geoff Prendergast, whose son, Joe Prendergast, at the age of ten and as part of his mourning process for losing his father so sadly, has just published several wonderful children's books.  The proceeds from these will be used for cancer research through the CCRT.  I would like the record to reflect this brave young boy, Joe Prendergast, and his Dad.</p></speech>

It would be a false economy not to ensure this test is made available for people who need it.  As Senator Crown said, the numbers are not huge.</p><p>I stand to raise the issue of the new advances in stem cell research, details of which were published yesterday.  We have no legislation at all in Ireland on stem cell research.  It has been said that when autopsies were first mooted, they were very controversial, and the fact science will overtake legislation again in this country is not a good thing.  I ask for a debate on the whole issue of stem cell research.  It is not, as one reads in some newspapers, human cloning, so-called reproductive cloning or anything that would turn people off it straight away.  This stem cell research is a major scientific development designed to produce replacement tissue for transplant operations to ensure that dysfunctional or damaged organs can be repaired or replaced.  It is a huge breakthrough which will help to alleviate many diseases, such as Alzheimer's, blindness, MS and a huge litany of other diseases.</p><p>I am not saying we should either adopt it or not, but that we should discuss it in this Chamber.  Dr. Stephen Sullivan, chief scientific officer of the Irish Stem Cell Foundation, has said he does not even know which Department is dealing with it or could deal with it, and that it is going from Billy to Jack.  Is it the Department of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, or the Department of Health which is responsible?  Is it a science and technology or health issue?  I want to see a debate on the elements of this issue and I ask that the correct Minister would take that debate.  I would like to see legislation introduced in this area.</p></speech>

I will call for an amendment to the Order of Business on a pertinent and immediate issue.  I was contacted by concerned farming representatives yesterday.  While we have had a debate on the fodder crisis, there is an immediate issue in that 3,000 bales of fodder are sitting in French ports that cannot be moved because of an impasse with the French authorities.  There appears to be some kind of an industrial dispute going on and only 120 bales of the 3,000 are being released to be brought to Ireland.  The farming community are very happy with the quality of the material that is coming through but something must be done immediately to try to get this issue resolved.  Animals are dying on the land, which is not to be over-dramatic about it.</p><p>The farming representatives have asked us to call on the Leader to have the Minister come to the House immediately to raise this issue with him.  They want him to use his position as the chair of the Council of Ministers to talk to his French counterparts to find whether there is any way to have this impasse resolved in order to get this badly-needed fodder released immediately.</p><p>They are also asking when the Government will appoint a Minister of State.  They feel the Minister is doing great work but he is no superman, and he has to deal with the CAP negotiations, the CFP negotiations, burger-gate, the fodder crisis and so on.  They feel a Minister of State should be appointed immediately to take some of the pressure off the Minister and that this Minister of State would possibly focus fully on the fodder crisis, which is an ongoing crisis.</p><p>This is an immediate issue that needs to be dealt with today or tomorrow.  We need to bring it to the attention of the Minister as quickly as possible because, if this continues over the weekend, we are going to come back next week with a lot more cattle dead in the fields.</p></speech>

It showed that the unemployment rate is starting to fall, although gradually, and also that employment is gradually rising.  It also showed that we have had population growth of 350,000.  I want to commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on noting this early in his Ministry and for providing the necessary schools across the country to deal with the issue.</p><p>The report also notes that, since it started in July 2011, almost 15,500 people have participated in the JobBridge scheme and 61% of those have gained employment within five months of their internships.  Some 81% of participants have expressed satisfaction with the scheme.  It is worth noting that the private sector provided 11,000 positions for participants, with the public sector providing 3,500 and the voluntary sector 1,500.  I ask the Leader to call on the Minister to encourage the public sector, which includes local authorities and the various semi-State bodies, to participate more in this scheme, increase their numbers and allow graduates the opportunity for work experience, given 61% of participants have gained employment within five months of completing the scheme.  This is a good scheme.  The Minister should require the public sector to engage more in it to ensure graduates can get the necessary experience to put on their CVs in order to get employment.</p><p>Senator Leyden has put down a good marker in regard to the use of this Chamber.  It reminds me of a time I went into a county council meeting to discover the staff had taken over the council chamber for their own purposes, although they did not stay there for too long.  The primary use of this Chamber is for the workings of the Seanad.</p> <p>That is what it should be used for and I hope that will be noted and that what Senator Leyden said will be taken on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600006#E00200"><p>I also support Senator Leyden's comments.  It is unacceptable that this Chamber, which is for the primary use of passing legislation and debate, should be handed over to a House committee, important as its work may be.  There are other avenues that can be explored in this House and there is a question mark over the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because it seems this matter was discussed in lodge and a decision was taken without any reference to the remaining Members of this House.  I am seriously concerned about the way the House is being downgraded.  There is now a growing trend in the media to highlight legislation in the other House months after it has been passed and debated in this House.  There have been two examples in the past few weeks, first, the Bill on the Irish citizens who fought for the Allied cause in the Second World War.  Not only was this a Seanad Bill but it was extensively debated in this House on all sides.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence was present and made his comments but there was very little coverage of this in the media.  When it went into the D&aacute;il, the Minister recycled everything that he had said in this House and it received extraordinary coverage, in the print and electronic media.  The second example occurred in the past few days and the Leader quite correctly corrected me yesterday although as soon as I sat down I realised that I had made a mistake about the debate on the report of the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture on offshore oil and gas.  It had slipped my memory in the immediate reaction that the debate had taken place here.  Once again, the media focused on the debate in the D&aacute;il where the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources recycled everything that he had said in this House.  There was an extensive debate on that report in this House a year ago and it was not covered.  This is a matter of great concern.</p><p>I challenge the media to do its job more effectively, to do a little bit more research and to be more aware of what goes on in this House instead of making itself look stupid because that is what it is.  To most Senators the media looks foolish when it starts recycling stories that appeared months ago or that started in this House.  I wish the media would cop itself on and do its job a bit more efficiently.  That is what it is supposed to do instead of picking up stupid old stories coming out of this House to denigrate it.</p></speech>

It is a great walk and takes approximately two weeks to complete at one go or one can do it in stages.  It takes in ten or 11 counties, finishing in Leitrim and Cavan.</p><p>We have another project in north Leitrim which I have mentioned before, the Green Way, following the old railway track from Sligo to Enniskillen.  Work has started on it and we can develop it.  I see the future of this country in tourism, particularly encouraging people into the west.</p><p>Agriculture is also important for the country's future, which brings me to the fodder crisis which is still a serious problem.  I received many calls last night and this morning because a lot of hay has been held up in France and we have difficulty bringing it across.  I call for that to be speeded up.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on putting &euro;2 million in place but there is a difficulty for trucks carrying it.  They must have curtain sides but boat owners do not want hay debris in the boats.  We have to sort out that problem.</p></speech>

I hope the Leader accepts the amendment.  If he is not in a position to do so he might at least pass on Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's concerns to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and maybe arrange a meeting between the Senator and the Minister if possible because this is an important issue.</p><p>I do not often support Senator Leyden's statements on the Order of Business but today he raised an important issue about the use of this House.  I do not believe that this Chamber should be used by other committees of the Oireachtas when we are due to sit.  It is fair enough for organisations to use the House on Mondays and Fridays when we do not sit but to interfere with the workings of this House is unacceptable and disrespectful.  It seems to be part of a growing trend over recent months of groups using this Chamber when we should be sitting.  It is embarrassing.  I ask the Leader to take on board the genuine concerns of those of us on this side of the House.  Has there been any progress at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, about inviting a trade union leader to address the House to mark the anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out?  Has an invitation been issued?  The last time I raised this I was told that it was discussed at the CPP.  It is important to mark this centenary.</p></speech>

I found it remarkable that as I walked into town I was stopped by four groups of tourists looking for directions.  This prompted me to wonder why we do not have more electronic signage.  Real-time passenger information has recently become available at bus stops.  The signs are produced by Data Display based in County Clare.  I would like to see more electronic information signs in the capital city because we need to ensure that the tourist product we provide is of high quality and that people can locate it with ease.  With the advent of satellite navigation communications and technology and so forth Dublin City Council and Tourism Ireland could make a far better effort on signage in Dublin city.</p><p>I also support Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's sentiments on the fodder crisis.  I received a distressing telephone call yesterday from a farmer in County Clare who is under enormous pressure as a result of the fodder crisis and it was suggested that there may be a role for the Army in assisting to transport the fodder.  The situation in France is very serious and needs immediate resolution at the highest possible level.  If the Taoiseach needs to telephone the French Prime Minister in order to resolve this problem, that call should be made.</p></speech>

We all understand that the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children are vitally important and we are very interested in them.  It beggars belief that we could not find another venue, as the Dublin song says, &#8220;contagious&#8221; to the D&aacute;il.  There are plenty of other public spaces within a short walk of this building.  It is part of the continual erosion and gradual denigration of the Seanad in preparation for a Government assault when the referendum is announced.</p><p>  We had a very interesting debate here last evening.  I congratulate Senators Zappone and Quinn and former Members such as Joe O'Toole who came up with a very reasoned Bill.  As Senator Norris said, it is worth reading the leader article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> for a balanced view of that Bill.  I had to pinch myself here yesterday to know whether I was in the real world when I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government respond to the Bill because he was commending it and its purpose and the views expressed in it.  All the time he smiled like the Cheshire Cat and the hatchet was behind his back.  The Government attitude recalls the story of a trainer with a bad horse of which he wanted to get rid.</p> <p>The trainer's vet said he could fix the horse's leg to which the trainer replied he could fix it if he liked but that he would shoot the horse afterwards anyway.  There is a touch of that happening here.  </p><p>I have drawn an analogy here on a few occasions between the way the Government is treating and downgrading the Seanad by inches with what happened when the old Irish House of Commons was abolished in 1800.  The person who was given the dirty job of carrying out that work was an infamous man by the name of Lord Castlereagh.  The Members may have heard the words of the poem: &quot;I met Murder on the way - He had a [face] like Castlereagh -&quot;  I am afraid we have &quot;Lord Castlebar&quot; this time.  The Taoiseach, even though he does not have a murderous demeanour or anything like it, has gone far out on a limb and lost touch with the people on this issue.  He is a man for whom I have great respect.  He has shown great courage on a number of recent issues, but on this one he is totally wrong.  If a referendum on this issue goes before the people, it will be vehemently fought, tooth and nail, and I predict it will be defeated.</p></speech>

The concerns about the fodder crisis were well expressed and I share them.  I am certain the Minister is working extremely hard to try to resolve them, albeit, as other Senators have pointed out, he is not Superman.  It is probably best that he carries on trying to work out the dilemmas and that he continues to respond to the crisis.  I am not sure that bringing him in here at this point in the middle of the crisis is the best place for him to be.  However, I would like a reassurance that he will be in touch with his French counterpart today and, as others have said, if that requires the Taoiseach to ring the French Prime Minister, then so be it.  We had a very good discussion on the fodder crisis with the Minister one afternoon last week.  It is clear that in the week that has passed nothing has improved and, if anything, it has disimproved because of the weather.  I am sure it is uppermost in his mind and he has made clear from the emergency crisis line that no farmers should find themselves in a predicament and that they should ring the crisis line, and I would urge that they do that.</p><p>I would like to note the efforts in regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann that have been made in the past  few days.  I spoke to a number of the workers in Sligo on Monday and they are very concerned not only about themselves but about the future of the company.  I noted this morning that progress has been made and agreement has been reached to put proposals to the workers.  I hope that will result in a resolution and that the workers will continue, as they have done this week, to show they were willing to go back to work in the interests of customers, visitors, schoolchildren and so on.  I note their continued co-operation.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the stem cell breakthrough research.  It is an extraordinary piece of research and it is a matter that could be debated in this House, even though I share Senator's Keane's confusion about which Minister might be the appropriate one, but it is certainly a matter on which we should take a lead.</p></speech>

It is an important piece of work.  It will afford people from the South from places like Beara from which the Leas-Cathaoirleach comes the opportunity to come to Breifne, the most beautiful part of the country covering counties Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal.</p><p>I ask the Leader if the President has yet signed the Education and Training Boards Bill which was passed by both Houses.  Will he inquire from the Minister when he intends to sign the commencement order for that Bill?</p><p>In regard to the use of this Chamber by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I must disagree with some of my colleagues.  I welcome the fact that the Chamber is being used.  It was a decision taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It affords every Member of the Oireachtas who wishes to participate in the committee's meetings an opportunity to attend them.  The facilities are here for them to do that.  It is unfortunate that this will happen on a sitting day but, nevertheless, it is good that this Chamber is being used.</p></speech>

This is a man who is not given to making wild statements.  He is someone who thinks and talks straight.  It is unthinkable and unconscionable that an unborn baby that would be capable of life outside the womb could lose its constitutional right and be killed.  That is an appalling prospect if it were true, and I sincerely hope it is not.  That is a right that deserves to be defended and vindicated.  We have had the heads of a Bill and hopefully when they are clothed that danger will be totally removed.  I am sure we will pursue the matter further.</p><p>That leads me on to Senator Leyden's grandstanding here this morning.  Let us be honest and calm about this matter.  As Senator O'Sullivan and other Members opposite have said, the hearings of that joint committee of both Houses are extremely important.  Hopefully, they will bring about the tabling of amendments, to which the Minister said he is open, and refinements that we would all wish to see.</p></speech>

This is leading to waste within the health services because other treatments are being offered which are unnecessary when what is required is that people would have such access in the first instance.  In connection with that, I would also raise the failure to fill the vacancies in the podiatric section.  Even Diabetes Ireland is highlighting the fact that many people with diabetes subsequently have to undergo amputations which would be unnecessary if the correct professional expertise was available to assist people with diabetes and type 2 diabetes in particular.  That is all leading to waste in the public service because there are disability allowances and various other costs attaching as a consequence.  Somebody needs to get a grip and run our public services in a much more efficient way than has happened heretofore.</p><p>I ask the Leader to consider arranging for a debate in this House across a number of Departments, particularly the Department of Health, where we could examine what was said pre-election, which was that the waste in the public service would be tackled.  It amounts to probably anywhere between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion which could be removed from the cost of the services purely by making people accountable, identifying the waste and ensuring that the services are run efficiently.</p><p>I agree with the point made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  There are serious challenges within the agricultural industry, of which the fodder crisis is one and there are others.  There is the challenge to the future of the industry in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy discussions and the Common Fisheries Policy.  Leaving the vacancy in the Department unfilled means that the Minister has to grapple with all these challenges on his own, which is unconscionable.  I can reliably inform the Senator that this position is being dangled as an inducement to quite a number of Members of the Lower House to get them to vote for the abortion Bill.  I can also reliably inform him that as soon as that Bill is voted on that position will be filled.</p></speech>

Such schools were designated in the early part of the previous decade in the period 2003 to 2004 with implementation in 2005.  The phrase, "That was then and this is now" is used with reference to other sectors.  However, for many who are the new disadvantaged, the designation is wrong.  There are far too many schools with DEIS status which no longer require it and far too many schools which require the designation very badly.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Hundreds of millions of euro are spent on DEIS schools every year.  I ask that this money be spent on the schools most in need and that any alteration should be cost-neutral.</p><p>In my view, the Minister and his Department have been very lazy with regard to this matter.  Public representatives from all parts of the country say they know of schools that no longer require DEIS status while others schools which are badly in need do not have DEIS designation.  The people who pay the price are the children in those schools.  I ask the Leader to arrange an immediate debate.  This is a very important issue.  We were told about 18 months ago that this designation would be given in September 2013.  However, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  The matter is being handled in a very lazy way by the Department and the Minister and it must stop.  Perhaps this request will prod the Department and the Minister into action.</p></speech>

More than 36 medical professionals will give evidence.  I know that Members may be inconvenienced because the Seanad is not sitting on Tuesday but it is important for continuity that the hearings are held on successive days.  Last January, the health committee proved that the consultation process was extremely helpful in dealing with this issue.  Likewise, the public hearings this Friday and on Monday and Tuesday next week, will also be helpful in teasing out the issues to ensure that the legislation will be constitutional and capable of implementation.  This very important issue needs to be given the space and time which it is being allocated.  The people who will appear before the committee over the three days of hearings are attending voluntarily.  They do not have to attend but they want to make a contribution to this debate and to legislation in this area.</p><p>I refer to Senator Jim Walsh's point about appointments in the health service.  I am extremely concerned about that issue.  For example, 95% of all consultant posts advertised in the past six to eight months have not been filled.  I can inform the House that they will not be filled.  We need to examine how junior doctors and consultants are appointed.  I have put this matter - which I have been raising for the past 18 months - on the agenda for the meeting of the health committee next Thursday.  The problem is not going away.  I am very concerned that more than 2,000 junior doctors are on six-month contracts while the HSE has made an agreement with a university in Pakistan to give two-year contracts to graduates from Pakistan universities.  This does not make sense.  It is time for a review by all the training bodies, the hospitals, the HSE and the Department of Health, of the long-term planning for the employment of medical expertise.  I ask for a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

To avoid any ambiguity about the comments made on this side of the House, we fully support the decision of our Chief Whip in supporting by vote at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the holding of the hearings in this Chamber.

Senators Mullins, Comiskey and Wilson spoke about the Beara to Breffni walk and the recently published report on health and welfare and well-being.  I will endeavour to have that report debated in the House soon.</p><p>Senator Leyden asked about &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; which does not cover the Seanad sittings if the D&aacute;il is not sitting.  I refer to a letter in response from RTE dated July 2011, which I read to the House.  I can read out the letter again.

I cannot get him to come here any sooner; that is when he says he is available.  </p><p>The inappropriate billing of patients by the health service can be addressed with the Minister for Health.  There is no one better qualified than Senator John Crown to speak about genetic testing for women with breast cancer and a Minister would be unwise not to consider the statement made by him.  Senators C&aacute;it Keane and Susan O'Keeffe called for a debate on stem cell research.  I will try to find out which Minister deals with that issue and arrange a debate on it.</p><p>Senators Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Michael Comiskey, Susan O'Keeffe and several others referred to the fodder crisis.  I will bring the matters raised to the immediate attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, who kindly came to the House last week to explain what was taking place in that regard.  I am sure he will be well aware of the matter raised when I bring them to his attention and I am sure he is working hard on them.  </p><p>A number of Senators asked when a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would be appointed.  Seemingly, Senator Jim Walsh knows all about it, but it is a matter for the Taoiseach to decide and I have no say in the matter.  </p><p>Senator Denis Landy referred to CSO figures and the positive signs emanating from them.  I note also his comments that the Minister should encourage local authorities and other public bodies to participate in the JobBridge scheme which is of great benefit.  </p><p>I agree fully with Senator Paschal Mooney on the media coverage given to Bills taken in this House.  Last week there was massive coverage of a Bill dealt with in the other House which had been dealt with here several months ago and on which we had had an excellent debate.  I certainly agree with what the Senator said in that regard.</p></speech>

We will certainly take into consideration what Members have to say, but they were informed about the committee sittings.  The other matter he raised was raised by Senator Ivana Bacik at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and while a decision has not been made, the committee will be favourably disposed towards inviting somebody to come to the House to speak on the anniversary of the Lockout.  A decision has not been made, but an invitation has not been sent.</p><p>Senator Martin Conway called for more electronic signage to assist tourists in the capital city, in particular.

Is deas bheith ar ais agus nuair a chuimhn&iacute;m ar an Teach seo, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, cuimhn&iacute;m mar <i>alma mater</i> &eacute;.  Is maith is cuimhin liom go maith19 I&uacute;il 1981 nuair a fuair m&eacute; glaoch ar an teilef&oacute;n &oacute;n Iar-Thaoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, go raibh s&eacute; do m'ainmni&uacute; go dt&iacute; an Teach seo.  Bh&iacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orm.  Is deas bheith ar ais ar&iacute;s, mar fheisire &oacute;n Aontas Eorpach.</p><p>  I am absolutely delighted to have the opportunity to address Senators today and to discuss matters of European interest.  As I said when I spoke as Gaeilge, it is very like a return home for me because I regard Seanad &Eacute;ireann as my <i>alma mater</i> in political terms.  I remember 19 August 1981, when I received a telephone call from the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, offering me one of his precious 11 Seanad nominations.  I was at a funeral in Christ the King Church in Galway, before the days of mobile telephones, and I could not be contacted.  Time was running out but eventually someone managed to fish me from a restaurant in Salthill and tell me that the Taoiseach was looking for me.  I barely made it and I had to wait until the six o'clock news to see whether I would be nominated.  While he asked me if I would accept the nomination, he was not clear or unequivocal.  I finally made it and I enjoyed every minute of the 11 years I spent in this House.  I was nominated originally, then I was re-elected and in 2002 I was re-elected until 2007.  This was my gateway to politics.</p><p>  From the point of view of the gratification I got, I got as much gratification in this House and sometimes more than in the Lower House, where I spent 15 years.  The level of debate in this Chamber, where there is not the same degree of rancour, is not recognised.  This House has always been under-reported and that leaves much to be desired.  I was very sorry to hear of the retirement of Mr. Jimmy Walsh, who invariably covered this House week in, week out, in his column at the bottom of the D&aacute;il report.  We owe a debt of gratitude to him and to &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;.  I am very critical of the national media for their lack of coverage of the proceedings in this House.</p><p>  The House has contributed much to national life and parliamentary life.  The current President, Michael D. Higgins, started his national political career in this House.  A previous President with whom I had the pleasure of serving, Mary Robinson, started her career in this House.  The former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, started his political career in this House.  I appreciate the anxiety Senators are going through at present.</p><p>  On 27 and 28 April, I was invited to Poland to celebrate the Irish Presidency of the Council by Krzysztof Malarecki.  He invites a member of the European Parliament from each member state to celebrate its Presidency.  A representative of the Cyprus Presidency, which ended in December, was invited and the Lithuanian Presidency will receive similar invitations.  The celebration was one of Irish traditional music, song, dance and ballads.  Polish dancers did traditional Irish dancing with exquisite perfection.  A professor of philosophy recited Polish translations of Raftery, Callanan, Kavanagh and there was Irish drink and Irish cuisine.  It was truly spectacular.</p><p>  Why should the Poles celebrate the rotating Presidency every six months?  To understand that, one must reflect on the history of Poland.  The country was invaded by Sweden in 1700, partitioned three times in the 18th century, invaded by the Russians in 1887, invaded by the Nazis in 1939, liberated by the Russians in 1945 and forced to kowtow to Moscow for the next 59 years.  In 2004, it became a full and proud member of the European Union.  The country was celebrating real liberation for the first time.  Poland's history is very much a reflection of those European countries locked behind the Iron Curtain and under the cold and icy grip of Moscow for so many years.  I have witnessed 16 rotating Presidencies and the Polish Presidency in 2012, the first, was a huge success.  It was a celebration of freedom, democracy and of being an integral component of the most successful political experiment in the history of politics, which is what the European Union is.  It is a mosaic of member states, coming from diverse backgrounds with the well-established common set of goals whose borders continue to push further into the eastern horizons of the mainland of Europe, with Croatia becoming a member on 1 July.  </p><p>  Some 40 years ago, the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paddy Hillery, signed the accession agreement for Ireland's entry into the European Union, bringing the membership of the union to nine states.  Its significance cannot be overstated.</p><p>  I referred to the success of the first Polish Presidency.  Ireland is now into the final few weeks of our seventh Presidency.  The Irish Presidencies have all been successful, well managed and thematic and the current Presidency is no exception.  The mission statement of stability, growth and jobs could not be more appropriate given the current economic crisis and there is a growing optimism that Ireland's performance will be emulated in due course by the other programme countries.</p><p>  We should reflect on the doom-laden headlines and prophecies in the media in January 2012.  The predicted disasters did not occur.  There has been no euro meltdown, the deeper dive into recession has not occurred.  What has helped, in terms of navigating Europe back to economic recovery, has been, in spite of occasional public street protests, the relative political stability as evidenced by the election process.  The results are testament to the current climate of political stability.  It is testament to our current Government that, despite the heavy budgetary cuts we have been forced to implement, cuts have been implemented as fairly as possible and have not resulted in chaos and anarchy on the streets.  I take hope from the fact that nowhere in Europe did political extremists advance electorally.  In Spain, they were kept out of power.  In France, extremists remained on the margins.  In the Netherlands, voters threw them out of the multi-party coalition in the autumn.  </p><p>  Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is a major problem.  As an tUachtar&aacute;in, Michael D. Higgins, said &quot;There is nothing more corrosive to society and more crushing to an individual than endemic unemployment, particularly among the young.&quot;  The still broken banking system has to be addressed and in this regard we need a fully-fledged monetary union, as in the United States.  The overhanging cloud of Britain's possible withdrawal from the EU is, for Europe and particularly for Ireland, a major cause for concern.  In recent local elections, the success of the United Kingdom Independence Party is cause for concern.</p><p>  I have had the honour of witnessing 16 of the rotating Presidencies since 2004, all of which have been successful.  I have heard Prime Ministers and Heads of State deliver their inaugural Presidency addresses to plenary sittings in Strasbourg.  One of the finest, if not the finest, was that of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, last February.  His speech had vision, style and substance.  It was punctuated by regular and virtually universal applause and when he concluded there was a prolonged standing ovation.  Having delivered his address, he engaged in a long and impressive question-and-answer session with MEPs from all sides of the House.  Likewise, the riveting, eloquent, scholarly address by our President, Michael D. Higgins at our April plenary session made one so proud to be Irish.</p> <p>As politicians, Senators will know that elected representatives do not give or get that kind of praise or adulation unless it is earned.  After the address by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, a member of the UK Independence Party, which, as I said, does not give plaudits very willingly, came up to me and said he must have kissed the Blarney stone.  I said: &ldquo;The Irish do not need to kiss the Blarney stone; that is for the Brits and the Yanks.&rdquo;  The same was said in regard to the scholarly address of the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins.</p></speech>

The Common Agricultural Policy has been in gestation for a long period but I am very confident that the negotiations that are currently in trilogue will deliver a final set of proposals that will be approved by the Parliament on the week beginning on 10 June.  Members will be aware that at 6.15 a.m. yesterday, the talks on the Common Fisheries Policy concluded, after 36 hours of negotiations.  These are the two big-ticket items.  The reforming of the Common Agricultural Policy strikes a balance between the need to support farmers operating in disadvantaged areas and the need to protect productive farmers in order to feed our growing world population.  The budget for agriculture agreed at the February Council meeting means the Irish agriculture sector will receive &euro;11 billion for the period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>Likewise, I am optimistic that the Common Fisheries Policy, which was concluded yesterday and is to be finalised at the June plenary meeting, will guarantee a much better deal for the Irish fishing community in terms of guaranteed sustainable livelihoods while at the same time ensuring strict oversight and sustainable fish stocks.  In this regard, I pay special tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, for his skilful management of negotiations in respect of both portfolios.  I pay special tribute to his officials for managing to persuade the other negotiating teams to appreciate the strength and logic of their viewpoint and for keeping MEPs briefed as the talks progressed.</p><p>I pay special tribute to what we regard as the common bureaucracy, known as the Permanent Representation, Perm Rep.  Senator Leyden's daughter is one of the additional 55 staff that have been taken on by the Perm Rep.  They are very successful in terms of their negotiating skills.  Thanks to the Lisbon treaty, we are now consulted all along the line.  My comments have been noted regarding decisions on the common agriculture and fisheries policies.  Had it not been for the adoption of the Lisbon treaty by all 27 member states, our role as parliamentarians in the European Parliament would be merely consultative.  Now, because of the treaty, there is co-decision-making, giving the Parliament full power of approval or rejection.</p><p>I referred to the success of the Irish Presidency.  Some Members may know that since 2009, I have been a member of the Bureau of the European Parliament, which comprises the President of the Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz, 14 vice presidents and five MEPs known as quaestors, not wasters.</p></speech>

I have a series of responsibilities but the ones I have fought for and succeeded in getting cover the Parliament's library service and the designation of exhibitions.  There are 27 exhibition spaces, which are much sought after.  Apart from running a very efficient and effective six-month Presidency, Ireland should use the exhibition spaces to showcase Ireland in its many different spheres.  With that in mind, I block-booked a considerable number of the exhibition spaces for Ireland and its Presidency.  We kicked off in spectacular fashion.  The month of January saw John Banville, whom Wexford people, in particular, will know as the author of 18 novels and six plays, the winner of the Man Booker Prize and the man who writes under the pseudonym Benjamin Black, give readings in the European Parliament.  It was an all-ticket affair.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, launched the Irish art exhibition, which included 27 spectacular paintings by Irish artists and three sculptures.  Last month, a 51-person choir from my constituency, Cill Aod&aacute;in Choral Society, provided entertainment during an Irish visit.</p><p>  I sponsored a competition in conjunction with the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> to discover the best slogan for the Union.  We received a huge number of entries.  Senator Harte will know that Donegal sometimes feels a little detached from the rest of the Republic.  Some of the slogans received were absolutely spectacular.  A child from Edeninfagh<font color="#2F2F2F"> national school won the competition with her slogan.  The prize involved my bringing her and her family to see the Parliament at first hand.  I decided to present the prize myself at the school, which is outside Glenties.  The principal, Mr. Oliver McGinley, had the students all pumped up, having told them a very important MEP was coming.  He said the MEP was the man who sponsored the prize.  When I went into the school, he said, &#8220;Dalta&iacute;, seo &eacute; an fear a bhfuilfimid </font>ag labhairt faoi.&#8221;  This translates as, &#8220;Students, this is the man we have been talking about&#8221;.  For the students, Jim McGuinness was more famous, which soon burst my bubble.</p><p>  Last week saw the launch of Picti&uacute;r, a touring exhibition containing contemporary Irish children's book illustrations.  This was organised in association with Children's Books Ireland and Laureate na n&Oacute;g.  In addition, we had a poster competition.  Leader representatives are to visit very shortly.  Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann does spectacular work in regard to the performance of Irish song, music and dance.  A spectacular joint venture involving Bord Bia and Diageo was co-sponsored by Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP.  As my former colleague, Senator Colm Burke, will testify, whenever there is food and drink around, one has no problem getting a crowd in the European Parliament.</p><p>  Mr. Jim Sheridan, who directed &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and numerous other productions, is to visit.  A musical group from County Cork called Pulses of Tradition is to come out.  That event will be co-hosted by Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP.  The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, will be promoting Irish agriculture on 24 June and 28 June.</p><p>  Overall, the Presidency has been going extremely well.  Getting the two big-ticket items, which are crucial for the Union, including Ireland, represents a huge achievement.  I was speaking to the Irish ambassador, Mr. Tom Hanney.  During the Irish Presidency, we have brought to fruition 21 issues, including directives and regulations that have been hanging around for four to five years.  That we have held the Presidency for the seventh time, know how presidencies work and have very skilled negotiators in the Perm Rep and among the additional civil servants we have taken on indicates that, of all the Irish presidencies, which have been good, the current one has been uniquely successful.</p><p>  The Senators face a dilemma.  Last night I listened to Senator Feargal Quinn debating the future of the Seanad with Professor Eoin O'Malley.  I listened to the vox pops taken on the street.  They were not very encouraging but radio and vox pops can be very selective.  I hope the Senators enjoy the remainder of their term.  I certainly enjoyed every moment of my 11 years here.  I know the Senators will continue to do a good job through making an input to the parliamentary process.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600012#L00600"><p>I am delighted to welcome back Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, for the Ireland North-West constituency.  As far as I know, he is the second Mayoman to hold the position of MEP.  The late Se&aacute;n Flanagan preceded him.  I will check my records but I do not know of anybody else from County Mayo who was an MEP.  This is great for the county, although I realise Mr. Higgins represents all counties in his constituency, including Roscommon.  He was a Deputy for part of Roscommon at one stage, as far as I know.  At least he ran for election there.  He has been an MEP since 2004 and had a dual mandate at one stage.  We used to debate his membership.  He was prepared to vacate it for one of the diaspora, as far as I recall.  That was his precondition and it was fair enough.  He held both positions very well and was elected in 2004.  He was re-elected in 2009.</p> <p>I wish him success in future elections.</p><p>On the matter of elections, I very much regret that it appears the number of MEPs for Ireland will be reduced from 12 to 11.  When we agreed to the admission of Croatia into the European Union, I did not realise we would lose an MEP as a result.  That should not be part of the deal.  I appreciate that there is a set number of MEPs in the European Union, but if Turkey becomes a member, for example, will we lose another two MEPs?  Will we have the same number as Malta or Luxembourg?  Ours is the most peripheral country, divided from continental Europe by the sea, and we need the current number of MEPs.  Pat the Cope Gallagher and Marian Harkin also represent Mr. Higgins's constituency and they, too, appeared before the Seanad.  Ireland can use its veto, but I understand it does not intend to do so.</p><p>The reorganisation of constituencies must be a concern for sitting MEPs who will be seeking re-election.  I understand Mr. Higgins will seek re-election in 2014, but at this stage he does not even know what his constituency will be.  He knows the basis of the constituency, but County Meath or some other place could be added to it.  It is most unsatisfactory because the role of the European Parliament is very important.</p><p>With regard to the crisis in farming, has it become an issue at the European Parliament?  A total of 143,000 cattle died between 1 January and 1 May this year, which is approximately 17,000 more than the figure for last year.  That gives us an idea of the size of the crisis.  It was mentioned this morning on the Order of Business that fodder was held up at a French port.  Is there no emergency support from the European Union in dealing with a crisis such as this?  We are importing fodder from the United Kingdom and France, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has provided less - approximately &euro;3 million - than the &euro;12 million provided in 1998 to deal with a similar crisis.  The IFA and the co-operatives have given some assistance, but the problem is very serious.  In Castlerea Livestock Mart a few days ago there was a queue, but many disappointed farmers were not in a position to obtain fodder.  We contacted Connacht Gold in Athleague where it has a plant, but we are at the bottom of a long list.  Adjoining farmers are very helpful and there has been great camaraderie among farmers in each community.  They are working together and, to my knowledge, nobody has exploited the fodder crisis in his or her area.</p><p>It is an ongoing crisis which should be raised in the context of what to do in the future such as the distribution of fodder between European Union countries at cost price.  Where there might be a surplus in a country such as France or Britain there should be some protocol or procedure whereby we can be made aware that it is available.  One can stock up for bad winters, but there is an ongoing problem, as Mr. Higgins is aware.  He travels through all constituencies and can see the quality of the cattle and what is happening.  I was in Knockbridge and other areas in his former constituency and could see the effect the crisis was having.  I know he is aware of it and doing his best, which is very important as a Member of the European Parliament.</p><p>With regard to the EU Presidency, I thank Mr. Higgins for his kind comments on Sinead.  It is a great experience for the staff who went to the European Union from the various Departments to back up the Presidency.  Believe it or not, as a former Minister of State, I was the negotiator on the Single European Act.  Nobody gives me any recognition for this, but I was only able to do it because I had the staff, including the ambassador, to support me.  I thank Mr. Higgins for mentioning the people concerned who are on the front line.  Every Government has been served equally well by the permanent staff in Brussels.  We have the best staff, which is generally recognised.  Our Presidencies have always gone well and I congratulate the Government, the staff and particularly the ambassador in Brussels on the crucial negotiations that have taken place and which have been very successful to date.  I wish them continued success.  I used to travel there on a Sunday evening to attend meetings on the Monday and the briefings provided were second to none.  We could always achieve this, above and beyond another member state.  In fact, the proof is that when Croatia held the Presidency, staff were seconded from Ireland to help it during its Presidency.</p><p>I thank Mr. Higgins for his attendance.  It is nice to see him back in the Seanad where he started his career in 1981 after being nominated by the late, great Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  I wish him continued success and hope we can continue this liaison.  I also thank the Leader of the House for arranging these meetings.  The fact that this Parliament can bond with the European Parliament is very important.  That line of communication between us is vital and long may it continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600013#M00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP.  In a sense it is a welcome home, given that he spent a number of years in the Seanad.  He made a valuable contribution during his time in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I also thank him for his assistance during my brief period in the European Parliament.  Working there with him and his staff and all of the Irish MEPs was a huge learning exercise for me.  The contribution MEPs make at European level is not given the recognition it deserves.  One of the problems is that the number is so small it is difficult for the media to focus on the work they are doing.</p><p>It was important that Mr. Higgins opened his address by mentioning President Michael D. Higgins; the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson; and the former Taoiseach, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  It is interesting that their careers started in this House.  Not only did they make a major contribution as Members of this House but both President Michael D. Higgins and Mrs. Mary Robinson are making a huge contribution to public life many years after leaving this House.  It is important to recognise this.</p><p>Mr. Higgins mentioned the Irish Presidency and his invitation to Poland.  It is interesting that he mentioned this because I happened to be Lord Mayor of Cork in 2004 when the ten new member states joined the European Union.  On that day, 1 May, a number of cities around the country were designated for each new member state.  Slovakia, for example, was assigned to Cork.  On that day we closed off Patrick Street in Cork and allowed the Slovakian community to set up stalls on the street in order that they could display what they had to offer to us in Ireland.  It was an interesting exercise.  It might be interesting to return to it on Europe Day and perhaps assign a country to 27 cities and towns around the country.  After the end of June it will be 28.  It would be a useful exercise as regards making a connection with other countries in Europe.</p><p>There is also the significance of the markets to which we have access.  We have access to a market of more than 500 million people.  While people might be critical of the European Union, the great benefit for Ireland has been having access to such a huge market.  In gaining access to that market we have retained our access to the American market which is also making a very valuable contribution to the economy.</p><p>Mr. Higgins mentioned the increased powers of the European Parliament.  It is very important that our Members of the European Parliament are effective and work to protect Ireland's interests at the same time as helping the European economy and the European Union generally to continue to develop.  On Tuesday last I was in London to attend a global diplomatic forum on European security and defence policy.  It was interesting to listen to the contributions and hear about how America was stepping back in terms of the support and protection it has provided for Europe in the past 50 years.  We must be conscious of this.</p> <p>While there is no discussion on changing Ireland's role as a neutral country, we can still play a very important part in a security and defence role.  </p><p>It was interesting to note the role played by Ireland in joining with France and a number of other countries, and how we stepped into the breach in regard to Chad.  We provided protection for more than 500,000 people in refugees camps and IDP sites.  The issue is Europe's role in working with the UN.  Ireland has a triple lock system, whereby a UN mandate, Government approval and the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are required.  We need to examine how we can continue in that role, while working with our European colleagues.  We have a very valuable contribution to make.  </p><p>We need to be very conscious of the need for MEPs to get the necessary support.  There are over 20 committees in the European Parliament and Irish MEPs sit on 14 of them, which means we have no direct representation on six committees.  It emphasises the need for MEPs to get the necessary support to make sure we are watching all the issues in the Parliament, which now has more power.  The permanent representatives which are giving support are extremely important.  MEPs have research staff and it is extremely important that they get the necessary funding and support to make sure they are able to do the work they are required to do.  In my time in the European Parliament I always found research staff worked extremely hard to give backup support to MEPs.  </p><p>Mr. Higgins touched on a number of interesting issues, such as CAP and the fisheries policy.  The three years the Minister, Deputy Coveney, spent in the European Parliament have been hugely beneficial in dealing with those issues and other countries, and coming to an agreement.  There is clear evidence that the experience has been a factor in his contribution.  </p><p>I again thank Mr. Higgins for his contribution to the D&aacute;il, Seanad and European Parliament.  It is extremely important that we continue to provide the necessary space for MEPs to make their contributions, and to get the information into the public domain and the media.  I wish him well in his future career.</p></speech>

He has history in this House and the D&aacute;il.  He recalled a fateful phone call, similar to one I received two years ago this Monday when I was in China.  It was a great story.  I will never forget the pride I felt when I got that phone call.</p><p>I acknowledge the roles which have not been highlighted and in which he played a significant part, namely, the EU suicide prevention and mental health treatment strategies, EU funding for the care of the elderly and the increased access to cross-border health care.  He was also involved in children and youth issues, such as childhood obesity and child literacy.  These issues are often not played out in Ireland, but are important in terms of the development of EU strategies which filter down to Ireland.  His role as quaestor is also very important.  </p><p>I note his role in introducing a cultural programme.  I happened to be present in January when Mr. Higgins met Mr. John Banville.  It was an excellent initiative.</p><p>As Mr. Higgins said, Ireland's Presidency is very important and set a number of milestones.  I would like to join the recognition of the roles played by Irish Ministers.  We all have a sense of pride when we hear about the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the news, delivering a deal people said would not be possible within this Presidency.  We should not underestimate the deal which has been struck, and the officials who support that work</p><p>I want to raise the role of citizens in Europe.  I have a concern that Europe has steered off its path slightly.  We should return to its original path, where all voices, no matter how small, were heard equally, and where the understanding and promotion of diversity of culture and ideas were to the fore.  Last week I had the opportunity while in Vienna to speak in the Austrian Chancellery on the Future of Europe Group report on striking a balance between unity and diversity.  It has not received much publicity in Ireland, but 11 foreign Ministers from EU member states, not including Ireland, came together and wrote a paper on what they believe is the future of Europe.  My difficulty with the report is that it progresses a very top-down approach.  If one really reads into the report, one will find it looks at the common security policy and similar areas on which we could co-operate, rather than issues which directly affect citizens.  </p><p>We need to be careful with our engagement on EU issues.  I would welcome a debate in the House on the future of Europe.  The report to which I referred is interesting.  It comprises only seven pages but there is a lot of content.  It is very interesting that although the foreign Ministers have all put their names to it, it is on only one official website, that of the German Foreign Minister, Mr. Westerwelle, for debate.</p><p>There is often a perception that popular sentiment towards the EU has turned sour because power has moved to the centre of Europe between France and Germany.  It should be noted that the European Movement Ireland committee commissioned a RedC poll earlier this year which found 85% of respondents believed that Ireland should remain part of the EU and 83% of Irish adults believe that, on balance, Ireland has benefited from its membership of the EU.  We should not underestimate those figures.  We can have a serious and engaging debate with the citizens of Ireland.  They see the benefits of the EU and we should examine how we can develop that further.  </p><p>I would be interested to hear the opinions of Mr. Higgins on how, post the Irish Presidency which will be over soon enough, we can ensure the EU agenda focuses on the issues that most affect our citizens and how we can best generate engagement with and support for the EU with people.  I refer to the &quot;critical friend&quot; approach, whereby a really good friend will tell one what he or she likes or does not like.</p><p>I have concerns about the multiannual financial framework.  It is close to completion.  We have a deal which will have to be discussed and rebalanced every year because we will not grasp the nettle.  We will propose a budget but each year the Parliament will have to grapple with it.  I would welcome Mr. Higgins's thoughts on that.  </p><p>I echo his congratulations to the Minister, Deputy Coveney for his role in common fisheries and CAP.  I am not from an agricultural background, although having spent 12 years on the economic and social committee with farmers' representatives I learned more about farming than I ever needed or wanted to know.  It is tremendous that Ireland has played a role in bringing people together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600014#N00300"><p>Following the comments on the role of citizens, I would like to touch on turnout at elections for the European Parliament.  In 1979 it was 62% but fell to 43% in 2009.  Of the 27 member states, 18 were unable to secure turnouts of more than 50% in 2009.  Of those, 11 had turnouts of less than 40%.  The Eurobarometer survey from last December showed trust in European institutions has been on a downward trend since 2007 and that 33% of people trust EU institutions.</p><p>Does Mr. Higgins think greater European integration will wide the gap between European citizens and EU institutions?  Is there a real appetite for further integration?  How might democratic legitimacy and accountability, thorough parliamentary oversight, with distinct roles at national and European Parliament level, be more clearly defined? </p> <p>How does Mr. Higgins consider that national parliaments, including the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, if we are still here in the coming years, might strengthen their role under the European semester programme?</p><p>In regard to the current debates on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, an issue that struck me in going through the drafts is the notion of macroeconomic conditionality.  Is that still on the table in terms of the Cohesion and Structural Funds?  What position is Mr. Higgins's party group in the European Parliament taking on macroeconomic conditionality and is he working to oppose it?  It is intended that agreement will be reached on the MFF regulation at the June plenary meeting of the European Parliament.  Does Mr. Higgins expect that the Parliament will give its consent in this regard?</p><p>In terms of the MFF and how it links in with the Irish Presidency, we have been repeatedly assured that the issue of youth unemployment is a pillar of the Presidency.  There was an agreement with the Council for funding of &euro;6 billion under the youth employment initiative of the MFF for 2014-2020, but that is being held up until the MFF is agreed by Parliament.  The Council recommendations acknowledge that youth unemployment is a major issue and that measures to address it must be implemented as soon as possible.  Does Mr. Higgins accept that member states cannot afford to wait for agreement to be reached on the MFF before action in this area commences?  I acknowledge that the funding for the youth employment initiative will not be released until that agreement is secured, but is Mr. Higgins of the view that member states should be making preparations for its roll-out, which might include a consideration of the necessity for matching funding?  After all, the provision over six years of &euro;6 billion across all member states with youth employment of more than 20% will not be adequate to tackle the issue.</p><p>The end of Ireland's Presidency coincides with the one-year anniversary of the June 2012 European Council meeting which called for the link between banking and sovereign debt to be broken.  How much progress has been made on this issue?  Does Mr. Higgins see a real appetite for change in this regard in Parliament, including within his own political grouping?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1173" speakername="Lorraine Higgins" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600015#O00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Higgins to the Chamber.  I should perhaps refer to him as "Deputy Higgins", which I understand is the title used by Members of the European Parliament themselves in the course of their work.  I get a kick out of that title because it is one I aspire to myself within our national Parliament.  It is always a welcome departure to have Members of the European Parliament address the House.  These engagements arise out of the excellent initiative championed by the Leader under the aegis of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Mr. Higgins's experience in politics at local, national and European level gives him a broad-ranging perspective which we are particularly interested to hear.  He clearly has been and continues to be a great ambassador for the country and we can be justifiably proud to have him representing our interests in Europe.</p><p>Mr. Higgins's address is particularly timely given that Ireland is the current holder of the Presidency.  Ministers and officials from our fellow member states have visited the country in the past five months and will continue to do so until the end of June.  This is Ireland's seventh time to hold this responsibility, which is always an honour for the country.  The 2013 Presidency has come as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 and has further strengthened the commitment we have shown to the European Union project since our accession.  As we mark our 40th year of membership it is useful to reflect on the remarkable changes that have taken place in our country, politically, culturally, economically and in terms of infrastructure.  As Senator Michael Mullins observed, in 1973 we did not even have a motorway in Ireland.  The wonderful changes that have come about through the provision of Structural Funds represent one of the major benefits of our membership of the European Union.  In the year of our accession, Ireland's wealth stood at 60% of the European average.  Today, despite the effects of the economic crisis, our level of prosperity is above the European average.  In the early 1970s more than 50% of our exports went to our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, while today we are engaged in the trade of goods and services globally.  Other EU economies such as Germany have become increasingly important for Irish exporters.  These are some of the notable and welcome aspects of our development and change since becoming a member of the Union in 1973.</p><p>Our priorities and aims for the Presidency are helping to shape European policy and contribute not only to Europe's growth and recovery but also to our own.  The Government has already made huge strides, for example, towards addressing our debt burden.  Indeed, within two short months of assuming the Presidency, the deal on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes provided a substantial easing of Ireland's debt burden, a deal which other political parties had argued at the time was not possible.  It was a great triumph on behalf of the Irish people.  Irish MEPs had their part to play in that, along with the Minister for Finance, Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and various Government officials.  We must continue to highlight the severity of Ireland's debt situation and to push for a deal on our sovereign debt.  I implore Mr. Higgins to continue to liaise with his colleagues in Europe to achieve this.</p><p>This country has been through a great deal in recent years, with very turbulent financial times domestically exacerbated by a world recession.  As we know, however, it is often during great adversity that opportunity knocks.  Now is the time for the EU to demonstrate its strength and stability and its capacity to foster growth even in these much maligned times.  Once steady growth is secured, the Union must foster employment opportunities which contribute to the welfare of the citizens of all member states.  The best example of Europe's ability to confront extraordinarily trying and testing issues can be seen in Ireland's own experience in recent times.  This State has undergone dramatic peaks and troughs in terms of growth in recent decades.  In the 15 years preceding 2008 we were the envy of Europe as a consequence of our unprecedented economic growth.  Unfortunately, that growth was fuelled largely by the excessive resources that were devoted to the property sector.  Irish banks adopted a flaithi&uacute;lach approach to lending which culminated in the Government of the day deciding to guarantee  their borrowings, thereby inextricably linking banking and sovereign debt.  The cost, economic, human and otherwise, of rescuing the banks and their creditors has been vast in terms of the toll it has taken on the Irish people.  In 2010, regretfully, we were obliged to seek support from the EU and the IMF when the door was closed on Ireland in the international financial markets.  We were fortunate in those circumstances to have an only friend in town in the form of the EU, which ensured we had enough funding to keep the country running, ensure public sector workers were paid and ATMs were functioning.</p><p>At the same time, we assisted Europe by helping to ensure stability in the banking sector.  That should never be forgotten by European decision makers.  As a consequence of the decision by the then Government to guarantee the banking debt, a burden of &euro;64 billion was imposed on citizens.  Irish people have taken the hit and played their part in addressing the economic malaise afflicting Europe.  Taxes have increased and expenditure has been curtailed.  The public sector has been reduced in size and salaries have been cut by an average of 15%.  The measures we have had to take have been difficult and there have been no easy choices.  It is time now for the light at the end of the tunnel, which should manifest itself before the end of our Presidency through an agreement to relieve the burden of our bank-related debt.  After all, we have shown other countries that there is a way back from crisis.  For too long we were included in that unfortunate group of countries to which the equally unfortunate acronym &quot;PIIGS&quot; was applied.  I look forward to the day when that acronym becomes &quot;PIGS&quot; and Ireland is no longer associated with it.  That time is approaching and I urge Mr. Higgins and his colleagues in the European Parliament to continue to emphasise what we have gone through in this country and what needs to be done to improve our situation.</p><p>Finally, Senator Terry Leyden referred to the fodder crisis.  I spoke yesterday with representatives of the Irish Farmers Association who expressed their serious concerns at the situation in France, where people re refusing to load boats for fear of being contaminated by what they have deemed to be hazardous substances contained within the fodder.  What they are alleging seems rather outlandish.  I ask Mr. Higgins to lobby the EU to establish an emergency fund which would assist farmers throughout the Union who find themselves in the circumstances facing Irish farmers, particularly on the west coast, in recent days.</p></speech>

I thank him for the kind words he said about his enjoyable experiences here.  One is not supposed to enjoy anything in politics.  It should be painful all the way.</p><p>I would like to ask a question about the future of Europe.  There has been a great deal of talk about the proposed referendum in the UK and the trouble it could cause.  Recently, some 130 MPs voted in favour of a motion expressing regret that the referendum was not mentioned in the Queen's speech.  I am not asking Deputy Higgins to comment on the internal politics of it.  If our closest commercial allies have a referendum on the EU, could it have a knock-on effect on us?</p><p>Senator van Turnhout mentioned a conference on the future of Europe.  I would like to refer to Jean-Claude Piris's book on the future of Europe, which was published last year.  Mr. Piris has been involved in legal aspects of much of the architecture of the EU.  In his book, he deals with some of the proposals for the future direction of the EU.  Does Deputy Higgins think the EU is well prepared to address the current and future challenges it might face?  The terminology that is used refers to a &quot;two-speed&quot; Europe.  The Lisbon treaty provides for closer integration among certain member states.  Is the debate ongoing in Europe?  Is it happening at all?  Will it land on us?  We have had enough surprises in this country without having to cater for any more.  We should be prepared for all eventualities.</p></speech>

The last times our paths crossed, we were watching the debacle of the dustbin recount in Castlebar.  Perhaps we should not revisit the last European elections.  What was the winning slogan that was provided by the young girl from Donegal?  I would like to hear it, if Deputy Higgins can recall it.</p><p>Like Senator Keane, I would be interested to know what is being said in the corridors of Brussels about the UK position.  What is the feeling among colleagues, staff and other people about the impact it may have?  Is it as unsettling as it may appear?</p><p>Does Deputy Higgins think the Common Agricultural Policy will do enough for small farmers, many of whom live in the enormous Ireland North-West constituency he represents.  I am sure many of them have made representations to him about their concerns regarding the Common Agricultural Policy.  I wonder whether he has any thoughts in that regard.</p><p>I share the views expressed by Deputy Higgins about the Irish Presidency.  The rotating Presidency seems to cause a great deal of upheaval in Europe every time it switches.  I accept that there does not seem to be another solution.  Of course some countries are better able and better placed to assume the Presidency than others.  Some countries have more experience of it, for example.  Is there another formula that might work?  Is the current formula satisfactory?</p><p>When the House debated Seanad reform yesterday, I was one of many speakers who suggested that the future of the Seanad might involve a role in scrutinising European legislation, perhaps as the national House for legislation that comes from Europe.  The Lisbon treaty now gives us the status to scrutinise that legislation.  I would like to hear the views of Deputy Higgins, as a former Senator and as an MEP of some distinction.</p></speech>

We have learned during the presentations by various MEPs over the course of Ireland's Presidency that "Deputy" is the correct term.</p><p>I want to pick up on Senator O'Keeffe's question about the scrutiny of EU legislation.  We have discussed this matter in the House on a number of occasions, including last night.  I have always meant to ask an MEP whether, in practice, scrutiny takes place in other parliamentary chambers around Europe.  If so, are MEPs aware of it?  How does it work?  We scrutinise EU measures relating to justice and home affairs at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member.  I wonder whether scrutiny is done in other countries in parliamentary chambers, as opposed to parliamentary committees.  Do the results of that scrutiny get fed back into the European Parliament?  Is there such a level of direct engagement with national parliamentary chambers?  If so, is there a particularly good model we could adopt here in Ireland?</p></speech>

Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir.</p><p>I thank Senator Leyden for his kind comments.  I made a deliberate decision not to mention in my contribution the possible reduction from 12 to 11 in Ireland's number of MEPs.  It is off the radar at present even though it is crucial for this country.  When the first direct elections took place in 1979, Ireland had 15 MEPs.  That number was reduced to 13 and then to 12.  One cannot blame the Germans and the French because this decision was taken in the European Parliament.  The number of German MEPs is decreasing from 99 to 96 and the number of Irish MEPs is decreasing from 12 to 11.  All of the small countries are being hit.  The Lisbon treaty deemed that the maximum number of MEPs should be 751.</p> <p>It also put in a condition that the minimum number for each country would be six.  Therefore, Ireland, with a population of 4.5 million, would have 11 MEPs while Malta, with a population of 400,000, would be guaranteed six MEPs, and Luxembourg, with a population of 500,000, would also be guaranteed six MEPs.  It is complete and utter folly.  The Senator asked what will happen in regard to Turkey coming in.  After Croatia comes in, Kosovo is very much in line and we will probably see it as a full member of the EU within the next two or three years.</p><p>I am not without hope that this may be vetoed.  I know the Greeks feel very strongly about it.  They are a bit like ourselves in regard to our indebtedness to Europe as, on the one hand, Greece is very much one of the programme countries but, on the other, the Greeks are very fired up about this, as are the Lithuanians.  If there is a veto, and if Ireland decides to go that road, we will not be on our own.  It is very much all to play for.</p><p>The Senator is correct with regard to the fodder crisis.  Under the new CAP, we will have a harvest insurance scheme similar to that which applies in the United States - that is an integral part of the CAP.  However, in the short term, I do not see anything coming from Europe, unfortunately.  The Senator outlined the number of livestock which have died since the beginning of the year, which is frightening.</p><p>I pay tribute to my former colleague in the European Parliament, Senator Colm Burke.  He had the unenviable task of stepping into the fairly sizeable shoes of the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and he very much focused on foreign affairs, with particular reference to human rights.  I know that in his capacity as an MEP, Senator Colm Burke visited Chad on several occasions.  Unfortunately, he did not get the publicity he deserved at the time but he did a huge amount in terms of highlighting the problems in Chad as well as the problems in Gaza.</p><p>The Senator is right about the lack of media focus on the European Parliament, which is very much akin to what happens in this House.  Was it Harold Wilson who said that all politics is local, and-----</p></speech>

When one is competing with local council issues and national issues, it is very hard to keep the international or European front on the radar.</p><p>From my own viewpoint, I am very lucky in that I have an excellent staff who pump out a huge volume of press statements almost on a daily basis.  We regularly monitor the number of hits we get.  Basically, the focus is the local media so, again, to come back to Tip O'Neill, all politics is local.</p><p>The Senator's suggestions in regard to Europe Day and the twinning of towns, which he applied in his own lord mayoralty of Cork, are excellent ideas.  One of the issues he touched on concerns the envisaged reduction in the number of MEPs.  As an Irish delegation, we sit down at the very start, whether we are from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Labour, and we try to cover as many committees as possible, particularly those that are of vital importance to Ireland.  We are not entitled to be on more than one committee as a full member, so I am a full member on the committee dealing with transport and tourism, for example, and Mr. Pat The Cope Gallagher is a full member on the fisheries committee, where he does a very good job.  We try to spread the resources in that way.  One can be a full member of one committee and a substitute member of another.  As a substitute member, one does not have full voting rights and one can only attend if one asks to substitute for somebody else.</p><p>If we were to lose one of our MEP seats, our strength and representation at the committees, particularly the vital committees, would be further diminished.  It is not looking good in that regard so, as a country, we need to look at this.  I believe it is unfair by virtue of the fact the elections will probably be over this time next year yet we still do not know the configuration for those elections.  Indeed, the local elections are happening and we still do not know what the new electoral boundaries will be.  Subsequent to that announcement, we will then have an electoral committee which will look at the European scene.  While that could be done overnight in terms of just assessing the population of the different countries, different constituencies and so on, we need to know this as a matter of urgency.</p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnout referred to obesity.  As she may be aware, I have been raising the issue of obesity regularly.  I put very strongly to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, that home economics should be compulsory right up to junior certificate.</p></speech>

I believe, given the growing obesity problem that has been highlighted through "Operation Transformation" and the statistics on the medical costs to the HSE and the wider social costs, that this should be done immediately.  Unfortunately, it is a problem we are not coming to grips with.</p><p>The Senator mentioned the role of the citizens.  As a result of the Lisbon treaty, a petition can be made to the Parliament, although this requires 1 million signatures.  However, many people are not aware that the Parliament has a procedure known as &quot;written declarations&quot;.  If somebody comes forward with a particular policy proposal and can get that policy proposal signed by 50% of MEPs, it then becomes an obligation on the European Commission to produce a report based on it, which forces the Commission to take action.</p><p>To give one example, a number of years ago, I happened to spot in a newspaper during the summer recess that the European Commission was taking the Kingdom of Denmark to the European Court of Justice because Denmark was introducing a maximum threshold of 3% for hydrogenated fats, or trans-fats, which are found in, for example, spreadable margarines, and are a major cause of coronary disease.  Here we had the European Commission, which hands out diktats in regard to how citizens and countries should behave, taking Denmark to the European Court of Justice.  After I spotted it, Ms Linda McAvan, the UK MEP, Mr. Dan J&oslash;rgensen, the Danish MEP, and I got a written declaration signed by more than 50% of the European Parliament, which forced the Commission to withdraw its proceedings.  Not alone that, it is now introducing as a mandatory minimum the measure for which it was going to take the Kingdom of Denmark to the European Court of Justice.  This shows the value of the procedure.</p><p>To give one example, a number of years ago, I happened to spot in a newspaper during the summer recess that the European Commission was taking the Kingdom of Denmark to the European Court of Justice because the Kingdom of Denmark was introducing a maximum threshold of 3% for hydrogenated fats, or trans-fats, which are found in, for example, spreadable margarines, and are a major cause of coronary disease.

Not alone that, it is now introducing as a mandatory minimum the measure it was going to take the Kingdom of Denmark to the European Court of Justice for.  This shows the value of the procedure.</p><p>Another very useful committee from the point of view of citizens engaging is the petitions committee.  Where an individual or a community feel they have a grievance against a state agency, such as a local authority, a Government department or a semi-state body, they can bring a petition before the petitions committee and have it heard and adjudicated upon.  Three families, the Farren family from Carndonagh, County Donegal, the Gallagher family from Achill, County Mayo, and the Keane family from Ballylongford, County Kerry, came to me some time ago.  The situation in regard to the Farren family is that they lost their beautiful daughter, Sinead Farren-McDaid.  She was travelling on a road she travelled every day.  Donegal County Council had resurfaced the road, left loose chippings on the road and provided only a small sign, which I understand had fallen on the grass.  Having travelled that road every day, Sinead thought she could drive at normal speed.  She came over a bump in the road, hit the loose chippings, which had not been swept, and it was the equivalent of driving on black ice.  She died in the ambulance on the way to Altnagelvin Hospital.</p><p>In the case of Ashling Gallagher, Mayo County Council put down a sub-surface known as dense bitumen macadam, which had not been finished.  The signs were left up stating one could drive at 100 km/h and the markings were on the road as if it was a 100 km/h safe driving zone.  It was a wet day.  Ashling went in under a dump truck and her body was laid out on Christmas day at her home.  In the case of the Keane family of Ballylongford, Eileen Keane and her boyfriend, Trevor Tuite, went through a junction where there was no yield sign or any other sign.</p><p>The families could get absolutely no joy from the local authorities in question.  They were not looking for compensation.  All they wanted was an acknowledgement that the local authorities were responsible for the deaths of their three beautiful daughters.  They came out to Europe at my invitation.</p> <p>Tina Leonard came to do a documentary for RTE.  She had tracked the family from their home in Donegal to their hotel and to the European Parliament and as a result the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport is conducting a major inquiry into the deaths of the three girls, which I think will hear experts from the Netherlands.</p><p>The week before last the West on Track people, of whom Senator Leyden is well aware, came to air their grievance that money has not been provided to enable the final phase of the railway line from Athenry to Tuam and Claremorris to go ahead and they got an excellent hearing.  As a result the Petitions Committee is coming to the west to see the underspend on infrastructure, even though this has increased and improved greatly as a result of our accession to the European Union.</p><p>I do not think that power is moving to the centre.  There is a perception that France and Germany are the engines but we have always used the slogan that we are at the heart of Europe and it is generally recognised that even though this is an island off an island, we are very much at the heart of Europe.  As regards the MFF, which Senator Reilly also raised, the way to go is to have a multi-annual financial framework rather than coming back every year.  If it gets through the Parliament, it will be worth &euro;960 billion, which will cover 2014 to 2020.  The hold up is that it is looking for an additional &euro;11 billion for the rest of this year.  That is the fly in the ointment.</p><p>The Senator mentioned youth unemployment.  That is a major issue when one considers that in Italy and Spain 56% of the youth are unemployed.  The safety valve here is emigration which is not a desirable one, but it has certainly reduced the pressure.  We must give the youth guarantee fund initiative, which has been announced, a chance and see how it operates.  As for the comment about the role of national parliaments, when I told my colleagues in the bureau that I and other MEPs would be addressing the Seanad and exchanging views with it, they were envious.  This is a model that can be adopted in other countries.  We need greater liaison between the domestic parliaments and the European Parliament.</p><p>There are only four of us, Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness, Se&aacute;n Kelly, Gay Mitchell and me, and although we are small fish in a big pond, we have managed to get a considerable amount of leeway on reports and so on.  For example, this week I finished a report on changing from analogue to digital tacographs which are tamper proof.  I am now in the throes of preparing a report on barrier-free tolling throughout the European Union which we are hoping will be the norm by 2020.  I like to think that we punch above our weight within our respective groups, not only my group but the Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour MEPs within their group.</p><p>With regard to the debt deals and getting further concessions from the EU, an awful lot depends on the German elections.  If they were out of the way we would be talking business and wringing more concessions from the EU.  Dr. Merkel has a problem and the Bavarian and other local elections have not gone particularly well for her.</p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins is right to say that Senator Cummins deserves to be commended on his initiative in inviting us here.  As regards trade, if we compare our pre-1973 figures with today's figures we can see that the great advantage in our participation in the EU is that, first, it has freed us from the shackles of being almost entirely dependent on the UK market, and, second, it has given Ireland the role of a gateway for US investment which is beginning to flow in our direction again.  We like to boast of our labour relations climate because we do not strike any more, and thankfully what is happening at the Labour Relations Commission and Croke Park II will ensure that we have stable labour relations for the foreseeable future.  We are English speaking, highly educated and so on, and the Americans see us as the gateway to that huge market of almost 500 million people.</p><p>I take the point about the fodder.  I am confident that as the history of this decade is written it will be seen as only a bump on the horizon and that Europe will get back to being a prosperous union based on principles of economic stability and solidarity.</p><p>Senator C&aacute;it Keane spoke about the future of Europe.  I am optimistic that General De Gaulle's dream of a united Europe, stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals, is happening, if slowly.  I sit between Latvians and Lithuanians every day and they are very proud to be part and parcel of the Union.  I have already given the example from Poland.</p><p>I was delighted that Senator Susan O'Keeffe was nominated to the Seanad.  She spoke about the count in Castlebar, where there was an allegation regarding votes which backfired on the individual in question, and during the European election campaign Senator O'Keeffe played no small part in burying Libertas and consigning it to the dustbin, hopefully once and for all.  Her nomination here was well deserved and I follow her career.  She made a point about small farmers.  I regularly meet the farming organisations and there are huge divisions between the IFA, the ICSA and the ICMSA around decoupling.  The big issue is whether there will be redistribution of the single farm payment.  I believe it is very wrong that some farmers get &euro;50 per hectare whereas others get &euro;1,200 per hectare.  We need to re-balance that payment.  The IFA is detached from the other two organisations in its stance on the issue.  It is all to be played for.  One of the big issues was that the Commissioner, Mr. Cioloş, wanted to propose a flattening of payments, in other words, one payment per hectare.  The IFA says this would be a disincentive and is hung up on the active, productive farmer and so on.  The Commissioner then proposed a guaranteed minimum payment of &euro;196 per hectare but some of the farming organisations are against that.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has a battle on his hands on that issue.</p><p>Much of the easy stuff was disposed of at the trialogues but we are now into the heavy lifting.  I hope that this will happen and deliver a final package to us that will give small farmers more assistance than they now get.  I am reasonably confident that it will happen during the Irish Presidency because after this Lithuania holds the Presidency for the first time.  No disrespect to Lithuania, but I do not know that it will have the skill and know-how to deal with the intractable issues if they are not dealt with before 30 June.</p><p>Senator Bacik made a point about the structures.  They are very much the same as those in the Oireachtas.  The Commission makes a proposal which goes to the Council and to the Parliament.  It does not go straight into a full sitting of the Parliament but to the committees.  That is where the work is done to improve something from the Commission.  It then goes to trialogues where the Commission, Parliament and the Council sit down together and thrash it out.  Then it goes for a second reading into the full sitting of the Parliament.</p> <p>There is a great deal of scrutiny.  It is a little like the work that is done by a joint or select committee in that what happens at committee level is seldom if ever reported.  Unfortunately, it is only what is done in the plenary sessions that tends to be covered, but they do not receive all that much coverage either.  The two newspapers which have permanent representatives in Brussels are <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Examiner, </i>which would not have the same level  of circulation.  Unfortunately, the <i>Irish Independent </i>does not have a permanent presence in Brussels despite its large circulation at domestic level. </p><p> I hope I have dealt with most of the points raised.  I thank the Members for their courtesy, kind words, attention and input.</p></speech>

Is cuairteoir rialta &eacute; sa Teach agus t&aacute;imid thar a bheith bu&iacute;och de faoi sin.</p><p>I am grateful the Minister is back in the House and acknowledge that he is here on a regular basis.  </p><p>To put matters in context, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have proposed the establishment of a national disability strategy implementation and monitoring unit, which would set annual targets in order to ensure full delivery of such a strategy.  We believe that taking a rights-based approach to policy implementation and change should not be disregarded during a recession.  We are committed to protecting income supports and necessary public and social services for people with disabilities. </p> <p>The gains made in previous years for people with disabilities have been under attack from the Government through its programme of cutbacks.  These vulnerable persons are paying for the disastrous policies and practices of the Government, banks and big business which led to the economic collapse.  People with disabilities have had their incomes cut.  Services are under increasing strain and funding for the voluntary organisations providing services and advocacy services for people with disabilities has also been cut.  </p><p>The Government should lead by example.  The number of public servants has been reduced significantly.  My question could be asked of a number of Ministers because it seeks to discover how many people with disabilities work in each Department.  What is the Government target for an increase in the level of representation of people with disabilities?  Nice policy documents are all very well, but the Government and Departments should be proactive in employing people with disabilities to ensure they are given a chance to be gainfully employed.  This would set a good example for other employers.  I ask the Minister to provide an indication of the Government's policy on this issue, state the number of people with disabilities employed in each Department and a timescale for improving on that number.</p></speech>

I will relieve him of any mystery by saying my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is primarily responsible as the co-ordinating Minister across Departments.  I am replying to this debate because she is abroad on Government business.  I know this is an area in which she has substantial commitment.  I will deal with some of the issues raised by the Senator who may take some added value from this information.</p><p>  The national disability strategy was launched in September 2004 and its implementation continues to be the focus of Government policy for the sector.  Key elements of the strategy include the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the sectoral plans of key Departments which set out how they will deliver services for people with disabilities.  However, a specific implementation plan for the strategy had not previously been developed, but this issue is now being addressed by the Government.  The programme for Government states:<blockquote>The Government will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources, and ensure whole of government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector.</blockquote>The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality, mental health and older people, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has established and is chairing a new group to develop an implementation plan for progressing the strategy in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  The new group has replaced the national disability strategy stakeholder monitoring group while maintaining the cross-departmental focus and collaboration with stakeholders.</p><p>  The implementation plan is developing well, with the identification by Departments of actions, time lines and key performance indicators, KPIs.  Discussions are ongoing between the disability stakeholders' group and Departments in an effort to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the plan.  Once all parties are agreed on the plan, it will be published as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>  The aim of the implementation plan is, through engaging with the disability sector and building on the traditional problem solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector, to make progress to achieve our common interests.  More targeted, innovative and flexible services, designed and delivered on the basis of the evidence drawn from systematic evaluation, will help to ensure available resources are used to deliver services that meet the needs of the community as efficiently and effectively as possible.  Acknowledging the current economic climate and diminished resources available across government, the implementation plan will seek to ensure available resources are used to the best effect in ensuring the living standards and access to essential services for people with disabilities are maintained.</p><p>  The implementation group comprises the senior officials group on disability which represents all relevant Departments and agencies across government.  A broad representation of disability organisations and the National Disability Authority has also been appointed to the group, as have a number of individuals with disabilities who have been appointed in a personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the group.</p><p>  In order to achieve further consultation with people with disabilities who are the users of the services provided by public bodies, the Minister of State has also set up a disability forum under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority.  The first meeting of the disability forum was held on 19 June 2012.  A report on the views expressed forms part of the considerations of the implementation group on the actions included in the implementation plan.  As before, the National Disability Authority is helping Departments in setting performance indicators and outcomes for the plan's targets.  One-on-one meetings with Departments were held during 2012 to assist them in identifying actions to be included in the implementation plan.  Work by the authority on disability indicators has been signed off on by the senior officials group on disability and the disability stakeholder group.</p><p>  With regard to employment in Departments, the Disability Act 2005 provides that public bodies shall, as far as practicable, take all reasonable steps to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities.  It also provides a framework for monitoring the employment target, currently set at 3% in all public bodies, through departmental monitoring committees.  The role of the monitoring committees is to monitor and, in consultation with the National Disability Authority, encourage compliance with the Act by all of the public bodies within the remits of the relevant Ministers.  The authority has an overall monitoring and reporting role under the Act.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility under the Act for setting and monitoring the targets for Departments and other bodies staffed by civil servants.  Other Ministers are responsible for public bodies accountable to them.  Each Department and public body is accountable for its own performance under the Act in promoting and supporting the employment of people with disabilities and meeting the target.</p><p>  The National Disability Authority publishes an annual report in compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act since this became a legal obligation in 2006.  The most recent report, published in 2012, is based on data provided for 2011.  It shows that for the first time the proportion of staff with disabilities reported across the public service as a whole reached 3.1%.  Departments averaged an employment figure of 4.2%.  For a number of years all Departments had successfully achieved or surpassed the 3% target.  However, in 2011 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the newly established Department with a very small complement of staff, was just below the target at 2.4%.  It was the only Department not to achieve the target in 2011; all other Departments achieved compliance, with percentages ranging from 3.2% to 6.6%.<br /><b></b> The Deputy will appreciate that with the significant number of civil servants leaving through early retirement schemes and the current recruitment embargo, it is a significant achievement for Departments to reach and maintain the target for the employment of people with disabilities in recent years.  The data for the numbers of employees in Departments for 2012 are being collated and will not be available until the autumn.  However, the percentages achieved by individual Departments, according to the report on 2011 data, are as follows: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, 3.2%; Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, 3.2%; Department of Children and Youth Affairs, 2.4%; Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, 5%.  One of the my two Departments, the Department of Defence, has a figure of 4%, with the figure for civilian employees at 5.4%.  The figures for the Department of Education and Skills is 3.4%; the Department of Finance, 3.9%; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 3.5%; the Department of Health, 6%; and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, 6.6%.  My second Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, has a figure of 5.4%.  The figure for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is 6.5%; the Department of Social Protection, 4.2%; the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, 4.1%; the Department of the Taoiseach, 4.7%; and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, 5.1%.  The total average figure is 4.2%.  I am very pleased that the two Departments in which I have the privilege to be Minister have rightly and substantially exceeded the 3% target and it is my objective that we will continue to do so.</p></speech>

A review will take place of the numbers who have left the public service and we look forward to getting the figures in the autumn.  Does the Minister believe the Government will relax the embargo in cases where it is important to increase the percentage, for example, in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs where it is below the average figure?  Will he ask the Government to relax the embargo in certain cases to ensure we reach the target of 3%?</p></speech>

Obviously, we must stick to the strict financial parameters within which we are operating, but within these parameters, as the Senator kindly acknowledged, the overall objective is being achieved.  There are some Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs which I mentioned where it has not been fully achieved.  Let us wait to see the figures for 2012 and if all Departments have managed to achieve that objective.  Obviously, I am conscious that staff are retiring and of the need to keep an eye on this area to ensure we meet our objectives.</p></speech>

The fact that he is here to address this matter is very telling and I suspect there might be some good news.  I actually raised this matter on the Adjournment this time last year because the Equality Authority provided what I would describe as extremely cost-effective and successful equality training for small and medium-sized businesses.  Many of the businesses which availed of the training provided now have very strong equality statements in place and some of the things about which my good friend and colleague, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, spoke are in place and people from myriad backgrounds, whether they are from different countries or ethnic groups or people with different disabilities, are working very successfully in the private sector, as the O2 ability awards have acknowledged.  The training was funded primarily by the European Union and the Equality Authority through the Minister's Department, but, unfortunately, the programme was shelved a couple of years ago.  The reply I received on the last occasion from a Minister speaking on the Minister's behalf outlined the fact that another panel would be established which would provide this service.  The exact title of the panel was that it was a panel of equality experts for equality mainstreaming support to the SME sector.  Expressions of interest were sought and a shortlist was drawn up, but the process has stalled.</p><p>I understand the funding being provided by the European union will come to an end at the end of 2013.  As we are now in May, we really only have seven or eight months in which to facilitate companies in providing training through this very good initiative.  I do not know what the reason for the blockage is.  Perhaps the Minister is not even aware that there is a blockage, but I respectfully suggest to all parties concerned that it is a no-brainer; there is a need to establish the panel and get on with it because it is primarily being paid for by the European Union as part of its obligations under various UN conventions.  We are on the cusp of ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and making ground-breaking changes in amalgamating the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission which will be the benchmark for equality services in this country for decades.  It will establish very strong and powerful foundations which will help us to meet our international obligations.  The problem is the enormous economic recession which has affected the SME sector very badly and, unfortunately, equality training and equality principles can be on the first line of attack when it comes to making cutbacks.  Without funding from the European Union, companies will not be in a position to afford this training and it is incumbent on us to ensure it is provided.  </p><p>I look forward to the Minister's reply which I hope will be as positive and comprehensive as that given to Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-05-16a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013051600021#U00700"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and very much appreciate his long-standing interest in this area.  I am not sure I will be able to give him as full a reply as he seeks, but in so far as there is any information missing, I assure him I will revert to him in that regard.</p><p>I take the opportunity to emphasise my continued commitment and that of the Government to promoting good employment and equality practices by all employers in Ireland, including those in the SME sector.  As we have highlighted on a number of occasions, there is a body of evidence that, in addition to improving the welfare of workers, such practices have advantages for firms in improving competitiveness and stimulating innovation.  </p><p>The panel to which the Senator refers relates to activities undertaken by the Equality Authority under an overall equality mainstreaming approach programme.  This programme was set up under the 2007-13 human capital investment operational programme in Ireland.  The equality mainstreaming activity is jointly funded by the European Social Fund and from the Equality Authority's grant-in-aid provision to a maximum of &euro;4 million over the period of the ESF programme.  In this context, expenditure incurred in 2014 is also covered.</p><p>Overall, the programme aims to contribute to improving access to the labour market for specific groups experiencing barriers to employment.  It does this by supporting small and medium enterprises, providers of vocational education and training and providers of labour market programmes to make institutional changes to combat discrimination, promote equality and accommodate diversity.  The selection of individual projects for funding is a matter for the project management within the criteria set out and agreed with the ESF for the overall programme.  There are a number of distinct strands to the programme.</p><p>Support packages are provided for vocational education providers, training providers and labour market programme providers and trade union and employer networks.  Research is funded to support the knowledge base on groups vulnerable to discrimination across the nine grounds protected under equality legislation.  The development of resource materials is funded, supporting good practice in combating discrimination, promoting equality and accommodating diversity.  For example, an employer's guide to equality in the workplace was developed with the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and is actively disseminated within the SME sector by that body.  A fourth strand involves the provision of consultancy support benefiting enterprises in the form of projects undertaken on a sectoral basis with groups of enterprises and other stakeholders and such support is ongoing.</p><p>In the first four years of the programme equality expertise was also made available to enterprises on an individual basis under a grants scheme for SMEs.  Under this scheme small businesses have been offered from one to four days consultancy support by expert equality trainers and facilitators to put in place equality policies and practices.  This support was paid for directly by the Equality Authority.  Some 282 individual SMEs benefited from direct interventions of this nature, with spending on the SME grants scheme amounting to &euro;759,000.</p><p>As I explained, the Equality Authority, in its role of project manager, has responsibility for the selection of individual projects for funding.  In preparing its  work plans, the authority is advised by a national framework committee comprising the social partners, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Finance and other stakeholders.  The Senator will be aware that this committee took a decision in early 2011 that it would not be prudent to operationalise the SME grants scheme in that year.  In the current difficult economic environment it proposed that a sectoral project approach, through which equality expertise could be made available to enterprises, might be an effective mechanism for engagement with the SME sector.</p> <p>Accordingly, the SME grants scheme did not operate in 2011 or 2012 and it is not planned to operate it in 2013.</p><p>I support the decision that was made by the authority, which is a valid one, in the very difficult economic budgetary context we face.  While the Equality Authority has made no announcement regarding its priorities, under this programme for 2014, I am advised that the authority has not closed the door on re-instating an SME grant in the future, if and when the budgetary outlook is more favourable.  I thank the Senator for raising the important topic, of the mainstreaming of equality.  </p></speech>

I hope that some provision will be made in the 2014 budget for the scheme because a demand exists.  A set of companies which have tried to access equality training before, when it was available, would benefit enormously.  We will keep an eye on the matter.</p></speech>

I must attend an engagement so I owe her a favour.  I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his stewardship of the Seanad this week and for allowing me to speak twice during the Adjournment debate.  I appreciate his efforts.</p><p>In County Meath there are significant issues that need a response from the Government this evening or this week.  My issue relates to the future provision of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The matter is urgent, particularly in light of the recent proposal to group hospitals.  The Navan hospital is now part of the miscellaneous group that includes hospitals as far away as Wexford and Kilkenny.  </p><p>Yesterday the report entitled Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: A Framework for Development was published.  What services will be provided in Navan in the future?  Paragraph 3.2, overview of services at a Model 2 hospital, clearly states: &quot;The hospital will have a daytime Urgent Care Centre comprising a Medical Assessment Unit and Local Injuries Unit which will be open where feasible 7 days a week.&quot;  With regard to an intensive care at Navan hospital, paragraph 3.3, medical and critical care services for a model 2 hospital, states: &quot;This hospital will not have an ICU.&quot;</p><p>I am also concerned about the provision of orthopaedic services.  The Navan hospital has been grouped with a number of hospitals, including Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital.  Does that mean that services will be moved out of Navan hospital?  I am aware of one Meath person who is due to undergo an operation this week at the orthopaedic unit of the Navan hospital and will need an ICU bed post-operation.  I understand from the report that such a person, even if orthopaedic services remained at Navan, would not be treated there due to the closure of the ICU unit, as per the smaller hospitals report.</p><p>Contrary to the contents of the smaller hospitals report, local Fine Gael Deputies have been out and about and stated in the media that the report was wrong about the services and that they will not close.  I seek clarity from the Minister on the future provision of services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The provision of hospital services is a huge issue in County Meath and 15,000 people protested in October 2010.  At the time the Minister for Health and Children gave an assurance that services in Navan would not be downgraded.  The new report suggests a change of mind and that he broke his promise.</p><p>In the weeks approaching the 2011 general election the Fine Gael team in Meath gave a commitment to provide a regional hospital for the north east in Navan.  At the time they said that they were working on the initiative with a number of investors who could participate in a public private partnership.  Today's Adjournment is a good forum to debate the matter.  Yesterday the hospital report was published but there was no Topical Issues debate on it in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know if there will be a Topical Issues debate today on the subject.  The Seanad is a good forum to seek a clear answer from the Government on the future of Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.        </p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising the matter and for the opportunity to discuss the reports that were launched on Tuesday.  They signal a fundamental modernisation of the health system in line with best practice.</p><p>We know that the traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  The formation of acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  In the longer term, each group's viability and future prosperity will be realised by its ability to deliver a comprehensive range of services across the group.</p><p>The establishment of hospital groups will see small and larger hospitals working together as one.  This is a key foundation stone for the eventual abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance for the people.  These huge reforms will take time but the establishment of hospital groups is a significant milestone in achieving the vision set out in the Future Health initiative.</p><p>Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals: A Framework for Development, which the Minister also published on Tuesday, offers clear information about the role of our smaller hospitals and what they will do in the future.  The framework focuses, in particular, on the role of nine smaller hospitals, including Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</p><p>The hospital has the potential to carry out more complex surgery than most of the other smaller hospitals.  More patients will be treated in Navan as part of the new hospital group.  The hospital will do more work in a large number of areas including day surgery, diagnostics, rehabilitation and chronic disease management.  Accident and emergency services will continue on a 24-7 basis as capacity issues within the group remain unresolved.  Endoscopy services will be enhanced.  Elective endoscopy and day surgery services will be further developed, including general surgery, gynaecology and urology to maximise utilisation of resources and reduce waiting times.  Outpatient services will also be expanded.  Discussions will commence immediately within the group to draw up a plan to address the issue in the context of the strategic plan which the group must develop within a year of its formation.</p><p>All hospital groups are required to submit a strategic plan in which to outline its plans for future services within the group area.  Consultation will be a key component of this planning, including consultation with local communities.  Smaller hospitals will play a crucial role in the delivery of services.  The framework for smaller hospitals commits to the expansion of services delivered in smaller hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery, ambulatory care, medical services and diagnostics.  In this regard, a new ED-minor injury unit is being constructed in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</p><p>When groups are established services can be exchanged between sites.  This will result in the maintenance of activity in smaller hospitals.  It will allow them to focus on the provision of high volume less complex care that is safe and appropriate.  The measure is intended to lead to significant increases in overall activity in these hospitals providing care as close as possible to the local people's home.  </p></speech>

Today is the first time that I have heard the new emergency department in Navan referred to as the &quot;new minor injury unit&quot;.  That is its formal description in the Government's reply.  I am not making a personal attack on the Minister of State.  He simply read the statement on behalf of the Minister who did not attend.  We have been told that a new accident and emergency department is being constructed but today it was described as an &quot;ED-minor injury unit&quot;.  That would accord with the smaller hospitals framework document.</p><p>  The Minister and the Government have stated:<blockquote>Accident and emergency services will continue on a 24-7 basis as capacity issues remain unresolved. Discussions will commence immediately within the group to draw up a plan to address the issue in the context of the strategic plan which the group must develop within a year of its formation.</blockquote></p> <p>As I see it, services in Navan, particularly the accident and emergency department and the intensive care unit, are on death row.  They are continuing for now but plans are afoot to get into the detail of how they will be stopped.  That is completely wrong and unfair, particularly in light of the fact that the regional hospital has been taken out of the picture and that Navan is outside of the group containing the other hospitals in the north east, which I find astonishing.  Now we have to wait to see what the capacity issues in the Mater Hospital are before anything happens in Navan.  There will be huge disappointment in County Meath in this regard and I will pursue the matter with the Minister for Health himself in due course.</p></speech>

Construction work is going on there at the moment and units will be built.  However, we all know that if there is major trauma involved, patients will have to be transferred to one of the larger hospitals.  In Donegal, such patients must go to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.  With all due respect, patients in Navan would not have to travel the same distances.  The short response I have just read contains a list of guarantees which should reassure the people of Navan that their hospital will continue to operate as a vital cog in the wheel of health services provision for the people in the eastern region.</p></speech>

I wish to draw attention to the plight of a young man I met recently, a 22 year old constituent of mine suffering from a rare, debilitating condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type.  This young man is severely disabled as a result of this condition and displays marked, widespread joint hypermobility.  Basically, he is constantly suffering dislocations, up to 18 times per day.  As he is prone to recurrent dislocations he frequently requires hospital accident and emergency admissions, particularly for his left shoulder.  This is the only joint, according to his mother, that he cannot replace himself.  It is pitiful to see such a young man in this condition.  While he can put his fingers back into place, he cannot put his shoulder back and every seven to ten days, he is admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, where he has to be completely anaesthetised so that his shoulder can be put back into place.  This has been ongoing since he was diagnosed with this rare condition.  It has interfered with his schooling and prevented him from taking part in the normal, everyday activities that most young people engage in.</p><p>  After a case conference of consultants in 2012, it was accepted by the consultants that there was no one in Ireland who could treat this young man and he was referred by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon to Britain for treatment.  I have all of the documentation relating to this referral.  His travel was approved by the treatment abroad scheme and he went to Britain.  It seemed that a solution had been found and that he could undergo a rehabilitation programme which was due to commence in September 2012.  He went to England and was assessed by an orthopaedic team there.  However, on 14 September last, the day before he was due to travel for his treatment, he was informed that his costs would not be covered by the scheme because the scheme did not cover second opinions.  Every time I have raised this matter, I have been told that the scheme does not cover a second opinion.  However, I have a letter from the orthopaedic consultant concerned who wrote to the HSE and said that he was puzzled by the HSE's decision.  He went on to point out that there is much correspondence in regard to this young man's problem and his application for treatment abroad.  The consultant confirmed that the young man has been seen by every specialist upper limb surgeon in Ireland, that his case was discussed at a shoulder conference and on foot of that case conference, his treatment in Britain was arranged.  The consultant argued that, in view of the fact the young man has already been seen by every upper limb specialist in Ireland, the decision and comments of the HSE were difficult to understand.</p><p>  I have read through all of the correspondence and I met the young man in person when I received extremely distressed correspondence from his mother.  It is dreadful that a 22 year old is frequently confined to a wheelchair when the dislocations become too much.  I am at a total loss as to why this case cannot be examined again.  He received a letter telling him to reapply for the scheme or to return to Cappagh Hospital or the orthopaedic surgeons he has already seen.  However, it is acknowledged, in writing, that he has been seen by every orthopaedic surgeon in the country.  </p><p>  I hope the Minister of State can provide some new insight into this case and, more importantly, some good news for this young man who is suffering terribly.  As I have already said, his condition has interfered with his life in a physical way but lately it has begun to affect him mentally.  In fact, there has been a danger to his life in recent months<b>.</b>  He feels at a total loss and that nobody can help him.  I do not know if this is a question of finance but one must ask how much it is costing the HSE to bring this man through accident and emergency and into theatre every week, with all of the associated expenses, including anaesthesia?  I would be really grateful if some solution could be found so that this young man can lead the active life to which he is entitled and which he could lead, if given the correct treatment.</p></speech>

Within these governing EU regulations and the Department of Health guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form S2, formally known as an El12.  </p><p>The TAS allows for an Irish-based medical consultant to refer a patient who is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets certain criteria, is not available within the State or is not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.  Following clinical assessment, the referring consultant certifies the following: the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient's needs; the treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment; the treatment is in a recognised hospital/institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner; and the hospital outside the State will accept EU/EEA form S2.  The application to refer a patient abroad has to be assessed by the HSE normally within 15 to 20 working days and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.  Appointments should not be scheduled prior to a decision being reached on an application.</p><p>The situation with this particular case is that the TAS of the HSE received an application from the person involved and issued a letter informing him that, in line with the governing EU regulations and Department of Health guidelines, his application did not meet the criteria for the scheme.  This decision was confirmed in a review of the case by the general manager of the TAS.  In order to advance this case, a letter was issued by the TAS to the person concerned following the review.</p> <p>The letter recommended that he seek a referral to the tertiary services in Ireland in the first instance and confirmed that should his consultant identify a treatment, as opposed to a request for a second opinion, then he is free to re-apply accordingly.  The HSE is not permitted to transfer a patient's care abroad without recourse to the EU regulations referred to above.  Until the HSE receives a valid application from the person it is not possible to progress the matter any further at this stage.</p></speech>

It is certainly not clear.  The Minister of State said he must go back to look for tertiary services, but he has done that and we have the letter to prove it.  The surgeon has stated that he has seen everyone in Ireland.  The treatment sought is in one of the most well-known hospitals in England.  Two consultant orthopaedic physicians, one a professor, have signed letters stating that he is in need of this treatment.  I am at a loss to understand the response to a request for something that is obviously minor, although perhaps I should not say minor.  I cannot fathom why it cannot be considered.  I strongly call on the Minister of State to take this back to the Minister for Health and perhaps open up correspondence with the family involved to encourage them.  They are not going to accept this.  They have given all the details.  I call on the Minister to enter into a correspondence to help this young man achieve the best of his ability rather than subject him to a life of pain.  He is experiencing excruciating pain on an ongoing basis and yet this treatment could help him and his family.  I have met his mother, who is totally distraught at this stage, as I or the Minister of State would be if one of my children or his children were in the same situation.</p></speech>

I realise the Senator has met this young person and is aware of the trauma he is experiencing.  I believe the door is not firmly shut and there is an opening as far as I can see.  As I have stated, until the HSE receives a valid application from the person it is not possible to progress the matter any further.  This means if a further, valid application is submitted it will be considered by the HSE.  All I can say at this stage is that Senator Moran's concerns and the points made will be brought to the attention of those whose responsibility it is to decide on the matter.</p></speech>
