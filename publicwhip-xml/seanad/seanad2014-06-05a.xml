I congratulate her on behalf of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il on her successful election.<br />The Leader did not refer to No. 5 on the Order Paper, report of the Committee of Selection, following the meeting which took place last night.  Where does the Government stand in that regard?  I congratulate Senators Se&aacute;n D. Barrett and Marc MacSharry on their selection to be members of the banking inquiry committee.  The meeting of the Committee of Selection was convened last night in accordance with the motion passed by the Seanad on 14 May.  The motion provided:<blockquote>(1) That, having regard to section 12 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 and Standing Order 103C, a Select Committee be appointed, to be joined with a similar Select Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to form the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, to develop a relevant proposal for conducting a &lsquo;Part 2 Inquiry&rsquo;...<br />(3) (a) The Select Committee shall consist of two (2) members who shall be nominated in accordance with Standing Order 89 and the provisions of Standing Orders 80(1) and (2) shall not apply.</blockquote>Standing Order 89 is very clear.  It states: <blockquote>There shall be appointed at the commencement of every Seanad a committee to be known as the Committee of Selection, which, unless it shall have been otherwise ordered, shall nominate the Senators to serve on Select or Special Committees and which shall have power to discharge members of such Committees from time to time for non-attendance or at their own request, and to appoint others in substitution ... The Committee of Selection shall consist of eleven Senators...</blockquote>It is clear, therefore, that the decision taken last night by the Committee of Selection is valid and was democratic.  What is the Government's position on it?  I assume the it will accept the democratic decision of an independent committee of the Seanad with representatives drawn from of all sides of the House.  Based on research we have carried out, I can see evidence that only once - in 1982 - has the decision of the Committee of Selection been challenged in the Seanad Chamber.   It is clear from looking at Standing Orders and the Government's motion that the decision on membership has been taken.  Will the Leader confirm that the Government will respect the democratic decision of the independent Committee of Selection of the House and ensure Senators Sean D. Barrett and Marc MacSharry are the two selected nominees to serve in the banking inquiry?  I would like the Leader to address this issue.  I want to deal with it in a proper fashion, as the Leader has always done, and have no reason to think that will not be the case.  The Committee of Selection has selected two members who have been selected under Standing Orders, the rules of the House and the Government Act.  They have been selected under the Government's motion that was passed in the House with our support.  I assume and ask the Leader to confirm that the Government will accept the two Senators elected to the committee from the Seanad, without political interference.  This should be done in order that we can move on and have the banking inquiry established.<br />The Government has been at pains to say - I agree with it - that this should not be a political inquiry.  It is about getting to the truth of what happened during the banking crisis.  I read media reports last night that there was concern that the Government would not have a majority on the committee.  I put it to the Leader that this should make no difference if it is to be an independent inquiry.  The party affiliations of any member of the committee should make no difference.  Will the Leader confirm that the Government will accept the decision of the Committee of Selection and tell us how we will move forward in that regard?</p></speech>

I am glad that we have the motion in that regard before us today to formally mark her election.</p><p>I welcome the announcement made by the Government that it is taking up the issue of the burial of almost 800 babies from the mother and baby home in Tuam between 1925 and 1961.  This is an issue that was raised first by Senator Hildegarde Naughton.  A number of other Senators and I raised it yesterday on the Order of Business.  I am glad that it is being taken up.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in due course on the issue of policing oversight.  The Government will publish legislation on GSOC, while the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is examining mechanisms for policing oversight.  It will undertake a fact-finding exercise in Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow to look at the Northern Irish and Scottish policing oversight bodies and at how we can best reform and amend our legislation to ensure better oversight of policing here.  I hope we will have a debate on the issue, not just on the legislation on GSOC, but also on the broader and more comprehensive review the joint committee is undertaking of Garda oversight mechanisms.</p><p>I welcome the comments and the news yesterday that the personal insolvency arrangements were being fast tracked.  Under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, we are seeing an innovative method used, whereby personal insolvency arrangements, PIAs, can be made for as short a period as three months.  This clearly will aid distressed debtors.  It has been described as a revolution in insolvency arrangements.  Perhaps we might have a debate in due course on a review of the Act, how it is being implemented in practice and the innovative arrangements being made.</p><p>In regard to the Committee of Selection, I know the Leader will respond to Senator Darragh O'Brien on behalf of the Government.</p></speech>

I welcome the interventions made by two of our stalwarts in the House, Senators Maurice Cummins and David Cullinane, and wish them every success.</p><p>I also welcome the news to be announced later of the appointment of Mr. Kevin O'Malley as ambassador of the United States to Ireland.  This is something for which we have asked.  Perhaps we might consider inviting the ambassador to visit the House in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014060500004#C00100"><p>I echo Senator Bacik's approval that some personal insolvency arrangements, or PIAs, have been fast-tracked by agreement with some lenders.  I highlight the plight of those who are borrowing from certain financial institutions which have made it abundantly clear that they do not intend to co-operate with the insolvency process and write down debt on family homes.  I reiterate the objections I voiced previously to the effect that it is unacceptable that some financial institutions have made it clear that they will not co-operate with a body established statutorily to assist people in mortgage distress.</p><p>On that note, I raise concerns in relation to the financial ombudsman.  It is perfectly clear from appearances before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and statements its representatives have made that the ombudsman's office views its remit very narrowly in terms of regulation of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and any other issues relating to personal debt and mortgage insolvency.  It is high time we reviewed the legislation underpinning the ombudsman.  It is not acceptable to have an independent ombudsman's office which sees itself as having no remit other than to decide whether procedures have been followed to the letter of the law.  It has no remit in relation to fairness and in particular as to whether any option offered by a bank is fair and sustainable.  In the current environment where some banks are behaving more responsibly than others, it is not good enough to have a so-called independent ombudsman's office which considers that it has no remit whatsoever in this regard.</p></speech>

I thought I might have been informed of the date as the one notified does not suit me.  I am surprised I was not consulted about the date as I issued the invitation.  People do have other commitments.</p></speech>

The Committee of Selection last night made the decision in a democratic manner.  The membership of the inquiry will be Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, the Chairman and a member of the Labour Party, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, Deputy John Paul Phelan, Deputy Michael McGrath, Deputy Pearse Doherty, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, Senator Sean Barrett and Senator Marc MacSharry.  It is a good inquiry and it has the credibility to go forward independently and examine the banking institutions.  I have great confidence in it, knowing in particular the calibre of the two Members from this House.  I will not speak to the calibre of the Members from the other House, who I am sure are of top quality.</p><p>I have known Senator Barrett since he entered the House and he has been exemplary in his work in every sphere of the Seanad's activity.  He may have contributed more than anyone else in the House to its workings.  He is a credit to the House.  He was very successful in fighting a campaign for the retention of the Seanad.  We owe him a great debt of gratitude in that regard.  </p><p>I have known Senator Marc MacSharry for very long time.  He is a man of the greatest integrity in public life and I have no doubt that he will play a very important role in the committee.  I note the work he did in the House during the term of the last Government when he fought for cancer services in Sligo without fear or favour.  He stood up and fought, irrespective of who was in government or what Minister was there and he will carry out his work in the banking inquiry in an exemplary manner.</p><p>Both Government and Opposition Members should be very fearful of any activity to disrupt the decision of the selection committee.  If Members engage in such activity, the banking inquiry will have no credibility whatsoever and should be walked away from.  If Members interfere with the decision of the selection committee, they will have to take the consequences of that action.  The Government is slipping every day.  It will slip further and the inquiry will never take place unless Senators Marc MacSharry and Sean Barrett are on it.</p></speech>

It would be appropriate given that we have recently existed the bailout and will soon be into budget preparation, for the House to discuss the recommendations which have been made.  They include implementation of current budgets, correcting the excessive deficit in 2015, reforming elements of the health care sector to increase cost-effectiveness and many other significant recommendations.  While we are not unique in that every other member state has received recommendations, it would be an appropriate, worthwhile and meaningful debate to have before the summer recess to ensure we can all feed into the budgetary process for the Minister.</p></speech>

Great efforts have been made to find a solution and the great news is that he arrived home this week to his wife and three children.  He has been in prison for seven years and his 24 year old, 20 year old, and 16 year old daughters had not seen him in that time.  It is a matter for great joy.  I raise it to say that the work of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Irish ambassador in India has been very helpful.  The family would wish that to be passed on.  Hopefully, this will be the end of these matters.</p><p>There is a case to be made for having a Minister for pensions.  The pensions crisis we are likely to experience in the future will eclipse the banking crisis of a few years ago yet we are not taking the steps we must.  As the population grows, the number of young workers being replaced by retired older people will go from five to one to three to one.  That will be an impossible situation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimates that in a number of years time the cost to the State of public sector pensions alone will be &euro;157 billion.  This is a huge matter, yet we merely say of pensions &quot;Oh yes, we must do something about that&quot;.  The case should be made to appoint a Minister for pensions in the very next Cabinet reshuffle or on the formation of the next Government but very shortly in any event.  That Minister would concentrate all of his or her efforts on the crisis that is facing us.</p></speech>

The post has been empty for approximately 18 months since Dan Rooney left it.  It is a very welcome development.  The relationship between Ireland and the USA is very important and the ambassadorial role is a key aspect of it.</p><p>Colleagues have referred to the banking inquiry.  While I congratulate those who have been appointed to it, I am very disappointed that there is no woman among the nine members.  I do not mean a woman should be appointed without regard to merit, but it shows that the wheels of power are slow to move, especially when it comes to gender balance.  We talk of boards not having enough women on them.  I do not often refer to women's issue and having more women on this that and the other, but it is disappointing that not one woman has been appointed among the nine.  It is a damning indictment of politics today.</p></speech>

I get the sense that we have a dead man walking in the Cabinet having seen media reports on the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  It appears the backbenchers in Fine Gael are finally coming to the conclusion we came to many months ago, which is that it is time for the Minister to go having regard to the number of debacles he has had on his watch.  It is a shame it has taken so long for the backbenchers to find their voices.</p><p>We should not wait for a reshuffle for the decision on the Minister to be made.  We see debacles continuing.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to clarify his relationship with the chair of the west-north-west hospital group in light of the fact that the report on the review of maternity services in the area was commissioned from a company of which that person owns 50%.</p> <p>The Minister needs to clarify his own relationship with the person in question.</p><p>At the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions yesterday, we considered the report of the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, on medical cards.  He raised alarming issues arising from the centralisation of the medical card process.  He said it appeared that when the system was centralised the files relating to how decisions on discretionary medical cards were made disappeared, or went to a place where they could not be found.  He has investigated a number of complaints about this issue on which the reports or files are not available, and he seems to indicate that this is a result of the centralisation process.  He also raised the issue of the delay in replacing the mobility and motorised transport grant schemes, which the Government is reviewing.  The grants were rescinded because the Ombudsman had highlighted an issue, but now he is concerned that people who need those grants have nothing available, and that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Will the Leader organise a debate on that issue?  We also need to find out why the files on discretionary medical cards do not appear to have been centralised when the medical card system was centralised.  It will be very difficult to review that system and to ensure that, if the Government is committed to returning medical cards to the people from whom they were taken, the decisions are based on proper information.</p></speech>

I think we are all agreed that it is important that we be fully aware of the consequences and implications of the online game formats.  We must remember that some are vulnerable to ease of access to gambling opportunities.  Earlier in the year, Senator O'Donnell raised concerns about this.  The State has yet to appoint a national lottery regulator as required under the relevant Act.  The new format of the games is being rushed out in advance of the appointment of a national lottery regulator.  We as legislators need to be assured that the new operators of the national lottery do not operate without regard to the common good in an attempt to maximise the return on the substantial investment that has been made.  I believe more attention must be paid to responsible gaming and not simply the return on investment.  I have written to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform requesting that representatives of the new operator be invited to appear before committee to outline their values, plans and priorities as we make the transition.  This is a very urgent matter, given the rush to secure the maximum online penetration before a national lottery regulator is formally established.  I am sure the Leader will agree with me on that point.</p></speech>

I believe the selection of Senators MacSharry and Barrett to sit on the banking inquiry augurs very well for the operation of that committee.  I do not have to outline their credentials, as we all know how accomplished and focused they are as members of the Oireachtas.  I do not have any doubt that they will fulfil their mandate without fear or favour on behalf of the people.</p><p>Those who knocked on doors during the recent elections know full well the hurt, the anger and the sense of helplessness that is being experienced by the public.  The idea of the banking inquiry has generated significant anticipation.  It is therefore vital that the committee does its job, which is to act on behalf of the people of Ireland, including those who cannot pay their mortgages, those who have lost their jobs and those who have emigrated to the four corners of the earth, and for that reason it will be monitored and assessed very carefully.  It is most important that it does not become a political quango.  It should not be used for political point-scoring.  Should that happen, it will lose credibility, and we cannot expect an outcome that will alleviate the suffering I have already mentioned.  My hope is that if the committee starts on the right track, leaving party politics aside, and doing one of the most important jobs that will ever have been done in the State, then we can start looking forward in earnest.  Although I accept that there have been improvements, we know that the people on the ground are disillusioned at this stage.  The only way we can overcome the attitude of the people is by showing them strength of character, honesty, integrity, commitment and focus.  It is good for this House that people of the calibre and character of Senators Sean D. Barrett and Marc MacSharry are the nominees of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to sit on this committee.  My hope is that there will be no misrepresentation.  If that were to happen - and I do not expect that it will - not only will we have done harm to this House, but we will have done excessive harm to the will of the people.  The people are waiting to see the Oireachtas Members doing a good job on their behalf and leaving politics to one side.</p></speech>

It is amusing that people are standing up and listening to Ombudsman reporting on this, while in the past three years I have repeatedly highlighted the issue of files going missing between Clontarf and Finglas.  It is time to review and revisit the operation of the PCRS.  I never agreed with the centralisation of the medical card system.  It is absolutely appalling that the HSE can now bring in a German company to review medical cards.  It has acted cynically on these issues.</p><p>It makes me laugh to see the high moral ground that has been taken by Fianna F&aacute;il on the review of medical cards and discretionary medical cards.  Let me remind the Members opposite that when they were in Government - I was a county councillor between 2004 and 2009-----</p></speech>

We all understand what is going on here.  Senator Barrett is the only qualified person in either House to ask the appropriate questions of bankers and regulators at the banking inquiry and he may find himself removed from the committee holding the inquiry for reasons that have nothing to with his competence or the national interest and everything to do with party political interests and pique.  I ask Members to look into their hearts for one glorious moment, pretend they are not in a party and look at the 4.6 million people in the country and what they have gone through as a result of the behaviour of the banks and decide who they think are the best people to have on the committee of inquiry and if Senator Barrett is one of them.  That is the only question Members should ask.</p></speech>

I do not agree with the cutbacks.  Everything was done wrong.  All these problems began the night the two main parties supported the bank guarantee.

No. 5 is a motion on the report of the committee.  There is no requirement for such a motion to come before the House because Standing Orders are prescriptive and we cannot rewrite history.  As a member of the committee, I had to make a decision, as did all committee members, and we did so last night arising from a motion passed in the House some weeks ago, which said a select committee carrying out a banking inquiry should include two members nominated in accordance with Standing Order 89.  That was in black and white.  There was no shade of grey and it was prescriptive.  The motion was passed.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann instructed the selection committee by a overwhelming vote of Members not to consider, submit or present two names but to nominate two Members to sit on the banking inquiry under Standing Order 89.</p><p>We need to be cautious about what we do because the Standing Order - we all fought to preserve the House last year on the basis that it is independent, not a creature of Government and stands on its own two feet - does not suggest but simply prescribes that there should be a Committee of Selection and that it shall nominate the Senators to serve on particular committees.  That is the job of work which we were asked to do last night and which we completed.  Some people are disappointed with the outcome but the Standing Order is clear.</p><p>It is disturbing to hear on the media and coming from certain sources concerns that the Government would not have a majority on the committee.  If the committee is formulated arising from divisions in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, there would be members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and the Independents on it.  The purpose of the select committee should not be that one side or the other has a majority; it should be that the committee comprises people who would do an independent job on behalf of the people.  If we look at the committee as being about Government versus Opposition, majority versus minority, it will start in a negative fashion.  We have to respect the motion passed in the House some weeks ago.  I am sorry for exceeding my time but this is important.  We must fully respect a motion passed in the House and we must fully respect the Standing Orders of the House.  If we attempt to do other than that, we will create a dangerous precedent.</p></speech>

However, while I have chaired the Committee of Selection, there have been 17 decisions, culminating in last night's decision, which have been put to the House.  During my term, last night's meeting was the first at which a democratic voting process took place as set out in the normal circumstances.  Will the Leader reflect on the implications of usurping the decision of the committee for Standing Orders?  In addition, in the context of precedent, there was only one time in the past 60 years when a decision of the committee was challenged in the House and the outcome was the House upheld the decision following a division.  As the committee chairman, I have to be careful not to impose my view and I must be fair and impartial.  I ask the Leader and the Government to seriously reflect on any effort to revisit the issue, which, as chairman, I would be slow to do.  Any other political attempt to usurp the democratic decision of the committee would want to be carefully thought out.</p><p>I wish Senator Norris well.  He has been out sick and he attended the committee meeting.  He came in with one mission in mind, which was to support his TCD colleague, Senator Barrett.  That demonstrates his commitment to the task.  Whatever about his physical and medical difficulties, there is nothing wrong with his brain.  He is still acute and sharp and his comments did not do Senator Barrett harm when he was unanimously accepted as one of the two nominees.</p> <p>With that in mind, I hope the issue can be resolved fairly and properly.  Senator Maurice Cummins is very fair and a good Leader of the Seanad.  I hope he can forget his role on behalf of the Government and do the right thing on behalf of the House.</p></speech>

We will see flights to Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Fuerteventura and Cracow continuing in the winter schedule.  These flights commenced in April and it was intended that they would operate just for the summer period.  This is a very significant announcement, given that there will be an extra 24 flights a week during the winter period between Shannon Airport and these European destinations.  It is a significant vote of confidence by Ryanair in Shannon Airport.  It means that what the Government is doing in having an independent Shannon Airport, with a focused aviation policy and marketing strategy, is working.  Coupled with the elimination of the travel tax, the continuation of the 9% VAT rate and the recalibration of the airport structure, these are very positive steps.  It will mean the continuation of jobs in the tourism sector and the creation of others during the off season in parts of Couny Clare, Limerick, County Kerry and the wider region.  I look forward to further significant announcements by other airlines when they announce their winter schedules in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

A test of that commitment will be whether it seeks to change the decision of the Committee of Selection of the Seanad on the make-up of the Members selected.</p><p>I welcome the news on the impending appointment of the US ambassador to Ireland.  As of last Monday, there were only 14 countries that did not have an ambassador appointed by the United States.  At least, we will have a new ambassador from St. Louis.  We look forward to his contribution in Ireland, including to the peace process, given the current position in dealing with the issues of parades and the past.</p><p>While talking about the past, the makers of last night's &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme on RTE should be complimented on their work in highlighting the torture that had taken place in the North of Ireland.  The decisions were taken at a high level in the British Government; Prime Ministers and Ministers and were aware that the torture of Irish citizens was taking place in the North of Ireland.  The matter was raised in the European Union by Jack Lynch.  The European Court found that the British had not tortured these citizens, but, of course, this was because information had been withheld from the judges.  Therefore, it is open to the Government to have the case reviewed.  In regard to the Ballymurphy massacre 40 years ago, when 11 people were killed by British soldiers in west Belfast in a matter of days, the British refuse to conduct any investigation.  Because of the work of RTE and the Pat Finucane Centre we are aware that British politicians took decisions to torture Irish citizens.  Why has the Government not asked the British ambassador to make available to it files on the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan, the killings in Ballymurphy, the torture of Irish citizens and the ruling of the European Court which were used by the US Government to justify the torture of Iraqi citizens.  The stress positions and five techniques used in Derry and Belfast sanctioned by the British Government were used on Iraqi citizens, most recently during the invasion of Iraq.</p></speech>

By way of comparison, the deficit in the first five months of last year was &euro;5.3 billion, whereas the deficit in the first five months of this year was &euro;3.5 billion.  It is clear, therefore, that the nation's finances are back on track, which is important.  That said, it is also important that we do not ignore the difficulties people are experiencing.  In that context, I raise the important issue of coastal erosion, particularly where properties are in danger.  While funding has been made available for harbours and piers and some coastal erosion projects, there are areas in which private properties are in danger and the works required are beyond the scope of any individual to undertake.  This is an issue we should examine.  There are thousands of properties from north to south and east to west which need immediate and specific works to be undertaken.  I am speaking, in particular, about my own area, County Wexford, which has the softest coastline in the country.  We should take the opportunity to bring in both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to put some measure in place to help those whose properties are in immediate danger.  As I said, we cannot take the nation's finances in isolation and ignore the individual.  If possible, we should debate the matter during this summer session in order to deal with it before the winter storms start.  There are properties that could fall into the sea in the next 12 months.</p></speech>

I hope this will accelerate progress on the ongoing issue of immigration reform in the United States now that we will have somebody in place in the Phoenix Park who will be able to act as a conduit not only for the Government but also the wider Irish public.  This is an issue that may seem to be under the radar, but it is just as hurtful and painful in its own way as many of the other issues raised in the House across the panoply of political activity.  I emphasise this is not about striking a separate deal for the Irish, given that some commentators seem to have completely misinterpreted the position, rather it is about comprehensive immigration reform from which I hope the Irish would benefit.  I applaud the actions of both the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in this regard since they took office in that they have kept the issue high on the agenda.  I have always believed the absence of an ambassador <i>in situ</i>here at a critical time in Irish-US relations, at a time when discussions on immigration reform were ongoing between Republicans and Democrats, would create a vacuum.  Now that we will have somebody in place, I suggest on behalf of this House the Leader write to the incoming ambassador to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well but also to point out that comprehensive immigration reform is a key issue for all sides of the House and one which we hope will be progressed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that it took 18 months for this appointment to be made, given the relationship between this island and the United States.</p><p>I congratulate Senator Barrett and Senator MacSharry on their appointment to the banking inquiry.  They will be excellent representatives of this House and that inquiry is of great importance in addressing the crisis in the Irish banking sector.  I join my colleagues in hoping the Government will accept the democratic decision of the Committee of Selection to appoint Senators MacSharry and Barrett and I commend the Leader of the House in ensuring this House will have two representatives on the inquiry.</p><p>I hope there is not a recurrence of what happened previously when some Government Senators did not toe the line on the so-called Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.  I do not blame the Leader of the House personally, but on that occasion he was instructed by the Government to suspend Standing Order 89, remove committee members and replace them with others without any input by the democratically elected Committee of Selection.  The Government parties allowed this to happen.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I am putting the Leader of the House on notice that if he attempts to do so again we will not co-operate in the running of this House.  I am sad that I had to say this but I feel it is only fair to give warning that our party will not co-operate with the smooth running of business in this House.  This is not for party political reasons, it is for democratic reasons and in the interests of democracy.  </p><p>I again commend both Senator MacSharry and Senator Barrett and I second Senator Bradford's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I presume the Clerk of the Seanad has notified the clerk of the banking inquiry of the appointments by the Seanad.  Senator Bradford is correct that there is no requirement for the Seanad to approve or not approve this decision as that job has been done.  There will be a different set-up to other committees as it will be governed by the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act, which makes specific statutory reference to our Standing Orders.  The Act says Standing Orders must be put in place within 50 days of the passing of the Act.  This has been done and I assume our existing Standing Orders, which are now governed by statute, are included.</p><p>The banking inquiry was set up by a resolution of this House that specifically refers to Standing Order 89 and appointment by the Committee of Selection.  The Standing Order refers to the Committee of Selection doing its job of appointing two Members and last night the Committee of Selection complied with the resolution of the House by appointing two Members to the banking inquiry.</p><p>I would not like to be the lawyer in the Office of the Attorney General who must examine this.  This is a highly complex matter and the Government would be best to leave things alone.  The reaction I have heard from the public suggests they do not wish for any perception of bias or interference by the Government in appointing members to the inquiry.  The members appointed to the banking inquiry last night were appointed in accordance with the law.  As far as I am concerned they are now members of the banking inquiry and I wish them every success and good luck in their work.</p></speech>

This should be done ahead of the Minister's submission to the European Commission relating to the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme and the rural development programme, Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.  This is of great importance to the farming sector in this country and to rural Ireland.  I understand the Department will make its submission towards the end of June so a debate should to take place here prior to that.</p><p>I wish to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Barrett and Senator MacSharry, on their successful selection by the Committee of Selection last night.  I note the views of Government Senators on the work of the Committee of Selection and I question why any Senator would doubt the ethos or integrity of a House committee, namely, the Committee of Selection.  If the Government was to take the view that the democratic decision made by the Committee of Selection last night is voted down in this House it would do the Senate a disservice and totally undermine the Committee of Selection.  I hope the Leader will take the pragmatic view that democracy means something.  A decision taken by the Committee of Selection under Standing Order 89 should stand.  I fail to understand why the Government feels it is necessary to have a controlling majority on the banking inquiry or why the Leader of the Seanad would not facilitate the democratic election of both Senators who were selected last night?  I hope the Leader will allow democracy to prevail and will not undermine a House committee.</p></speech>

There was a general consensus that we would appoint one Government Senator and one non-Government Senator.  However, I agree this was not mentioned in the motion that was passed.  The motion only mentioned selecting two Senators.  I am suggesting, and I am going to ask the Cathaoirleach, that the matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so it can be investigated.  I have information that I intend to bring to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will do so acting in the best interests of the House at all times.

The Committee of Selection met legitimately with a quorum and selected Senators Se&aacute;n D. Barrett and Marc MacSharry to be members of the banking inquiry.  It is not in any way, shape or form coincidental that the statement made earlier by the Leader was directly related to that decision because it suits Government to have a majority on the inquiry and its nominee was not successful in being appointed.  That is the background.  It cannot be dressed up in any other way, shape or form.  No one can disagree with that.</p></speech>

I have worked closely with him over the past three years and have the utmost regard for how he has always conducted himself in this House.  For us, what happened this morning was a bridge too far.  The Leader has withdrawn the remark of a suggested conflict of interest.  I can tell him there is no conflict of interest.  As per the Cathaoirleach's ruling, it was highly inappropriate for the Leader to raise this issue on the floor of the House today.  That should not have happened.</p><p>The Leader should apologise to Senator MacSharry and his family for what has been said here today.

We all make mistakes.  I have said things before that I regretted saying and I have apologised for them.  Members here know that.  There is no weakness in apologising and admitting one made a mistake.  I put it to the Leader that the foundation of the banking inquiry is rocked owing to what happened last night at the Committee of Selection and the manner in which the Government has dealt with it here today, which was unprecedented.  The public want a banking inquiry and deserve to have one.  They also deserve a non-partisan banking inquiry.  An independent committee of the Seanad met and according to procedures, selected two Members of this House for appointment to the inquiry.  The Government parties are not happy with that decision.  That is politics, life and democracy.  That decision stands.  It was made under Standing Order 89 and according to the Government's motion which came before this House on 14 May.  As far as we are concerned, that is a separate issue.  It is done and dusted in that two Members have been selected.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Leader has withdrawn part of the remarks he made earlier.  </p></speech>

He will be glad to hear that this is a friendly societies Bill.  In that spirit, and arising from what we said on the last day, I have proposed amendments for his consideration.<br />Ireland needs a good portfolio of financial institutions, particularly given what has happened to banks, insurance companies, accountancy firms, pension funds, credit unions and building societies.  There is an immense array of difficulties in the sector, as he will know because he is part of the work to correct them.  Into that mosaic I would place friendly societies.<br />Let me explain what friendly societies do.  They provide small life assurance benefits, sick benefits and death benefits to the members.  I would not like to close the door on that happening again, particularly in the wake of such uncertainty about financial services.  I recall the Minister for Finance's efforts to get new banks into this country, given the pillar banks' obsession with property and the danger of a cartel.  Therefore, we need a new landscape for financial services.<br />I propose to amend the first section because it would mean that one could not form a friendly society in the future, ever.  The second amendment proposes a restriction on the rating of new capital.<br />My third amendment seeks the following.  If the Central Bank agrees to allow a new friendly society to be set up, and agrees to the new capital limits, would that be a way to solve the very slight difference of opinion between myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock?  One of the statements on the Bill that he made on the last day reads:<blockquote>.... preliminary step in the process of establishing a system of the most appropriate supervision of certain existing societies, especially operating in the area of financial service provision. That is the ethos under which we are trying to introduce the legislation. It is intended that the group of societies would be subject to Central Bank supervision and that this would be the closed group.</blockquote>The only words that I differ with him on are &quot;the closed group.&quot;  What if new people want to set up friendly societies?  Such societies have played a major part, and still do, in the adjoining island.  They look after the savings and investments of 4.5 million people and have a total fund of &pound;15 billion under investment.<br />As the Minister of State will know, friendly societies have not participated in some of the financial collapses that have occupied so much Government and parliamentary time in recent years.  However, they could play a role and be regulated by the Central Bank.  It is in the spirit of the very constructive discussion that we had on the last day that these amendments have been tabled for his consideration.  Also, I will not push them to a Vote.  They are available for consideration by him, as the promoter of the Bill, and by his Department.  They are also in line with the McDowell report on financial regulation in Ireland.  In fact, the Minister of State has spoken about his knowledge of friendly societies in the Mallow area and, I think, Horace Plunkett was mentioned as well.  <br />I would not write friendly societies or an expansion of their activities off.  As he said himself, there seems to be a movement towards the Central Bank.  It was also mentioned in the McDowell report.  Would he afford the option as he brings the Bill through Parliament? </p></speech>

That is the cessation of registration of any new societies under section 8 of the legislation.  The rationale for the change, as I set out on Second and Committee Stages, is twofold.  First, the lack of demand for the friendly society model, evidenced by the fact that there have been just three new entrants in the past nine years.  That gives a clear indication that the friendly society model is no longer favoured by newly-establishing organisations.<br />Second, current legislation does not provide for prudential supervision of friendly societies by any public authority.  This is a source of some concern because there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public where societies offer financial services. <br />Section 8 the 1896 Act sets out the types of society that may be registered.  There is currently nothing in the section which would preclude a society from seeking the authorisation of the Central Bank, under the Central Bank and Financial Services Act 2003, to carry on a regulated business as defined in that Act.<br />The Central Bank Acts provide specific exemptions for friendly societies from the requirements that relate to banking.  Under sections 7 and 8 of the Central Bank Act 1971 a friendly society is exempt from the requirement to hold a banking licence.<br />Under section 29(<i>a</i>) of the Central Bank Act 1997, a friendly society is exempt from the requirement to hold an authorisation as a retail credit firm. <br />I believe, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary, and does not add to the Act in terms of clarity.   There are no references to a &quot;regulated business&quot; in the Friendly Societies Acts and no definition of what is intended by the term.  Introducing such a concept in the manner proposed by the amendment is not practical.  Further, the amendment as drafted refers to &quot;a person who wishes to carry on a regulated business&quot; when the Act refers to societies, not persons.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment because I do not believe it to be a workable amendment, as currently constituted.</p></speech>

Presumably, it is possible for those who wish to set up a friendly society to apply to the Central Bank.  I do not know why the Registrar of Friendly Societies does not want to perform the role any more.  She does not want anybody to submit an application to her to set up a new friendly society.  I know there has not been much demand.  We will have to reconfigure financial services here and I hope that fact might influence the Minister.  Of all the financial landscapes, I cannot imagine a sector that has done less harm to the economy than the friendly societies but there we are.</p> <p>It echoes what we were discussing this morning in regard to banking.  I will not press the amendment but I regret it was not accepted.  The Parliament is shutting the door on the formation of friendly societies, the registrar does not want to do the task anymore and the Minister of State expressed the sentiment that the Central Bank of Ireland may take over the role.  Having expressed my regret, I thank the Minister of State for his consideration but I will not press the amendment.</p></speech>

The registrar does not wish to see separate loan funds being created and the purpose of this section is to shut it down.  We are affording friendly societies that wish to use this way of creating loan funds the possibility to expand under the regulation of the Central Bank.  </p></speech>

The change will not have an impact on existing societies that have a fund in place.  This amounts to three societies at present.  The rationale behind the change, as mentioned on Committee Stage and on Second Stage, is that such activity where it is operated by any other body, is subject to prudential supervision by the Central Bank.  There is no prudential supervision by any public authority in the case of a friendly society.  While the number of friendly societies operating a loan fund is very small, it is not in the interests of the members of friendly societies that new funds be permitted to be established without appropriate prudential supervision.  I hope that addresses the essential spirit of the overarching point made by Senator Sean Barrett.</p><p>In section 6, our aim is to prevent friendly societies - apart from the small number already engaged in such activity - from operating a loan fund that is not subject to prudential supervision.  The exception provided is to allow any application that may be in hand, where an application to register a rule change has been passed by the society and lodged with the registrar by the operative date, to progress under the current rules so that it will not disadvantaged an existing society.  Given the general lack of interest, even among existing societies, in operating in the area, an influx of society seeking to establish loan funds is not anticipated.</p><p>The Senator's proposal is worded to amend section 6 and to require that &quot;the formation of a separate loan fund&quot; should receive authorisation under the Central Bank and Financial Services Act 2003.  This is not a workable amendment because the Act authorises the carrying on of the financial activity itself, namely, the granting of loans, not formation of the fund.  On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The registrar does not want to do it, the Central Bank does not want to do it and the friendly societies cannot set up loan funds.  That we run into these culs-de-sac explains the background to some of the financial mess the country is in.  Maybe we will refer it onto all the other contentious items before the banking review.  It was plain under section 6 that a society may not establish a loan fund after the coming into operation of the section.  As the Minister of State said, it does not affect an existing society that currently operates a loan fund.  We tried to set up a facility where the friendly society could operate the loan fund under the Central Bank, which is the financial services authority for the country, and the amendment was not acceptable.  I accept what the Minister of State said.</p><p>If there is so little interest and appetite for regulating the sector in respect of registrar of friendly societies, perhaps it can be transferred to the Central Bank.  Maybe the banking committee will look into this matter.  I see the sector having a much better future than the Bill envisages and I would not rule it out.  I will not press the amendment.  Certain contradictions are manifest.  This is shutting off options for a sector that might very well have a role to play.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

This was the intention of the McDowell report in any case.  We need financial regulation in the country and it is a matter for the banking inquiry.  That is why I tabled the amendment.  Friendly societies play a big role in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, and the sector has not been developed here as I and the Minister of State would wish.  Why shut it off rather than have comprehensive regulation of financial services?  In the adjoining island, friendly societies have 4.5 million members and total funds of &euro;15 billion.  We have a very pessimistic view in the Bill about the possibility of such development.  Would it develop better under regulation by the Central Bank?  This is the reason behind the amendment.</p></speech>

The change is necessary as, for the past number of years, the role of Registrar of Friendly Societies has not been a dedicated role, but has been fulfilled by the Registrar of Companies in addition to her existing duties.</p><p>The amendment proposed by the Senators, which I understand seeks to transfer powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Central Bank, will not operate as intended by the Senators because section 5 of the 1977 Act sets out powers of the Minister with regard to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and not the powers of the registrar.  There is a reference to the powers, functions and duties of the registrar in section 5 but it relates to who may be authorised by the Minister to perform these powers, rather than setting out the powers themselves.  Section 6 of the 1977 Act does relate to a specific power regarding cancellation of the registration of societies but, as I do not believe it to be the intention of the Senators in drafting this amendment to transfer powers solely relating to cancellation of societies to the Central Bank, I do not accept the amendment.</p><p>There have been discussions on, and it is intended to examine it further with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, the appropriate prudential supervision for friendly societies.</p> <p>It is intended to examine further with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance the issue of appropriate prudential supervision for friendly societies.  At present the powers to exercise such supervision do not exist under the friendly societies legislation and therefore appropriate powers must be put in place.  No existing powers can be simply transferred.  It is considered that the best place to address the matter is under the Central Bank Acts rather than the Friendly Societies Acts.</p><p>I wish to restate what I said on previous Stages.  The Friendly Societies Acts do not confer corporate status on societies or limited liability on members.  The evidence in recent years is that it has become common practice for many charities and clubs to register as limited companies.  I hope to give some confidence to Senator Barrett in addressing the points he has made by reiterating that the most realistic institutional option for introducing an appropriate system of supervision is the Central Bank, which is at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight.  It has a responsibility to provide in a fully integrated and co-ordinated manner for the prudential supervision and stability of all financial services within the financial system as a whole.  To avoid the possibility of other bodies moving into this unregulated area it was decided to close registration to new friendly societies.</p></speech>

We have added a subsection that states, "The powers, functions and duties of the registrar of friendly societies under sections 5 and 6 shall be transferred to the Central Bank of Ireland from the operative date."  That is what the Minister of State has said and he is working on it.  I believe we are far closer than it might appear.</p><p>I wish the exercise Godspeed.  I would prefer if the reference was in the Bill.  The Minister of State is thinking about it and I commend him on that.  Let us put in a reference such that it will go to the Central Bank since the powers exist under section 8.  Our amendment proposes that the issue of new start-ups and loan funds should also be considered by the Central Bank.</p><p>I am happy to leave that with the Minister of State and his officials for consideration.  I hope that the Minister of State and the Governor, Professor Honohan, will bring proposals back to the House soon.  That is the logical place to have it.  I agree with what the Minister of State has said.  I was simply trying to get it down on print in his Bill.</p></speech>

Seo &aacute;bhar a d'ardaigh m&eacute; c&uacute;pla uair roimhe seo sa Teach, &aacute;bhar a bhaineann le iar-cheannasa&iacute; Chumann na bhFiann, Domhnall &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;.  I am raising an issue that has been raised previously in the Houses but time has moved on and there have been many developments in justice issues since the last time we debated the issue.</p><p>There have been allegations concerning the founder of Chumann na bhFiann, Domhnall &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;.  He was the subject of a TG4 documentary some time back which examined claims that he may have abused dozens of victims in the 1970s and 1980s.  It was alleged that &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;, who has passed away, may have abused up to 100 boys when he was an Irish and religion teacher.  Some of the alleged incidents took place in camps, hotels, flats and cinemas in Athlone, Rosmuc, Dublin, Donegal and Tipperary.  He died some time back while under investigation for sexually abusing a 13 year old boy the 1970s.</p><p>The Garda investigated allegations of abuse in 1988 and in 2002 the teacher faced 56 charges of sexual abuse involving 11 victims.  However, the case did not go ahead following a legal challenge.  At the time the case was live, the Rape Crisis Centre claimed that the Garda had had two opportunities to investigate the allegations against &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;, who the centre described as very influential and a powerful figure.  The centre called on the Garda Commissioner to ensure a full review to ascertain if the Garda utilised the opportunity of the investigation in 1991 to examine whether abuse had taken place, a procedure practised elsewhere in such cases.</p><p>Questions also surround the loss of vital evidence from the 1991 case which, in turn, impacted on an investigation in 1998, when five men came forward and reported sexual violence by &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute;.  In response to queries about the case at the time, the Garda press office said it did not discuss named individuals.  The matter was passed on to the then Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, who said that he had directed a re-examination of the case to identify any issues that needed to be addressed.  He also outlined the new policies in place.</p><p>We know that the allegations against Mr. &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute; date from 1955 and that he had opportunities to work in different areas as well as access to young people.  I have been in contact with several of the victims and their families.  They remain concerned that the truth has not been given to them around these issues.  They are keen to find out what will happen about it at this stage.</p><p>Several investigations have been instigated relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Department of Justice and Equality, etc.  I note that the new Minister has called for an independent review group to be put in place to examine issues around the Department of Justice and Equality.  In this case the victims believe that they have not got justice.  Some people believe not all information has been forthcoming.  Several Departments have a role in respect of the questions that they have asked, including the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the review called for by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, will she include or has she directed that the &Oacute; Lubhla&iacute; case be examined, how it was handled and how the review of the case was handled by the Department of Justice and Equality?  Is that included?  Can it be included?  It is most important for the victims in this case and other cases to get full justice and to be assured that justice has been done.</p> <p>If the Department, the Garda or other Departments were remiss in any way in any review undertaken, investigation carried out or evidence that might have gone missing, they deserve to know the truth.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to confirm that the Minister will take this on board in the review being carried out.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and acknowledge the consistency with which he has advocated on it.</p><p>As the Minister recently announced, an independent review group has been established to undertake a review of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The independent review group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, has been asked to undertake a comprehensive review of the performance, management and administration of the Department.  It will assess and report on the roles, responsibilities and capabilities of the Department, including concerns in respect of the governance and oversight of external organisations identified in particular in the report of Mr. Sean Guerin, SC; the Department's performance in discharging its responsibilities, implementing its programmes and achieving its desired strategic outcomes, as set out in its statement of strategy; the effectiveness of the Department's current structure, systems, management and capabilities.</p><p>In making its recommendations the group will have regard to the policy, legal, institutional and resource framework within which the Department works.  It will also draw on international best practice regarding the organisational structures, skills, training and levels required by the Department in order that it can fulfil its roles and responsibilities.  It may engage additional expertise to help with its work, as it sees fit.  Based on the conclusions and lessons drawn from this assessment, it will make recommendations to the Minister who has already commented that she believes the report will be an important signpost on the path to reform and enable the Department to build on its considerable strengths and fully address areas that need improvement.</p><p>Before I comment on the specific case referred to by the Senator, I wish to make it clear that the Minister does not wish in any way to pre-empt the work of the independent review group or how it will focus its efforts in the light of its terms of reference.  At this stage, she would simply reflect that it was not anticipated that the independent review group would necessarily be the best means to address the detail of specific cases such as the one referred to, although its findings will, of course, be relevant to the how the range of the Department's functions are delivered.  The Department is not aware of any question having arisen relating to the Department in the context of the case referred to by the Senator.  It, of course, is not involved in the investigation of criminal offences.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner previously directed that an examination be carried out of the procedures surrounding the handling of the complaints against the person in question.  The Minister is advised by the Garda authorities that a review has been completed of a number of complaints made against the person concerned.  However, further information has recently been provided for the Garda and this has necessitated further examination by garda&iacute; before the review can be finalised.  The Minister is advised that this process is ongoing.</p><p>The Minister wishes to assure the Senator that the need to learn from past child protection failures is a priority for her and the Government.  This is reflected in the transformation of child protection arrangements which have taken place since the Government took office.  In particular, the Senator will be aware of the recent publication by the Minister when she was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs of the Children First Bill 2014 which will, for the first time, provide for key elements of the Children First guidelines to be put on a statutory basis.  This builds on other significant legislative and administrative measures which have been put in place in recent years to better protect children.  In the light of the Minister's clear commitment in this regard, she will be asking the acting Garda Commissioner to ensure the review in question is completed as soon as possible.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I will convey his comments during this debate to the Minister.</p></speech>

That is very important.  There is a sense among the victims and observers who have studied the case that the investigation to date has not been up to scratch.  We know that there are questions about how the Garda has investigated certain issues in the past and that that is subject to a number of inquiries.  I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Minister how important it is for the victims in this case that a full, thorough and rigorous investigation be carried out in order that they can find closure, that the truth can be exposed and that they can move on with their lives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-05a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014060500017#S00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending to take this matter.  I hope he will be able to tell me that he will put children first in terms of the Children First guidelines and the safety of children.  The matter I raise concerns the Firhouse Educate Together national school and the premises in which it is located.  The school is located in temporary, unsuitable accommodation which was originally built to be a community centre, not a school.  The school is housed upstairs.  The parents, teachers and local community are all very anxious about the unsuitability of the current premises for it.</p><p>Firhouse Educate Together national school is a very good one.  The education provided and teachers are excellent, but the premises leaves a great deal to be desired, to put it mildly.  It is absolutely unsuitable.  If a safety analysis was to be conducted, it would not pass.  The stairs are very steep and there is no wheelchair access.  There is dual usage of the community centre and crowding at times when children are moving from one place to another.  It is a serious issue.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for the safety of children, which is an issue in the school.  When the school was accommodated in the premises, the Department stated initially, in September 2013, that it would be for four months.  That stretched to six months and then eight.  There is overcrowding in the staff room which is shared with learning support staff and when I visited the school, there was a child there who required special support.  It is totally unsuitable.  There is one toilet which is used by the public also.  The community centre and the people in it are fine, but the community is being discommoded by having an educational establishment where there was never meant to be one.  The community is very understanding and welcoming of the school, but it was to be temporary.  It has been based there too long and, as time passes, is not viable.</p><p>The school had intended to grow.  Owing to its good name, it had sufficient children enrolled to secure another teacher next year, but now parents are starting to look at the long-term position and wonder where their children will be if the school does not have a permanent location very soon.  Some are beginning to look at other schools, even schools outside the area, if they wish to have their children attend an Educate Together school.  If the school is to be viable, it must receive immediate assistance.</p><p>I asked the Minister for Education and Skills about this issue last November.  In the south Dublin local area plan two sites were designated for education in the Firhouse area.  The sites are available.  I do not know if they are suitable or whether they are for the Educate Together national school, but perhaps the Minister of State might comment or offer some certainty on where the school will be located next September.  Obviously, it cannot continue where it is located at present and operating in very difficult circumstances for the students, staff and parents.  The safety issues must also be taken into consideration.  The Minister must immediately find suitable accommodation for the school.</p></speech>

As a Minister of State in the relevant Department, I am acutely aware of the predicament in which that school community finds itself.  I take this opportunity to inform the House that I am not going to read directly from the prepared script.</p><p>As I understand it, the Firhouse Educate Together school was established to service a specific demographic demand within the Firhouse area.  The Senator referred to the South Dublin County Council plan, etc., and in that context, the school should ideally have a permanent home within or as close to the geographical area in which it is currently located as possible in order to meet people's needs.  A process is ongoing whereby officials from the Department of Education and Skills are working with their counterparts in South Dublin County Council in order to acquire a suitable site.  In the context of the Department's geographical information system and analysis, the Ballycullen-Oldcourt area is considered a separate and distinct geographical area.  The local area plan for Ballycullen-Oldcourt refers to the planned future additional population.  This means that the area will have educational infrastructural requirements in its own right should the planned housing developments for it materialise.</p><p>I am given to understand that the process relating to identifying and acquiring a site for Firhouse Educate Together is ongoing.  The Senator indicated that she previously raised this matter last November.  It has been my experience that the process of acquiring land tends to be open-ended in nature.  It is very difficult, for example, to put in place sunset clauses in respect of the acquisition of land or to disregard the commercial sensitivities involved.  The process is ongoing and due to the kind of commercial sensitivities to which I refer, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.  I am sure the Senator has heard that before and I do not wish to offer her any platitudes in respect of this issue.  I am aware, however, from my dealings with the officials in the Department, that when interacting with local authorities, there is a process which must be undergone.  The process is not seamless and can involve many twists and turns.  That will come as no comfort to Senator Keane in the context of her attempts to represent the interests of the people who made representations to her.  I assure her that I will raise the matter with the relevant officials in the Department and that I will exert as much pressure as possible in the context of establishing the current position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-05a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014060500018#T00200"><p>I referred to the two sites in question because I am aware of both.  I am also aware that one lies outside the boundary.  The Minister of State referred to site selection and indicated that the process of acquiring land is ongoing.  I am aware that attempts were made to acquire a public open space, namely, a football field and that the local community was opposed to this.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the proposal to purchase this land is no longer on the table?  There are several groups involved here, namely, the school community and those who play football and use the land in question for the purpose of engaging in physical exercise.  When he refers to commercial sensitivities, I presume the Minister of State is referring to sensitivities which relate to some private as opposed to public land the Department is seeking to acquire.  Seeking to acquire land from a local authority such as South Dublin County Council is one thing, whereas seeking to purchase it from a private owner is quite another.</p><p>I accept that there are commercial sensitivities involved but people must be allowed to know what is happening.  In view of what is happening in respect of property throughout Dublin at present, the land is going to be for sale on the open market in any event.  I do not want it to be a case that the sale of the land will be signed, sealed and delivered and that the new school will be built there.  I want a school to be built which will be within the Firhouse area and which will suit the demographic needs of that area.  If the Minister of State has the relevant information about a possible site in his possession, he should make it available.  It should certainly be made available before September in order that those at Firhouse Educate Together will know that a site will be acquired for it.</p></speech>

I have come across situations such as this previously whereby schoolchildren are being obliged to learn in what can only be described as Dickensian conditions while they await the provision of permanent accommodation.  I wish to give Senator Keane an undertaking to the effect that I will raise this matter within the Department.  I must point out, however, that it is not only in respect of the acquisition of privately-owned land that sensitivities arise.  I take the Senator's point regarding the upward trajectory of property prices in the Dublin area.  However, sensitivities also arise when land is being transferred from one public body, local authority or State entity to another.  There are many legalities which must be dealt with in that context.  Regardless of whether it is a private or public entity involved, the process is not seamless.  As a result, the acquisition of a suitable site is taking some time to bring to a conclusion.  I fully acknowledge that.  I will bring the points made by Senator Keane to the attention of the officials within the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-06-05a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014060500018#T00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad he is here to take this matter because, as a result of the fact that he represents the constituency of Cork East, he is aware that the issue of small schools in rural areas is beginning to become one of concern throughout the county.</p><p>The Minister of State will be aware of the relevant statistics and I am sure he will correct what I am about to say if it is incorrect.  The figures available to me seem to suggest that there are approximately 600 schools throughout the country with 50 or fewer pupils.  Obviously, this poses a challenge for school authorities, the Department and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the context of the allocation of resources.  We must acknowledge the very proactive role the schools to which I refer play in small rural communities.  Small schools are very much at the centre of life in rural areas, particularly in the context of the number of activities they facilitate.</p><p>I wish to refer to the challenges that will be faced by some of the schools in question as a result of the change to the pupil-teacher ratio and I appreciate the huge financial constraints under which the Minister, the Department and the Government continue to operate.  When Budget 2012 was introduced, it was announced that the pupil-teacher ratio would be changed over a three-year period.  The latter is going to place small rural schools at a significant disadvantage because the number of number of pupils per teacher and per class is obviously going to increase quite significantly.  Anyone can romanticise the notion of the small rural school where there are two, three or four classes in a single room and where every child sings along happily with his or her teacher.  That is only one side of the story.  We live in the modern world and the educational challenges which arise are greater than ever.  I refer to the fact that people have high expectations of schools and teachers.  We are placing a huge onus on teachers to produce results and to guide young children through their early years in education.  It is going to become increasingly difficult for teachers to do their job as they would like to do it if they are going to be obliged to deal with 28 or 29 pupils spread across two or three classes.  This is a matter upon which we must reflect.</p><p>I received correspondence from a teacher - the Minister of State may also have received it - who asked children in senior classes the differences they had noticed a month after class sizes had been increased.  The children replied that they needed to do more writing and that if they required help from the teacher, they were obliged to wait longer for it.  The teacher in question notes that children who are weaker academically are not served well by larger class sizes because there is little or no time available in which to give them additional attention.</p> <p>We must do everything possible to maintain these rural schools, because they play a significant role, not just in the educational but in the broader life of the community.  When we have done that and have secured every possible school we can and its future, we must try to ensure the pupil-teacher ratio in that school is appropriate to the needs of the pupils, teachers and community.</p><p>I am advised that in disadvantaged DEIS areas the maximum pupil-teacher ratio, in infant classes in particular, is 20 pupils.  I have no disagreement with that and believe it is appropriate, though perhaps 20 is too many.  We are talking about classes in some of our small rural schools which can have 28, 29 or 30 pupils.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister to reflect on this and to try to ensure, in so far as they can, that these schools will receive the teaching allocations they require to allow them continue the fine traditions such schools, communities and parishes have had for generations.</p><p>I admit we live in a changing time and world, but we need traditional stability.  Our schools can provide that, our small rural schools in particular.  However, there must be willingness on the part of the Department to provide resources to allow sufficient teachers for those schools.  I do not expect a major policy announcement today, but I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to keep these rural schools and their teachers and communities at the centre of the Department's thinking.</p></speech>

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually.  I accept the point made by the Senator in regard to budget 2012, whereby as part of that budget there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less.  The current system operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS band 1 schools.  I have not seen the correspondence Senator Bradford referred to, but I acknowledge pressures are being brought to bear in terms of the classroom experience, both for pupils and for teachers.  I acknowledge also that budgetary measures taken in 2012 brought pressure, a result of macro-economic factors.</p><p>The Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  Small schools will not lose their classroom post if they project sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  We are all aware of the appeals process and the staffing circulars and the processes involved. </p><p>I acknowledge the general point being made by the Senator that we must ensure there is a role for small schools within rural communities.  Both he and I hail from the same region and such communities.  The Department has taken a conscious decision to ensure that schools which had no inward investment for many years, for example, in regard to capital expenditure and bricks and mortar, are seeing investment.  Projects are now going on throughout our region and the country to replace prefabs with bricks and mortar.  This is part of trying to make the experience for students and school communities better.  In rural areas, these schools are the institutions underpinning the community.  </p><p>The Senator will be aware that a value for money review was conducted on small primary schools.  The review took account of the ethos of schools and of their locations relative to other similar schools.  We are currently considering the value for money reviews, in consultation with Government colleagues and it is intended to publish the report on completion of the consideration process.  We are very mindful of the points raised by Senator Bradford in regard to the budget 2012 measures.  We seek to ensure we have a sustainable model for the future, but I acknowledge there are challenges in that regard.  </p><p>The Minister has had initial discussions with the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA, and the Irish National Teachers Organisation in regard to their proposals on the issue of primary school consolidation and reorganisation.  We acknowledge that some 48 small schools have had a reduction in enrolments, which means that for September 2014 they will lose a teacher.  We acknowledge these losses would not have occurred if the pre-budget 2012 enrolment threshold still applied and if the threshold for a two-teacher school had remained at 12 pupils.  We acknowledge the constraints that exist currently.  However, the value for money review is under consideration and will be published. </p><p>Speaking personally, I will advocate strongly for assurances to be given on the future of schools and for consultation and engagement with stakeholders in a meaningful process of dialogue which will ensure a future for these schools.  Then we can begin to address the dynamic the Senator outlined in regard to the new pressures that exist in particular schools and classrooms as economic circumstances improve. </p></speech>
