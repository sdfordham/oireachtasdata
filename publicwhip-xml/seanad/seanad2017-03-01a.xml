I am delighted she is here to respond to me on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  As a representative of an urban area, I am sure she will understand the various challenges that arise when successful businesses that want to get bigger decide to purchase greenfield sites to develop large out-of-town shopping centres and retail outlets.  One such challenge develops when the premises from which such businesses previously operated are left empty.  While these vacant facilities are available for leasing and renting, the terms and conditions involved, including the requirements and duration of the lease, make it impractical for anyone to promote a realistic business opportunity at such premises.</p> <p>I know this used to be a major issue in Dublin and other cities when successful retail outlets, especially supermarkets, that were leaving sites vacant were able to claim a 100% rebate on their rates each year.  The way it used to work was that a company with one of these units would pay rates on that unit on 31 December each year, before claiming those moneys back on 1 January of the following year by demonstrating that the unit was available for renting to a suitable client who could meet strict terms and conditions.  To deal with this problem in Dublin and other big cities, it was decided to introduce legislation limit to 50% the rebate such companies could get on their rates.  They paid 50% and got a discount of 50%.  I want this legislation to be extended to all urban areas in order that it covers towns like Ennis in County Clare and Tralee in County Kerry.</p> <p>A large unit in Tralee town centre from which Dunnes Stores traded successfully for many years is now empty.  The company was so successful in the town that it decided to build a big out-of-town unit on a greenfield site.  As a consequence, its former unit in Tralee town centre has been empty for some time.  The existence of this vacant unit in the centre of Tralee is choking development in the area.  It is fair and reasonable to expect a successful company like Dunnes Stores to make a contribution towards the rates bill for what I would describe as a derelict site.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There has been no effort whatsoever made to rent it out, either as small units or to an alternative business.  The particular example in Tralee is replicated in towns all over the country.  I have huge sympathy for somebody who goes out of business and is having difficulty in renting a unit, given that it may require significant investment to bring it up to an acceptable standard and the particular client may not have money to do so.  However, it is a different ball game when there is a major company with significant profits which is in a position to prevent this from happening.  It is a reasonable request that legislation be introduced to extend the 50% rebate across the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is before the Select Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and I will be taking this matter on his behalf.</p> <p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner may be entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, the specified purposes being as follows: if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of making additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork where the same criteria for refunds applied, but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable.  </p> <p>With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the levels of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply, that is, either 100% or 50%, as set out.</p> <p>The legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  The Minister will shortly be bringing proposals to the Government to modernise the legislation governing the levying and collection of commercial rates.  The proposals will include measures for the elected members of a local authority to determine, as part of the annual budget process, the level of abatement from rates where a property is vacant.  The Minister envisages that the new legislation will be brought before the Houses later in 2017.</p></speech>

To be fair to the Minister, he is reflecting on the situation.  I do not think any fair-minded person would expect somebody who is struggling and may not have the resources to bring a particular building up to standard to have a punitive rates bill for a building that is not generating any return.  The particular situation about which I am concerned involves a business which has been relocated and is thriving and leaves what I would describe as a ghost property in the centre of a town.  The legislation the Minister envisages bringing before the Cabinet this year will I hope reflect the particular anomaly.  I thank the Minister of State for her very positive response.</p></speech>

There are two types of deer, the native red deer, a most magnificent wild animal, and the imported Japanese sika deer.  Frankly, I do not mind what the Minister of State does with the Japanese species which I do not think has a proper place in the national park.  He can remove all of them.  The only cull that should take place among the native red deer should involve old and infirm animals.  As for the sika deer, it can be open season.  I do not know how many hundred there are, but we want to protect the native red deer.</p> <p>I accept that deer have caused some accidents.  In that regard, I am particularly concerned about accidents occurring on the Killarney to Killorglin road.  The provision of further fencing would be of great help in keeping deer within the bounds of the national park.  As I do not think the erection of fencing would be possible on the Killarney to Kenmare road, perhaps more signage might be provided to warn motorists.</p> <p>The Department has received a communication from the Wild Deer Association of Ireland.  I suspect it has its own agenda and wants a licence from the Department to shoot deer in the national park.  That would be extremely dangerous and is not something I would recommend at all.  In fact, I recommend that the Minister of State have a meeting with the Kerry Deer Society.  At this point I must declare an interest in that I am a member of the society.  We are conservationists, not hunters, unlike some of the others.  Through engagement with the Minister of State and his officials, a proper policy on the management of deer could be worked out satisfactorily.</p> <p>I see a Senator from County Mayo present in the Chamber.  She reminded me recently of a national park in that county, Ballycroy National Park.</p></speech>

Some of the native red deer could be relocated to Ballycroy, Glenveagh and Connemara national parks, as happened before.  If there is overpopulation, I seriously recommend relocation to some of these national parks.  Why not share them with others?  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.  It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department licenses the hunting of deer, my Department does not own the deer population.  Deer roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  It is not part of the remit of my Department, nor would it be generally possible, to cordon them in specific areas of land.</p> <p>I am sure the House is aware of the unique position of the Kerry red deer.  A survey of red deer on the island of Ireland undertaken in 2014 found that the red deer population in County Kerry was descended from an ancient introduction and merited conservation.  During the mid-19th century the Japanese sika deer was introduced to Ireland in Powerscourt.  It has thrived dispersed within County Wicklow and been translocated to other sites throughout Ireland.</p> <p>Despite a long-standing overlap in the ranges of red deer and sika deer in County Kerry, no red deer-sika deer hybrids were detected there during the survey work.  However, red deer-sika deer hybrids were identified in County Cork.  Given their proximity, the County Cork hybrids pose a threat to red deer in County Kerry.  As hybrids are not easy to distinguish visually, genetic testing is necessary to tell them apart from pure bred deer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Further genetic surveys are under way on deer in south-western Ireland and departmental officials in Killarney National Park continue to co-operate with this work.</p><p>All wild deer species in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  However, there is an annual open or hunting season during which deer can legally be shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from the beginning of September to the end of February each year, depending on the species and gender of deer.  This reflects the conservation needs of the species concerned including red, fallow and sika.  Some 4,700 deer hunting licences were issued by my Department last year.</p><p>I point out that the hunting of red deer in Kerry is totally prohibited.  However, permits may be issued by my Department to hunt red deer in Kerry in instances where they are causing serious damage to crops or forestry and these applications are considered on a case-by-case basis by my Department.</p><p>I accept that deer can and do cause serious damage to crops and forestry.  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners.  Where control measures need to be taken outside the open season, landowners may apply to my Department for permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to cull deer.  This offers a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to stop serious damage being caused by deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such serious damage and on a case-by-case basis to take action by means which can include scaring, capturing or killing.</p><p>The Department routinely carries out localised deer counts on State lands such as in Wicklow and Killarney national parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the numbers and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative consequences.  However, it must be noted that the population of red deer in Killarney National Park and surrounding areas are of national conservation significance.</p><p>My Department commissioned a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in Killarney National Park.  On foot of the recent report, staff from my Department are currently undertaking a cull of deer in the national park, which will be concluded by the end of March. </p></speech>

I urge him to have a meeting in early course with the Kerry Deer Society, whose members would be most anxious to sit down with him.</p> <p>Our views are broadly in line and we accept that where some serious damage is done it can be examined on a case-by-case basis.  If deer are on a person's property, they are under the ownership of the landowner who can apply to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for a licence, which is understandable.  In a general sense, these are worthy of conservation and I accept everything the Minister of State has said in that regard.  I would be happy to facilitate his meeting the Kerry Deer Society in early course.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#C00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for coming to the Seanad, which enables me to demonstrate why it is vital that the Minister, Deputy Harris, does everything in his power to address the waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery at the Galway university hospitals.  We often hear of hundreds of thousands of people waiting for procedures and appointments at hospitals throughout the country.  Today I want the Minister of State to hear the case of one individual from my area.  I have his full permission and that of his family to use his name in this regard.  Nothing brings home the seriousness of the situation like hearing the details of the individual cases.</p><p>His name is Neil McEleney.  He first underwent spinal surgery at UHG in November 2015.  This was a triple spinal fusion which consisted of eight screws, three rods and extensive bone grafting.  Two months later the screws slipped and broke two vertebrae, which resulted in the screws pulling out.</p><p>He then had a second operation in February 2016.  This time the screws and plates were removed and more extensive hardware was used further up his spine.  Unfortunately, he experienced severe pain for several months after the operation, at which time a scan showed that the screws had pulled out of the vertebrae and four screws loosened further down the spine.</p><p>The CT scan showed a haloing effect where the bone around the screws is being eroded with the constant movement.  Every time he moves the screws and frame move, and the four loose screws further down are causing frame movement. </p><p>The unimaginable pain Neil is experiencing every minute of every hour and every hour of every day can only be described as inhumane.  To complicate things further Neil has two underlying diseases, one is sarcoidosis which affects the lungs and muscles, and has unfortunately gone into the pituitary gland which has in turn caused Addison's disease.  His consultants understand his operation requires a multidisciplinary approach involving respiratory and orthopaedic input, as well as endocrinology.</p><p>Neil desperately needs a third operation as his spine is out of alignment.  This is called an osteotomy where basically a cut in the shape of a &quot;V&quot; is made in the spinal column and the spine is either bent or broken to realign it, and extensive screws and rods are fixed for two thirds of its length and anchored to the pelvis.</p><p>His consultant at the time Mr. Jadaan assisted by Mr. Fergus and Mr. John McCabe organised for Neil to have the surgery on 26 September 2016.  He was admitted to UHG on 25 September 2016, put on a pre-operation IV drip due to the Addison's disease and was advised that he would be first to the theatre on Monday morning at 7.30 a.m.  He was gowned and ready for surgery on 26 September, but as there was no spinal cord monitor the surgery had to be cancelled.  Neil was discharged and sent home.</p><p>Since then he has been waiting in desperation.  His endocrinologist has said he is in exquisite pain and he is concerned about the huge amounts of painkillers he has to take.</p><p>I quote his consultant orthopaedic surgeon who has stated,</p><blockquote>This is major complex revision spinal surgery which is only performed in two centres in Ireland and the waiting lists for it are serious.  This is largely due to failure to provide funding at the necessary level for pathway of care commensurate with modern spine practice and has not been adequately addressed.</blockquote> <p>The Galway university hospitals are also awaiting appointment of further consultants.  Again I quote the consultant, who has stated, </p><blockquote>I have patients waiting [since] as long as 2013 for spinal surgery under my care.  I am not in a position to effect change in the pathway of care unless I get appropriate funding.</blockquote> <p>How Neil can get the vital surgery he needs?  Last week he was sent to UHG by his GP for a much-needed CT scan.  He was hoping to being admitted to the accident and emergency department.  However, no CT scan was conducted and he was sent home again.</p><p>When the Minister, Deputy Harris, was in UHG last week, Neil and his wife Kathleen were there.  They saw his entourage pass by but did not have the strength to speak to him.  They have nothing left.  They are mentally, physically or emotionally drained.  I have a simple question for the Minister of State today.  Neil has been given several reasons for not being able to have this vital operation at UHG including lack of staff, facilities and funding.  He cannot wait in this excruciating pain indefinitely.  Can this operation be done in a different hospital, specifically the spinal unit at the Mater Hospital, as a matter of urgency?  I say that in the context of the desperation of people on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery and the pain they are experiencing.</p></speech>

Of these, 37, or 5%, have been waiting for more than 24 months.  Three patients, which represent less than 1%, have been waiting for more than 36 months.  The Saolta University Health Care Group advises that a review of orthopaedic services is currently under way across the group.  Findings from the review will be forthcoming shortly.  It can assure the House there have been concerted efforts to address waiting lists and reduce waiting times for orthopaedic services at Galway University Hospitals.  A musculoskeletal physiotherapy service has been put in place and is being expanded to manage approximately 240 referrals per month.  Patients are triaged and, as determined by their consultant, are seen by the physiotherapist.  Galway University Hospitals also provides a dedicated orthopaedic pre-assessment service, which helps to ensure patients are appropriately assessed prior to surgery and that appropriate discharge planning is in place following surgery.  There are currently nine full-time consultant orthopaedic surgeons in position in GaIway.  Two additional surgeons, one with a special interest in paediatrics and the other in spinal surgery, are due to be appointed in March and September 2017.  </p><p>Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.  It is for this reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in budget 2017 which will rise to &euro;55 million in 2018.  Last December 2016, the Minister, Deputy Harris, granted approval to the NTPF for a day-case waiting list initiative, with the aim to ensure that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months by 30 June 2017.  More than 2,000 day cases will be managed through the process and appointments under this initiative will be issued shortly.  The HSE is due to submit waiting list action plans for inpatient day cases and outpatient waiting lists shortly.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure that no patient on either list is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October 2017.  The HSE has been requested to develop the inpatient day-case waiting list action plan in conjunction with and supported by the NTPF's approach for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10 million of the 2017 funding for patient treatment.  These plans are being finalised and the Minister, Deputy Harris, expects to receive them imminently.  When requesting the waiting list action plans, the Minister raised concerns about the waiting times across a number of specialties in Galway University Hospitals.  He expects that particular focus will be on Galway waiting times as part of the forthcoming action plans. </p></speech>

I appreciate the review is being done but for people such as Neil on the waiting list, a review is of no consolation to them.  Review after review is being done right across the board yet no action is being taken.  The consultants are telling us they do not have the resources to do the job.  We have to ask who is accountable.  Can we find one person who is making the decisions?  What we see in health all the time is the Minister passing it over to the HSE where it gets lost in the quagmire again and nobody is accountable.  Somebody has to be accountable for leaving people like Neil in excruciating pain for months and months on end.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister of State coming in here today but I ask her to speak to the senior Minister, Deputy Harris.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, HIQA released a report in December regarding financial irregularities in the Greenmount property at the St. Mary's, Drumcar, campus of St. John of God.  The report found that the residential centre for people with disabilities took thousands of euro from the private accounts of residents without their consent to fund services which the centre should have funded.  At the time, the St. John of God campus was home to 22 residents with intellectual and physical disabilities.  This fraudulent activity included taking &euro;2,300 from a resident for a specialised armchair.  Another resident was charged &euro;2,500 for an armchair and a bone density scan and another resident was charged &euro;552 for a body brace.  Bone density scans cost, at most, &euro;100.  This is absolute exploitation of the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p>Last week, we heard recollections from the advocacy group, SAGE, of a patient with dementia being charged &euro;20 per month for activities that she could not participate in.  In addition, another resident was charged &euro;100 for laundry identification tags.  There was a weekly charge for a doctor, which was totally immoral because the patient had a medical card.  This is absolute fraud and it needs to be addressed.</p> <p>In response last week, four of the eight residential units at the St. John of God facility in Drumcar were deemed not fit for purpose by HIQA.  As my party colleague, Deputy Declan Breathnach, has rightly pointed out, Drumcar needs investment and support, not to be closed down.  He will be calling on the Minister in the D&aacute;il for support to ensure the facilities at Drumcar are improved to provide modern delivery of care for the many who still need institutionalised care at the facility.  We are trying to get away from congregated settings to community settings; we need integration and not segregation.  Currently there are over 2,723 people in congregated settings.  The Minister of State needs to initiate a full review of the services provided by St. John of God in Drumcar and to meet the needs of the facility head-on by investing in what is required.</p></speech>

The Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  Regulation and inspection of residential centres for people with disabilities was placed on a statutory footing in November 2013 and compliance with HIQA standards is a requirement under the service level agreement between the HSE and non-statutory disability service providers.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is aware of HIQA&rsquo;s ongoing concerns regarding the safety and care of residents at the St. John of God, Drumcar, facility in Louth, following numerous inspections the regulator has carried out there.  As a fully independent regulator, established under the 2007 Health Act, HIQA has very significant regulatory powers.  It is engaging directly with St. John of God leadership and senior management on the serious issues identified in its numerous inspections.  A separate review of services would be of no benefit while this process is ongoing.</p> <p>When initial HIQA inspections began in 2014, they uncovered a lack of understanding on the part of some service providers in terms of meeting regulations and standards.  This was particularly true in the case of many of the large congregated settings where longstanding institutionalised care practices were impacting adversely on the quality of life of residents.  The Government recognised this and has committed significant resources to escalate the movement of residents from inappropriate, congregated settings to more appropriate living arrangements.  Capital funding of &euro;100 million has been allocated over the period 2016 to 2021 to facilitate the reconfiguration of residential services.  This capital funding for five successive years will support the move from congregated settings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this context, 11 specific sites were prioritised for capital funding in 2016 owing to significant issues with complications with regulatory requirements in these locations.  St. John of God North East Services, St. Mary&rsquo;s, Drumcar is one of the priority sites.</p><p>Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  Our aim must always be to ensure people with disabilities maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.  They and their families trust us to care for them with kindness and compassion.  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  While the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA's findings may sometimes make for difficult reading such as in case of the Drumcar facility, they serve as evidence that the regulatory process works effectively and in the interests of protecting vulnerable persons in the care of the State.</p><p>While a lot of work remains to be carried out to ensure all facilities comply with disability residential standards and this is presenting challenges for both the HSE and some disability service providers, we must remember that the fundamental objective at all times is to safeguard vulnerable persons.  HIQA will continue to take action when standards are not met and where providers are failing to provide residents with a good quality of life.</p><p>Senators raised the matter of money being taken from residents.  I have no answer and do not know whether the Minister will be able to come back to them on it.  I do not have any information on it in the reply.</p></speech>

It is also why I am bitterly disappointed a specialised review of the facility is not taking place.  We need to remember that the population is getting older.  In the next 30 years the number of people over 65 will double, while the number over 85 will quadruple.  All aspects of the health system will be under strain, especially residential units.  There is no point in providing residential units if they will be substandard.  For that reason, I encourage the Minister of State to bring the message back to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, that an independent review of the facility in Drumcar is needed.</p></speech>

We all know the Government has done a cost-benefit analysis on it and the determination by those who wrote the report was that the benefits did not justify the costs to the Exchequer.  While it does not benefit everybody who takes it, Orkambi benefits some.  For those who have taken it and for whom it has been successful, it has been life transforming and, in many cases, life saving.  People who suffer from cystic fibrosis can spend weeks and months in our hospitals tying up those valuable beds which we need for others.  That is why I ask the Leader to organise another debate on the issue to question why the Government is not providing the funding.</p> <p>Orkambi is an expensive drug and other countries have done deals with the manufacturers.  However, it is of benefit to those who suffer.  We must ensure the Government puts aside the funding to give the benefit to those who would have a better quality of life if they took Orkambi.  The Government must do a deal.  The Minister was brought here before on the issue and I do not want to bring him in again at short notice.  However, the Leader must update the House on what the Government will do to help those who suffer from cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>Last week, as the Leader knows, we had many statements, which can be helpful, although we are a legislative body and that is what we should be doing.  I have spoken previously on the Irish Sign Language Bill and on the Corporate Manslaughter Bill.  The Bills were passed here on Second Stage before Christmas.  We have put the House on notice that on 29 March we will pass All Stages of the Irish Sign Language Bill.  We have written to the various Government Departments and tried to engage with them, before and after Christmas, seeking their amendments to the Bill.  They have not been forthcoming.  We will not accept amendments that will make the Bill unworkable or of little use to members of the deaf community.  Could the Leader update the House on what will happen with the Bill and if the Departments are going to table amendments?  If not, that is okay.  We will pass the Bill, and the Corporate Manslaughter Bill, on 29 March.</p> <p>The Corporate Manslaughter Bill was initially proposed by the Law Reform Commission after another scandal regarding the failure of Government systems when it failed the haemophiliacs and women who contracted hepatitis C through contaminated blood products.  Will the Leader update the House on what the Government will do, whether it will come forward with the amendments to the Bills I mentioned, and regarding those suffering from cystic fibrosis and who badly need Orkambi to change and save their lives?</p></speech>

The feeling regarding the HSE is one of complete and utter confusion.  The HSE has promised a 40-bed mental health unit in Kerry.  Believe it or not, this perfect, state-of-the-art, magnificent mental health unit has been idle for the past two years.  The HSE has promised it will open during the next couple of weeks.  I am asking the Leader about it, given that my questions to the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Helen McEntee, are not being answered.  How will the unit open, given that there are no staff?  The staff who are supposed to be for the unit have been deployed and have threatened to boycott the unit.

Although there are staff ready to go, the HSE cannot get its act together.

I ask the Leader to do this as a matter of urgency and certainly not later than next Wednesday.  I am aware that the Minister is busy on other matters and he might be even busier by this day next week.</p></speech>

JobPath is an absolute scandal.  I asked specific questions last December when I and Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Gavan raised this matter first.  One question was about the set-up of the JobPath scheme and, in particular, about Seetec and Turas Nua, which are operating in my constituency.  Those questions have not been answered, and I want answers.  I want answers because what I continue to hear-----</p></speech>

I ask Senators to leave if they want to talk.  It is not fair and it is happening day in, day out.  The same people are constantly talking.  In fact, yesterday I spotted a Member in the corner on a telephone.  That is not allowed in the Chamber.

I agree with you.  Last June or July, the Minister said he was going to refer 60,000 unemployed people to private operators under the JobPath scheme, to take the people off the live register and make the numbers look good.  We need a proper examination of this.</p> <p>I have encountered cases where people more than 60 years old, who are waiting for hip operations, are being sent to sit in front of a computer 20 miles away simply to take them off the live register.  What is happening here is a scandal.  We must have our questions answered.  I do not wish to see it become the subject of another "Prime Time Investigates" programme.  We should not have to depend on RTE making investigative programmes to bring these matters forward and to be able to question and answer honestly.</p> <p>If the JobPath scheme has not worked and if we have paid out huge amounts of money to private providers and entangled ourselves in contracts we should not have entered, we must come clean with the people, particularly the people who are not allowed on community employment schemes because they are already committed to JobPath and are ordered miles across rural areas to attend stupid courses that are of no relevance to them.  I look forward to seeing the Minister in the House within the next seven days.</p></speech>

Respect is at the heart of this recognition for a group of people who for too long have experienced prejudice and discrimination, as shown in shameful poor health, poor housing and poor education for Irish Travellers as was recently set out in stark terms by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.</p> <p>All credit goes to the campaigners from the Traveller community who have worked for decades for recognition and have now succeeded.  I acknowledge Members of the House who have been supportive of the Irish Traveller campaign for recognition, including Senators P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Martin Conway, as well as the Chairman and members of the justice and equality committee for their efforts.  I also acknowledge the great leadership of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, who has delivered on his promises.  The Taoiseach will be on the right side of history tonight when he makes the historic statement.</p> <p>While good history is being made today, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House to share with Members the lessons from the recent reports on the historical abuse of a woman we have come to know as Grace.  While the commission of inquiry is deliberating, instead of statements of outrage, which all of us could make, perhaps the Minister would come to the House and outline what law, safeguards and protections are in place or are being put in place for the thousands of adults who might be vulnerable to abuse today, to ensure that such abuse is prevented and punished and that abuse and apparent cover-up never happen to people such as Grace again.</p></speech>

I support the remarks made in the House.  Peter was always good humoured and very dogged on the subjects he raised.  I served with him on the finance committee along with Senator Kieran O'Donnell.  I extend my sympathy to his family on the loss of a very courageous and good man.</p> <p>Over the last few weeks the lifespan of the current D&aacute;il and Seanad is coming into focus.  How long will they exist?  The Leader has been very co-operative in prioritising the business of the House, but I believe we must have a new focus in terms of how long the Seanad will exist and what legislation can be passed.  Fianna F&aacute;il referred to two important Bills earlier.  I ask the Leader to engage with the group leaders to see if we can prioritise the legislation that can be passed by the House in whatever length of time we have left to serve.  Certainly, I had hoped that we would have made better progress on Seanad reform.  Over the last few weeks the need to move quickly with that has rapidly come into focus, if it is not to be passed to another Seanad and D&aacute;il.  I know the Leader will engage with Members on trying to prioritise what business we can get through in whatever length of time we have left in the House.</p></speech>

The decisions that this Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services recommend will have an impact on whether the country addresses serious environmental issues such as pollution, water shortages and water quality.  The Oireachtas, irrespective of political ideology and party positions, has a responsibility to the State and its citizens.  The decisions that will be taken will impact on the risk to our environment and the risk to the State's finances.</p> <p>If we are not legally compliant with our EU obligations and, indeed, Irish environmental law, the State will be exposed to serious financial risk in terms of fines that are retrospective to 2009, amounting to approximately &euro;20,000 per day, with a lump sum also attached.  If we do not take a responsible position on the future of water services in the country, a legal liability of almost &euro;50 million will be attached to the taxpayer.</p> <p>In addition, we will not have a sustainable system that will address the pollution flowing into our rivers and onto our beaches and capacity shortages in Dublin and other cities.  This affects our future in sustaining water services.  Will the Leader use his influence to ensure that colleagues, irrespective of party positions, adopt a responsible position and will he make provision for a long debate on this issue when the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services has finalised its recommendations?</p></speech>

The former is the Critical Health Professionals Bill 2017, which would allow all critical health employees of the Department of Health, the HSE and section 38 organisations to prolong their working lives for an initial two years on the basis of dual consent.  This issue was first raised as an amendment to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which passed through this House recently and which received widespread support from those on all sides.  I am not suggesting that the Bill will cure the woes of our health system but it will help to ameliorate some of the issues surrounding staff shortages and the haemorrhage of talented and vastly experienced staff from our health service.</p></speech>

The song refers to the ebb tide of water and one could apply the analogy to the ebb and tide of politics.  It struck me that many people were exercised very much by the ebb and tide of politics, whatever their direction and whatever the party to which they belonged, if any.  If one replays the commentary on the radio this morning or reads the coverage in the national press today, one will note that there is much debate about the Attorney General's legal opinion.  That is all it is - a legal opinion - and it has never been tested.  It is untested by the courts.  That is always worth saying about any legal advice, particularly that of the Attorney General.</p> <p>I am very conscious of the water services directive and the penalties to which Senator Coffey referred.  It is clear that there is dilemma, particularly for Fianna F&aacute;il.  Understandably, that party does not want to find itself in a situation where it is seen to be facilitating the reintroduction of water charges.  That is a political call that Fianna F&aacute;il alone can make but it is my view that it would be blatantly irresponsible to oppose the imposition of a penalty on people who waste such a valuable resource.  On my first day in Seanad &Eacute;ireann I said that I am not against a charge for irresponsible waste and abuse of the rich resource that is water.  We must address that issue.</p> <p>I wish to refer to a statement by the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, on Sunday last.  She spoke about how Members of these Houses must work and referred to the need for consensus.  Members might say that is all very well and while I am not trying to promote the Minister of State or the Government, she did strike a note in terms of consensus politics.  We must find consensus.  The politics of the numbers in these Houses has been given to us by the people and within those confines we have to govern and introduce legislation.</p> <p>I will wrap up by saying that it is very important that we have a fair and generous free water allowance but that anyone who is irresponsible and does not respect that resource must be penalised.  I would also like to discuss with the Minister issues such as rainwater harvesting, installing storm water attenuation tanks on farms and domestic premises in order to save water and so forth.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House following the publication of the Oireachtas committee's report.  I also ask the Leader to convey to the Minister my view that he should lead an all-party delegation to the European Commission to determine the issues and the possible penalties involved.</p></speech>

The dispute appears to have escalated overnight and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will have to get involved.  A strike by Bus &Eacute;ireann will have a very detrimental effect on rural Ireland, although the Minister refuted that claim today.  The Minister should take a trip on a bus to see the areas of the country covered by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A strike will also affect tourists, who depend on buses to get to and from airports and so on.</p> <p>The Irish Heart Foundation launched a campaign today that is aimed at preventing the online targeting of children by the producers of junk food.  Given that one in every four children in Ireland is obese, this is an issue that must be taken very seriously.</p></speech>

I am thinking, in particular, of the leaders of the Traveller communities across Ireland who fought for this for many years.  I am sure we will revisit this issue over the next week or so.</p> <p>In fairness to the Leader, he has arranged a number of debates with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, for which I thank him.  The theme that I pursued during those debates was the fact that when one looks at the transport map of Ireland, one can see that the 500,000 people who live in the north-west region have no motorway or rail connection; nor do they have any direct air connection from Derry city, the fourth largest city on this island, to Dublin.  That reflects the Border, partition and neglect over many years.  Just to reiterate, there is no publicly-funded rail or air connection and no motorway.  Every other region, and rightly so, has such connections.  In that context, I am absolutely stunned that of all of the locations that Bus &Eacute;ireann would seek to remove services from, it chose the route to Derry.  That will mean that we will have no publicly-funded rail, bus, air or motorway connections for a population of 500,000 people.  While I know that Translink in the North provides services, as do a number of private operators, I ask the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  The Minister must be asked to explain how Bus &Eacute;ireann can make such a decision because it defies logic.  It clearly demonstrates a total lack of joined-up thinking in Government in terms of transport on this island.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to respond to the House directly on this matter, particularly in view of the fact that he reassured us that these issues are of importance to him and to the Government.</p></speech>

Will the Leader tell us what time the debate on the aforementioned Bill is due to start and how many hours will be devoted to the discussion.  I also ask that amendment groupings list be furnished to Senators.  On a previous occasion, we did not receive the amendment groupings list until just prior to the debate.  In order to be prepared and to have a decent debate tomorrow, we should be provided with the groupings list today.  I would really appreciate that because it would serve all Senators well in terms of their preparation for tomorrow's debate on the Heritage Bill 2016.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to debate this issue in the House as soon as possible.  This is an issue of particular concern to me in the context of the Irish Cement plant in Castlemungret, County Limerick.  I attended two public meetings recently with residents of the area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The concern is whether the EPA is actually monitoring air quality, something I would like the Minister to address when he comes before the House.

While Peter was not known for his brevity, he certainly was for his bravery and principles.  I extend my condolences to his wife and four children.  Ar dheas D&eacute; go raibh a anam dilis.</p> <p>I agree with everything Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn said about the lack of transport and air infrastructure in the northern part of the country.  I come from a county that had huge infrastructure, both rail and bus, in the 1950s and early 1960s.  When the railway line was lifted and closed, we were assured that the road infrastructure would be upgraded and that we would not be neglected.  Unfortunately, for people north of a line running from Galway to Dublin, apart from a short stretch of motorway through County Meath, that area of the island has been neglected.  At a time when we are concerned about Brexit and the implications it will have for us as a nation, a national bus route to one of the principal cities in the North of Ireland is to be closed.  That is nothing short of disgraceful and the matter should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I appeal to the Leader to use his good offices and implore the Taoiseach and especially the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who has an opinion on everything other than the Department for which he is responsible to intervene in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

We cannot comprehend the grief she must be feeling today and my deepest sympathy goes to her and her family.  Peter was, indeed, a decent and generous man.</p> <p>I debated a Commencement matter yesterday with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  It concerned the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I am not in the business of bashing the Minister and think he is doing the best he can under the circumstances.  However, this morning I learned from the National Treatment Purchase Fund that every condition was not necessarily covered.  For example, we are told neurosurgery is not available under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  We probably need the Minister to come and outline specifically what is and is not available.  There was a gerrymandering of the figures on waiting lists in the south east, where everybody on a waiting list received a letter telling him or her that he or she was off it and that he or she had to reapply.  We received an explanation yesterday, but what we now need to know is if the National Treatment Purchase Fund is available to everybody.  If so, what conditions are covered by it and how does one get from a waiting list to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to have the treatment one urgently needs?  Yesterday I was given the example of someone looking to have an orthopaedic procedure carried out.  Two people I know are seeking the same treatment, one of whom is on the public list, while the other is on the private list.  The person on the public list will have to wait two years, while the person on the private list only has to wait two days.  We need to get to the bottom of this problem.  In that regard, I would appreciate the Leader's assistance.  This is not in any way a criticism of the Minister who is doing as fine a job as he can.  At one stage the Department of Health was called Angola.</p></speech>

He was a great friend and colleague and always available to give advice when one needed it.  Our thoughts are with his family.  He was a decent man.</p><p>Last night there was a CHAMP<b></b>event.  The aim is to promote dialogue and co-operation between Deputies, MPs, Lords, Members of the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the National Assembly for Wales.  They are needed now more than ever.  I say this because I was in London a few weeks ago to attend a London-Irish Construction Network event.  The Irish are beginning to mobilise and work together.  This is important and something that should have been happened 50, 60 or 70 years ago.  Perhaps it is a matter of confidence, but it is something at which we have to look in the context of Brexit and what is happening in the United States.  I say this because ironically the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce was only set up in 2011 after the Queen's visit, despite Ireland being the United Kingdom's largest trading partner, with hundreds of thousands of people moving forwards and backwards between the two countries.  It is doing great work.  On St. Patrick's Day the Taoiseach will be in the United States, while Ministers will be selling Ireland around Europe.  They, too, are doing a great job, but there is a role to be played by Senators in representing the country.  We do not have to be paid for it.  One can book a Ryanair flight to anywhere in Europe for &euro;20 or &euro;30.  We are sending Ministers, but there are only so many to go around.  Members of the Seanad<b></b>could represent the country and could do so on a cross-party basis.  We do not want to be paid expenses.  We could do it ourselves.  We should look at this for the future.</p></speech>

I, too, extend my condolences to the family of the late former Deputy Peter Matthews.  The only phrase that sums him up is that he was a consummate gentleman in everything he did.</p><p>I raised concerns previously in a Commencement debate about the administration of the affordable housing scheme by Galway City Council.  I note that <i>Galway City Tribune </i>reported recently that a Galway City Council employee had been suspended because of metering irregularities.  The report stated an investigation was being carried out into alleged irregularities involving pay and display parking meters and that a member of staff was on leave pending the outcome of this examination.  Councillors have said a thorough investigation is needed and have criticised the local authority for releasing a statement without first informing councillors of what was happening.  They have raised questions about the transparency of the way the matter is being handled.  I am also told by people quite close to Galway City Council, on foot of other issues I have raised, that other serious issues may come to light concerning the misappropriation of property belonging to the council, something which has been happening on an ongoing basis.  I wonder if the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is aware that these issues are being investigated and, if so, who is investigating them?  Who is being told about what is going on?  I am led to believe that, all in all, Galway City Council could be out of pocket by as much as &euro;800,000 or even &euro;1 million because of a number of these irregularities.  Who will ultimately pay the price?  We need to have a debate with the Minister on the oversight mechanisms in place in local authorities.  Is the Department notified when such issues arise and, if so, what does it do about it?  Does it merely take a hands-off approach?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What mechanisms are in place in the Department to ensure that proper oversight and procedures are in place in respect of financial and capital asset management in local authorities?  Are these incidents particular to Galway City Council or are similar irregularities happening in other local authorities?  In light of recent issues with organisations in this State investigating themselves, is it appropriate for a local authority to be judge and jury over irregularities that happen on their own watch?  How can one have confidence that such investigations can be thorough, impartial and in the best interest of citizens?  A lot of Members of this House are concerned about the responsibility of the elected representatives on these local authorities regarding the issues being raised since they state they are not being informed on an ongoing basis as to what is going on.  I wonder whether ignorance is a defence in their case.  We must get to the heart of this matter and discuss it with the Minister in detail.</p></speech>

He has fought honourably for this for many years.  I heard him on the wireless this morning and I was very moved by his tribute to his Traveller grandmother.  It was a very fine statement and I think that we all appreciate it.</p> <p>This is Ash Wednesday and I note the Cathaoirleach himself is wearing the marks of the ash.  I do not agree with the proposal to open public houses on Good Friday.  It is an extraordinary thing to say.  Good Friday is the most solemn day in the Christian calendar.  It is the most serious day, the day on which Christ was crucified.  We have 1,500 years of Christian observance in this country, it is a wonderful tradition.  We may be somewhat post-Catholic at the moment but I do not think that is any reason to jettison our religious, ethical and cultural standards and values.  In Muslim countries, people from outside and people who are Christians have to observe the cultural traditions of those countries and if not they are severely punished.  Working people deserve a day of rest.  If we introduce this people will be forced against their will to work in pubs, hotels and so on and I think that is completely wrong.  Were such an instrument to be introduced in this House, I for one would vigorously oppose it.</p></speech>

It is still too high at around 436.  I received a note this morning from Nursing Homes Ireland stating that 834 beds are vacant in 210 nursing homes nationwide.  There is a proposal from the Minister to build prefabs to accommodate new hospital beds and while I have no difficulty with that, we also must look at other options that are available.  We used prefabs for schools and we need to look at this carefully.  One possibility we must consider, where we can plan and deliver very fast, is step-down facilities quite close to existing hospitals.  We have not done that in Ireland although we seem to be able to build barriers to looking at new ideas.  We must consider matters carefully before we start using prefabs as we did in respect of schools.  It ended up with a huge cost to the State.  The previous Government tried to remove prefabs from schools and were we to go down this road for hospitals, would we be doing the same thing in ten or 15 years' time, that is, trying to remove the prefabs from hospital grounds?  We particularly need to look at what is available already.  As Nursing Homes Ireland has 834 vacant beds available in private nursing homes, it is about co-operation between the health services and the private sector on this matter.</p></speech>

I want to give my support to her mother, Vera, and the family.  It is disgraceful that this little girl, who has dozens of seizures daily, is not getting medical cannabis and the Minister needs to step in and give it to her.</p> <p>Medical cards are one of the biggest issues here.  Senators all face the issue and I keep bringing it up but it is getting worse.  When someone is waiting for an urgent medical card, the delays are the same or are actually worse.  I told the Minister recently that there is a difference in respect of palliative care, on which I compliment the Minister.  There is a great service for palliative care medical cards, which are provided straight away, but on urgent medical cards where, for example, someone might be starting their cancer treatment in the next week, there is a massive delay and if someone does not have the full information within three months, they must reapply.  This is unacceptable.  The other issue relating to medical cards that keeps coming up is that when a person applies for a medical card and is barely over the limit, by say &euro;3 to &euro;5, he or she is disqualified and does not get a medical card.  Years ago, there was a system in place whereby someone who had a hardship case or a medical grounds case would get that medical card but that is not happening.  The Minister needs to step in and the Department needs to look at this as being crucial.  A medical card is so precious to people that it is like a gold card but we need to look at the people who are barely over the threshold by a few euro and who are not being accepted.  In addition, urgent cards need to be given out really quickly.  One cannot keep asking patients undergoing cancer treatment or any other type of treatment for further information; they need to be given medical cards.</p></speech>

Any people who booked their summer holidays would have been delighted to think they were not going to pay extortionate roaming charges to fill the coffers of mobile providers.  It is set to be law by 15 June 2017 and would see the abolition of roaming costs.  People thought at least the EU was listening and was doing something for ordinary people and it makes the EU a bit more relevant to people in different countries.  Unfortunately, thus far at least three or four mobile providers have indicated it will not apply to them.  Instead of allowing people to roam like home, these providers will jig around with the terms and conditions and make it obsolete.  They are putting it up to ComReg and giving it the proverbial two fingers by stating that customers will not get the same amount of data when abroad.  The providers' intention and action is to put in place a two-tier data system for when the EU law passes.  It is shocking that ComReg left data out of this regulation.  While the regulator put in talk, text and calls, data services are the most important thing we use when abroad and in our day-to-day life.  The EU has been caught unintentionally or deliberately in obfuscating this issue and ComReg seems to be the butt of an absolutely farcical joke.  I call on the Leader to request the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to update Members on this issue to ascertain whether there is anything they can do to take over from the greedy providers of mobile services. </p></speech>

We brought in all the stakeholders from the agricultural and fishing communities and from the food industry.  It is a comprehensive 124-page document and I compliment everyone who was involved in its production and on the work put into it.  It is important, from the Seanad's point of view, to use the information available in that report to feed into the Seanad's own Brexit committee.  I propose Members have a debate in this House on the report published yesterday to inform Members who were not on that committee about the 27 recommendations it contains.  That could feed into the greater document which will be produced by the Seanad's Brexit committee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is potential benefit for many industries.

Taking the information from that extensive report can feed into the greater works that are being proposed by the Brexit committee set up last week.</p></speech>

I know a number of colleagues have raised it yesterday and today.  My concern is that people seem to be viewing it as an industrial relations issue, when in fact it is much bigger than that.  Government policies are at the heart of the problems faced by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  An example is the Government policy not to give adequate public service obligation levy, PSO, subvention.  It was cut dramatically over the last decade.  It has been increased recently, but it is nowhere near where it needs to be.  Subventions in other European countries run at around 50%, whereas here it runs at 10%.  That is an issue of Government policy that needs to be addressed.   The free travel scheme is only being subsidised by 40%.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is missing out on around &euro;17 million in fees there.  That will not be solved via industrial relations.  It will only be solved by a change in Government policy.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Leader has asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to come in.  The problem is the Minister is not listening.  The Minister's insistence that he will not intervene in the dispute is putting the cart before the horse.  If he were to recognise the failures in Government policy from a funding point of view, and address them, it would make a solution viable.  The difficulty is it would appear that the Minister is intent on driving Bus &Eacute;ireann off a cliff.  This company will close in May if the funding issue is not resolved.  The trade union movement has made concrete suggestions to place Bus &Eacute;ireann under the direct ownership of the CIE holding company, and to negotiate with the National Transport Authority and other stakeholders to build a proper future for our national bus company.  </p> <p>I remind the Leader that when I told him two weeks ago that there would be cuts to services in Bus &Eacute;ireann, he said that I was scaremongering.  We now know there are cuts to Clonmel, Limerick, Galway, Westport and Derry.  I also remind him that travel passes are not accepted by most of the private operators that the National Transport Authority thinks are adequate to replace Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  This is a major issue for rural communities.  It is a major issue for the west of Ireland.  The Minister is failing.  I ask the Leader to directly intervene.  Otherwise the Government is heading into a general election when it is going to close the national bus company.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we should stop procrastinating.</p> <p>In regard to what Senator Norris mentioned about Good Friday, there are two sides to this story.

However, every country changes with time, even Islamic and Christian countries.  What is tolerable for some is intolerable for others.  I do not accept the proposition that anybody with a religious sentiment is offended by the fact that those who want to use a public house on Good Friday do so.  It does not in any way interfere with religious freedom or religious reverence.</p> <p>I echo what Senator Wilson mentioned about infrastructure in the North and north west of the country.  I regularly travel on the M4 to Mullingar, where the motorway stops.  From there on to Sligo, and up to Donegal town, it is a very poor road in some areas.  Likewise, the N3 Cavan-Derry route is completely underdeveloped.  I recently went to a briefing with IBEC at which it indicated that instead of the country concentrating on the mantra of reducing public indebtedness from 75% down to 45%, it having already reduced from 120%, we should concentrate on getting public infrastructure right.  If necessary under EU budgetary rules, we should use public private partnerships to build this essential infrastructure.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, when he comes in and deals with all of the other issues which he is supposed to be dealing with, and expresses all the other opinions that we are asking him to express in this House, to deal with the urgent need to restore the programme which existed prior to the financial crash of building decent public infrastructure out to the North and north west.  As has been stated in the House, the city of Derry and the people of Derry are entitled to have decent connectivity via Cavan and Monaghan with Dublin.  If we are at all sincere about all the rhetoric about Brexit and soft borders and the like, the hardest border is that it is very hard to drive that distance now.  We need now to have a renewed infrastructural programme, using public private partnerships if necessary.  We cannot live in the straitjacket of EU budgetary arrangements and yet at the same time expect this country to prosper and, in particular, the north west to prosper.  It has been isolated and cut off for far too long.</p></speech>

If I can reply to Senator Daly about Orkambi.  This morning I spoke with representatives from Vertex.  I fully agree with the Senator that this matter must be resolved.  The HSE and the Minister have been engaged and are working to bring the matter to a resolution and to a successful conclusion.  The Minister is on record as saying that he hopes it will be concluded in the next couple of weeks, that his priority is to ensure that agreement is reached, and that we can provide certainty to the cystic fibrosis patients who require not just Orkambi but Kalydeco and other drugs now and also for the future.  There has been engagement.  I am led to believe that the process is coming to the final part of the negotiations which I hope will resolve the matter conclusively and successfully.  I was very heartened by my conversation this morning with Vertex.  However, as I said yesterday on the Order of Business, it is through engagement and negotiation that we can reach a resolution.  That requires both sides, the HSE and Vertex, to sit down and negotiate and thrash this out properly.</p> <p>In regard to matters the Senator raised about legislation and statements on the Irish Sign Language Bill, I can tell the Senator I would pass the Bill tomorrow morning.  I am not objecting or obstructing the Bill being passed.  What is incumbent upon the Senator and I as Members of this House is to act responsibly as to how this legislation can be progressed.  What the Senator and I both want to see is a Bill that can be enacted from day 1, from this House.  The Senator has been engaged with my office and the Department and he knows well there is a process under way.

I am not familiar with the issue she raised regarding the mental health unit in Kerry but in the HSE service plan and expenditure for the Department of Health, there has been provision for &euro;115 million, with over 1,100 new posts for mental health since 2012.  There is &euro;851 million for key programmes in this calendar year alone.  The HSE service plan is committed to much capital investment, along with service investment in terms of improving facilities and services for young people.  I would be happy for Senator Freeman to gives me the specifics that have not been addressed by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  I am surprised as she was here on 1 February for Senator McFadden's Commencement debate.  She is quite open to discussing the matter.  I would be happy for the Minister of State to return on that.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the JobPath issue.  I share some of her concerns about JobPath, as I stated before in the House.  Senator O'Donnell has also raised the matter in the House.  A review is being undertaken and it would be premature to have a debate now on the issue.  I would be happy to have the debate when the review is concluded and published.  The Senator also raised the issue of hip replacements and the health system.  When I was canvassing in Ballycastle last Saturday in the North, I closed my eyes and thought I was listening to people giving out about the health system but it was people under the Sinn F&eacute;in Government in the North who were complaining.  It is ironic that Senator Conway-Walsh raised the matter of hip replacements.  I met a lady who had to spend &pound;10,000 of her own money as she waited two years for a knee replacement but could not get it.  That is under the watch of Sinn F&eacute;in in the North.  Let us have a proper debate about health North and South in that regard.</p> <p>I join Senators Kelleher, Mac Lochlainn and Norris in their comments on Travellers.  I apologise if I missed anybody else who spoke on the issue.  Senator Mac Lochlainn has played a tremendous advocacy and ambassadorial role, which is an example of how collective positioning by political parties and non-political parties or Independents can bring such an important and historic day as today.  I heard Senator Mac Lochlainn speaking this morning and I thank him.  I praise the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who was very strong in his view on how to get to this point when he served as Chairman of the justice committee in the previous Oireachtas.  It is a good day and one we should celebrate.  There will no doubt be detractors but today is a day on which we should rejoice and recognise the importance of the ethnicity of the Traveller community.  As a former Chairman of the Cork City Council Traveller accommodation committee, I know of these men and women who have fought for rights, entitlements and respect.  It is a day for them and their families.</p> <p>Senators Humphreys, Wilson, Craughwell, Feighan and &Oacute; Clochartaigh joined yesterday's tributes to the late former Deputy, Peter Mathews.  It was put in context when Senator Craughwell mentioned that the mother of his wife, Susan, has died as well.  It is an awful tragedy.  At a time when some commentators were telling us all what to do, Peter Mathews rolled up his sleeves, stood for election, came here and played his role.  It is a testimony to the man that, unlike some people, he was not prepared to be the hurler on the ditch.  He came here and gave of his time and effort to try to make our country a better place.  It is one of his legacies.  I thank Members for their contributions in respect of and tributes to the former Deputy, the late Peter Mathews.</p> <p>Senators Humphreys and Daly referred to the group meetings we have every week.  In a non-political way, we try to put forward legislation or a roadmap of the agenda for the week ahead.  We will do that again today.</p> <p>Senator Coffey raised the issue of water and I give a commitment that we will have a debate on the publication of the committee report in the House.</p> <p>I commend Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on his stewardship of the committee thus far.  It is important for people to take off the politically populist jersey now and be responsible.  We should be conscious of from where we have come and where we need to be.  We cannot afford to return to the bad old days of spending everything we have while expecting the State to provide everything.  If we were to take the Vincent Browne model of taxing just the rich, we would have no money in our coffers to do anything or to meet the needs highlighted by many people in this House every day.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan referenced a song performed by Frank Sinatra.  I hope Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin does not take a Frank Sinatra-style "I-did-it-my-way" approach to the water issue.  I hope the Deputy behaves in a politically responsible way, as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is trying to do.</p> <p>I am happy to accept Senator Swanick's amendment to the Order of Business and I commend him again on the work he is doing in the area of health.</p> <p>Senators Byrne, Mac Lochlainn, Wilson, McDowell and Gavan raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann and public transport.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is still before the committee or was before it this morning.  From his remarks to the committee, it is evident that he is very clear in his approach.  He is willing to commit to the Government not attacking the public bus service in Ireland, as some people are alleging.  He is looking to expand the public bus service in rural Ireland by means of increasing the amount of public service obligation, PSO, funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann and providing a 24% increase in funding to rural transport programmes.  In addition, there have been increases in the PSO services and it is important, despite what Senator Gavan has argued, to remember that this is primarily an industrial relations matter.  There is a need-----</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach stated and I mentioned yesterday, Bus &Eacute;ireann is losing &euro;50,000 per day on the Expressway service.  That cannot be sustained no matter where one is from.  The Senators have raised challenges regarding infrastructure deficits across the country and I would be very happy to have the Minister come back to answer those remarks and be specific on the issues raised.  He has been here twice for debates and on a number of occasions for Commencement issues.</p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan spoke about the Heritage Bill 2016.  It was agreed at the meeting of leaders last week that we might have four hours allocated to it tomorrow.  My understanding is it will be from approximately 12.45 p.m. to 5 p.m.  As was mentioned, the grouping of amendments is not my remit.</p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the Irish Cement plant in Limerick.  I gave a commitment yesterday to Senator Byrne on that issue, which is very important.  A debate on air pollution and clean air must take place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Craughwell commented on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I am happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.  I do not agree with the Senator regarding gerrymandering of the figures but I will ask the Minister to come to the House to provide clarification on the figures for the NTPF.</p><p>I join with Senator Feighan in highlighting the importance of St. Patrick's Day and the need for all of us, whether Ministers or whoever, to be able to sell the message of Ireland.  To be fair, I might have my battles with Senator Daly, but he does a very good job of promoting Ireland across the United States and in particular in Capitol Hill.  Senator Feighan does a similar job in the UK with the Good Friday and North-South committees.  They are the role models we can use as public representatives, in addition to our Ministers.  It is surprising that the British Irish Chamber of Commerce has only been around since 2011.  Anyway, it is important that we sell Ireland.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised a very important and sensitive matter that is under investigation.  I do not believe any of us would condone or support the loss of the amount of money Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referenced &ndash; either &euro;800,000 or &euro;1 million - in regard to irregularities.</p><p>I am unsure whether the Minister is aware of the matter because I do not know who would bring the matter to his attention, whether the chief executive of Galway City Council or Galway County Council.  Certainly, if Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has information, I encourage him to go to the Minister, the local government Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General or perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh highlighted an important matter and it certainly should not be passed on to the taxpayer in any shape or form.  An oversight mechanism should be used and I would be happy to work with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh in that regard.</p></speech>

I will do it now as we had that discussion yesterday.  I made reference to the fact that we hope to have the debate on the report in the House.  We are trying to get a slot for it.  We heard a number of contributions on the matter yesterday during the Order of Business.  As I said yesterday, it is fine to have a tribunal established, but what we need is responsibility, accountability and transparency with regard to the way people were treated.  This woman was treated disgracefully by our State.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, an apology should be given.  Not only that, there should be a clear understanding that this can never be allowed to happen again.</p> <p>Senators Norris, McDowell and Devine called for debate.  I will allow for the debate when it comes to the debate on the Bill from Senator Lawless relating to the sale or non-sale of alcohol on Good Friday.  I respect the views of all sides of the House with regard to the sale of alcohol on Good Friday.  I hope we will have a full and frank exchange during the debate.  There will be diverging views.  We will have that debate in due course.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Colm Burke on the issue of the use of nursing homes.  He is right to articulate and advocate the figures from Nursing Homes Ireland.  Senator Burke stated 834 beds are available in 210 nursing homes today.  It makes absolute economic and political sense, not to mention the advantages for the health and well-being of the senior citizens involved, that we should work with Nursing Homes Ireland to be able to utilise those beds.  Senator Burke is right.  We need more step-down facilities.  This is one of the greatest deficits in our health system.  Those of us who have clinics and who deal with people know it.  The question of step-down facilities for a one-week or two-week convalescence is a major problem.  I share Senator Burke's views in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of Ava Twomey.  Again, I commented on the issue yesterday on the Order of Business.  It is important that the case of Vera and Ava Twomey is highlighted again in the House today.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has given a commitment with regard to compassionate access around medical cannabis.  The Minister cannot write the prescription or make the diagnosis.  There is a need for more engagement on this matter.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and medical cards.  The Senator is not right regarding the issue of medical cards on discretionary grounds.  Discretion is available and it is utilised by the PCRS and the HSE.  I call on Senator Murnane O'Connor to bring the matter to the attention of the people involved.  A scheme is available.</p> <p>It is important to welcome the change for 400,000 pensioners and medical card holders.  Prescription charges are being reduced from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 per item and to a maximum of &euro;20 per month.  It is a good news day for those people and I welcome the move.</p> <p>I am not familiar with the issue raised by Senator Devine on the loophole for roaming charges.  Perhaps she could raise the matter in a Commencement debate.  If she does not, I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.</p> <p>Senator Lombard referenced the issue of the Brexit committee and the report from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I commend all those involved and hope that we can utilise the report as part of the work of the Seanad Brexit committee.  It is important to note that both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have appointed their Seanad spokesperson on agriculture to that committee.  I am unsure whether Sinn F&eacute;in or the Independent Members have done so.  I am unsure who their representatives are.  The move highlights the importance of agriculture in the whole Brexit negotiations.</p></speech>

I was not aware of that.</p> <p>I was at the same IBEC briefing as Senator McDowell and I fully agree with him.  There needs to be a utilisation of the public private partnership model.  There is also a need to look at how we can use the European Investment Bank in terms of being able to draw down funding.  We need to invest in infrastructure.</p> <p>I am sure the Cathaoirleach was listening to the US President, Mr. Trump, last night.  He spoke of his plans for the United States of America in terms of investment in infrastructure.

What was true then is true now.  Domestic violence is a pernicious evil that has devastating physical, emotional and financial consequences for victims as well as society as a whole.  It is not acceptable that anyone in Ireland is subjected to abuse, fear and intimidation.</p> <p>The purpose of this Bill, which has been a key priority for me, is to consolidate and reform the law on domestic violence to provide better protection for victims.  I am also very glad to advise that the Bill also includes provisions to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, more commonly known as the Istanbul Convention.  These include a new provision for emergency barring orders and a new offence of forced marriage.</p> <p>The Bill is part of a larger package of measures aimed at dealing with the scourge of domestic violence in our community.  As Senators will be aware, I am also funding a major national awareness campaign on domestic and sexual violence called &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; which is a part of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.  I pay tribute to the many stakeholders and those working on the front line in dealing with domestic violence, some of whom have joined us in the Gallery today, who came together the other day to have a very useful consultation on the campaign.  This campaign calls on us as relatives, friends, neighbours, bystanders and witnesses to say collectively that domestic violence is not right and it must stop.  It is an opportunity for each of us to start a conversation about what we would do if we came across situations such as those we see on the television and radio ads.  It is not enough for us to turn a blind eye.  We must all step in to support victims and make domestic violence unacceptable in a civilised society, and it goes without saying that we must do so in a way that is safe.</p> <p>I would like to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains standard provisions.  Part 2 deals with the various orders that can be applied for under the Bill and the various court procedures we need to provide for to make sure it works for victims.</p> <p>Section 5 provides for the making of safety orders to prohibit violent and threatening behaviour.  Safety orders were first introduced in the Domestic Violence Act 1996 and section 5 largely re-enacts those provisions.  The main change is that the scope of the safety order will be expanded to allow a court to impose as well a prohibition on electronic communication, where necessary, and that is very important.  Safety orders can remain in place for up to five years and a further safety order can be made for a subsequent period of up to five years.  Where a safety order is made for the protection of a dependent child, it will remain in force after the child reaches the age of 18 until the order expires.  I advise Senators that I intend to bring forward an amendment to section 5 on Committee Stage to ensure persons in intimate and committed relationships but who are not cohabiting can also avail of safety orders.  There has been a good deal of discussion about this and many requests.  I have had it examined legally and I am very pleased that I am going to be able to bring in an amendment in that regard.</p> <p>Section 6 provides for the making of barring orders to direct a person to leave a place where the victim resides, or not to enter that place.  Statutory barring orders were first introduced in Ireland by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976.  These provisions were replaced by the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act 1981.  As most Senators know, the Domestic Violence Act 1996 further strengthened the law in this area.  The main change being introduced in this Bill is the removal of the six-month minimum cohabitation requirement in cases involving persons in cohabiting relationships.  The scope of a barring order will also be expanded to allow the court to impose a prohibition on electronic communication.  Barring orders can remain in place for up to three years and a further barring order can be made for a subsequent period of up to three years.  Where a barring order is made for the protection of a dependent child, it will remain in force for the period I outlined.</p> <p>Section 7 provides for the making of interim barring orders where there are reasonable grounds to believe a person is at immediate risk of significant harm.  They were first introduced in 1996 and this section re-enacts those provisions, which were amended in the 2002 Act.  If an interim barring order is granted without notice having been given to the person against whom it was sought, it will have effect for up to eight working days.  In all other cases, an interim barring order will continue to have effect until the application for a barring order has been determined.</p> <p>Section 8 provides for a new emergency barring order - this is a very important new section which is quite transformational - which will put life and limb ahead of property and allow a person in a dangerous situation to get a temporary barring order even if they have no rights to the property.  It has long been discussed as to whether this is feasible.  I am pleased we are introducing it in this legislation.  It is an important new provision which must be enacted if we are to be able to ratify the Istanbul Convention.  A person can apply for an emergency barring order where he or she has lived in an intimate and committed relationship with the perpetrator without being their spouse or civil partner or where he or she is the parent of an adult perpetrator.  The most significant element of this new provision is that a person can apply for an emergency barring order even if they have no legal or beneficial interest in the place concerned or if they have an interest which is less than that of the person against whom the order is sought.  Emergency barring orders will only be granted where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person is at immediate risk of harm.  An emergency barring order may be granted without notice having been given to the person against whom it is sought and it will have effect for up to eight working days.  Once that emergency barring order has expired, another emergency barring order may not be made until one month after the expiry of the previous order, unless the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.  This is to ensure this order will operate as an emergency, temporary measure only.  If there are extraordinary circumstances, it will be up to the court to decide that in terms of granting another one.</p> <p>Section 9 provides for the making of protection orders pending the determination of an application for a safety order or barring order.  A protection order can be made where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the safety or welfare of the person who applied for the order or a dependant are at risk.</p> <p>Sections 10 and 11 allow for applications by the Child and Family Agency for safety orders, barring orders and emergency barring orders.  Those sections re-enact provisions contained in the 1996 Act.</p> <p>Sections 12 and 13 provide protection to spouses and civil partners against disposal of household effects in the period between the making of an application for a safety order or barring order and the determination of that application.  Members will realise how important that would be in these circumstances where a person could lose their personal effects.  This is to provide protection against that.</p> <p>Sections 14 to 20, inclusive, relate to the hearing of applications, the date on which orders take effect, the delivery of copies of orders, appeals from orders and so on.  We are also trying to make the court process less difficult for victims of domestic violence when they are applying for civil orders under the Bill and also in cases where an order is breached and a criminal prosecution follows.  This complements what we are doing in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, which I hope to introduce later today.  It was meant to be introduced in the D&aacute;il yesterday but I hope it will be introduced later today.  That will provide for victims giving evidence in criminal proceedings.  These are various protections we are giving to victims and we are trying to ensure our courts and all the criminal justice agencies become more victim aware and victim centred.</p> <p>We have a section providing for the giving of evidence through live television link where an application is being made to the court for an order under the Bill.</p> <p>We also have a new section, which will be very supportive to individuals in these circumstances, which allows a person who applies for an order under this Bill to be accompanied in court by a person of his or her choice, in addition to any legal representative.  That is to make sure that people in these circumstances feel supported.</p> <p>Another important provision, which I believe will be welcomed by everybody, will enable the court to seek the views of the child when certain orders are being sought on the child's behalf.  This is another important element of the legislation.  It is very much in line with the constitutional changes we have made in regard to children and the work we have done in Children and Family Relationships Act, in the development of which Senators were very involved, where we wanted to ensure the view and the voice of the child in circumstances where they are affected would be heard in the courts.  The courts are engaged in working out how they can best do that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That work is ongoing.  We also have the new Hammond Lane family courts which will be developed over the next number of years, where we will have much better facilities for the hearing of family court actions and cases.  That is very important also as the current conditions people are working in are far from satisfactory.  We have made a decision in regard to the capital for that new development and this will be very important in terms of having better provision for witnesses and better conditions so people do not come face to face with perpetrators and there is no inappropriate contact.  It will make a big difference when we have that new service.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising regulations which will set down the criteria for appointing child view experts under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  Those regulations will also apply to the appointment of experts under this section.</p><p>There is another new provision in line with the EU victims' rights directive and the victims' rights legislation I am bringing in.  This requires the Courts Service to provide information on domestic violence support services to victims, which is where the very important work of victims' rights organisations comes in.  People can be made aware these organisations are available because the courts will have an obligation to tell them about these services.  As we know, specialised services for victims of domestic violence can play an invaluable role in providing support during the court process.  The Courts Service will have to direct people and make sure they are aware these services are available.</p><p>Section 25 provides that the court may direct a person against whom it makes an order under the Bill to engage with a programme or service to address issues relating to his or her behaviour.  This could be a programme for perpetrators of domestic violence at an addiction service or a financial planning service.  The court now has the power to direct a person against whom it makes an order to avail of these services and it can monitor that.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill provides for offences under the Bill and its sections provide for various provisions.  For example, section 31 is a new provision to provide privacy for victims in cases where there is a criminal prosecution for breach of an order.  The judge will be required to exclude all persons from the courtroom except persons directly involved in the case, court officials and bona fide members of the press.</p><p>Section 32 provides for arrest without warrant where a garda has reason to believe that a breach of an order is being, or has been, committed under section 29, following a complaint from, or on behalf of, the person who applied for the order in question.</p><p>Sections 33 and 34 provide that where proceedings are brought for an offence under section 29, it will be an offence to publish or broadcast any information or photographs which could lead to identification of the victim or the person charged, or a dependant of either of them.  Anyone who breaches this anonymity requirement faces strong penalties.  Again, that is being very protective in regard to the victim.</p><p>There is another important new provision I am pleased to be able to introduce in this legislation, namely, the provision in regard to forced marriage.  While the inclusion of this provision is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul convention, I believe it is important to send out a message that such behaviour is not acceptable in 21st century Ireland.  It will be an offence to use violence, threats, undue influence, duress or coercion to cause another person to marry.  It will also be an offence to remove people from the State with the intention that they will be forced into a marriage abroad.  Obviously, the courts will have to look at the evidence and decide on each individual case.  However, if we think about the kind of trafficking we know exists at present, which so often happens with the threat of forced marriage, it is extremely important to have this provision in Irish law so it is accessible for young people who might find themselves in this situation.</p><p>I will bring forward an amendment to this section on Committee Stage to clarify the jurisdiction of the forced marriage offence.  The amendment will make it clear that a forced marriage offence committed outside the State against an Irish citizen can be prosecuted in Ireland, provided the act in question is also an offence in the place where it was committed.  I have had to take extensive legal advice in this regard and I will table an amendment to deal with that situation.</p><p>The Bill contains transitional provisions, as is normal.  There is also an important amendment to remove the exemption for underage marriage.  At present, section 33 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows an application to court for an exemption to the requirement that a person must be over 18 to marry.  We are removing the underage marriage exemption, which should help to protect minors against forced marriage, as requiring both intended spouses to be at least 18 should assist in ensuring that potential spouses have the maturity to withstand parental or other pressure to marry a particular person.  It will also be necessary to change the Civil Registration Act 2004 and section 42 provides for this.  The validity of marriages which have already taken place under the exemption will not be affected.</p><p>The remaining sections in Part 4 amend other legislation.  These are routine changes which are needed because of the changes I am introducing in this Bill.</p><p>In conclusion, like so many other speakers, I have had experience of many cases of domestic violence over the years.  At a certain point, I perhaps naively thought we could end domestic violence and that we would not see it increasing.  Unfortunately, what we see are increasingly complex cases of domestic violence where drugs, alcohol and various addiction issues come into play, and where violence continues to be used.  We need a multifaceted approach to this.  It is about changing societal and individual attitudes.  It is also, however, about having the legislation in place.  We need to work on many different levels to eradicate this evil and to continue to fight it in our society.  Undoubtedly, the law has an important role to play.  I believe this legislation will help to improve the protection in law for victims of domestic violence as it puts the needs of victims first and foremost.  I hope Senators will support the Bill and that we can see it enacted as soon as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

This is a very comprehensive Bill and I have no doubt that, when it passes, it will leave a great legacy.  It is legislation that has long been called for and has been in the melting pot for some time.  As the Minister knows, Fianna F&aacute;il has quite a strong record in this area.  It had the first national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence back in March 2010, and that had been progressed following the recommendations of a task force in 1997.  We were certainly happy to bring that forward at the time and many bits and pieces have been added over the years.  I believe it will be very comprehensive legislation, which I welcome.</p> <p>My party and I support this Bill which seeks to address the appalling problem of domestic violence.  Violence against women in all its manifestations, including domestic violence, is a deeply traumatising act that demands Government action.  While the Minister said there will be amendments and changes to it, in principle, we are happy to support the legislation, which is very timely.  As a society, we will have to look at the greater ills that are leading us to this position.  From talking to garda&iacute;, it is clear domestic violence is close to out of control and, not to put too fine a point on it, it has become unmanageable in recent years.  Perhaps it could be argued that it had been hidden and unreported for a long time and it was not something people liked to discuss in the open.  In ways, life has become cheaper due to social media and other factors, and people can be seen as objects at times, which does not help.  The Bill is certainly a step forward but we may have to look at the greater ills that are leading us to this position.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

At this stage, I would like to put on record our acknowledgment of the work she has done, not just as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, but when she was a social worker.  That is the type of hands-on knowledge that influences legislation in order to ensure it is good and does the right thing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People would probably be shocked to learn that one can go to court and apply to allow somebody younger than 18 years to marry.  Society has moved on to such a degree that it would not even resonate in the consciousness of most, but this legislation will ensure it will no longer be possible to do so.  If somebody is not old enough to vote, how can he or she be old enough to make a decision on marriage?  However one views it, it is abuse.  People are not <i>compos mentis</i>, no matter how good they are or what their background is to make a lifelong decision of that nature at that age.  This legislation brings together much of what should have been done years ago but was not.  Our job, as legislators, is to do what should have been done in many cases.  If a person's home is not safe, it is up to the State to make sure the necessary legislation is in place to ensure adequate protection.<br/><br/>The point about barring orders and a property to which somebody would not have a legal right makes sense.  People, however, have gone to court to defend a request for a barring order on the basis that the person looking for it has no legal right to the home, even though he or she may have lived in it for several years.  It does not make sense and the legislation deals with that issue.  We have a responsibility to constantly review the legislation dealing with domestic violence.  I have no doubt that when the Bill is enacted, it will achieve a lot, but there will probably be other anomalies that we will have to address in a couple of years time, if we are all lucky enough to be still here.  It is an evolving process.  The Minister said she once thought we could eliminate domestic violence.  That should always be our goal.  It is not a na&iuml;ve aspiration but something we should all want.  Society should be foolproof enough to ensure the minute it raises its ugly head ,it is dealt with, but that is a Utopia we will probably never see.  <br/><br/>I commend the bravery of the many who have spoken out recently about domestic violence.  After Christmas Clare FM ran a week long campaign to highlight the work of the Rape Crisis Network in dealing with child sexual abuse and domestic violence.  I raised the issue here with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  People who speak out whether they have been affected or are whistleblowers or conscientious members of the media must be encouraged because as a result of their bravery society can, should and I hope will become a much safer place.  <br/><br/>I look forward to the Minister's necessary amendments when the Bill is taken on Committee Stage.  I am fairly confident that the Bill will receive unanimous support in the House because it has a tradition of coming together to do the right thing.  If any Member identifies amendments he or she believes are necessary, I have no doubt that the Minister will engage on them.  We will deal on Committee Stage with the technical amendments her officials have identified.</p></speech>

Domestic violence can happen to anybody.  It happens to men and women.  It can happen to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, community, an issue about which my colleague will talk in a few minutes.  It can happen in any social stratum.  For want of a better word, I will use the word &quot;victims&quot;, but I like to think of people who experience domestic violence as survivors, whether they are surviving it at the moment or have come out the other side.  </p><p>I hope the Bill can be improved further as it passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I will not be found wanting in helping to make the Bill as good as it can be.  I thank safeireland and welcome Sharon, with whom I have worked.  I also thank Women's Aid and all those working in women's refuges and rape crisis centres throughout the 32 counties.  I have met women from the Shankill Road and Cork who work in the area and have experienced domestic violence.  I thank the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Amnesty International and others with whom I have worked for campaigning tirelessly for changes to legislation and the wonderful work they do every day for survivors of domestic violence.  </p><p>Don Hennessy from Cork has done exceptional work and wholly and completely captured the evil dynamic when perpetrators of domestic violence set to work on their victims.  His book, <i>How He Gets into Her Head: The Mind of the Male Intimate Abuser</i>, helps to make sense of the question many ask: why does she not just leave him?  We know that, on average, it takes seven years for a woman to leave a situation of domestic violence.  Mr. Hennessy helps women experiencing abuse and violence to recognise the power and control games being played to destroy their self-esteem.  </p><p>Above all, I acknowledge the courage, strength and resilience of the women and children who have experienced domestic violence, those who continue to live with abuse and those who have managed to leave.  I want us to remember the 209 plus women who have died violently in Ireland since 1996 and all those who died prematurely because of the violence and abuse inflicted on them.  I acknowledge their suffering and that of their families.  I acknowledge those adults who were robbed of their childhood and have survived domestic violence. </p><p>Domestic violence is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed.  It is a crime that is repeated day after day, night after night for years and sometimes decades.  We often express shock and outrage about one-off incidents when violence is inflicted on a victim, rightly so, but why do we turn a blind eye to domestic violence?  Why do we have an inherent tolerance for sustained attacks on human beings just because the violence occurs behind closed doors or because it is inflicted by a perpetrator who is known to the victim?  What does that say about our society and us, as legislators?  Someone said the Bill was timely, but it is 100 years too late.  The barriers that prevent many from leaving much sooner than they should should be removed and appropriate supports put in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I speak about these barriers from an experience of working with women and children and experience in the area of domestic violence over a number of years.  The lack of alternative accommodation is one of the biggest barriers.  This ranges from the shortage of refuge beds to the lack of transitional housing to spiralling rents.  Women and children who flee domestic violence must be exempt from the red tape and bureaucracy that surrounds housing applications.  The woman may be the joint owner of the house, but if she is fleeing for her life then she can hardly call it home.  To this end, all housing officers should have domestic violence training in order that they truly understand the dangers and dynamics of the situation of the woman who is sitting before them.</p><p>Reference was made to the property test.  We need to remove the property test for co-habitants when applying for a barring order where the best interests of the children of the family so requires.  If there is a strong pragmatic reason this cannot be done, we need the duration of the short-term barring order to be at least six months for the co-habitant applicants who do not satisfy the property test.  The maximum duration of a barring order should be extended to five years.</p><p>Garda&iacute; must be allowed to apply for out of hours barring orders to an on-call judge.  The return date would be the next sitting date in the nearest available court.  This would enable those victims of domestic violence to be protected out of hours and would strengthen the power of garda&iacute; who often try to deal with domestic violence without having the legislation they need to do the job they want to do and ensure the safety of victims.  I hope this legislation can do that.  Garda&iacute; must be empowered to deliver safety and barring orders as a matter of course.  The practice of the person who is suffering the abuse having to deliver the order to the perpetrator is absurd.  We know that the most dangerous time for a woman is when she is trying to leave.  The practice of the perpetrator who may be barred from the house having unsupervised access to the children is terrifying.  It is imperative that the risk posed by the perpetrator of domestic violence to the children of the family, and the impact of such abuse on them, is assessed and that immediate interim measures are taken to protect children.</p><p>I welcome the fact this Bill recognises violence and abuse inflicted by perpetrators who are living separately from the victim of the domestic violence.  Considering all that can be done to abuse a victim through social media and so on, it is past time that this was done.  These are just a few of the elements we need to shore up this Bill.  On Committee Stage Sinn F&eacute;in will have a number of amendments to enhance this Bill.   The Minister has our assurance that we will continue to do everything possible to expedite this legislation.</p><p>Most importantly, this legislation must be underpinned by additional resources for front-line services.  When the budget is being discussed I want the Minister to say to the Minister for Finance in the context of this legislation that she has done all this good work and now we need the resources to be able to make it meaningful.  This involves getting additional funding for refuges, helplines and cross-agency and community training.  This involves additional funding for refuges, helplines and cross-agency and community training.  This training would include mandatory training for judges, about which I will speak at another stage.  According to Safe Ireland, 5,000 requests for refuge places were refused last year. This, in itself, is criminal. I thank the Minister for all the work she has done and we look forward to working with her on the Bill over the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and I thank her for bringing forward this legislation.  I welcome its introduction and I especially welcome the new protections for applicants for domestic violence orders, such as the ability to give evidence by video link for those aged under 18 and for others in certain circumstances, the right to court accompaniment, the extension of safety orders to applicants in dating relationships, and the introduction of emergency barring orders.  In my work with the RISE Foundation I sometimes deal with people who are prepared to stay in a violent relationship because they feel there is no alternative.  They are not financially independent and fear they will become homeless with their children if they try to escape the violence experienced in the home.  The lack of support for these people needs to be addressed and their housing and financial needs have to be met.</p> <p>The introduction of this legislation is to be welcomed as the provisions in the Bill will allow Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention or the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  We all know the statistics.  A recent European Union survey on violence against women has found that 14% of women in Ireland have experienced physical violence by a current or ex-partner and 6% of women have experienced sexual violence by a current or ex-partner.  The survey found that 31% of women have experienced psychological violence by a current or ex-partner.  In Europe, 73% of women who have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or a previous partner indicate that their children have become aware of the violence.  The scale of the problem in Ireland can be seen when we consider the fact that in 2015, there were 12,041 contacts with Women&rsquo;s Aid, in which 16,375 disclosures of domestic violence against women were made, including emotional, physical, financial and sexual abuse.  The extent of the problem can be seen when one considers the recent solved murders of Irish women, of which more than half were murdered by their husband, partner or ex-partner.  Domestic violence is a crime and domestic violence is everyone&rsquo;s business.  Domestic violence kills our women and children.  Women deserve to be protected in their own homes.  I appreciate, however, that men are also suffering from domestic violence, as my colleague Senator Conway-Walsh has said.</p> <p>All too often there is outrage and condemnation when a woman is assaulted in a public place, but most violence suffered by women is in their own homes.  A strong zero tolerance message should be sent out to anyone who commits, or intends to commit, violence in the home.  It should also be considered that a second or subsequent conviction of an offence of domestic violence would be punished by a doubling of the maximum sentence.  This legislation will reinforce the message that domestic violence is a crime, that perpetrators will be punished and victims protected.  These policies must focus on the protection of children and address the impact on children of violence in the home.  Criminalising domestic violence sends a clear message that violence is not a private matter and that it is unacceptable.  It is essential that protective laws are enforced and offenders held accountable.  Violence against women recognises no racial, cultural, economic or religious borders.</p> <p>The human and economic cost of violence against women is enormous.  The personal cost of violence against women can manifest itself in health problems such as depression, poor overall health, eating disorders, gynaecological problems, substance and alcohol abuse and attempted suicide.  The particular impact of domestic violence on children must be taken into account by all Government agencies responding to violence in the home.  Resources must be specifically allocated to support children who are exposed to violence in the home, within the overall context of prevention and support for adult victims of domestic violence.  Interventions that support children who are exposed to domestic violence are crucial in minimising the long-term harm.  Staff who work with children need to be trained to detect early warning signs and to provide appropriate responses and support.  Early detection programmes that train health care workers to ask women about domestic violence can also help to break the silence and encourage women to seek help.  Providing services and support to adult victims of domestic violence can benefit children, especially when the specific needs of children are considered.  Support for locating safe housing, income assistance, access to health care and referrals for psycho-social support services should be considered as means to assist all victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>The link between child abuse and domestic violence has been clearly established, with domestic violence being a very common context in which child abuse takes place.  It has also been found that the more severe the domestic violence, the more severe the abuse of children in the same context.  International research documents the co-occurrence of child abuse with domestic violence and the impact of domestic violence on the developmental needs and safety of children.  Exposure to domestic violence is recognised in itself as a form of emotional abuse with detrimental effects to children&rsquo;s well-being.  I welcome the emergency barring order in this Bill because it puts safety ahead of property rights.  When barring orders are granted to protect a woman from her abusive partner, there is often no assessment process looking at the safety and well-being of children of the relationship.  For example, in many cases the perpetrator may be barred from the house but still have unsupervised access to the children and use that access to continue abusing the children.  It is imperative that the risk posed by a perpetrator of domestic violence to the children of the family, and the impact of such abuse on them, is assessed and that immediate interim measures are taken to protect the children.  When granting a barring order, the safety and well-being of any children should always be considered and appropriate interim measures should be put in place to protect them from further abuse.</p> <p>When examining the issue of domestic violence, it is essential that we not only deal with acts of physical and sexual violence but also acts of psychological and economic abuse, including stalking and other forms of harassment, and acts which are undertaken to exercise coercive control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Indirect forms of harassment, including posting online of harmful private and intimate material in breach of a victim&rsquo;s privacy or impersonating them online are also forms of abuse.</p><p>At present there is a lack of measures to provide for immediate protection in an emergency when the courts are not sitting.  For example, if a domestic violence incident occurs on a Friday evening, there is no recourse to the courts until at least the following Monday.  This may be longer outside Dublin where courts may not sit every day.  It may be unsafe for a woman and her children to remain in the home with the perpetrator and with no protection for this length of time.  While in certain cases garda&iacute; may make an arrest, the perpetrator is usually granted station bail within a few hours.</p><p>In the absence of immediate protection, the woman, often with children, may have no option but to leave the family home and seek protection with family, friends or refuges.  However, family and friends may be unable or unwilling to shelter her and refuges are often full.  The current crisis in emergency refuges and homelessness more generally can mean that women and children who are forced to leave their home may take a long time to secure new accommodation and may be forced into emergency transient accommodation for a long period.  In extreme cases, women and children may find themselves homeless and living on the streets.  In other cases, they may return to the abuser, not having any other realistic alternatives.  Immediate protection and prioritising the victim's safety does not sit well with having to wait, possibly for a few days, for the courts to open.  There remains a clear and unmet need for orders to be available outside of traditional court hours in order that victims of domestic violence do not find themselves in an emergency without protection for extended periods.</p><p>The commitment included in the Minister's press release to table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to extend access to safety and protection orders to those in intimate and committed relationships who are not cohabiting is very welcome.  I thank the Minister for bringing this legislation forward.  It is badly needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#T00200"><p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward such comprehensive legislation.  I wish to talk briefly about my own experience of work in the legal profession.  While I have not specialised in family law, I have been involved in it.  In dealing with any family law matter, a careful balance has to be met.  It is not a very nice situation to be in.  This occurred to me when I was acting for someone and waiting for the case to be called and received a note that the person I was representing had just committed suicide.  Another colleague was involved in a matter being dealt with in court.  During lunch, one of the parties involved in the case committed suicide.  We must be very careful about how judges have to deal with these matters.  It is not all black and white and it is not all straightforward.  It can be very difficult.</p> <p>This is very comprehensive legislation.  When we talk about domestic violence, we can talk about cases in which there is no physical attack and where people are abused mentally.  We can deal with that through legislation.  Another issue is also arising in that the courts system is being used to wear people down.  I am just coming to the end of a case for which I have been in the courts for 16 years.  We have gone from the District Court to the Circuit Court to the High Court to the Supreme Court and back around.  There is no mechanism in place, as far as I am concerned, which prevents this from happening.  That whole process is about using the courts system in an improper manner.  It is something for which we do not have legislation and I do not think we can put legislation in place.  In that particular issue, a Circuit Court judge was judicially reviewed on two occasions to the High Court.  That is all within the law.  It is one of the ways in which family law can become complicated.  It is not all black and white where a clear line can be drawn.</p> <p>I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  I particularly welcome section 21, which allows for evidence to be given by television link.  That is a welcome development.  Section 22 allows for an applicant or aggrieved person to bring someone along to court.  That is also very important.  Section 23 allows for seeking the views of the child.  Going back to my own experience more than 20 years ago, there was a matter in which there was a very good judge who decided he wanted to take on board the views of the child.  He took the child out for a burger during lunch to find out the child's views.  The judge gave a very reasoned decision to accommodate all parties, but in particular to accommodate the views of the child.  It is very important to see how that judge was able to deal with what was a difficult situation and used what powers he had available to him in a very good way.</p> <p>I am a little unclear about the issue the Minister included under section 35 regarding a forced marriage.  That relates to a non-Irish citizen who lives in this country and for whom, for some reason or other, arrangements are made to travel abroad.  I am not clear if this section will cover that individual if he or she is taken outside of the country and enters a marriage.  The Minister might explain that.  I have heard of situations where a person is not an Irish citizen but is living in Ireland, is taken out of the country by questionable means and put into a forced marriage.  I ask the Minister for some clarification on that and whether we can table an appropriate amendment to this section to deal with that.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  It is very comprehensive.  It relies very much on the experience of all those involved in in the courts over the past 30 or 35 years.  The first family law Bill was produced when I was in college in 1976.  At that stage, there was no legislation at all.  We have come a long way in that time and that is welcome.  This is very welcome legislation.  I thank all those in the Department and in the Office of the Attorney General who have been involved in bringing this comprehensive legislation to Government.</p></speech>

I know from many engagements with her on this issue just how much of a personal commitment she brings to the issue of domestic violence, to tackling it and to seeking to ensure better legal treatment of the victims and survivors of this appalling violence.  I commend her on that.  I welcome the Safe Ireland representatives and those in the Visitors Gallery who work in the area.  I commend all those involved in working on this Bill.  I and a number of others on the justice committee held extensive hearings on domestic violence and produced a report in 2014.  I know some of the issues in the report have been addressed in this legislation.</p> <p>This is a very welcome Bill and is a long-awaited codifying reform of the law on domestic violence, repealing and reforming as it does earlier legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  As the Minister said, the Bill is also necessary to enable us to ratify the very important Istanbul Convention.  It is very welcome legislation.  It is also welcome to see it being introduced in the Seanad.  I thank the Minister for that also.</p> <p>As others have done, I commend the bravery of those survivors and victims of domestic violence who have spoken out publicly, especially in recent years when we have seen a great deal of increased awareness around it.  I welcome also the Minister's awareness raising campaign that she mentioned in her opening remarks.  As she said, a huge amount of the issue around domestic violence relates to societal attitudes and myths around domestic violence.  We need to tackle those through other means as well as through legislation.</p> <p>Speaking at the Safe Ireland summit on domestic violence in the Mansion House last November, I was very struck by the bravery of those women who spoke out about their experience of domestic violence.  They were very clear about the inadequacies of the legal system currently.  At an earlier seminar at a 2015 launch of a Safe Ireland research document entitled The Lawlessness of the Home, we heard the stories of 13 individual women who had experienced appalling abuse at the hands of their partners.  They also experienced very negative aspects of the criminal justice system in its legal response.  It is important that we challenge societal attitudes and that we also address the inadequacies of the legal system.  That is something that we are seeing being done in this important Bill.</p> <p>Many have conducted research on the way in which domestic violence is regarded in society.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are those who have spoken about the phrase "domestic violence" as tending to trivialise or minimise the impact of this very serious violence and suggested that other phrases might be more appropriate, such as, for example, speaking of it as violence in intimate relationships.  From extensive research, we are aware of the gendered nature of the violence and that it women tend to be much more likely to experience it.  Recent statistics from Women's Aid show that there were 12,000 contacts with it in 2015.  A recent EU survey on violence against women showed that 14% of women have experienced physical violence by a current or former partner.  We know how prevalent the issue is.  As Senator Kelleher has said, we know the extensive and sometimes fatal violence perpetrated on women and children in the home and we know the gendered nature of this violence.</p><p>I will turn to the inadequacies of the current law and criminal justice system.  In one presentation before the Safe Ireland event in 2015, we heard of a woman who had been eight years before the courts.  This involved 44 separate appearances on her part, all relating to issues of domestic violence.  Senator Colm Burke has spoken of his own experience.  Those of us who have worked in the family law courts are aware of the lack of joined-up thinking and connectedness.  We are aware of child custody applications being heard by judges with no awareness of parallel proceedings on breaches of barring orders or maintenance applications.  Unfortunately, all of these applications have tended to be dealt with in piecemeal fashion.  I declare my own interest.  Anyone who has practised in Dolphin House is aware of how utterly inadequate the facilities are.  The Minister has addressed that.  It is great to hear that Hammond Lane will be coming on stream in coming years.  Many of us have taken instructions in fraught and awful cases in crowded corridors where there is not the space to deal with the harrowing emotions and personal circumstances individuals bring to the court.</p><p>I welcome the procedural provisions in sections 14 to 20 of the Bill, which aim to make the court process easier for victims and survivors.  I welcome other aspects such as the live television link that will be provided for and also the provision around hearing the views of the child.  Barnardos has made a submission on the Bill and has welcomed the recognition of the need to hear the views of the child.</p><p>I also welcome the substantive changes the Minister has spoken about in the Bill in terms of the extension of safety orders to those in intimate and committed relationships who are not cohabiting, namely, the removal of the six-month cohabitation requirement.  The Minister has said she will bring forward an amendment on the removal of the cohabitation requirement, which I very much welcome.  It is something that Women's Aid and others have looked for.  I also very much welcome the new emergency barring order provision which is necessary to ensure we can implement the Istanbul Convention.  All of these will give rise to real and substantial changes for victims and survivors.</p><p>I will turn to the issues of forced and child marriages which are addressed in sections 35 and 39 of the Bill.  I welcome the new offence provided for in section 35.  I give a particular welcome to section 39 because it is an issue I have worked on for some years and which I have spoken about with the Minister many times.  The Minister may have been in the Seanad in 2014 to deal with this when former Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Katherine Zappone and I raised the issue of the need to ensure protection for children against coercion into marriage.  We were very alarmed that between 2004 and 2014, 387 children were married in Ireland under the exemption provided for in the Family Law Act.  That exemption will be abolished under section 39, a development I really welcome.  There is currently no minimum age at which a child can seek an exemption from being allowed to marry.  We know that 302 of the parties under 18 who got married in that period were girls.  There were 33 applications for exemptions in 2015 alone.  A significant number of children are continuing to marry in the State despite 18 being the nominal minimum age of marriage.  I welcome this change, which we called for in 2014 and which the Minister undertook to examine at the time.  The High Court had previously criticised it in 2013 so I welcome it has now come together in this important provision in section 39 which will make 18 absolutely the minimum age for marriage.</p><p>Will the Minister look at some of the recommendations made by Women's Aid in its submission on the Bill?  It talks about the need to ensure that when granting a barring order, a court would consider the safety and well-being of any children of the relationship.  It is an important recommendation to ensure more joined-up thinking and it comes back to the point about the need to ensure a better experience in the courts for victims and survivors of abuse.  I welcome Women's Aid's suggestions on the amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act to ensure that a past history of domestic violence would be seen as an aggravating circumstance.  There is a great deal more work to be done on the consideration of aggravating circumstances in hate crimes.  That is another piece of work but is something that could be looked at, particularly for domestic violence, in the context of this Bill.</p><p>I will conclude by saying how much I welcome the Bill and how much I hope it will result in a change in approach to domestic violence whereby it will be taken extremely seriously - as, I know, the Minister takes it - across society in general.  I also hope that there will no longer be evidence of the sort of attitude that one survivor of abuse described to me whereby other women in the playground of the school said to her "Sure it was only a slap."  Unfortunately, that attitude, which she expressed very eloquently to me some years ago, is still prevalent.  At the justice committee, a former colleague of ours, himself a victim of domestic violence, said how awful it is that women and children are still the people who have to leave the home while the perpetrator remains.  This Bill will do a lot to tackle that situation.  Together with the awareness campaign and changes in policing practice, it will result in a real sea-change in attitudes.</p></speech>

In the 21st century, we often think we have advanced a great deal in terms of issues such as domestic violence.  However, I was horrified a few weeks ago to learn that Vladimir Putin had introduced legislation in Russia which means that if there is a situation of domestic violence, it will not be considered a criminal attack unless bones are broken.  It is horrifying that this should be the case.  I am old enough to remember a time in this country when if the guards were called to a situation of domestic violence, they just said that it was a family matter and that they could not intervene so they just left.  I am very glad we are progressing this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, who has a passionate interest in this matter because of her professional background.  She said that the Bill will enable us to ratify the Istanbul Convention, which is actually very strong on certain issues.  Article 52 of the convention states:</p><blockquote>Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the competent authorities are granted the power to order, in situations of immediate danger, a perpetrator of domestic violence to vacate the residence of the victim or person at risk for a sufficient period of time and to prohibit the perpetrator from entering the residence of or contacting the victim or person at risk.  Measures taken pursuant to this article shall give priority to the safety of victims or persons at risk.</blockquote> <p>This is a very important aspect for us to consider.</p><p>I welcome very much the removal of the six-month cohabitation requirement.  It is a considerable advance.  The Minister said that once the emergency barring order has expired, another emergency barring order may not be made until one month after.  It is extraordinary because the first order is the result of an emergency.  What makes us think that an emergency evaporates after eight days?  A person cannot get another one for a month.  I do not understand the logic of it.</p><p>The issue of forced marriages is something that had not really struck me at all.  I presume it is mainly people who originated in other jurisdictions.  Are there any figures because it had not crossed my horizon at all that there were forced marriages in this country unless one goes back to things like in John B. Keane's &quot;Sive&quot;?  The figures are really quite staggering - 14% of women have experienced physical violence by a partner; 6% have experienced sexual violence by a partner; and 31% of women have experienced psychological violence by a partner.  Of those, 73% say their children were also involved.  We have to take a very strong line with regard to the protection of children.  There were 5,900 - just under 6,000 - disclosures of child abuse to Women's Aid in 2015.</p><p>I would like the Minister to address the question of the property test for cohabitant applicants.  A cohabitant applicant must have an equal or greater interest in the property.  I do not see why property should come into this at all.  I am delighted to see the Minister nodding.  Perhaps she will introduce an amendment.</p></speech>

A provision should be made in the Bill to amend the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act so as to include aggravating circumstances.  Such aggravating circumstances could include the presence of a child when the act of violence was committed - which makes it much worse - the fact that the offence was committed repeatedly, the fact that the offence resulted in physical or psychological damage and the fact that the violence was part of a pattern of repeat offending.</p> <p>Domestic violence clearly does not only occur during office hours or at convenient times.  In that context, we need to have a system where, in an emergency situation, an applicant can apply for an out-of-hours barring order and there should be a panel of on-call judges available for this.  On attending a domestic violence incident, a garda of an appropriate rank should be able to authorise the calling of an on-call judge.  This is logical.  Why should the system only operate on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis?  In every situation, the welfare and interests of the child should be taken into account.  </p> <p>Indirect means of harassment, such as the use of e-mails and other forms of electronic communication, are also worthy of consideration.  It is important to note that children are at the heart of all of this because we know that children who experience domestic violence are more likely to become perpetrators themselves.  I have heard a number of children speak about this but I will not put their views on the record of this House.  The systematic inclusion of the impact of domestic abuse on children should form part of every assessment.  I have already referred to the availability of an out-of-hours panel of judges.  I have also raised the issue of the extension of protection to couples who are not co-habiting.  </p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister, who was a distinguished Member of this House previously, has chosen to introduce this legislation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1372" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#V00200"><p>I welcome this legislation and thank the Minister for bringing it forward.  I commend the work of all organisations supporting survivors and victims of domestic and sexual violence.  I also commend the victims and survivors themselves who have spoken out.</p> <p>Domestic and sexual violence is a poison.  It touches every part of our society.  It demands that we shine a light, raise awareness and go above and beyond the call of duty in providing support to victims and survivors.  I say that in the context of refuges which are under sustained pressure.  As Mayor of South Dublin I learned of the work of the Saoirse Women's Refuge and was proud to support it but that refuge had to turn away 80% of the women who came to it for support in recent years.  If we are serious about women's rights and LGBT rights, then this is an area that needs our continued and increased support.  </p> <p>In our election manifesto in 2016 - some of which is being addressed in this legislation - Sinn F&eacute;in made a commitment to significantly increase funding to domestic violence support organisations.  We also made a commitment to implement the Istanbul Convention.  Further, we promised that should survivors be named on a mortgage with their former abusers, we would remove any obstacles to them accessing social housing.  We also committed to ensuring that garda&iacute; are adequately skilled and trained to enable them to protect and support vulnerable people, including victims of child sexual exploitation, vulnerable adults, domestic violence victims, victims of trafficking and people with mental health difficulties.  </p> <p>In its report entitled Burning Issues 2, the National LGBT Federation called for the introduction of mandatory LGBT equality and awareness training for all public service providers.  The Rape Crisis Network produced a report last year highlighting the barriers facing victims of sexual violence and noted that such barriers were significantly higher for LGBT people.  I commend the network for that report.</p> <p>Above all else, it highlighted the need for hate crime legislation in efforts to address racism, sectarianism and homophobia in society.  It is a critical report, containing very important expert information and research, commissioned by the Rape Crisis Network, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and Gay Switchboard.  The report highlighted the added vulnerability of members of the LGBT community in this sphere.  All victims of sexual and domestic violence face barriers when contacting support services.  However, it is critical that we take into account that this experience can be significantly worse for LGBT survivors, 50% of whom wait more than ten years before reporting abuse compared with 20% of heterosexual survivors.  We must ensure that our public policy is in line with international best practice and information such as that contained in the aforementioned report is critical in this regard.  LGBT people face a consistent struggle for visibility against persistent erasure and for that reason, I thank the Rape Crisis Network and all feminists who were involved in preparing that report.  </p> <p>Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, has been to the fore in the European Parliament in calling for paid leave for survivors of domestic violence.  This is a valuable idea and such a provision has already been introduced in Australia and the United States of America.  The European Parliament voted in favour of such a provision last year.  We need determined efforts to combat domestic violence on the part of the European Commission and member states, including considering the introduction of paid special leave for victims and survivors of such violence.  </p> <p>I again thank the Minister for bringing this legislation before the House.  As Senator Conway-Walsh has already mentioned, Sinn F&eacute;in will be proposing positive amendments as the Bill moves through the legislative process that we hope will improve it.  It is also my hope that LGBT-proofing of public policy, including policy relating to sexual and domestic violence, will become the norm and Sinn F&eacute;in will seek to aid that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-01a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030100002#V00300"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming to the House today.  I welcome the introduction of the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 and the opportunity to provide some feedback on its contents.  Like the Minister, my background is in social work, in both Ireland and England, and I know that domestic violence cuts across class, region and age.  One of the statistics that stood out for me when I was reading the very useful briefing note prepared by Safe Ireland and other civil society organisations was that 31% of women have experienced psychological violence by a current or ex partner.  That is one third of women, which is a huge number of people experiencing something with which they should not have to live.</p><p>The fact that this Bill, as well as dealing with the physical violence that we all know and will not tolerate, also takes seriously the issue of psychological violence is very welcome.  The Bill also takes seriously the impact of domestic abuse on children.  As Senator Norris said, trauma not transformed is often trauma transferred.  Very often children who witness domestic violence become victims or, tragically, perpetrators themselves in adulthood.  The fact that the Bill takes into consideration the views of children and the impact of domestic violence on them is very welcome.  The improved law will be accompanied by an awareness campaign to shift behaviour and attitudes so that we no longer tolerate domestic violence in this country and that is also very welcome.</p><p>Other aspects of the Bill which I welcome include the provisions for court sittings to be held <i>in camera</i>, for evidence from children to be given by video link, which could be extended to all ages, and the rights of victims to be supported and accompanied in court.  I also welcome the new provisions on forced marriages and on emergency barring orders which will offer protection from adult perpetrators, who are sometimes sons or daughters of older people experiencing domestic violence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of particular importance is that, in the digital age, much harassment in an intimate context is now done by electronic means.  Protection against this kind of behaviour is badly needed.  This could be strengthened to include communications with third parties, to catch the awful behaviour popularly known as "revenge porn".  These protections being strengthened would be very helpful.</p><p>The Bill should include a clear and comprehensive definition of what constitutes domestic violence.  This definition should not only include physical, including sexual, but also psychological and economic abuse.  This is all the more important given the prevalence of psychological abuse.  Coercive control should also be included in the definition.  This happens to a great number of people, but it is very hard at times to get action taken on it.  Organisations at the coal face have found it difficult to get orders resulting from non-physical forms of violence.  That is important.</p><p>I welcome that the Minister is going to amend the section affecting former dating partners and people who are not co-habiting.  </p><p>The National Women's Council of Ireland recommends developing guidelines on criteria and considerations for granting orders under the legislation and that these should be broadly phrased to take account of individual and novel circumstances.  There is a concern that, without a clear set of criteria, open list judges will act inconsistently.  There should also be mechanisms to restrict the ability of a respondent to delay or interfere with the course of a domestic violence order application.  Senators Bacik and Burke talked about cases going on in court for years and years, leaving people in a terrible limbo.  Changes should be made so the perpetrators are prohibited from directly interrogating their ex-partners during court proceedings.  I have a concern over possible unintended consequences under section 33(3).  The section is drafted so broadly that it could criminalise any innocent mention of a case, including the accused's identity, by the complainant to anyone.  This could merely be an email to a relative or friend in the course of ordinary private correspondence.  The wording of the section could be tightened up.</p><p>In regard to barring orders, the phrase "putting in fear" is open to many interpretations.  It should be clarified that it refers to the fear felt by the applicant and-or dependants of any future violence or abuse, or threats of same, by the respondent.  </p><p>Many speakers have referred to situations which occur out-of-hours and the fact that abuse does not happen 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or Monday to Friday.  In every instance and at every point of proceedings, the impact on children should be taken into consideration.  There should be a presumption of capacity of applicants with any form of learning or intellectual disability to give instructions and evidence.  The case of Grace this week is a timely reminder of how important that element would be.  Fees should not be a barrier to people accessing justice.   </p><p>I look forward to working with the Minister on the Bill.  It is very encouraging to know that the Minister has taken the Bill so far, and that she is using her position to push this through.  It is much needed.</p></speech>

I have already taken on board a lot of the issues that have been in the public arena in recent months and years in terms of what people would like to see in the legislation.  As I said, I will also be tabling some amendments at a later Stage.</p> <p>I am struck by the common themes that have been addressed in the course of the presentations today.  Senator Conway-Walsh, along with other Senators, spoke about how there are no boundaries on this issue.  It is all across the country and across gender.  We have heard the LGBTI issues about it.  We have heard about age from Senator Kelleher.  We have heard about the complexities in the court situation.  Senator Colm Burke described the complexity of cases.  Senator Bacik spoke about the period of time that cases can take to go through the courts.  She stressed the need for more joined-up thinking, whether it is custody and access, or domestic violence issues.  There are very big issues here in terms of ongoing reform of the courts to ensure that there is joined-up thinking and joined-up processes within our courts systems to enable people have a better experience overall.</p> <p>There is really good work being done on court reforms, and we are seeing those coming through.  It is clear there are huge demands on our courts.  We are trying to give them extra resources so that, for example, technology can be used more effectively, so there is more efficiency, and that people do not have the delay in waiting times.  The physical conditions in Dolphin House were also discussed by Senator Bacik.  Those conditions need to be changed as quickly as possible.  </p> <p>Most Senators also spoke about how the scale of the issue and how it is almost hard to believe that scale.  According to the statistics, 4,103 orders were applied for in 2015.  There were 7,564 orders granted.  Almost 2,000 complaints of breaches of orders were initiated in 2015.  According to some research 300,000 people are experiencing severe or very severe domestic violence in their lifetimes.  That figure was quoted by Watson and Parsons in a 2008 study done by the ESRI for the National Crime Council.  Many people will find that extraordinary.  It is clear this is a very big issue which we are speaking about it more openly now than in the past.  This legislation, along with the new victims' rights legislation, is intended to support victims.  </p> <p>A number of particular issues were raised by Senators.  I will try and run through some of those.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out some of these issues.  I will look at all the submissions I have, including those I received very recently.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke asked about forced marriage.  If a person is taken out of Ireland for the purposes of a forced marriage, that will be an offence, whatever the nationality of the victim.  If an Irish citizen commits a forced marriage offence anywhere in the world, whether or not the victim is an Irish citizen, the perpetrator can be prosecuted here.  We can address that a little further.  Senator Norris asked about its prevalence.  Obviously forced marriage is very hidden.  It is hard for the Garda or others to know precisely what numbers might be taking place in Ireland.  Every year over the past few years a very small number of cases have come to attention.  However, that may be the tip of the iceberg.  As our culture and society become more diverse, it is clear this is something that we need to be aware of.  It is important to have legislation in place.  </p> <p>The issue of coercive control is not included the Bill, and I do want to address that.  It is accepted that behaviours in the domestic setting that involve emotional abuse, humiliation and fear can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse, as they are an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship.  This issue was considered in the context of the Bill.  There was consultation on this issue, as with many sections of the Bill, with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.  To be effective and enforceable, an offence needs to have a clear definition.  It was decided not to include an offence of coercive control as, given the complexity of relationships and the range of behaviours that could be considered coercive or controlling, it would be very problematic to define that in statute.  Further, given that the harm caused is non-physical, obtaining evidence of such behaviour and the harm caused, sufficient to satisfy the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, is likely to be extremely difficult.  That is the advice I have.</p> <p>Difficulties in securing convictions could send a very negative message to victims.  We need to be very aware of that.  It must be remembered that courts can already take into account such behaviours when sentencing in domestic violence cases.  The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act of 1997 already provides for offences relating to harassment and threatening behaviour.  It is not that this issue has not been considered.  It is worth putting the views regarding that on the record.</p> <p>The question of defining domestic violence is something I have of course considered.  I have taken legal advice on it, and I have linked with the Office of the Attorney General, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the DPP.  I have looked at this very seriously.  Domestic violence covers a very wide range of behaviours.  We have heard that from Senators here today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It covers physical behaviour such as assaults, rape and sexual assault as well as psychological abuse, intimidation, harassment, mental cruelty and economic abuse.  A number of existing offences capture the range of behaviours associated with domestic violence.  Obviously, physical violence is captured by the legislation I mentioned and sexual violence is covered under other legislation.  I do not propose to create a specific offence of domestic violence in the Bill because of the complexity of defining in statute an offence of domestic violence.  I have carried out a great deal of consultation on this.  There is also the possibility of such an offence giving rise to unintended consequences, especially for the victim.  It is not that I have not considered this option and taken advice on it but I am strongly advised that from a legal point of view it would not be helpful to the victim and would lead to other complexities.  That should be put on the record.</p><p>The question of resources has been raised a number of times.  Resources are increasing and clearly must increase.  The national budget for domestic and sexual violence services increased to &euro;20.6 million in 2016 and is being increased further in 2017, arising from the provision of increased overall funding to agencies.  We must continue to examine the resources in this area.  I am aware that many of the front-line organisations found it very hard to continue to support victims over the past seven years when the economy was failing.  Like the Senators, I thank them for the work they have done in providing front-line services and for the way they continued to reach out to victims during that period.</p><p>I should point out that in exceptional circumstances a judge can be accessed out of hours via An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are some recommendations that this service should be more comprehensive.  That is something we can examine.  It is a resource issue.</p><p>I thank the Senators for their support for the Bill.  I hope I have clarified why certain things are not in the Bill at this point.  I look forward to Committee Stage and further examination of these issues.</p></speech>

The construction of the North-South interconnector has been a serious issue for the people of counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath since it was first mooted back in 2007-08.  As a result of the recent decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to award planning permission for the project, that is, the construction of 299 pylons between 25 m and 51 m in height, Fianna F&aacute;il has felt compelled to bring the motion before the House and I hope all parties will support it.</p><p>As the Minister will appreciate, the North-South interconnector project has caused great stress and annoyance to the people who live along the route in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath, as well as in counties Tyrone and Armagh.  I pass on my compliments to the communities that have banded together in total opposition to the project for the strong campaign they have waged since the first opposition was expressed to EirGrid's proposal to install the pylons.  The campaign has been managed by two groups, namely, the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign, which have conducted themselves in a very professional and sensible manner.  The resolve of the people against the project is as strong today as it was when the project was first mooted, if not stronger. </p><p>As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the upgrading of the national grid, thereby ensuring security of electricity supply in order to boost capacity for future economic growth.  That said, it is concerned about the installation of pylons by EirGrid throughout the countryside near residential areas and in areas of scenic beauty.  In its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid only made a submission on an underground line.  It did not consider the merits of the possibility of undergrounding the power line.  This is blatant discrimination against the people who will be affected by the North-South interconnector.  Why has the Government not listened to and investigated their concerns?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When similar concerns were raised over Grid West and Grid East, analysis of undergrounding options was undertaken.  The people of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath are asking why their concerns are not being treated in an equal fashion.  They deserve nothing less.  In 2007-2008, when this project was first mooted, we were told that the cost of undergrounding the project would be somewhere between 20 to 30 times the cost of overgrounding and that it was not possible from either an engineering or technical perspective to underground these cables.  Things have changed dramatically in the intervening period.  By April 2015, EirGrid publicly admitted for the first time that it was possible to put these cables underground and at a much reduced cost than was first mooted.  Furthermore, recent international experience has disproved claims that underground lines are not feasible for the development of projects such as this.  This can be seen in the ALEGrO project, a project that runs between Germany and Belgium, which is approximately 90 km in length and which can carry 1,000 MW.  The ALEGrO project will achieve these aims without infringing on the landscape along its routes.  Not a single mountain vista or rolling hill will be tainted as a result of steel pylons being erected.  No local resident will face land devaluations, health issues or reduced quality of life because of its construction.  We are asking for the Government to conduct an independent analysis of the possibility of undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  This analysis must also assess and detail the impact that constructing the North-South interconnector will have on local communities.  What would the impact be on the devaluation of property, local heritage sites and tourism?  What would the impact be on farming land and agricultural production?  What would the ramifications be for the health of local residents?  These are the type of questions we are hearing from families in the counties through which the North-South interconnector is to pass through.  They have not been answered by the Government to date.  Instead, it prefers to allow EirGrid to proceed over the will of local people, ignoring the concerns they so rightly raise.  It is incumbent upon elected representatives of both Houses to give a voice to the people whom we serve and to give careful consideration of how decisions taken by us impact on their daily lives.  It is very disappointing that the concerns of the people have so far been ignored by the Government.  All we are looking for here is an independent expert review of the project and for the advances in technology that have occurred since it was first mooted to be taken into account.  I ask Fine Gael Members present to fully support this motion.  They have nothing to fear from it.  Someone said once that it is never too late to do the right thing.  I appeal to the Fine Gael Members to put their shoulders to the wheel, speak up for the people they represent and fully support this motion this afternoon.  With the support of the Members of the House, I hope this motion will address the general fears expressed by the people of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.  I commend the motion to the House. </p></speech>

Since he entered the Department, the Minister is aware, as are many Members of the House, that this project has been going on for well over a decade.  It is a decade in which communities in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan suffered greatly as a result of the concern about what will happen to them.  It is ten years during which EirGrid has told untruths, has misrepresented the situation that exists and has misrepresented the consequences of its insistence on putting more than 290 pylons over one of the most beautiful parts of the island.

In December 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted approval of the proposed construction of the North-South 400 kV interconnector in counties Cavan, Meath and Monaghan.  The highest voltage in use in the United Kingdom is 400 kV volts.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la awarded planning permission to construct 299 pylons that are, as Senator Gallagher has pointed out, between 25 m and 51 m in height.  EirGrid and Northern Ireland Electricity jointly planned this major cross-Border electricity scheme linking the existing 400 kV substation in Woodland, County Meath, with a planned substation in Turleenan, County Tyrone.</p> <p>I appeal to all Members of the House, both in opposition and in government, to support this motion.  I am disappointed the Government has tabled an amendment to this motion, a watered-down amendment which is not acceptable to the people concerned with this proposed project.  Over the past ten or 12 years, members of the County Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and the North East Pylon Pressure campaign in County Meath have been extremely active in conveying the views and concerns of local communities regarding these proposals.  Those concerns have also been highlighted by their public representatives in counties Meath, Monaghan and Cavan.  I attended my first meeting more than ten years ago in Kingscourt, County Cavan.  I am glad to see in the Gallery this afternoon Councillor Clifford Kelly, a long-serving member of Cavan County Council representing that area.  At a recent Cavan County Council meeting, Councillor Kelly, on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il outlined very eloquently the concerns of these communities.  In both Cavan and Monaghan county councils, all parties were represented and all were of the same view.  This project, as it currently stands and as currently approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, cannot go ahead.  That is the view of all political parties and none.  I put that on the record of the House.  The concerns of these communities have to be taken into consideration.  EirGrid has shown nothing but disregard for the worries of these communities.  That is also not acceptable.  Senator Gallagher has pointed out the differential in what we were told the cost of undergrounding would be.  Ten years ago it was over 20 times and five years ago it was six or seven times.  Most recently at an Oireachtas joint committee meeting, it was said the technology was there to underground it, something that was continually denied for ten or more years.  It was finally agreed over 12 months ago that the technology existed for this to be undergrounded but that it would be three times the cost.  The most recent independent figures show it would be slightly over 1.2% higher.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some studies indicate that it could be even cheaper than that.  We are not against the interconnector project and neither are the communities we represent but they are against it being overground.  There is no logical reason an independent review cannot be carried out to investigate once and for all whether this is feasible.  We are confident that an independent review would show this option is feasible and that it would be on par with or only slightly dearer than the overground option.</p></speech>

I note the amendment that will be moved to this motion and welcome this opportunity to address Members of the House and to discuss what is a very important energy infrastructure project, namely, the North-South interconnector.  This proposed interconnector is a new 138 km long, high-capacity electricity interconnector along overhead lines between the transmission networks of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I had the same opportunity to debate this issue in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 14 February 2017 when an identical motion was proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.The Government proposed a counter-motion and the same counter-motion will be proposed here today.  It is important to again advance this counter-motion in order that we affirm the need for the North-South interconnector, recognise the benefits it will bring through lower prices as a result of more efficient operation of the single electricity market and acknowledge the analysis that underpins the overground proposal.</p><p>On 21 December 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the interconnector in Ireland with a number of conditions attached.  The decision concluded a lengthy planning process, which included an oral hearing completed over an 11-week period from March to May last year.  The planning process in Northern Ireland is ongoing, with a planning inquiry having concluded on 27 February of this year.  The proposed interconnector is a vital piece of infrastructure for ensuring a safe and sustainable source of energy for both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is expected that its development will deliver significant benefits to electricity consumers across the island of Ireland through lower prices as a result of more efficient operation of the single electricity market.  Developing the interconnector has the impact of reinforcing the electricity grid infrastructure in the north east of the State and, therefore, provides certainty for electricity generation and wider investment.  </p><p>Many Members of this House and the Lower House have genuine concerns and I have no difficulty with that but some people have mischievously played politics with this issue.  I want to put it on the record that if this project is not built, it will create uncertainty that may impact on the willingness of future investors on the whole island of Ireland to exploit the full potential of the single electricity market.  I repeat, as it is important this is noted by all Members of both Houses, that if the project does not go ahead, it will create uncertainty that may have an impact on the willingness of future investors to invest in electricity projects on this island.  I hope all Members of both sides of the House take note of what I have just said.</p><p>Any further delays to the development of the project add uncertainty and will increase security of supply risk to Northern Ireland, in the first instance, but also to both Ireland and Northern Ireland as the benefits of mutual reinforcement of the single electricity market would be delayed.  In the context of Northern Ireland's security of electricity supply challenges post-2020, it is particularly important in terms of maintaining our excellent North-South relations in the area of energy that Ireland provides certainty in respect of developing the North-South interconnector.  I also underline the crucial importance of continuing Ireland&rsquo;s close relationship in the energy sector with both Northern Ireland and the UK in the context of our future energy relationship and Brexit.  In 2015 Ireland had an energy import dependency of 88% and the UK is the conduit for much of this energy.  For instance, 97% of the natural gas used in Ireland in 2015 was imported via the UK.  Maintaining secure trade in energy with the UK and the continued effective functioning of the single electricity market are key Brexit priorities for Ireland.  I note the UK Government&rsquo;s continued support for the single electricity market, as set out in the UK White Paper on exiting the European Union and the letter of 14 October 2016 of Prime Minister May to the First and deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland.  </p><p>Brexit is the most significant economic and social challenge of the past 50 years.  It will impact our economy and society due to the close links between Ireland and the UK, of which energy is one of the critical sectors.  Given the importance placed on the single electricity market and the key role of the North-South interconnector in this market, the uncertainty created by passing the proposed motion would be of significant concern.  Furthermore, the bilateral relationship we have with the UK in energy cannot be viewed in isolation.  We must consider the implications of any potential impacts a change in our energy relationship, perceived or otherwise, could have on other sectors.  It is therefore critical, in the context of Brexit, that we maintain a close and positive relationship with the UK across all sectors.  </p><p>In a wider European context, the North-South interconnector was designated a project of common interest by the European Commission in October 2013 and again in November 2015.  Projects of common interest are energy projects deemed by the European Commission to be of strategic, transboundary importance.  Any development of national infrastructure must strike a balance between the overall benefits of the project and the local impact on people, landscape, tourism, farming and homes.  I am well aware of concerns that have been raised among the communities across counties Cavan, Meath and Monaghan about the proposals for the North-South interconnector.  In fact, I am one of the few Ministers who has met the groups face to face.  I believe I am the first Minister since the former Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who had the courtesy to meet them and hear their concerns.</p><p>I am also aware there is a long-held and passionately-argued belief within some local communities along the route of the interconnector that the transmission lines should be laid underground, rather than built overhead.  However, all evidence available to me and the advice of my chief technical adviser, even on foot of the recent meeting I had with the groups, indicates that this would cost substantially more and deliver less.  In essence, the interconnector is proposed as a high-voltage alternating current overhead line because various studies, many of them independent, deem it to be both the best overall technical solution and the most cost-effective option for this project.</p><p>This proposal is fully in keeping with EirGrid&rsquo;s statutory obligations to develop a fit-for-purpose electricity transmission system as cost-effectively as possible.  The studies include the international expert commission report in 2012, which found the construction of an underground option to be <i>circa</i>three times the cost of the overhead option and the July 2014 statement of the independent expert panel, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, which found that in all material respects, the methodologies employed on the North-South interconnector were compatible with the methodologies employed on other grid development projects such as the Grid Link and Grid West projects.  From a technical perspective, it should be pointed out that direct current lines would need to be used if the lines were laid underground over this distance and these do not efficiently integrate the electricity systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland into a single meshed grid system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a key technical disadvantage that an underground option would have when compared with the proposed overhead project.  All studies and information pertaining to undergrounding were available to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as part of the recent planning process.  In the oral hearing the inspector heard testimony both in favour of and against the overground and underground solutions.  The inspector examined those issues thoroughly and concluded that a high voltage alternating current overhead line is the best technical and economic solution for the North-South interconnector to achieve national energy objectives.  I would stress, therefore, that the statutorily independent planning process has determined that the proposed North-South interconnector should be developed, and I fully accept the outcome of that planning process.  Of course, I also understand the concerns of the communities of Cavan, Meath and Monaghan about the project, and I have met with and listened to representatives of these communities in the last fortnight and committed to further engagement.  I know that my officials will be directly engaging with both of those committees.  However, the reason the Government does not support the motion as proposed is due to the uncertainty it would create regarding our energy relationship with Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole.  </p><p>An issue that has been raised, including by the community representative groups, was that there needs to be further independent analysis of international developments around the relative cost differences, technologies and engineering solutions of overhead and underground technologies.  An update of the work of the 2012 independent study can provide this clarity, and my Department is working to finalise the terms of reference and procure expert advice on these issues.  My intention is that this should be a short, focused piece of work and be placed in the public domain as quickly as possible.  This is what the proposed amendment I have proposed seeks to do and it does it without introducing undue uncertainty to our energy relationship on an all-island basis and with the UK.  I would urge Senators to support the proposed amendment, which is both fair and balanced. </p></speech>

The Minister has mentioned the amendment in his statement.  I want to compliment the Minister on his handling of the brief and also his handling of this issue.  This issue has been around since 2007.  There have been consultations regarding land and route selection since 2007.  This Minister has gone out of his way to meet all parties, and that has to be acknowledged.</p><p>The issue we are trying to debate is the appropriate way forward for the country regarding the single market we have at the moment.  We all realise that the interconnector has to happen.  We have a situation where post-Brexit energy security will be one of the key issues for driving our economy.  At the moment we have only one interconnector between here and Northern Ireland.  This proposal concerns a second one.  This is a crucial piece of infrastructure, not alone for Northern Ireland but for the Republic going forward.  It is about energy security.  Security is a key part of what we are trying to propose here.  Security regarding energy and the ability to ensure that we have access to this energy is very appropriate.  </p><p>We know what we are.  We are an island nation just off the UK.  Our nearest neighbour is the UK, and we need to have connectivity to that market.  This interconnector gives us the ability to do that.  It will affect people in Northern Ireland.  It will affect people in Cork.  It will affect people everywhere, and that is why this proposal, which has been around since 2007, is so important.  That is why we have proposed this amendment because it is about trying to ensure that we have certainty in the market.  A proposal has been proposed here today which is about certainty in the energy market.  Going forward we can hopefully build our economy off the back of it.  There are issues, which have been raised by other Members of the House, regarding pricing and the actual cost of the project.  At the end of the day, the project was started in 2007 and ten years later it has not been physically started and is still going through the planning process.  That shows the level of consultation that is happening on these issues.  </p><p>The Minister made it very clear in his speech why we need to progress and move forward with this project.  I have to support the Minister, because a key aspect behind this is that if we were to stall now again and start into another consultation period, where would we go?  We also have an issue about Northern Ireland.  We must show that we are on board so that we can develop in both the North and the South.  Brexit is going to be the key issue in terms of energy security.  We have a single market in Ireland, which has worked as we have seen, but now we need to build on that, and this interconnector is a key part of building that confidence in the market.  Confidence is very important.  We need to have the confidence of the investors and the marketplace so that we can provide this key piece of infrastructure.  If we lose this confidence what effect will that have on other infrastructure projects, whether it is broadband or other issues?  We will lose the confidence of the investors that we need to ensure that we can have these core infrastructure projects put in place so that the island itself can develop.  </p><p>The Minister has shown his ability to engage with the communities, and that is something that has to be acknowledged.  I am sure that Members from Fianna F&aacute;il will acknowledge afterwards that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, went out and met these people.  That is a real key issue here.  He has physically met these people on the ground, and that is a very important issue.  We are engaging, we are working and we are going forward with the Minister.  We can ensure that we can have this interconnector in place.  It is important for all of Ireland that it actually happens, and I am sure the Minister will deliver it.  More importantly, he will deliver it by consultation, by talking, by working with his chief technical officer, and by talking to the communities.  </p><p>I would hope that we can have backing for the Government amendment because it is the appropriate step forward.  If we can all work together we can hopefully achieve the security that is required so that the entire economy can grow.  The Minister has proven by his meetings with the groups involved that he has an open ear and that he is open minded about these issues.</p></speech>

There is plenty of food for thought in his response.  It is a detailed response, and I thank him for that.  There are a number of issues raised that we must think about and be cognisant of.</p> <p>I do not think that there is any disagreement about the North-South interconnector.  We all need that.  There is no point in rehearsing all the things that we agree on.  We must discuss what we do not agree on and decide what the difficulties are.  I have spoken to a number of Independent councillors.  Might I say that Cavan is the only council in the country that has no Independent councillors, which is strange in itself.  Perhaps they are efficient and are doing a good job up there.  This issue has divided both political groupings, namely, the Government and the Opposition, it has divided communities and it has divided people.  It is about the environment, sustainability and the environment in which people live.  It also highlights shortcomings.  I will not go into it, it is a matter for another day, but we clearly need a critical infrastructure agency that stands on its own.  We are going to have many challenges right across this country in the foreseeable future in rolling out essential critical infrastructure for many reasons that will aid and support our economy, job creation, balanced regional development and a whole range of other issues.  Critical infrastructure is essential, and this is another part of critical infrastructure.  I do not see any problem with supporting the North-South interconnector.</p> <p>When one looks at the motion and the proposals before us, they are calling on the Government to commission an independent report incorporating international industry and expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector, taking into account the most recent developments in technology and experience gained from existing projects, and to evaluate the impact of both overground and underground options.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The motion also calls on the Government to "evaluate the potential impacts of both undergrounding and overgrounding".  I believe it is right that it should be underground.  While certain costs would be associated with that, what cost can be put on the health and safety of people living in communities?  This whole case has shown up the lack of real public consultation, the failure to provide information to people and the lack of engagement with communities and elected representatives.  I am disappointed that a number of the Senators who have vocally opposed this scheme are not here today.</p><p>This critical issue affects people in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath, in particular, but it also affects people in other areas.  This is ultimately a question of independent validation.  I know that this scheme has gone through the planning process and people are disappointed with the outcome.  I have appealed many decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and have been disappointed with the outcome.  How can we clearly set out the facts?  What are the exact costings for putting this underground?  Is it possible to put this underground?  Are there technical reasons this cannot happen?  If so, do those reasons relate to costs or to delays?  If it is a question of costs, those costs must be independently validated so that we can spell out to people the absolute costs involved.</p><p>This is a difficult decision for an Independent Minister.  I do not know what is the Government Chief Whip's current stance, but she has spoken publicly on this issue in the past.  One of the difficulties is that the representatives of all the affected constituencies are going to square up.  This ultimately must be about trying to reach consensus.  While value for money is important, we do not need to put a value on everything.  If I lived in County Monaghan, County Cavan or County Meath, I would expect my local Deputies, Senators and county councillors to fight this case on behalf of the local people while remaining cognisant of the need for critical infrastructure.  The Minister might share with us the details of the costs and elaborate on whether it is technically possible to go underground.  I thank him for his comprehensive response.  I will think about it before I decide how to vote.  I thank him for clearly setting out in an unambiguous and upfront manner the difficulties he sees in this regard.  Can we have some greater detail on cost?</p></speech>

I am pleased to see him in good health.  Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Private Members' motion that has been proposed this afternoon.  We have stood with the communities affected by this scheme since the beginning.  In 2014, we passed a strong motion at our Ard-Fheis calling on EirGrid to put the cables underground.  Residents along the proposed route will be faced with pylons of 45 m in height, some of which will be 50 m from their homes.  While we absolutely support the development of the interconnector, we also support the right of residents to oppose these massive pylons, 229 of which will pass through counties Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone and Armagh carrying 400 kV of power.  EirGrid has failed to deal in a meaningful manner with the concerns of affected residents.  Its initial claim that putting the lines underground would cost 25 times more than placing them overground is false.  In fact, undergrounding was just 1.5 times as expensive at the time and this differential has probably reduced since the report was published.</p> <p>I was a member of Mayo County Council when a representative of EirGrid appeared before it some years ago.  I asked him on several occasions about the feasibility of putting lines underground.  I wanted to know whether it was technically possible.  He tried to fob me off with references to physics, but I told him to let me have a look at the physics so I could decipher it for myself.  I said that what we were discussing was either feasible or it was not, taking the cost off the board.  I am reluctant to say he told lies time and again during that presentation, but it has since been proven that he told lies.  I do not like to call anybody a liar, but that is exactly what transpired at the presentation.  If EirGrid had not taken such an approach, my colleagues and I would not be talking on this issue in the Seanad this afternoon.  If EirGrid had come clean and told the truth from the outset, we could have worked with that.  I presented international models of best practice at the time.  Even at that time, there was a move towards the undergrounding of lines that were originally developed overground.  Has EirGrid been reprimanded for telling lies to communities and public representatives in all of this?</p></speech>

I am naming EirGrid because I think it is responsible for the untruths it put out there.  Successive Governments are responsible for not calling into question those untruths.  They should have faced down EirGrid when it was telling people these untruths.  The fact is that these lines can be put underground.  The concerns that have been expressed about the cost of doing so are dubious, to say the least.  Sinn F&eacute;in advocates that an all-island approach should be taken to our most pressing problems at all times.  I have spoken previously in this House about the need for an all-island approach to be taken to health, economic recovery and transport.  A sustainable power supply for the entire island in the future is no different.  We support the interconnector project as a means of Ireland achieving its 40% renewable energy target.</p> <p>We have heard arguments from those who favour the overground pylons approach.  They have suggested that undergrounding is neither affordable nor achievable.  The contrary was found to be the case when the Oireachtas commissioned an expert report, which stated quite clearly that undergrounding the North-South interconnector was a realistic solution due to "a significant technical development and a commercial breakthrough" in the most recently developed voltage-source converter HVDC technology.  There are also benefits to having the cables run underground.  Underground cables are disturbed less frequently than overhead lines.  Overhead cables are affected by severe weather.  Only outside influences can disturb and damage underground cables.  Underground cables are low-maintenance, compared with overhead lines.  While underground cables cost more than overhead lines at installation, they are low-maintenance, have lower transmission losses, have a longer lifespan and have no environmental or other negative impacts associated with them.  All of this suggests that the additional initial outlay will be offset over time by many advantages.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed, as a novel solution, that the underground routing of these cables could be done in conjunction with the development of the A5 dual carriageway.  The cables could be ducted underground at the time of the construction of the new road.</p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision to approve the construction of the EirGrid-led North-South interconnector pylons means the various undergrounding options will not be fully considered.  There must be a full view of the measures taken so far and a commitment to consult and listen to the communities that will be affected by this scheme.  While I understand what the Minister is saying in his amendment, I cannot agree with it.  The amendment calls on the Government "to take account of the concerns of the communities of Cavan, Meath and Monaghan".  There has been no proper consultation.  The quality of the consultation on these gridlines across the country has been absolutely atrocious.</p></speech>

People should not have been fobbed off by being told they would not understand the physics.  Those who claimed to know better tried to tell the public that this could not be done underground.  It can and will be done underground.  We must respect the will of the people in this regard.  We want progress and development.  If the blame for the lack of progress and development, and for everything else the Minister has cited this afternoon, is to be laid at any door, it should not be laid at the door of the communities that are affected and the public representatives of those communities - it should be laid firmly at the door of the Government and of EirGrid.</p></speech>

It is good to see him back in good health.  I support this motion.  The communities directly affected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision to give planning permission to EirGrid for the construction of overhead powerlines, which will result in the building of 299 pylons in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, have expressed their anger and frustration about this decision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is general support for the upgrading of the national grid to ensure security of energy supply and that the North-South interconnector would play an essential role in preventing energy blackouts on the island of Ireland as well as bringing in an increased amount of renewable energy into the system while ensuring lower energy costs in the future.</p><p>There is concern around the installation of overhead pylons throughout the State by EirGrid near residential areas and areas of scenic beauty.  Locals have expressed their opposition to the scarring of their beautiful historic landscapes with this infrastructure.  The undergrounding of the North-South interconnector is the expressed wish of the people who are directly affected.  Residents in Meath would be exposed to 45 m high pylons some of which will be only 50 m from people's homes and exposed to potential health risks.  Studies have proved the increase in carcinogens in proximity to the electromagnetic fields from power lines.  The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, SCENIHR, found that the previous conclusion that electromagnetic fields are a possible carcinogenic chiefly based on childhood leukaemia results is still valid.</p><p>An Oireachtas commission expert report states quite clearly that undergrounding the North-South interconnector is now a realistic solution due to the significant technical developments and the commercial breakthrough of the most recently developed voltage source connector technology.  EirGrid originally stated that the cost of undergrounding the cable would be 25 times that of erecting overground pylons.  This does not hold true.  In its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la EirGrid only made a submission for an overground line.  Why did EirGrid not consider the merits or possibility of an underground power line in its application? This is blatant discrimination against the people affected by the North-South interconnector.</p><p>EirGrid's inconsistency and overall unwillingness to engage with this is central to why the people of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan feel they are not being treated equally or fairly.  People in these counties are asking themselves why no underground cabling proposals are outlined for the proposed North-South interconnector.  In April 2015 EirGrid stated that an underground system would cost in excess of &euro;500 million more than the overhead option, approximately three times more than the overground option.  Again, this appears to be significantly reduced costs compared with what was previously relied upon to make a decision to go overground.  An independent group of experts is now needed to assess the specific needs of the North-South interconnector and to calculate a precise cost estimate.  EirGrid cannot be seen as independent when it comes to assessing the costs of undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  Since the beginning of the process EirGrid has been intent on placing the North-South interconnector above ground and could be perceived as biased towards this option.</p><p>Recent international experience has disproved claims that underground technology is not suitable for developments like the North-South interconnector.  A similar project in Belgium will ensure no area of natural beauty will be tainted as a result of the erection of steel pylons.  No local resident there will face land devaluation, health issues or a reduced quality of life because of its construction.  Why can the communities in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan not be treated in the same way?  The international expert commission employed by a previous government found that putting the cables underground was a viable option.  Why is there now an insistence that the project must proceed overhead?</p><p>There would be benefits in undergrounding that would result in long-term savings and maintenance.  Underground networks do not require the same level of maintenance as overhead networks.  Underground cables have lower transmission losses and a much longer lifespan than overhead lines.  Disturbance to underground cables is less frequent than to overhead cables that are affected by severe weather.  This is something we must take into consideration.</p><p>The Government should undertake a study to assess the possibility of undergrounding the North-South interconnector.  This study should also analyse the possible impacts on the health of local residents and the possible loss of tourist revenue due to the tainting of the landscape by pylons.  The cost of delays to this project also needs to be factored in to any costings because the level of local opposition to the pylons will undoubtedly lead to legal challenges.  There is general agreement that farmers will not allow these pylons to be erected on their land because of health concerns for their families and their livestock.  There is also the fear that the value of their properties will be reduced.  The concerns of the residents in these areas need to be taken into consideration and I echo the concerns of the public in their opposition to the construction of these pylons.  It is essential that this project is stopped and the people who are directly affected are listened to.</p></speech>

I support this motion and I commend my colleagues Senators Gallagher and Wilson on calling for an independent expert review.  I also welcome to the House Councillor Clifford Kelly who has been a long-term campaigner on this issue, as well as Deputy Cassells.  I have spoken today to a councillor of more 33 years' experience from the region.  He informed me that he has never seen such resolve by the public over one issue.  It is his opinion, and I would have to concur with him, that any potential savings by placing these cables overground will be usurped through a lengthy legal battle in the courts and possibly in the EU courts.  When we talk about costs it is also worth considering that &euro;8 million was wasted on a flawed planning application three years ago, which was withdrawn at hearing stage.  The current planning application by EirGrid to place cables overground may also be flawed as only 30% of the route was actually surveyed and 17% of the route was inaccessible.  Obviously there are potential and widespread inaccuracies in this which could have subsequent cost implications.</p> <p>In 2014, the then Minister for Health, our colleague, Senator James Reilly, decided to inquire about the potential health effects on people who are living in close proximity to high voltage overground power cables.  By doing so he made the point that people feel a deep unease about living next to major electromagnetic fields.  There have been claims and counter-claims about various illnesses that can be attributed to living close to electricity pylons.  As a GP, I can honestly say that if a patient who has attended my clinic for many years suddenly found themselves the unwilling neighbour of a 50 m high pylon and complained of symptoms they never had before, then I would wonder if there was a direct link.  Scientific efforts to analyse electromagnetic fields around pylons and their possible relationship to cancer and other diseases began as far back as the 1970s, instigated in the US by reports of increased numbers of children with leukaemia who lived in the vicinity of power lines.  Professor Denis Henshaw, the British physicist and professor of human radiation effects at Bristol University, has listed the increased possible health risks of living close to power lines such as childhood leukaemia, adult leukaemia, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumours, depression and many other illnesses.  The EirGrid chief executive at the time, John O'Connor, did little to calm fears when he admitted, before an Oireachtas committee in 2013, that he would not like to live close to a pylon.  EirGrid dismisses these concerns and insists there is no evidence to support them.  It may not have been proved but that does not mean it does not exist.  Professor Anthony Staines, chair of health systems in the School of Nursing and Human Sciences at Dublin City University has said that there is simply not enough certainty.  I for one would not like to take the risk.</p></speech>

One Department of Government is flagging Ireland's Ancient East.  It is pushing the area as the east's answer to the Wild Atlantic Way with our beautiful scenery and our historical locations.  At the same time we have a Department that wants to spoil all that scenery and those locations by putting up pylons when the cables could be put underground.  One side of the Government is working one way and the other side is working the other way.  With regard to village renewal schemes and the smaller scale cabling from one street light to another, there is a major push on village renewal schemes and enhancement schemes where money is provided to enhance the beauty of villages and small towns by putting cabling underground, which had been overground since cables and streetlights were introduced.  This is being done for aesthetic reasons but we still want to put this monstrosity of a project overground through three major counties.</p> <p>I will now turn to the Government's stance on this and I would like some clarification on where the Government is with regard to the situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The morning after the Fianna F&aacute;il motion was tabled in the D&aacute;il the Government Chief Whip stated on LMFM that the Government would enact it.

Where is this project going if the Cabinet cannot agree?  Why has one member of the Cabinet said the Government will implement the Fianna F&aacute;il motion because it passed with great numbers in the D&aacute;il while the Minister has come in here today asking to move the goalposts?  We need the matter clarified.  We also need a better answer than the one we got from the Minister in his statement on why the decision that was made has been made.</p></speech>

He mentioned in his contribution that he met the action groups.  I know he was in great physical pain at the time.  On behalf of the elected Members present and the people from the communities that met him, I thank him most sincerely for meeting the action groups.</p><p>I welcome Deputy Shane Cassells to the House and Councillor Clifford Kelly from County Cavan.  Along with other public representatives, they have been a strong voice against this project as presented to us.  Indeed, the councillors of County Monaghan, who are my former colleagues, and all of the councillors of Cavan and Meath, have also spoken with one voice on this issue.</p><p>I take issue with a number of points made by the Minister.  He seemed to imply in his statement that we are against upgrading infrastructure and the project <i>per se</i>.  I wish to make it very clear that we favour this project but we have an issue with the project going overground as opposed to underground.  </p><p>The Minister made the point that some people have played politics with this issue.  I can assure him that all of the public representatives who have spoken here today and, indeed, elsewhere against this project did not play politics.  They have spoken for and represented the people in the communities in which they live. </p><p>I agree with what the Minister said about the delay.  It is important that when one apportions praise or blame, it should go in the proper direction and in this case it is EirGrid.  The delay occurred because EirGrid made a hames or a dog's dinner of the initial application at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;8 million.  The delay was due to EirGrid's incompetence when handling the application, which was first discovered and cited by Councillor Owen Bannigan who has since passed away.  He was a great champion, among others, of this particular project.  </p><p>The Minister also mentioned the cost of undergrounding.  It is important that we briefly touch on this matter.  He mentioned in his statement that an expert group maintained in 2012 that it would cost three times the amount to underground this project than go overground.  I accept that point.  Four years earlier the same experts told us that it would cost 20 to 30 times more.  In 2012 the cost dropped from 20 to 30 times to three times the amount.  Five years have elapsed and I contend that the cost has reduced even more.  Let us remember that advances have also been made in technology.  An independent study will provide clarity on the true cost of this project. </p><p>I was disappointed to learn what the Fine Gael Deputies from the affected counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath have done.  When they had an opportunity to put on record their opposition to this project they decided to keep their mouths closed and say nothing.  However, when they speak on the local and national airwaves they have tried to fool the people into thinking that they are against the project.  This evening the Fine Gael Members of this House have an opportunity to state where they stand on this project.
