I tabled this matter to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to facilitate the continuation of restricted recognition for graduates in Montessori education, as currently permitted under regulation 3 of the Teaching Council Acts.  This affects approximately 100 graduates per year between St. Nicholas Montessori College and Cork Institute of Technology.  As the regulation has been in place since 2005, up to 1,000 of these graduates have level 8 degrees.  Graduates with level 8 qualifications in Montessori education are currently afforded restricted recognition.  They may be appointed to teaching positions in special education settings in primary schools and special schools.  The numbers registering under this provision amount to 1% of annual registrants, or approximately 110 teachers.</p> <p>If the proposed removal of regulation 3 is allowed they will not be able to secure any form of recognition from the Teaching Council because in the absence of a Teaching Council registration number, a graduate with a four-year, level 8 degree cannot be appointed to a primary school or a special school.  These graduates are in the Minister of State's county of Donegal as well as my county of Galway.  The Department of Education and Skills will not pay any person in a teaching capacity who does not have a Teaching Council registration number.  I understand the Teaching Council is advising the Minister to sign an order that will withdraw registration for these Montessori teaching graduates.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the proposed removal of regulation 3 is allowed, the only current role within the education setting available to level 8 graduates would then be as special needs assistants.  There is a big difference between being a teacher and being a special needs assistant in a special school.  As the Minister of State knows that is in a particular care setting.  The opportunity for Montessori graduates to practise the pedagogical foundations acquired under the four years of higher education could not then be exercised.  It is an appalling vista for people who have invested in a four-year degree.  Furthermore, it is a downgrading of early years education and the Minister should not do this.<br/><br/>Graduates and providers of level 8 Montessori programmes are seeking the retention of the existing registration process.  In other words they want it left alone.  The Montessori pedagogy is recognised as having a unique role in assisting children with special needs.  The 141 special schools would bear the brunt of this decision if it proceeds, which is fairly serious.  The children would lose access to teaching resources, human resources with a set of skills designed to assist their personal and educational development.<br/><br/>I recently met a qualified second level teacher who has Teaching Council registration.  However, it was her Montessori qualification that gave her an opportunity to get a particular role working with three children with extreme needs.<br/><br/>Research by Banks <i>et al.</i>in 2014 suggests that up to 25% of children in the educational system have special educational needs.  While the spectrum of the resources to address their needs will vary, statistics available from the NCSE and the Department of Education and Skills confirm that over recent years the allocation of resources has increased by an average of 6.5% annually.  Importantly there has been no evidence that the low-entry requirement, which is often cited as a basis for differentiation for Montessori graduates, has impacted on the quality of the provision for pupils with special educational needs - if anything it has improved them.<br/><br/>The Minister has made a very strong commitment to the early years sector, which has been backed up by very positive action.  Montessori graduates want to play their part in helping the Minister to realise her vision.  However, if the Teaching Council proposal is allowed to proceed in its current format, it will send a message to those teachers and educators in early years settings that they are not part of the education profession.  Rather than building on her initiative it will detract and demotivate the very persons we rely on for the continuum of education from birth to six years and into the special needs sector as well.<br/><br/>Knowing the Minister's commitment to early years education, the Minister should not be the Minister to sign off on this regulation.  The required amendments allow for the implementation of Part 5 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2012 to proceed without abolishing the current provision under regulation 3.  I accept the role of the Teaching Council <i>inter alia</i>is to provide advice and guidance to the Minister, but in this instance the Minister has the authority to reject this.  I am asking the Minister of State to convey this concern to the Minister for Education and Skills so that the qualifications and standing of our Montessori teachers, who have restricted access and restricted recognition to teach in our primary schools in special education and the early years setting, are not affected.</p></speech>

As the Senator may be aware, the Teaching Council is the independent statutory regulator for the teaching profession.  The council sets standards for all elements of the continuum of teacher education including initial teacher education programmes, induction and continuous professional development.</p> <p>The Teaching Council's regulations for the registration of teachers were first published in 2009 and set out the standards that teachers must meet if they wish to be registered members of the profession in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Regulation 3, covering special education needs and Montessori, was put in place in accordance with the relevant circulars issued by the Department prior to the council's establishment in 2006, whereby such teachers are eligible for employment in restricted school settings, that is, in certain categories of special schools and in certain classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</p><p>The council has been engaged in a review of the regulations for some time, and has consulted with a number of stakeholders, including a provider of Montessori teacher education.  The review has been necessitated by the extension and reconceptualisation of all programmes of initial teacher education.  New regulations will also be necessary in light of the Bill to amend the Teaching Council Acts that is currently completing its passage through the Houses.</p><p>The developments are part of a significant programme of reform of teacher education in which the council has been engaged in recent years, informed in part by the Department's literacy and numeracy strategy of 2011.  It is important to remember that the primary focus of the reform programme is to enhance the quality of teaching and learning experience for all children and young people.  In any discussions we have about teaching and learning, including inclusive education, the learner must be the focus.</p><p>As the statutory professional standards body for teaching in Ireland, the Teaching Council is of the view that all teachers should be first and foremost qualified and registered as teachers in their given sector whether primary or post-primary, before they specialise in particular areas of teaching and learning.  Special education needs, SEN, is now mandatory in all programmes of initial teacher education under the council's criteria and guidelines, so the landscape has evolved significantly since regulation 3 was put in place.</p><p>That said, the council itself acknowledges that no one phase of teachers' learning will be sufficient to address all the needs of the pupils they will teach throughout their careers.  The very concepts of continuous professional development, CPD, and the draft national framework for teachers' learning, Cos&aacute;n, bear that out.  Specialist provision will continue to have its place in teachers' learning.  Once teachers are fully qualified and registered, it is hoped they will continue to have a keen interest in finding quality programmes that will enable and empower them to adapt their practice to the needs of children in their care.</p><p>Recent changes in the teacher education landscape have been designed to ensure that inclusive education, incorporating the education of learners with special education needs, is given the appropriate professional space and time.  In summary, the advice of the council that regulation 3 is no longer required has been accepted.  I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070700002#D00200"><p>I would be very disappointed if the Minister were to sign the regulation.  I urge her not to do so.  I accept that the Teaching Council is very busy.  At times, I am in close contact with the Teaching Council and it has said it has no interest in early years graduates.  It does not acknowledge the very specific pedagogy that Maria Montessori afforded us all, and that has informed teacher education formation for all.  What impresses me about Montessori graduates is that they have very specific hands-on knowledge of how to work with children in special education needs settings.  I was a teacher educator and I know how squashed the programmes are.</p> <p>While I am pleased that special needs education is a part of all programmes, I do not believe any current teacher education programme has an adequate focus on special education and the range and complexity of needs facing teachers in the classroom.  I urge the Minister to consider the matter again.  I appreciate that it is not the Minister of State's brief.  Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh, for the time.  Does the Minister of State agree with the two-tier approach that is emerging between the 1,000 graduates that have gone through the system that had restricted recognition afforded to them and the new students who are in the system who will not be given any?  Another form of discrimination is emerging.  Does the Minister of State agree with that?</p></speech>

I have tabled this matter because the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service is most valuable.  It is an essential part of the work being done by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris.  It is the expenditure equivalent of the work the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does on the tax side.  It is vital that public money is not spent on expenditures that are ineffective and that do not create a flow of benefits that exceed the costs and it is not desirable to have expenditures which add to the national debt problem.  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service has a seven-member oversight committee and I commend them.  They include Professors Dave Madden and Kevin Denny of UCD, as well as Professor Frances Ruane.  The chair is Ms Deirdre Hanlon, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There also is a 15-member management group.  They have a strong view that the service needs to extend its work to include the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and they want those Departments to join in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service by the end of 2015.  I would say, "Why not today?"  That is approximately &euro;9 billion of expenditure, out of &euro;53 billion overall or 18%, that is not covered by this valuable work that we all must do.  The first set of graduates recruited will have joined by the first quarter of this year.  They have masters degrees and the object is a programme of continuous professional development to assist both the Government and the Oireachtas in providing an evaluation service.</p> <p>The constitutional officer to oversee value for money is the Comptroller and Auditor General and perhaps this new body should liaise with him because sometimes the Comptroller and Auditor General only turns up after the mishap has happened.  Members need to have early warnings, as events such as the banking crisis illustrate for them.  Moreover, there are parallels, such as the Congressional Budget Office in the United States and so on.  The problem with this evaluation exercise is it undoubtedly will have powerful enemies.  Lobby groups, not just bankers, think they have the right to Exchequer funds, notoriously on 29 September 2008.  There are also enemies within as described in the work of the US economist, William Niskanen, whereby in many bureaucracies, promotion depends on expanding the budget and therefore, they maximise the budget rather than even asking the question as to whether those budgets led to any useful outputs.  More cost-benefit analyses and more studies are needed in advance.</p> <p>There have been three cases of late about which I am worried.  A single page was all that appeared in the Oireachtas Library about the sale of Aer Lingus.  While I expressed strong views on the other point of view regarding the sale of the Government's stake, this is inadequate.  In addition, I raised at the relevant Oireachtas committee last week the issue of postcodes, involving &euro;27 million for a seven-digit non-sequential address for every house in the country but I note the time the President had to consider such a proposal, on which I have seen no cost-benefit analysis, was reduced when the Government invoked Article 25.2 2&deg; of the Constitution to require that legislation to be signed on a date earlier than the fifth day after the Bill was presented to the President.</p> <p>The third case that has arisen in the transport committee, which I believe also affects the Minister of State's part of the country and it concerns the question of whether it is the correct solution to generate electricity for Northern Ireland within that territory, for example, in Derry or in Larne or is it correct to generate it in the South?  How much does one lose if the transmission is overhead on pylons or underground?  I believe that numbers in this regard would help.</p> <p>This is a message that is of use to evaluation.  We should have a lot more of it as it is valuable and this House will always support progress towards better evaluation of public expenditure.  All knowledge that can help the better governance of Ireland should be promoted.  Moves in that regard would certainly would have the support of this House.  This is why I asked for this item to be considered.  The initiative is important, will have powerful enemies and people will try to avoid it but it is in the interests of Parliament and, as the Government has stated, it is in its own interest to have full evaluations and full discussion.  The recruitment of all these young people with those qualifications and the involvement of the senior academics is most welcome and I wish the initiative well.</p></speech>

Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis.  I thank Senator Barrett for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who is not available this afternoon due to Government business.</p><p>The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, was established in 2012.  The introduction of the new service was part of the broader expenditure reform agenda launched by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  It is an integrated cross-Government service to enhance the role of economics and value-for-money analysis in policy making and demonstrates a strong commitment to a high and consistent standard of policy evaluation and policy analysis throughout the Civil Service.  The purpose of IGEES is to enhance the evaluation and economic capacity of the Civil Service.  Its first objective is to develop a professional service that will provide good quality analysis to assist Government, its second objective is that it aims to support better policy design and its third objective is that it works towards more open policy dialogue with expert stakeholders.</p><p>IGEES is spread across the central Government sector.  It operates within a large number of Government Departments, each of which have specific units or sections that are focused on economic and/or evaluation work.  In some Departments, evaluation or economic units were already in place prior to the establishment of IGEES.  These have typically either been expanded or are planned to be expanded as part of developing the new service.  In other Departments, new units have been set up.  Building on existing specialised expertise in Government Departments, there have already been three successful recruitment campaigns since 2012 to augment this capacity.  There will also be annual recruitment campaigns to sustain and develop the service.  These intakes of qualified economists and evaluators will help ensure the service meets its long-term objectives.  There are now approximately 90 IGEES members working across the Civil Service.</p><p>IGEES members work on core areas of government, including the budget and macroeconomic forecasting.  IGEES members developed the public spending code - the value-for-money standards for public expenditure - and are actively involved in promoting the code.  IGEES units in Departments across the Civil Service are already delivering a range of analytical and statistical outputs.  The entire range of different analyses is published by individual Departments and also on the IGEES website at <i></i>.  These analyses include: programme evaluations: cross-cutting reviews: economic analysis: tax expenditure reviews; and sectoral trend analysis.  Some examples of recently published papers include: A Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport - Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; A Fact Sheet on Irish Agriculture - Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Behavioural Economics - Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Expenditure Implications of Demographic Change in the Primary and Post-Primary Sectors - Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Departments which are involved in IGEES follow shared approaches to recruitment, promotion and mobility for their IGEES staff.  Under the leadership of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, they have also jointly developed a standardised professional development framework and a strong programme of training and development opportunities.  In addition, the IGEES network and annual conference provide important opportunities for members to present and discuss their work with colleagues from other Government Departments, as well as academics and specialists.</p><p>IGEES is particularly important to support programme evaluation across the Civil Service.  The growing capacity of IGEES will play a central role in delivering a new series of expenditure evaluations under the value-for-money review initiative as the previous round comes to a close.  The initiative is a long-standing feature of the evaluation landscape in Ireland.  It requires Departments to systematically examine and review spending programmes to ensure that they are working efficiently and effectively.  The overall objective of the reviews is to inform spending decisions.  Value-for-money reviews are regularly published by Departments and laid before the Oireachtas.  During the next three years, a new programme of reviews covering well over 30 different programme areas will be carried out.  The results of these reviews will help underpin the next comprehensive review of expenditure.</p><p>The recent such review built on the work of IGEES staff across Departments and in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A range of background analyses and papers that were undertaken by IGEES as part of that review were published.  The output of IGEES is available to inform policy makers, public debate and Parliament.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, introduced the whole-of-year budgetary process so that the Oireachtas could engage in constructive dialogue with Ministers and their officials about spending plans and priorities.  To do this, it is important that the Oireachtas has timely, coherent and relevant information.  A significant volume of information has been made available to committees through the performance budgeting initiative.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, the range of evaluations undertaken and published by Departments, often using their IGEES resources, provide further evidence to help the Oireachtas assess public policy options.</p></speech>

The open policy dialogue he mentioned is a credit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department.  It is also vitally necessary that it is not in any way subverted by people with favourite projects who try to get them through without evaluation.  It is more welcome that the skills deficits noted in the Wright report are being addressed.  I hope these new evaluation experts will be fully incorporated into the public service.  It is the kind of expertise we need and it is part of the reforms we all came into the House in 2011 to implement.  It is good to hear about the progress that is being made.  The Minister will have support for that momentum on this side of the House.  It is important and valuable work and this House will not be found wanting because it is essential that we never drift back to where we were between 2005 and 2008.  It is important that every item of public expenditure is fully accounted for and value for money is assured to taxpayers.</p></speech>

We always have to be conscious that it is a three-way conversation between the citizens, the Legislature and the experts.  When I was a Member of this House in 2005, I quoted my father who said: "If we do not watch what is going on this country whereby people are paying up to &euro;600,000 for two-bedroom apartments, they will have millstones around their necks for the rest of their lives."  We have to be conscious of the fact that this House has a role and there should be better trigger mechanisms.  We have a second arm of the Legislature here and there should be trigger mechanisms when a politician raises a point in this House in order that it is followed through.  I recall making that point at the time and that was as far as it went.  I appreciate the Senator's contribution.  I am a big advocate of the man on the street and he was talking about a property bubble bursting and crashing long before it became trendy within the appropriate field of expertise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-07-07a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015070700002#G00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad he is an advocate of the man and woman on the street and his or her views.  I wonder what are the views on the man on the street in Athens today following Sunday's referendum.  I debated this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Harris, in the House last week, and while neither of us put our political prediction hats on, both of us deep down suspected that the Greek people would see fit to come round to the conventional world view of Greece and vote "Yes", but they surprised us and much of the EU and took a democratic decision to vote "No".  It is not a decision we may have desired but that was the result of the referendum.   As we speak, much bigger and more serious and senior discussions are taking place elsewhere between eurozone finance Ministers and eurozone leaders and, hopefully, during the next few hours and days, a solution will be put together to allow Greece to remain in the eurozone and to allow the ongoing work of the European project to continue.  It would be a complete and utter economic and political disaster for the eurozone and the EU itself if Greece was forced out of the eurozone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would be the first to concede that the management of the Greek economy by previous Greek Governments left much to be desired.  The current Greek Government, having been swept to power on a wave of euphoria, dreams and promises a few months ago, has also taken unhelpful economic action.  Hopefully however, arising from what it believes to be a mandate from its referendum on Sunday, it might see common sense.</p><p>The Irish government and other governments in the eurozone, as well as in the broader European Union, must be seen to work with and for a Greek solution.  It may be necessary to swallow some political pride.  We all know the reality of the politics of the situation.  Certain countries do not want to see a win for Syriza.  As a political "saddo" who watches all parties&rsquo; Ard-Fheiseanna, I was not impressed to see the now Greek finance Minister speak at Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis several months ago, highlighting the links and similarities between Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s and Syriza's policies.  That is politics but we must move beyond this to ensure the misery faced by the people of Greece is dealt with.</p><p>Wild promises continued to be made right up until the last moment of the referendum campaign.  The outgoing finance Minister said that, regardless of the referendum result, the Greek banks would be open on the following Monday and Tuesday and a solution found within 48 hours.  Again, that was being overly optimistic.  It is essential, however, we park the politics and look at the bigger picture to devise a workable solution.</p><p>From an Irish perspective, rather than following we should be leading.  There was a time when Irish foreign policy had a strong moral dimension to it.  It was one in which Ireland felt obliged, because of our colonial history, to side with the underdog, forming alliances with smaller nations.  It appears now, however, that in the European Union, and in particular the eurozone, we take our leads not from the smaller countries but the more powerful.  We need to work with all of our colleagues on the European stage, large and small.</p><p>Not only is there an opportunity but there is an obligation on us to be one of the countries advocating for concessions towards Greece.  The Minister of State can argue about the cost to Ireland.  However, what will be the cost to Ireland if Greece does exit the eurozone?  What is the cost if it has a contagion effect on our nearest neighbour, the UK, and impacts on its forthcoming European referendum?  We must not just be thinking in the political short term but look towards the medium and long-term necessity of keeping the eurozone strong.</p><p>I appreciate there are evolving negotiations taking place on the whole issue.  What is the Government&rsquo;s current thinking on the matter?</p></speech>

He has given a broad and holistic view on this important issue.</p> <p>Greece remains a full member of the euro area and it is in all our interests that it remains so.  However, as the Government has stated on many occasions, as a member of the euro area, each member state has responsibilities and obligations.  This is no different for Greece.</p> <p>The referendum in Greece on Sunday, July 5, resulted in a majority &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, which was a rejection of the prior action list as it stood on 25 June.  It should be noted this list was not a final list as the Greek authorities unilaterally withdrew from negotiations before agreement could be reached.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While there were still divergences, there was considerable commonality to bridge the gap and agree a single document that all parties could sign up to.  The institutions had come forward with a very favourable offer to Greece and would have also addressed future financing needs and the sustainability of the Greek debt, although this had not been discussed or agreed by the Eurogroup.  It also included support for a Commission-led package for a new start for jobs and growth and would boost recovery of investment in the real economy.  Greece withdrew from the negotiations and called a referendum.  As of midnight on 30 June, the second economic adjustment programme for Greece expired along with associated disbursements.  Therefore any further financing for Greece would likely be under a new programme with associated conditionality.</p><p>Today, the finance ministers of the euro area will meet to take stock of developments, listen to the new Greek finance minister and try to find a way forward.  This will be followed by a meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area, the euro summit, in which the Taoiseach will participate.  The ball is now in the Greek court.</p><p>For recovery of the Greek economy to occur, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable.  There is no getting away from this.  It is important that the Greek authorities put forward reform measures that will put the Greek economy back on a sustainable path.  Ireland is, of course, open to a new programme for Greece, but any programme must be backed by a full memorandum of understanding and a commitment to strong ownership and implementation.  Time is running out, as is evident from the extremely difficult situation the Greek banks are facing.</p><p>While the governing council of the ECB maintained the level of emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, at just under &euro;90 billion, it decided to adjust the haircuts on collateral accepted by the bank.  We have great sympathy for the Greek people and the Minister for Finance has expressed this view on several occasions.  He has also been quite helpful to the Greek authorities in moving to the position whereby realistic negotiations were taking place prior to the referendum and stands ready to further these efforts with the new finance minister.</p><p>Ireland, together with the other member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people which has been exacerbated by the expiry of the second programme and the current uncertainty created by the referendum.  This is why there is still a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new government.  We have engaged as quickly as possible.  It is now up to the Greek authorities to come up with a credible plan which will undo the damage created by this uncertainty and put Greece on a sustainable path of growth.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said that the ball is now in the Greek court.  The ball is in the courts of all the eurozone countries and with their leaders.  We know from our history, and for geographical reasons the Minister of State knows this better than I, that when big decisions must be made and compromises found, movement is required on both sides and previously entrenched views and positions must be set aside.  That is why saying the ball is in the Greek court is not sufficient.  There must be movement, compromise and new, fresh thinking on all our parts if a solution is to be found.  I hope Ireland is leading the charge in seeking those compromises and that new thinking.</p></speech>

We have issued a revised version of that motion and I encourage all Members interested in this matter to put their names to it in order that a clear message from the Seanad can go out that this is important and that we believe that people who are waiting for pancreas transplants are important.  By way of further information for Members, 15 pancreas donations went to waste this year thus far because we did not have a surgeon in place and the vacancy has not been filled.  I have received this information from the retired professor and surgeon, David Hickey.  Those 15 pancreas donations could have been used in life-changing and life-saving operations but they were not used because we do not have the facilities or the surgeon to carry out that life-saving surgery.  I do not think anyone thinks this is acceptable.  If people are interested in this matter I ask them to put their names to the motion by 5 p.m. today.  I intend to move the motion tomorrow, I hope with the full agreement of the House.</p> <p>On other health issues, I refer to the figures for the record number of people waiting on trolleys.  The numbers of people on outpatient waiting lists increased by over 200% and there has been a 400% increase in St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin.  It is gone past a crisis.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, will be in the House next week but there are very many issues that are not being addressed.  I refer to the frustration of people who cannot get appointments.  People are on trolleys and outpatient appointments are being cancelled.  It has gone from bad to worse and worse again.  We need to have a specific debate before the summer recess to give the Minister an opportunity to outline his plans for addressing this crisis.  All we get from the Minister is tea and sympathy.  He says it is terrible and I agree with him but what is he doing about it?  That is the problem.  I do not see anything happening.</p> <p>I have further referenced the point with regard to the Fampyra drug, an issue I have raised in the House time and again for more than a year.  Three thousand multiple sclerosis patients who would benefit from this mobility drug cannot get the drug.  It is as simple as that.  They cannot get it because of inaction by the Department and by the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have raised the matter time and again and the Leader has used his good offices to raise the point with the Minister, but nothing is happening.  I raised it in February 2014.  People I know of in my area and all over the country can no longer work.  They no longer have mobility, are dependent on the State and cannot access a life-changing drug.  This is an issue for 3,000 MS patients and it is beyond disgraceful at this stage.  There is no logical reason for it.  The drugs policy unit can state what it wants, that it is assessing this or that application, but the reality is that people cannot access the drug that was helping them.  This is not right and the Minister must address the issue.  Therefore, I am again today proposing an amendment on the Order of Business that the Minister come to the House to address specifically the issue to allow 3,000 people to access and benefit from the MS drug, Fampyra.</p></speech>

However, it was made very clear by European leaders that they wanted <i>Mr. Varoufakis</i>gone.  There is no question or doubt that that is from where the impetus came.  There is no vision or leadership in Europe.  This is a disaster for the European project.  What has happened to the idea of solidarity?  I know that it is not fashionable or politically correct to say it, but it is time somebody reminded the Germans that they started two world wars and were penalised heavily through reparations.  However, after a number of years, there was a massive debt cancellation, but now they are the ones who will not permit debt cancellation for the Greeks.  It is time somebody mentioned their record.

Among other things, it noted that Galway is one of four national urban areas that has experienced a decreased level of service due to congestion.  Anyone who knows Galway would hardly find such a conclusion surprising given the volume of traffic.  It also proves there is a need for better public transport and to finalise plans for an outer bypass, as a matter of urgency.  I sincerely hope that such a route could proceed as soon as possible.  However, if we are to be realistic about this matter, it will take at least five to ten years given the difficulties regarding route selection.  As I have stated in the past, and as I shall state here again, in order to tackle traffic congestion in Galway city and the western region it is critical that we have park and ride facilities located east, west and north of Galway city.  A bus service must be provided.  It would mean people can park their vehicles and use a bus that will travel every ten or 15 minutes at peak times in the mornings and the evening, and to a lesser degree during the day, to bring people to their education centres, places of work or hospitals, all of which are located in the city centre.  All reports that have been conducted in Galway city will show that over 90% of people want to travel into the city centre area.  Therefore, it is critical that we have an efficient and cost-effective bus service.  If we want to develop the western region, and want to promote and develop the local economy, then we need to deal with traffic congestion in the short term while we await longer-term projects.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that today is the tenth anniversary of the killing of 56 people in London on 7 July 2005.  This anniversary is almost in the same week as the horrific events in Tunisia.  It behoves us to remember what the word terror means.  It means putting fear into the hearts of people.  I feel very much for the people of Tunisia who fought very hard for their democracy and now see it fading from them as international tourists abandon Tunisia, which is totally understandable..  It is sad to see the democratic regime in Tunisia coming under pressure because of the activities of terrorism.</p> <p>I congratulate FLAC on the launch of its annual report yesterday.  I commend it on the excellent work it does and note that it acknowledges that there was an 80% increase in the number of calls coming in to the office as a result of the current crisis in housing, in the rented sector in particular.  </p> <p>Could I ask the Leader that we have a debate on the issue of access to free legal aid, because at the end of the day, it is a person's ability to vindicate his or her rights that is at issue?

We have had the experience in recent times of Berkeley in California but also of Priory Hall and the row of homes in County Kildare that burned down.  It seems there are defective buildings likely to be occurring even yet.  During the Celtic tiger building went up at such speed that I do not think there were controls on them.  I understand the Minister is looking at introducing a review of building regulations.  I think it would be very useful to have him come to this Chamber so that we would have an opportunity to discuss matters.  If somebody buys a house, as many of us have, and ten, 20 or 30 years later we discover it is a defective building, we cannot get in touch with the builder or do anything about it, yet in other countries they have an insurance policy that continues to enable the owner of the home to be able to seek recompense many years later.  I think it would be worthwhile if the Minster were to come to this House to give us a chance to discuss the regulations before he introduces them.</p> <p>May I mention one other occasion today?  Mrs. Kathleen Hayes Rollins Snavely who died yesterday was 113 years and 140 days old and was born in Feakle in County Clare.  To the best of my knowledge she was the oldest Irish person and she died in New York.  She was the 16th oldest person in the United States.  I am sure that when she was born in 1902 she did not realise she would still be around in 2015 and might be mentioned in an Irish Parliament.</p></speech>

A number of my colleagues were present for the event.  I ask, as I have done in the House previously, that some more money be put into Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada's residence in County Leitrim.  County Leitrim is allocated only &euro;30,000 for the whole celebration and it is not enough.  We have been lucky in that money has been allocated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht towards a car park at Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada's house but much work remains to be done around the house.  That area could be transformed by bringing more tourism to the locality.  The village of Kiltyclogher, which will be Leitrim's heritage town, will be recognised shortly.  This is a great opportunity to promote tourism and encourage more people to the area by spending a little more money.  I call on the Minister with responsibility for this area to have another look at the issue with a view to developing Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada's house and the village of Kiltyclogher into something which will be of great significance in 2016.</p></speech>

When I looked at the photographs in the newspaper of the Pearse cottage in Galway I thought it was the Mac Diarmada cottage, such is the similarity between the two.  Without wishing to appear partisan, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris, visited the Mac Diarmada homestead a few weeks ago to launch the annual Leitrim County Council sponsored Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada summer school.  There was a high level of expectation, especially among Senator Comiskey's party colleagues, that the Minister of State would not leave without making a specific announcement.  Not only were those in the Government parties disappointed but all of us who live in Leitrim were disappointed that no such announcement was made about funding.  I found it hard to absorb yesterday watching all the media attention on the Taoiseach and all the various foot soldiers in Fine Gael turning up in Connemara for the announcement in terms of the P&aacute;draig Pearse cottage.  I do not want to set one cottage against another but, as history has already proved, he was probably the most significant member of the Provisional Government of 1916.  We in Leitrim believe that reality should be recognised and recognised financially.  In that regard I fully support the comments of Senator Comiskey and call on the Government, even at this late stage, to allocate the necessary funding.  Leitrim County Council has plans for its development.  The road access is very narrow and funding is required.  I am sure it can be found somewhere.</p> <p>I support Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Senator Sean D. Barrett and others on all sides, who are calling for a humanitarian approach to what is going on in Greece.  There is most definitely an elite between the German-Franco-Finnish-Dutch axis, although I would probably exclude the French in that they seem to be standing in solidarity with the Greek people.</p></speech>

It even says on its website that it opposes unsustainable out-of-town retail development.  I fully agree with it on that point, but what about the sustainable retail units and supermarkets being built smack bang in the middle of our town centres which it opposes?</p> <p>The cost of submitting a planning objection is so cheap, at &euro;20 to the local council and &euro;50 to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it makes great commercial sense if one is looking to retain one's market share.  The actions of these naysayers, however, are costing towns jobs, not only in the retail sector but also in the construction sector.  To turn a blind eye to what is going on right now would be nothing short of negligent.  We must continue to highlight the kind of strokes being pulled.  The essence of democracy allows for people to make their concerns known and I want to uphold that right, but it is wrong and worrying that the integrity of the system is being called into question and large companies are abusing the process for their own commercial gain.  We need to have a debate on the issue and look at strengthening our planning legislation to ensure it is not left open to abuse.  For that reason, I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be invited to this House to debate the matter at his earliest convenience.</p></speech>

I did not interrupt anyone on the other side of the House when they were speaking.  I commend the people of Greece on the way they have voted.  They have showed real courage in voting against what has been described by other Senators in this House as an attempt by the European elites to force upon the Greek Government and people unsustainable debt, poverty and economic changes which simply do not make sense.  Any economist worth his or her salt knows there will be a need to restructure the debt in Greece.  The European elites are trying to find a political solution, which is concerned with regime change and putting the Greek Government under pressure, rather than finding an economic solution which is obvious to most right-thinking people, namely, ease up on austerity and restructure the debt.  Even the IMF, for all people may think of it, has clearly said it wants a restructuring of debt but the Greeks are not being offered that because it is being frustrated by bigger countries such as Germany which simply do not want it to happen.</p> <p>On a separate issue, I call for a debate on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We have not had a debate on that issue in this House.  We know ex-taoisigh, ex-Ministers-----</p></speech>

We also know that despite the facade of fairness which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is trying to present as underpinning the Lansdowne Road agreement, higher earners, those with more than &euro;65,000, including Deputies, are in line for a &euro;7,000 pay increase over the next two years.  What of those earning less than &euro;65,000?  They get crumbs from the table: &euro;1,000.  Yet the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform says it is fair.  It is not fair.  I am calling for a debate on the unfairness of both those agreements and their impact on the vast majority of public servants who will not benefit to the extent top civil servants will benefit.  It is a golden ticket for those on the highest incomes in this State and crumbs from the table for the vast majority of public sector workers.  The Minister should come in and explain what the deal means and go through its detail rather than the continue with this facade of fairness he is currently trying to present.</p></speech>

There must be structural reform also.  Rather than having rhetoric, there has to be a little understanding that one cannot get one thing without doing another.  For example, today the Irish Minister for Education and Skills announced an additional 610 SNA posts to complement the 220 allocated in 2014 for 2015.

It seems too simple to blame EU leaders but it is also too simple to engage in casual dismissal of the Greek people and their approach to taxes, etc.  Many people will miss Mr. Varoufakis as he sails off into the sunset on his motorbike.  I hope his successor, a man by the name of Euclid, is capable of the necessary political triangulation that might be needed to bring about a solution.</p> <p>Senator Bacik rightly mentioned the anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica, but it is also appropriate for us to recall that this is the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.  Today in the House of Lords there will be a debate on Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with specific reference to freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and freedom of thought.  Those rights are under major threat and attack in the world today.  We should remember that the massacre of Armenian Christians, Assyrian Christians and others, and the massacre in Namibia of the Nama and Herero people in the early years of the 20th century, really began the story of genocide in the 20th century.  It was Hitler who famously asked who remembers the Armenians.  Modern-day Turkey does not remember them.  It refuses to discuss to them to this day.  It behoves us, given what is happening internationally, particularly to Christians, to remember the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.</p> <p>I ask that we have a debate at some point soon on the persecution of Christians that is occurring in the world today.  It does not matter whether one is a Christian, believer or non-believer if one is being persecuted but we cannot ignore that what is happening in the world today is affecting Christian minorities particularly acutely.

Arising from the profound concerns which will now surround the sale of the northern loan book by NAMA it would be advisable if, at the earliest possible opportunity, the Minister for Finance, notwithstanding his duties on the Greek situation, would come before the House to make a clear statement in respect of this sale.</p> <p>In the past decade or so we have been transfixed by tribunals, inquiries and commissions of inquiry into various matters, whether planning, money to politicians, the sale of licences etc.  We are now arriving at the tipping point where there will be, at some stage, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, some sort of inquiry into NAMA sales.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The taxpayers and citizens of this country will be short-changed if assets are sold for less than their true worth.</p><p>The ongoing revelations about Northern Ireland are of deep concern.

It is important that a clear statement is made in this regard but the overall issue of NAMA's responsibility to the taxpayer should be addressed by the Minister for Finance.  I would like to have the Minister come to the House in the near future, and certainly before the summer recess, to offer us assurances in regard to NAMA sales.  It is a matter of significant public interest.  We are speaking about figures amounting to billions of euro and we must ensure there is absolute propriety and transparency.  We need to hear from the Minister on the matter.  I appreciate that the Leader cannot arrange for a debate with the Minister overnight but I ask him to arrange an opportunity before the recess for us to get the necessary assurances.

The Government took the very pragmatic step in putting the national interest first by negotiating with the best hand it had in a quiet manner.  While there will be many critics of this, there are no queues today at banks in Ireland to make cash withdrawals.  The pharmacies here have medicines.  People here can spend money because they have money.  If we had listened to the counsel of some of our opponents on the strategy being pursued, we might have found ourselves in that position.</p></speech>

If foresight was as good as hindsight, we would not have any problem.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the Seanad to discuss the issue.  Ireland has direct exposure of &euro;365 million, which is our contribution to the ESM.  I believe I heard of an overall Irish exposure of &euro;2.4 billion to a Greek default or write-off.</p> <p>The Greek debt stands at $370 billion.  According to the World Bank, the debt for the entire Continent of Africa last year stood at $390 billion.  The Greek debt is the same size as the debt of 54 African countries.  We are asking here if we can write off debt.  In light of that figure, we need to know where our priorities should lie.</p></speech>

Perhaps we might start here.</p> <p>The Greek issue is not just about the debt.  Everyone seems to refer to the vote in Greece, but it is a much bigger question than that.  It is a question about the European Union and the future of the euro.  Greece is one of 19 eurozone members and represents 2% of the European economy.   Its people are suffering, but the situation will get much worse if Greece leaves the euro because there will be food rationing and rationing of other items.  We should not advocate that such a situation should occur.  European political leaders and bureaucrats, who perhaps are the real leaders, need to work out a refinancing and rescheduling plan.  They must stop issuing threats to the European Central Bank to the effect that it cannot lend money to Greek banks.  That is disgraceful and fuelling what is happening on the streets in Greece where people cannot access their own money.  There are real, fundamental issues at stake about democracy and capitalism and where both concepts cross over.  Capitalism is winning and democracy is losing.  Unfortunately, when political leaders and politicians protect capitalism, democracy loses.  We must reflect on this.  European political leaders who were elected by the people in sovereign countries must also reflect on it.</p></speech>

The killing of more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys in July 1995 marked one of the darkest days in the troubled conflict that engulfed the former Yugoslavia.  It was one of the worst atrocities to take place in Europe since the Second World War and was very much a failure of the international community to prevent the genocide from taking place.  Mr. Mirza atibu&scaron;i from Bosnia spoke very movingly and warned us of the dangers of a repeat if the international community failed to act on some of the awful things happening in the world today.  I hope that in the next term we will have a discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the situation in Syria and other conflicts throughout the world.  The official ceremony to mark the genocide in Srebrenica will take place on Saturday, 11 July.  I am pleased that Ireland's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Patrick Kelly, will represent the Government at the ceremony.  As has been said, today also marks the tenth anniversary of the appalling terrorist attack in London in which 52 people were killed and more than 700 were injured.</p> <p>I join Senator Jim D'Arcy in very much welcoming the announcement that an additional 610 special needs assistants, SNAs, will be provided.  The decision was sanctioned at today's Cabinet meeting.  It will mean that every child with an assessed need will have access to an SNA.  From September, there will be 11,820 whole-time SNA posts in primary and post-primary schools, an 11.7% increase since the Government took office.</p></speech>

As I stated, all Members agreed that the Clerys workers had been treated outrageously.  They have been disregarded and treated with disdain, which is totally unacceptable.  Current legislation sets out that employers must enter into a 30-day consultation period before redundancies are implemented.  That is the statutory legislation period required, but it was not adhered to in the case of the Clerys workers.  These loyal workers with commitments, mortgages, etc. were given one hour's notice.  Company law should be amended such that any employer or someone working on behalf of an employer who fails to comply with the procedures can be removed as a director for at least five years.  I support the cause and call for an urgent debate to consider the legislation required.</p></speech>

I agree with the comments made by Members that there should always be flexibility to accommodate changes to bailout programmes sought by governments.  I remind Members that when the Government took office, it secured significant changes to our bailout programme.  It replaced the &euro;750 million in further income tax increases agreed to by the previous Government with alternative measures that were less damaging to jobs.  The Government secured agreement to reverse the cuts made by Fianna F&aacute;il to the minimum wage, to cut the lower rate of employer's PRSI for three years and to cut the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors from 13.5% to 9%, which resulted in the creation of more than 30,000 jobs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government also secured interest rate reductions on the bailout debts and got rid of the promissory notes relating to the IBRC.</p></speech>

IBEC warned that employers might be very slow to enter into an REA if by doing so they would be exposing themselves to the REA being varied without their consent.  This concern is not applicable in this instance as we are providing that an employer may apply to become party to the agreement that has already been registered.  Therefore, the agreement itself will not be varied and an employer will simply be added to it.  This was proposed by both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the TEEU and in our view it is important to table this amendment.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is to allow an employer sign up to an existing REA as a new party to the agreement.  However, section 8 already provides for a mechanism by which an REA can be varied in its application to any worker or workers to whom it applies.  In this regard, the variation provisions under section 8 would allow for an application by a new employer to become party to an existing REA, subject to one of the existing parties to the agreement making the application to the court.  Alternatively, it is always open to an employer to enter into a separate collective agreement involving the same terms and conditions with a trade union and have that registered with the Labour Court.  The amendment might also have the consequences of permitting an employer become party to an REA against the wishes of the original signatories and also and then to seek to have it modified, also contrary to the wishes of the original signatories.  For the reasons outlined I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It sought an amendment to provide for adequate notice to be given to trade unions where the Labour Court might or intends to cancel an REA because the trade union is considered to be no longer substantially representative of the workers to whom the agreement pertains.  Our amendment provides in this situation for notice to be given to the trade union or trade unions involved and to allow them to state their case, which is essentially what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for.  It is a right to be heard and a right for unions to have their say.</p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to require the court to give three months' notice to the trade union of its decision and to allow for an appeal within six weeks of the decision.  Any consideration by the Labour Court as to whether a trade union is no longer substantially representative of the workers concerned would require the court to engage with the union in advance and to consider submissions from the union on the issue.</p></speech>
