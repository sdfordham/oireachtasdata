I very much appreciate him dealing with this matter, which relates to the increase in demand there will be for home care now that we have an increasing number of older people in the country.  That number will continue to increase at a dramatic pace in the next ten to 12 years.  The figures, as I understand them, indicate that 637,000 citizens are over 65.  Within 12 years, that will be 1 million.  While there has been an increase in the number of people who are being provided with home care, we also need to plan for the long term.  In particular, we need to plan to upskill people who will be able and available to provide home care.</p> <p>The other challenge we face relates to the fact that because of the increase in employment, people will not be attracted into providing home care because there are more permanent jobs available.  We will have to look, therefore, at what kind of mechanism we should put in place to ensure that people have job security.  That is becoming more of a challenge for those who want to provide home care.  It is in that context that I am raising this issue.  I would like to know what action the Government and the Department of Health are taking to deal with this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#B00400"><p>In common with other developed counties, Ireland is experiencing the ageing of its population.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is giving rise to some significant challenges for us.  The proportion of the population aged 85 and over increased by more than 20,000 between 2006 and 2016 and is projected to increase by a further 36,000 by 2026.  This effectively means that this age group is expected to more than double over a 20-year period.  Based on current CSO population projections, it is expected that population ageing will continue in the forthcoming decades.  This, of course, has direct implications for health and social care services because demand is highest among those in these age groups.</p> <p>The HSE, working within its available resources, has sought to maintain and, where possible, expand the range and volume of services available.  These services include supporting people to remain in their own homes and preventing early admission to long-term residential care, as well as supporting people to return home following an acute hospital admission.  Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated.  The additional resources made available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HSE's national service plan provides for a target of just over 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  Turning now to the steps that have been taken, I can advise that at the end of last year the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, launched the national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning.  The framework aims to support the recruitment and retention of the right mix of workers across the health and social care system to meet planned and projected service needs.  The framework proposes a consistent approach to strategic workforce planning together with the establishment of structures and governance arrangements that support and enable the application of this approach in the health sector and cross-sectorally where appropriate.  One of the early actions identified as necessary to implement the framework is the development of a more formal and structured arrangement for engagement between our health and education systems to ensure the development and retention of the appropriate competencies and skills in the system.  As with all health and social care workers we must ensure that the competencies and behaviours being developed by those who wish to become home care providers take account of developments in health and social care delivery.  It is essential that educational and training courses are provided to these individuals with the core competencies which are required for their future profession.  Ensuring closer engagement between health and education and training systems is vital to achieving this goal.  The development of a protocol for engagement between the two sectors is a high-level objective of the framework's implementation plan.  I am fully aware that home care providers play a vital role in improving the health and well-being of our older population by supporting and looking after them at home, which is usually their preferred environment.  In terms of the provision of training, the HSE provides training to its home support workers.  The current programme in health service skills leads to an award at level 5 recognised in the national framework of qualifications or equivalent.  This skills programme is available to staff working in the HSE and section 38 agencies.  This ensures that they have the necessary competencies required for their role meeting all the quality standards required for effective patient and client care.</p></speech>

He has acknowledged that there will be a substantial increase in the demand for home care.  In the context of the national strategy framework for health and social workforce planning, do we have a five-year or ten-year plan to develop this service or are we merely going from year to year?  My concern is that it is the latter.</p></speech>

It is staggering to think we will have 1.2 million people over the age of 65 years living in this country in the next 20 years or so.  There is a huge challenge and that is why, early in my tenure in this role, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I launched a consultation on a new statutory home care scheme that would mirror the fair deal scheme.  It would be underpinned by statute, would be guaranteed funding and would be a demand-led scheme.  Part of that is looking at our workforce planning and the issues surrounding ensuring that we have availability.  It is a challenge in many different regions and it contributes to the <i>ad hoc</i>nature of delivery today.  The upskilling and recruitment, as well as the maintaining and keeping in the system of home care workers, is part of that statutory scheme and is part of the planning process that is being undertaken at the moment.  I assure the Senator that we are aware of that challenge and that is to the fore in our development of the new statutory scheme, which we hope to have up and running within the next two to three years.</p></speech>

Two operating theatres in Merlin Park University Hospital, Galway were shut on health and safety grounds last September when significant leaks in the roof were discovered.  Repair works were completed on 1 November and yet, more than three months later, the theatres are still not open.  An independent clinical assessment has been undertaken to assess the feasibility of returning these theatres to use and I understand that correspondence was issued yesterday to the effect that one of those theatres may be in a position to open today.  Can the Minister of State confirm this?  More importantly, can he also confirm that it would be adequately resourced, keeping in mind that it is more than six weeks since the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il the Government's commitment to ensuring the restoration of a full elective orthopaedic service to Merlin Park University Hospital, Galway?  For such a service to be restored, the promised modular theatres on the Merlin Park site need to be put in place immediately.  I have been in contact with the chair of the HSE forum, Councillor Mary Hoade.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She has echoed the concerns of all the forum members from all parties, all the staff members from University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park and, more importantly, the concerns of the public in general.  Over six weeks ago, the Taoiseach said that the tender process for these modular units was in the final stages and it was expected that a contract would be awarded in the coming weeks.  Can the Minister of State confirm whether this contract has been awarded and provide a timeline as to when work is due to begin?</p><p>With respect to Galway University Hospital emergency department, Eilish O'Regan reported last week that patients were falling victim to outbreaks of deadly superbugs in dangerously crowded hospitals.  We know that the emergency department of University Hospital Galway is dangerously overcrowded.  It has consistently been at the top of the trolley watch indicators, which is a shameful accolade.  A 2017 report found that conditions at the emergency department were chaotic and nothing short of scandalous.  The eyewitness report commissioned by the Saolta group stated that patients are crammed together, within touching distance of each other for the most part and with little or no privacy.  Is it any wonder that patients in close quarters are contracting and passing on superbugs, which are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics?  The CPE bug is particularly nasty and has multiplied and evolved since my days of working in accident and emergency.  It is dreaded because it is almost untreatable.  It is immune to some of the last resort group of antibiotics that are used when all other drugs fail.  It usually leads either to a pneumonia-type infection in the chest or an E. coli infection in the bladder or digestive system.  It kills around half of patients whose bloodstream it enters.  Some 17 new cases were detected between 19 February and 12 March in Ireland, including in University Hospital Galway.  I ask the Minister of State to update the House on the current stage of works at the new emergency department block.  I urge him to acknowledge that there is a real need to put all shoulders to the wheel in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#D00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on these matters on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The leaks in the roof of the building that houses Merlin Park University Hospital&rsquo;s orthopaedic theatres occurred in September 2017, necessitating the closure of both theatres in the interest of patient safety.  A full repair to the membrane of the roof was required to secure the integrity of the building and these works have been completed.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to inform the House that following completion of remedial works identified as part of a further external assessment, one of the theatres has become operational today.</p> <p>It has been evaluated that the best way of restoring effective capacity at Merlin Park is the construction of two modular theatres on the Merlin Park site.  The HSE has advised that the tender process for these modular units is now complete and a contract has been awarded.  Contract documents have been exchanged and active engagement with the successful company is in progress.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that the Department and the HSE have implemented a number of measures to address overcrowding at University Hospital Galway.  The Government is committed to fixing the situation in our emergency departments and breaking the cycle of overcrowding in the health service.  To do this the Department is pursuing three priorities in 2018, namely, increasing capacity across the system using evidence provided by the health service capacity review beginning with some additional hospital beds; implementing reform through Sl&aacute;intecare; and increasing services provided through primary care by negotiating a new GP contract.</p> <p>The situation in University Hospital Galway is challenging, with 41 patients waiting on trolleys yesterday morning.  Infection control issues remain of concern with six beds closed due to norovirus, which is impacting on congestion and admissions and transfers to wards.  I wish to acknowledge the distress for staff, patients and their families of the current situation.  Funding has been provided in 2018 to open 28 additional inpatient beds in University Hospital Galway and access was provided to seven additional home care packages per week and two additional transitional care beds per week for the duration of winter.  Furthermore, the Department of Health is also engaging with the HSE to fast-track the recommendations of the recent health service capacity review with a view to opening more new beds within the system as soon as possible this year.</p> <p>Both the Department and the HSE are working on alleviating the overcrowding situation at University Hospital Galway and ensuring that the orthopaedic theatres at Merlin Park are operational as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the recently announced additional family resource centre provision but, unfortunately, there is no provision for north Mayo.  I have not intervened on this matter up to now because I was sure the urgent need for a family resource centre in Erris would be recognised.  I am not sure if the Minister of State has been to Erris but I am sure he has heard of Belmullet which has a population of almost 8,000 people.  In terms of isolation and the difficulties around access to services, it is a 154 km round trip to the county town of Castlebar and a 124 km round trip to Ballina.  The primary and secondary routes connecting to those towns are prone to flooding and in need of urgent upgrade.  However, that is a matter for another Minister.</p> <p>The recent Social Justice Ireland report shows an increase in poverty in rural areas.  There is also a poverty of access to essential services.  It is not feasible for support services, such as those provided by Tusla through the family resource centres, to travel to and from Erris to meet the needs of individuals and families.  That Tusla and HSE staff have to spend half their days travelling to and from the main centres is not the best use of their time and not conducive to providing quality support services to individuals and families.  The reality is that families and individuals are being deprived of the life-saving and life-changing supports and services available to people living in other areas.  </p> <p>A family resource centre located in Erris would facilitate an early intervention and prevention approach that would assist in preventing cases escalating to the social work teams and mental health teams that are already overstretched.  Following on from the closure of community development projects in 2015, there is an even more severe gap in services for the Erris community.  Over the 13 year timeframe that the CDP was in existence, along with the one-to-one supports provided by it initiatives such as whole community responses to bullying, domestic violence, poor mental health, isolation and many other key issues, were developed.  It also acted as a facilitator and an anchor for parenting programmes, community participation in primary care and other anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives.  The combination of family support services and community development that could be provided by a family resource centre would tackle disadvantage and address the inequalities that are preventing people from living full, healthy and self-determined lives.</p> <p>Erris is a wonderful area in which to live or to visit.  The deprivation statistics included in the application for a family resource centre in Erris speak to the underlying severe disadvantage when it comes to accessing services, unemployment levels, the level of lone parents and the number of people living in isolation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It speaks to all of those things.  Young people with acute mental health difficulties must still travel to north Mayo CAMHS which is based in Ballina.  If a young person recovering from a bereavement or something traumatic needs the support of CAMHS and other services, it is not feasible to take him or her out of school for a whole day to access those services.  That is why I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the family resource centres and to put one into the Erris area as a matter of urgency.  I would not ask if it were not desperately needed.  I ask on behalf of the families and individuals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#F00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh.  The family resource centre programme was established in 1998 and was overseen by the former Family Support Agency until the transfer of responsibility to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, on its establishment in 2014.  Until 2018, there were 109 family resource centres in the programme, seven of which are operational in County Mayo at Ballina, Castlebar, Westport, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe and Kilmovee.  Family resource centres are independent voluntary organisations that deliver universal services to families in local communities based on a life-cycle approach.  Centres seek to combat disadvantage and provide supports to improve family life.  The family resource centre programme emphasises the involvement of communities in tackling the problems they face, working inclusively with service users and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory organisations at community level.</p> <p>In budget 2018, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, secured an additional &euro;3 million for Tusla to support the family resource centre programme.  The additional funding is being used to support existing family resource centres and to provide for the expansion of the programme with the inclusion of 11 new centres.  Following a public application process, Tusla announced recently the 11 centres which are being included in the programme this year.  I understand that applications to Tusla to join the programme were of a very high standard.  The criteria considered included the size and make-up of the geographical area, the social and economic conditions in the specified area and the overall population breakdown of the area that would be serviced by the proposed centre.  The criteria also considered the structure of the organisation applying to the programme, its objectives, targets, current relationships with other organisations and the inclusion of available research, community projects and needs assessments with the application.  A high number of applications, 47 in total, were received by Tusla, one of which was from an organisation based in the Erris area of Mayo.</p> <p>Tusla was faced with a difficult decision-making process to select 11 new centres for inclusion in the programme.  It is important to emphasise that Tusla recently established an online virtual child and family support network for Erris and Ballina.  Child and family support networks represent services which play a role in the lives of children and families in a given area such as statutory service providers and local voluntary and community services.  The aim of these networks is to ensure that if a family presents to a service which cannot meet its needs, the service can redirect the family to another service which is more appropriate.  The new online network will enable services to develop an understanding of the work of other providers in order to facilitate the provision of a more integrated service to families in the community.  Tusla has advised that it also funds a full-time family support worker in the local area.  The Mayo children and young people service committee also brings together representatives of State bodies and community and voluntary services who work with children and young people in the county.  The committee is currently finalising a three-year plan for Mayo which will include an audit of services working with children, young people and families in Mayo, as well as a local needs analysis.  Future commissioning of services by Tusla in County Mayo will take the completed local needs analysis into account, including any gaps in services wherever they may be identified.  Through its prevention partnership and family support network, Tusla will continue to provide supports through the targeting of additional resources to services which will impact positively on vulnerable children and families.</p> <p>I thank Senator Conway-Walsh for raising the matter.  It is of key importance that the needs of children and families are met in the best way possible, in particular in areas of disadvantage.  I assure the Senator that my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, will continue to support the work of family resource centres.  Family support is a key priority for her.</p></speech>

I have worked in the middle of all of this.  In the context of interagency co-operation and the work that can be done, what is needed is a family resource centre.  I welcome the fact that a support worker will be in place but it is not enough.  However, that is not adequate to replace the community development project and the extra family support that is needed in the area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State will know there has been severe tragedy across that area in recent years and even in the last number of months.  These services are desperately needed.  I will contact the Minister, Deputy Zappone, separately but I ask the Minister of State to ask her about this.</p><p>There are exceptional needs in this area which will not be covered in the local needs analysis.  There will be lives lost in three years.  The quality of life in those three years for people who desperately need the services which could be provided through a family resource centre will not be improved.  That really concerns me.  We have all these headline figures.  We need to get down to these people who are extremely vulnerable.  Time is of the essence in doing so.  I will write to the Minister separately to ask her to consider Erris on an exceptional needs basis.  I do not want to get caught up in an audit.  The deprivation figures speak for themselves.  This has the backing of all of the statutory agencies, which do not do things like this lightly, because they know the need.  Some of them are working in the area and people who they work with in their teams have to travel out to the Erris area.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State, but this is just the beginning of the fight for a family resource centre in Erris.</p></speech>

Tusla is doing a very good job in the area of children, an area in which I have a particular interest having chaired the relevant committee previous to my current appointment.  There was an additional &euro;3 million allocated for family resource centres this year, which was very positive and which was an acknowledgement by the Government of the good work which they do and the need for them in communities.  We are all in agreement with the Senator on that.</p> <p>As I said in my initial reply, there were 47 applications.  Only 11 were successful on this occasion.  I cannot speculate on the level of funding which will we be made available in 2019 but I will sincerely be supportive and hopeful that an additional allocation will be made next year.  If there is, I have no doubt that the Department will be more than willing to work with the Senator, the Mayo children and young people's services committee and the child and family support network for Erris and Ballina in order to identify the needs there and to recognise the very genuine and legitimate issue which the Senator has raised here today.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has kindly agreed to step in and take this issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed.  I received a telephone call from the Minister's office today informing me that he was unavoidably absent.  I fully understand and respect that.</p> <p>I want to address a number of issues.  As part of the criteria for GLAS III, there is a requirement to undertake a soil analysis and nutrient management plan.  An applicant must be compliant with that to avail of the funding and supports under GLAS III.  I have had a look at the guidelines provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of the European regulations on the GLAS payments and the co-funding for them.  I have set this out in an email to the Minister, but on page 36 there are strict criteria.  Failure to comply with the nutrient management plan and to have it filed by 31 March 2018 will incur penalties.  No GLAS payment will issue to farmers for completion of the nutrient management plan if they fail to comply with the terms and conditions.  </p> <p>My case and the case of farmers and people who have lobbied me in this regard is that we know that the land is swamped.  I spoke to a farmer in Tuam the other day.  His land is swamped with water and yet he has to have soil cores bored and tests complied with and filed by 31 March.  He will simply not be able to do it.  Anyone, urban or rural, driving around this country in the last few weeks would be aware that we had Storm Ophelia, Storm Eleanor, Storm Fionn and Storm Emma.  We had vast flooding of our grounds.  Nobody wants not to comply with the terms and conditions of GLAS III.  We heard time and time again of the failure of farmers under GLAS I and GLAS II.  We still have ongoing issues with people not receiving their payments.  Some of that was to do with compliance.  We cannot tolerate people who do not comply.  I accept that.  I am not here to make a case for people who do not comply with the GLAS terms and conditions.  I am here today, as someone who sits on the agricultural panel in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to make a strong case for flexibility and a reasonable approach by the Department and all those involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept that it had these terms.  My proposal, which I ask the Minister to consider, is that as we monitor the situation in the run-up to 31 March, the Minister and those administering the scheme, both locally, nationally and through the European funding mechanisms, should have some flexibility.  Can we extend that period for up to three or four weeks?  That is a reasonable request.  I acknowledge the Minister will have to be consulted but I ask the Minister of State to revert to the Minister and to the Department and to make a case for a reasonable, fair approach to farmers whose lands are swamped and who cannot comply with the soil testing and the nutrient management plan data they have to file by 31 March.  These farmers need leeway in order that they will not be penalised and struck off for what is effectively a substantial and important payment for them under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS 3.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#H00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter and ask him to please accept the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Creed, for his absence, as he is at a funeral this morning.</p> <p>On his behalf, I wish to outline the current position regarding GLAS.  We are very pleased that the GLAS scheme has proved to be such a popular scheme among Irish farmers and that the original target of 50,000 participants was surpassed well ahead of the date scheduled.  Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015, it is a remarkable achievement that this 50,000 target was exceeded within a period of 15 months.  GLAS has a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme, with provision for payment up to &euro;7,000, known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.  Last year we paid out almost &euro;200 million on GLAS and have continued payments each week this year with a further &euro;32 million paid to date.  </p> <p>GLAS, like previous agri-environment schemes, supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  GLAS was opened in three tranches.  The issue being raised here today relates to the third tranche of the scheme, known as GLAS 3. There are more than 13,000 participants in this tranche who are required to submit a nutrient management plan to the dedicated online nutrient management planning, NMP, system operated by Teagasc.  The deadline for the submission of these plans is, as Senator Boyhan pointed out, 31 March 2018.  This deadline, as with all such deadlines, is being monitored on an ongoing basis.  The relevant participants have received ongoing reminders of this deadline and it is matter for them now, in conjunction with their advisers, to ensure that they meet this deadline.  </p> <p>The GLAS scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and addresses the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the enhancement of biodiversity and the improvement of water quality.  The scheme provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that benefit all of us.  The scheme is co-funded by the national Exchequer and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  As required under EU regulation, two payments issue each year, namely, the advance payment followed at a later stage by the balancing payment.  In 2016 and again in 2017, the advance payment represents 85% of the annual payment, with a balancing payment being 15%.  The 2017 advance payments commenced on schedule in November 2017 and continue to be made on an ongoing basis as tranches of cases are cleared.  The current position is that 97% of eligible participants have now received their GLAS 2017 advance payment.  In some of the outstanding cases, applicants remain ineligible for payment until they complete the steps they must take before the Department can process their payment.  There is nothing we can do to advance these payments until the applicant completes their obligations.  In most of these cases, this relates to outstanding documentation which they must submit.  As soon as this is received and assuming everything is in order, the Department will move immediately to issue payments.  The main issues include the need for advisers to commence a commonage management plan in the case of participants with a commonage action and to submit the required documentation in the case of the low emission slurry spreading and rare breed actions.  </p> <p>It is simply not possible for the Department to make payments in these cases because the participants have not met the requirements.  I appreciate that the Senator has made the same point.  Updates are published weekly on the Department&rsquo;s website and clearly show that steady progress is being made.  While the officials are prioritising the clearing of cases and where a farmer has been contacted for additional  information, it is important that any such request is responded to as the information requested is essential to finalise all checks.  While the issue of payments is of importance, we must also recognise what the scheme is delivering in terms of the environmental and public goods.  What the buy-in to the scheme by the farming community is achieving includes the fact that the low-input permanent pasture and the traditional hay meadow actions are delivering more than 350,000 ha of diverse grassland species.  Moreover, 29,000 km of river bank are managed to protect rivers from pollution under the protection of watercourses from bovines and riparian margins actions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are over 200,000 ha of farmland bird habitat managed to protect bird species, over 20,000 ha of wild bird cover planted, providing winter feed for farmland birds, over 2 million trees planted, almost 5,000 farmers using new technologies to spread slurry, and 10,000 ha of arable land cultivated using minimum tillage techniques.

The Minister needs accurate readings and to get them one needs proper, drained soil.  There are many complications because people feed cattle out on the land and we need appropriate readings in order to comply with the conditions for grants.  The issue is a four-week extension but I accept that the Minister of State cannot tell us today that he is extending this for a month.  Nevertheless, I ask that he keep it under consideration, engage with and consult the relevant people in the area and, perhaps, come back to us before the end of the month.  There is a crisis and there will be weather issues in the next week or two.  I will not support people who do not comply but I know the Minister is flexible and reasonable.  He comes from the agricultural sector himself so he will have experience of these difficulties.</p></speech>

In the wake of Brexit and the talk of a hard border, our rugby team gives us hope and promise of what we can do when we work together on an all-Ireland basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were able to celebrate this amazing achievement thanks to the sacrifices made by the members of the team, their support teams and their family members, who do not see them for weeks on end.  I thank them and say "well done".</p><p>The second item I would like to raise also relates to sport.  Unfortunately, this House was not sitting last week when a further allocation of sports funding was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ross.  My heart was broken when I went through the list of recipients as I sat at home.  I was sure some of the large projects in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 would finally be acknowledged and much-needed funds would be allocated to assist them in their work with young people in my area.  I was astonished to see that Wesley College in Dublin was awarded &euro;150,000.  Drimnagh Castle CBS, which educates and nurtures some of the finest young men in Dublin, was hoping to get a similar grant for a similar sporting facility, but it was badly let down.  Schools in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 rear and educate our young people without the benefit of private funding and are wholly reliant on the State.  I cannot understand why those most in need of sports funding were overlooked again.  The Government pays lip service on a daily basis to how it intends to look after inner-city communities, but on this occasion it has not put its money where its mouth is.  Communities in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 are sick of being dumping grounds for services that other areas do not want, including wet hostels and injection centres.  To add insult to injury, the Liberty Saints sports club was handed a cheque for &euro;7,000 while Malahide Rugby Football Club was given over &euro;100,000.  There is absolutely no fairness in this.  Inner-city communities need proper facilities and adequate housing.  This Government is failing at every level.  In my opinion, the self-indulgence of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in giving sports allocation grants to private colleges is sickening.</p><p>The third item I would like to raise is the use and sharing of personal data on the Internet.  The mining of that data by companies has come to light as a result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  The debate on this issue, which has been raised by Senator Higgins and others in this House, had been simmering away, but now it has exploded.  When I watched "Prime Time" yesterday, I learned that psychological operations, or planned political operations, are deployed to convey selected information to audiences to influence their motives and political voting patterns.  It seems from my understanding that computer scientists and data analysts have figured out how to brainwash us, almost, and to manipulate us our voting patterns.  This is very worrying.  We need to ensure we have proper legislation in place to govern the sale and use of our data on online platforms.  Ultimately, we need to be more self-aware.  We need to question our willingness to use and share our personal and private data, thoughts and emotions online.  Did those who filled out a Facebook quiz know that the results would be used to target them for their political motivations?  Probably not.  Many of these platforms are based in and have their headquarters in Ireland.  We need to know whether they acquiesced to or had knowledge of what our data would be used for.  I am calling for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come to this House to make a statement on the matter.  How does he plan to ensure our data will not be misused and manipulated for political gain?</p></speech>

I know Senator Devine as a hard-working person here in the Seanad, but I could not allow such a thing to go without comment.  Brian Stack was a prison officer who served this country during the Troubles.  He was murdered by thoughtless people.  Like many other members of this country's security forces - prison officers, garda&iacute; and soldiers - Mr. Stack stood guard and looked after this country during the worst of times.  It is totally unacceptable that anybody would seek to denigrate his name in any way now.  In my view, Mr. Stack was a true patriot of Ireland.  He needs to be respected for standing his ground in dealing with prisoners during some of the most troubled times we have known in this country.</p> <p>I am not going to condemn Senator Devine here today.  Instead, I am asking the Leader to set aside time for Senator Devine to come to this Chamber, as a Member of the Seanad, to explain to her colleagues how she got involved in this series of tweets.  The retweeting was one thing, but to argue online with Brian Stack's son was totally unacceptable.  Many of us in this House have met Austin Stack on various occasions.  I have met him at several committee meetings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I am absolutely devastated.  I had grave reservations about raising this issue coming in here today because one never wants to take one's colleague to task.  However, at the end of the day, the murder of a patriot in this country cannot be allowed to be in any way debased or diminished by anyone.  Nobody has the right to go after the likes of Mr. Stack.  It is so easy to say what one wants about the dead because they cannot speak for themselves.  I just think of the family.  We have all seen the bots on social media - the faceless people who attack all of us.  They will attack my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in as quick as they will those in Fine Gael or anywhere else.  We should not give these people oxygen.  I believe that Senator Devine is entitled to time to come in here and explain how she found herself in that situation because all of us have made mistakes in our lives.  The Stack family, however, are entitled to a formal apology at the very least.</p></speech>

She has rightly profusely apologised for her unacceptable actions.  Our party president, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, acted swiftly and decisively to implement the disciplinary process which led to Senator Devine being suspended from the party for three months.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about this week's report from Social Justice Ireland, which once again exposed the reality of systematic poverty which is hidden behind the flashing lights, spinning headlines and fancy presentations designed to mask the inequalities and struggles of the 780,000 people, or 16.5% of Ireland's population, who live below the poverty line.  We continue to see that having a job does not equate to coming out of poverty.  Behind all the data we see that individuals and families are working day and night while struggling to make ends meet.  These are the families that have to deliberate over whether their children are sick enough to warrant the &euro;50 or so it costs to take them to the GP.  </p> <p>They are also the individuals who end up on hospital trolleys, who have no medical card and who cannot afford medical insurance.  They are charged the standard Government levy of &euro;80 per night, regardless of whether they get a bed or not.  Can it be believed that one has to pay a Government levy of &euro;80 to spend a night on a hospital trolley while being stripped of dignity and left at risk of cross-contamination on a draughty corridor?  That is absolutely unacceptable and the Government needs to look at it in light of the huge and ever-increasing numbers of people on hospital trolleys.  The people who are being hit by this levy are the working poor.  They are the people who have already paid &euro;100 as an emergency charge.  They are the people who struggle to find the rent, the mortgage payments, the school transport charges and other household bills.  We also see that the poverty rates in rural Ireland are increased by higher costs, including travel costs, and by low-income employment.  </p> <p>Government policies which protect the extremely wealthy while draining every last cent from those on low incomes can be stopped and have to be stopped.  We have to heed the report from Social Justice Ireland, which is similar to the reports made by the Combat Poverty Agency ten and 12 years ago.  We have to seriously look at those who are working in this country and yet cannot afford a basic standard of living and who are continuously kept below the poverty line.</p></speech>

I am grateful to those who have expressed support, and I hope to bring a cross-party motion before this House tomorrow or perhaps early next week.  Perhaps the Leader could ensure that it is on the Order Paper without debate so that we can say that the Seanad has agreed this motion.  It can then be presented to the Minister, whose office I have been in communication with, and also to other interested parties, such as the Russian ambassador.  <br/><br/>I also want to commend the Trinity College Dublin Students' Union and the Take Back Trinity campaign for their campaign last week which challenged the ridiculous and sudden imposition of a new supplemental exam fee.  Along with my Trinity colleagues I was delighted to support the students and was proud to be in Front Square on Thursday when the students emerged from their occupation.  It felt like old times, to see students engaged in this sort of radical action.  The students were entirely supported by staff unions in the college, both administrative and academic, including my own union, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT.  They had really strong support from across the college community for their actions, and I commend the provost for engaging with the students.  I am glad to see the matter appears to be moving towards a resolution.  <br/><br/>I welcome the progress being made in the other House on the Thirty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution Bill.  I am glad to see that it appears to be moving to Committee Stage today.  It should be before this House next week; I know that we will be discussing that at the leaders' meeting.  From the point of view of the Labour Party, we will co-operate in any way we can to ensure that the Bill is passed before Easter so that we can run a respectful and dignified campaign for repeal.<br/><br/>However, to follow on from what Senator Ardagh said, I would have a real concern about the role that social media campaigning is going to play in this referendum, and indeed in future referendum and election campaigns here.  I want to pay tribute to Carole Cadwalladr, the <i>Guardian</i>and Channel Four teams, and the whistleblowers from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica who have come forward to highlight concerns about the misuse of the personal data of Facebook users.  Clearly there is more to come in terms of the revelations.  We see, for instance, the UK information commissioner seeking a search warrant to search the English offices of Cambridge Analytica.  It raises a bigger question for us in Ireland, given that Facebook has its headquarters here, as to how we may regulate Facebook and other such companies to ensure there is adequate protection for personal data.  The Data Protection Bill is before us tomorrow, and the Minister has indicated he will be moving certain amendments to that Bill in light of those revelations, but I would ask that in the near future we have a more broad debate over how best to resource and empower our own Data Protection Commissioner to ensure adequate regulation.  This started many years ago with the case of Max Schrems.  It was an Irish case which lead to a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice, effectively preventing Facebook from misusing data, but we are still seeing the repercussions of such misuse.  Again, there are real concerns about how this might play out in a referendum campaign.  I will ask the Leader for that debate in due course.</p></speech>

I went into the Dining Hall on the second day of the occupation and I felt very proud to see the majority of my campaign team who helped get me into that presidential office occupying the room.  They were accompanied by the students from Fossil-Free TCD, and also Students Against Fees, which are campaigns which emerged during my presidency, so I was very proud to see them all join together in a joint effort to protest the commercialisation of education and other issues.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of social welfare inspectors and the overstepping of the mark in terms of when they knock on a person's door, especially the doors of lone parents.  Perhaps this is more suitable for a Commencement matter.  I thought this practice had ended years ago, but I spoke to a few mothers over the last few weeks who have had social welfare inspectors visit them who then searched their wardrobes and presses, looking for any sign that another person is living in the house.  This must be an invasion of privacy, and there have to be rules and regulations against this type of searching.  Single parents are already living below their means.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They may already feel helpless and unable to stand up for themselves against social welfare inspectors because they believe that social welfare inspectors must have the right to go through their wardrobes.  This practice has to stop and we need to trust single parents.  One has to be able to refuse a request to go through one's drawers.  I wish to ask the Minister and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection whether this is accepted practice.  Are there guidelines in place?  Do social welfare inspectors decide to do this or are they instructed by the Department to go through people's belongings and their private space?</p></speech>

I was there when we won it in 2009 but I was watching it on the streets of Limerick when it happened this year.  It was wonderful to see a Limerick man presenting the trophy to the team and we had two Limerick players on the team, Keith Earls and Conor Murray, whom I congratulate on being short-listed for player of the year.  I also congratulate the team in general and it was a great weekend for Ireland.  Cuala and Na Piarsaigh, a Limerick team and a Dublin team, also gave us value for money and will replay on a date to be fixed.</p> <p>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced during the week that a dual-diagnosis clinical programme will be set up for addiction and mental health, which is something I raised in the form of a Commencement matter on behalf of a family whose son had both mental health and addiction issues.  I have come across a couple of families with this problem and people have been falling between two stools in respect of help, being only able to get one type of assistance or another.  Now there will be a dual-diagnosis clinical programme, with a programme manager and a national clinical lead.  There will also be a literature review.  Can the Leader find out the timeline for the establishment of this programme?  Many families across Ireland would welcome it.</p></speech>

Two bombs, placed in bins, were exploded without warning by the Provisional IRA on Bridge Street, Warrington.  Three year old Johnathan Ball died at the scene, 12 year old Tim Parry died five days later from his injuries and 54 others were injured.  Nobody was ever prosecuted for these murders and this barbaric incident shocked our two islands.  It perhaps brought a renewed focus on peace.  I worked in London and then as a GP in Wales and when one said one was from Ireland, the atrocity of Warrington was often mentioned.</p> <p>Colin and Wendy Parry, the parents of 12 year old Tim Parry, established the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, which works nationally and internationally for peace and non-violent conflict resolution.  In 2000, on the seventh anniversary of the bombing, a peace centre was opened and I am sure people like Colin and Wendy Parry never imagined the tragedy visited upon them.  When violence and death arrived at their door, however, they chose to make a difference for others.  I salute them and every other victim who had the courage to stand up and say bombings never bring people together.</p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta.

The Good Friday Agreement will be 20 years old in a few weeks and it is timely that we should have a debate on it in the Seanad.  The agreement was overwhelmingly approved in two referendums in both parts of Ireland in May 1998, only the second time in a century that the people of Ireland voted on the same issue on the same day on their constitutional status, the first being the election of the first D&aacute;il in 1918.</p></speech>

If we are to be fair and if we are to be advocates for human rights, be it in Guantanamo Bay or anywhere, we must be consistent that human rights are fundamental to everybody and justice must prevail and that due course of action must prevail.  What was alleged to have happened to those men was nothing short of a disgrace.  I want to support the Government.  I particularly support the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, in the stand he has taken.  I would appeal to the Minister to meet the victims and their legal representatives within days because what happened was wrong and cannot be countenanced regardless of the political sensitivities.  In 2014, the Government agreed to have this case re-examined by the European Court of Human Rights but the court yesterday rejected those claims.  Speaking for myself, I abhor and hate violence on any side.  I advocate justice for all, regardless of their background, tradition, creed or political affiliation.  Our thoughts must be with the men who suffered these appalling violations against them as human beings.  I simply call for the Minister to meet these men and their legal representatives soon and for the Government to give serious consideration to appealing this decision to the Grand Chamber of the court.  This is about human rights.  It is about taking a stand, regardless of how long ago it happened, against the methods of torture of people in Northern Ireland.  Torture, no matter where and by whom, must stop.  I am conscious, as I stated earlier, of Guantanamo Bay, but all over the world, we as parliamentarians must take a stand and defend human rights and justice.  I acknowledge the work the Government, and Deputy Coveney, as Minister, has done and I ask that we in this House are kept informed as to progress.</p></speech>

It is proposing that free Wi-Fi would be available in public spaces and it has launched a new project where it is giving a &euro;15,000 voucher to local authorities or local districts to provide free Wi-Fi in public spaces, such as public health centres, community centres and even main streets.  It proposes there will be free Wi-Fi in towns.  It is a welcome initiative whereby approximately 8,000 local authority districts across the European Union will be connected up with free Wi-Fi in the next two years.  It is what we need to see more of.  I encourage local authorities to apply for this funding and to work with the towns, in particular, the chambers of commerce, in order that these projects can get off the ground.  It is a significant tranche of funding for an issue that is important for us.  In my part of the world, one would hope it would be another tool in our box regarding tourism and where we are going in promoting west Cork because if one can provide free Wi-Fi in towns such as Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Kinsale, one will have another tool along that Wild Atlantic Way, which will help everyone.  It is an important step.  It needs to be publicised but the local authorities now need to be proactive and need to apply for it.  The date set for this funding is 20 May and they must look for it now.  The sum of &euro;15,000 for free Wi-Fi in every town in Cork, Dublin, or even Ireland, is very significant.  It is there and it only needs to be applied for.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the local authorities work actively to ensure we get this infrastructure because the funding is there and it can benefit everyone.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody in the Chamber does not have family who fit that category. </p><p>However, one has to compare our approach to the undocumented Irish to our approach to those who come to this country seeking asylum.  A few years ago I was chairperson of the public service oversight committee.  The committee visited asylum seekers in the direct provision system throughout the State.  We went to disused family centres, hotels and buildings and saw families living in surroundings which were entirely inappropriate for their needs.  We listened to their stories and prepared a report.  I am pleased today that the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children have oversight of that system.  </p><p>I was horrified recently to learn that the Department of Justice and Equality intended to place 150 men, women and children seeking asylum in Lisdoonvarna in west Clare, a village which has a population of 300 outside the summer holiday season.  The asylum seekers will be housed in an old hotel in a rural area.  It is a great deal for the person who owns the hotel, and good luck to him or her.  It is a great bit of commerce, but it is completely inadequate, in particular for the children in the system.  The decision is completely unfair.  In the main, those who objected did so in the interests of the families who were going to be placed in an entirely inappropriate setting.</p><p>Some attempted to misrepresent those who objected as racist or whatever, but that was not the case.  They raised the same issues as those raised by our committee, namely, that 150 human beings, in particular children, from all parts of the world were being sent to a hotel in rural Ireland without the necessary amenities or community support.  How dare the Department of Justice and Equality make a decision like this without consulting asylum seekers and the local community.  I appeal to the Leader to stop the hypocrisy of talking about the undocumented Irish in America while treating asylum seekers, in particular children, in the manner in which we do in this country.  We need to sort out this issue.</p></speech>

It is long overdue.  A man whose wife has cancer spoke on RT&Eacute; recently.  Over a six-month period he paid &euro;1,000 in parking charges.  My local hospital in west Meath, Navan, charges &euro;4 for parking whether one is there for two minutes or two hours.  There is a simple solution to this.  If a person is not well over a long period of time and is staying in hospital, there should be no charge for parking for close family members.  It is as simple as that.  Some hospitals give free passes for certain cases, but this is not common knowledge and most patients and family members are not told about it.  They have to keep paying the charges and it is just not good enough.  I hope the Minister for Health can come before the House and provide us with a positive outcome.  The review is long overdue.</p> <p>There was a violent post office robbery last week in my constituency of Meath West.  I hope the staff get over their terrible ordeal.  The staff had to go back behind the counter and give out pensions and other entitlements.  Fair dues to them for doing that.  It is to be hoped that the brave man who tried to stop the robbers getting away recovers from his injury and the perpetrators are caught.  I congratulate the staff on reopening the post office and giving people their entitlements in such difficult times.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach very much for that information.  If this is a decision for the Committee for Procedure and Privileges then we will have time to discuss this matter.  I hope it will be a positive decision, otherwise there will be no excuse for anybody to complain about it.</p> <p>I also wish to raise the decision of the European Court of Human Rights that what happened to the hooded men was not torture.  Of course it was torture.  A blind bat could see that it was torture.  This is extremely important.  I do not refer to historical importance pertaining to the people involved in the case.  This is used as a precedent by other countries, including the United States of America, to justify extraordinary rendition and torture, including waterboarding.  This is where it leads.  We have to stand up.  The European Court of Human Rights is a creaky old body, and it does not like reopening cases.  It has to be pressurised into doing this and I urgently ask that the Minister appeals this matter.  It is essential that Ireland appeals this matter to the Grand Chamber.  We cannot permit torture, which this plainly was.  The European Court of Human Rights got it wrong.  It was reluctant to reopen this case.  It must do so in the name of humanity.  </p></speech>

It is an issue I have raised in this Chamber many times, and I refer to and compliment the work recently done by <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, which conducted a survey of GPs throughout the country to ascertain the extent of the problem.  The results of that survey showed that 64% of GPs surveyed have now closed their doors to new patients.  What does that mean?  In County Monaghan, in both Carrickmacross and Monaghan town, GPs have closed their doors to new patients completely.  I encountered a young couple who returned home with their two children to set up life again in County Monaghan.  They approached every GP in the town and none would take them on.  Where are these people meant to go?  I can only imagine how stressful that is with two young children.  They have now been told to approach doctors on call.  That is the only option available to them.  The doctor on call service is now so overwhelmed that it has capped the number of patients not registered with GPs who will be seen.  That cohort includes this family.  This is a very serious situation and it has been allowed to get worse under the Government's watch.  I ask the Leader to call the Minister for Health before the Seanad to advise Members and the people as to what he is doing to address this serious issue.</p><p>The reality is that if someone gets sick he or she cannot go to his or her GP.  Now we find that such people cannot go to a doctor on call service.  Where will they end up?  They will end up queueing, like everybody else, in accident and emergency departments.  It is simply not good enough.  Everyone knows that the GP is the first line of defence when someone gets sick.  We talk about promoting primary care in order that we have a properly functioning system that alleviates the problems in accident and emergency departments.  Here is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

What happened at the weekend falls far below the standard expected of anybody in elected office.  In recent years Mr. Austin Stack has been engaged in a long-running battle to find out what happened to his father.  As everybody knows, Deputy Adams facilitated a meeting in 2013, and he was taken to that meeting in a blacked-out van, which was ridiculous in 2013.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the time, Austin was told that the perpetrators of that attack on his father were still alive and they had been disciplined.  I use inverted commas - as youngster do - on the word "discipline" because if the discipline is anything like the discipline our colleague received at the weekend than I am not inspired.  Perhaps by way of making a proper apology to the Stack family for what happened at the weekend, our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the House and in the D&aacute;il might encourage their colleagues in the IRA to actually help the Stack family to find out exactly what happened to their father, and perhaps bring the perpetrators to justice?</p></speech>

The GP issue has been brought up with me regularly in Limerick also.  It is a real concern and is worthy of debate because perhaps we need to look to a new model of GP services delivery.</p><p>I wish to speak today about Liam O'Flynn.  It is important to remember Liam O'Flynn, who passed away last week.  He was particularly close to my heart because when we lived in England in the 1970s, the emigrant experience was much tougher for my parents back then and for people of that generation.  They would not get home to Ireland that often, maybe once a year if they were lucky.  The music of Liam O'Flynn, and especially on the first album <i>Prosperous</i>, by Christy Moore - which is a Planxty album in all but name - really spoke to those people and it resonated with that generation.  Like so many others, I followed Liam O'Flynn's career with huge admiration.  I was lucky enough to be at the Planxty reunion concert in 2004.  When the sound of Liam's uilleann pipes came soaring in at the beginning the huge cheer that went up from the audience was completely spontaneous.  It spoke of the huge admiration for the splendour of his work.  It is very important to mark the passing of this man.  Liam O'Flynn worked with Seamus Heaney and with Shaun Davey.  A piece of work by Liam O'Flynn is a song written by Shaun Davey called Winter's End.  It is from a 1993 album called <i>Out to An Other Side</i>and I contend that it is the most magnificent piece of music ever written.  It is important to commend the work of Liam O'Flynn and remember the great man who passed away last week.</p></speech>

This obviously helped with the election of President Trump.  Over the years we have talked of dirty tricks and underhand methods in elections but they are in the ha'penny place to what is happening now.  We need a debate on this issue with regard to bribes, ex-spies, dirty tricks and fake news.  We certainly need a debate to find out what exactly is happening with social media.  As we have discussed today, it is far from user-friendly and is being used to model human behaviour.  It could be used to undermine the democratic process in elections.</p> <p>Senator Gavan referred to the UK.  I was in the UK for most of the week.  I was in Cheltenham, in Twickenham and in the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  There is goodwill towards the Irish in the UK but we need to discuss Brexit.  It is looming large and if the United Kingdom leaves the EU it will have a huge impact on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>The Irish people in England and the Irish on the island of Ireland were united with the wonderful result last Saturday.  I am more of a soccer man than a rugby man but this year it is 30 years since Ireland beat England 1-0 in Stuttgart.  As with the uilleann pipes, Shaun Davey and Planxty, sport also gives the Irish people living in the UK a great sense of pride, nationalism and patriotism, without spilling any blood.  I believe the Cathaoirleach worked in the UK.</p></speech>

I am disappointed, however, that there seems to be no indication that the Pope will visit the North of Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would be regrettable if it is the case.</p><p>My main reason for raising this issue is to ask the Leader if he would indicate whether there is any proposal to invite Pope Francis to address both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a proposal that has been made in the past by Senator Norris and there was general acceptance and agreement that that should be the case.  It would be appropriate that the Pope, as the leader of hundreds of millions of Catholics throughout the world and head of the Vatican State, should be invited to address a meeting of both Houses.  I ask the Leader to indicate whether that is being considered.  If not, I propose that it should be considered and ask what process must we engage in to ensure that it happens.</p><p>On Senator Feighan's comments regarding Brexit, it is time that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came back to the House to give us an update on the situation pertaining to Brexit, which is changing on a day-to-day, week-to-week and month-to-month basis.  In recent weeks, we have heard indications from certain elements of the Conservative Government that perhaps a solution to the Border difficulties would be that people from the Republic of Ireland who intended to travel to the Six Counties would register their intention to do so.  As somebody who comes from a Border community, who was born and reared in that community and who saw at first hand the detrimental effect it had on that region, both economically and personally, I want to put it on the record of this House that I and the community from which I come have no intention of registering our intent to visit another part of our country.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to come before the House to provide an update on Brexit, especially as it pertains to the Border region.</p><p>Finally, I welcome those from St. Mogue's college in Bawnboy, County Cavan, who are visiting both Houses this afternoon.</p></speech>

He is a huge loss.  It is important that we give recognition to those who have made a major contribution in the promotion of Irish music over a long period.</p><p>I have raised with the Leader on a number of previous occasions my concerns regarding the issue of the GP contract.  I welcome that the Minister for Health has announced that the negotiations for a new contract are to start in April but I would hope that this is not another process <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The contract has been in place for over 40 years.  We need to progress the issue of how GPs are supported in the community and, as a result of their contribution, how they support people in communities and keep them out of hospital.  On the Commencement debate earlier, I raised the need to train and upskill people in the context of providing home care.  Likewise, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient number of GPs - working together with public health nurses, community nurses and those who provide home care -  to provide care in the community and keep as many as possible out of the hospital and nursing home systems.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Although it will not happen before Easter, I suggest that it might be timely to have a debate after Easter on community care and health care outside the hospital structure.  All of our focus has been on the hospital structure and the HSE.  It is something we should really consider doing.</p><p>In respect of priorities, I am concerned that staffing levels in the HSE have gone up by 11,000 in the last three years.  There is now nearly one new person in administration or management in the HSE for every general practitioner in the country.  That is a disproportionate growth in administration and management in the HSE.</p></speech>

We have a fine tradition in this country of inviting visiting Heads of State to address these Houses.  As he is the Head of the Vatican State, which we have long recognised, it would be appropriate that he be invited to address the joint Houses of the Oireachtas.  I join with Senator Wilson in asking the Leader to make the necessary inquiries as to how this could be set in train.</p> <p>I also support what the Senator has said about Brexit.  I do not think any of us would want to be getting involved in any paperwork and that we would frankly refuse to do so.  I think it is accepted by both sides, anyway, and indeed by the EU, that this will not happen.  Hopefully they will facilitate an all-encompassing trade agreement involving the entire EU and the UK.  They will not enter a customs union but they may call it something else, a customs partnership or whatever, and that would satisfy the matter, please God.  Some of us are going to spend Monday and Tuesday of next week in the so-called palace of Westminster, meeting committees of the Commons and the Lords.  We will be delighted to give the House an update when we return on Wednesday or Thursday.</p></speech>

It is also international Down's syndrome day.  It is a day to reflect on the joy that those good people bring into so many people's lives, the inspiration they are for so many.  It is also a day to reflect on our need to include them and people with disabilities generally more and more in our society.  We have had debates here during which we have probably all spoken from time to time about special needs, education and so on.  It is a good day to remember that we still have a long way to go towards genuine inclusion.</p> <p>I compliment people and companies in the private sector who make space within their workforce, sometimes quite visibly, for persons with Down's syndrome, who make a wonderful contribution.  I also pay tribute to those people, prominent and not so prominent, who do their best to make them more visible in our society.  I would encourage colleagues, if they have not already seen it, to look at a documentary called "A World Without Down's Syndrome?", produced by a woman called Sally Phillips a number of years ago.  Some Senators may know of Sally as an actress.  She featured in "Bridget Jones's Diary" and she set out to explore in an emotional but quite compelling way why it is that with increasing possibilities of screening, such children are being screened out in other jurisdictions, to the point where it is predicted that after a period of years children with Down's syndrome simply will not be born.  There is a lot of food for thought for us in that.  I would recommend to people to watch that particular documentary, produced by Sally and featuring her son, Olly.  It is really very compelling.</p> <p>Most of us have been called on to comment on what our colleague said on social media.  It is an embarrassing situation because the person making that call, Austin Stack, is somebody who needs to be heard.  He is an important voice for the justice that is due to his family over what happened to his father.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, it would be wrong of us to engage in a kind of an embarrassed collegiality and just pipe down.  Equally, it would be wrong for us to engage in the business of virtue signalling, which goes on a lot in politics these days where we want to show how well behaved we are.  Senator Devine has already apologised but I would like her to have the space to do so in this House as well.  I have always believed that a culture of allowing people to up their game and learn from their mistakes, and let us face the fact that we all make mistakes, is better than a culture of calling for heads to roll.  The reconciliation, apology or amends must be sincere and for too long there has been tribalism in politics where people say they embrace new politics but fall back to embracing oppositionalism and hostility.</p></speech>

It seems to concern bots which seems to be where robots imitate human beings.  Perhaps when it comes to social media we need to avoid the phenomenon of human beings acting like robots, in other words robotically getting into a language, and I am not just talking about the particular incident I have mentioned.  There is too much abuse, negativity and nastiness in social media and that is why some of us are pulling away from using social media, to a certain extent.  Let us, as politicians, given the privileged position that we enjoy, give a lead in the responsible use of social media and point the finger at ourselves as much as we might be tempted to point it at others.</p></speech>

I have attended matches in Twickenham a good few times but, unfortunately, the result mostly went the wrong way.  The people of west Cork have a huge claim to Tadhg Furlong who wore the No. 3 jersey because his mother comes from Whiddy Island.  The people of west Cork are very proud of him.  His number one supporter is his grandmother, Mrs. Noreen O'Leary, who still lives on Whiddy Island.  She is a lovely lady and I have often had the good fortune to visit her house for a cup of tea.  When I go to these matches, although it is not often, I always claim that a man from Bantry or Whiddy Island - where only 20 people now reside - is on the front row of the Irish team.  His mother took up a teaching job in south Wexford and I am sure his father, James Furlong, will have a different claim.  I have been very fortunate to have met him on a few occasions and they are lovely people.  This was a great and uplifting occasion for the country.  I felt that I had to make those remarks.</p> <p>In terms of No. 5, Private Members' business, Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill 2016, can the Leader clarify whether the Order for Committee Stage and Committee Stage will be taken together?  </p></speech>

I thank the 20 Members of the House for their contributions on the Order of Business.  I begin by joining with all of the Senators in congratulating the Irish rugby team on their magnificent success on Saturday.  The occasion brought great joy and celebrations to us as a people.  I also congratulate Rory Best and commend Joe Schmidt on their leadership and tremendous success in winning the Grand Slam, in particular winning in Twickenham on St. Patrick's Day.  I thank all of the supporters, clubs, mentors and family members who supported or assisted all of these players to reach the pinnacle of their professional careers last weekend.</p> <p>I thank the Irish supporters for the way they celebrated and behaved during the course of St. Patrick's Day.  I commend all who organised and participated in the St. Patrick's Day parades that took place across the country.  It was a wonderful showcase for us, as a people.  It highlighted the importance of community, creativity and art in this country.  I join with Senators Gavan, Feighan, Coghlan and t&uacute; f&eacute;in, a Chathaoirleach, in paying tribute to and remembering the late Liam O'Flynn.  I wish to convey on my own behalf, and on behalf of the House, our sympathies to his family on his sad passing.</p> <p>I wish to refer to the contribution made by Senator Gavan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would love to have been at the Planxty reunion.  The evocative image Senator Gavan created this morning is something Liam O'Flynn did through his music, work and art.  I wish to be associated with the remarks on his sad passing.</p><p>Data protection was raised by Senators Ardagh, Bacik and Feighan, among others.  The misuse of personal data is both wrong and worrying.  The Data Protection Commissioner is having a meeting with representatives of Facebook.  It is important that we realise the significance of what has taken place with Cambridge Analytica and to commend all involved in unfurling this issue.  It is a cause of worry.  It is our personal data and data harvesting, whether is on Facebook or elsewhere, is wrong and cannot be condoned.  Whether it occurs in the United States, Ireland or the UK, we must be careful and cognisant of it.  I am sure part of the Minister's Bill tomorrow will address some of the issues involved.  However, we must be vigilant in how we use our information online and how we use online apps and information.  It is critical to ensure that what we do online is not given away.  I realise there are some who will use this as a stick with which to beat people but Facebook's European headquarters is in this country.  It has a duty to live up to its obligations and I hope it does so.  The Minister will be in the House tomorrow to discuss the Data Protection Bill and I hope he will address some of the significant issues mentioned in the House this morning.  However, it is a worry.  The trend has begun and I hope it can be curtailed and eliminated.  We have a precious democracy and our vote.  We do not have electronic voting but there is the ability to be influenced by online platforms, as we have seen in other jurisdictions.  I hope that cannot continue.</p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the sports capital funding.  For the record, 35 of the 149 appeals under the sports capital programme appeals process proved successful.  I am not familiar with the information the Senator gave this morning with regard to the school she mentioned, but schools are eligible to apply.  It is ironic that the Senator is complaining about the sports capital programme given that the party of which she is a member closed it down and deprived clubs and schools of the ability-----</p></speech>

Rather than playing one school against another, the sports capital programme is about investing in community, sporting and educational facilities.  There was an appeals process.  There were some clubs in my constituency that were unsuccessful.  I wish they had been successful.  It is important to understand the importance of the sports capital programme.  Many clubs, community groups, schools and facilities are celebrating the sports capital programme, having been awarded an allocation from it.</p></speech>

As regards the point made by Deputy Ardagh about Dublin 8 - to be fair, she has made it previously - I certainly hope that Dublin 8 would not be seen as a dumping ground for the issues the Senator raised.  The people of Dublin 8 and surrounding areas are fine people who invest in their community, promote it and have a great sense of community.  I will be happy to arrange that debate with the Minister in the House.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell, Conway-Walsh, McFadden and Mullen raised the tweet by Senator Devine.  In my political life I never call for a head or make a matter personal but it is fair to say that Senator Devine's actions were grave and catastrophic, to quote Deputy McDonald.  The response of Sinn F&eacute;in has been less than adequate, to be honest.  I will not get into a political row about this because that is not my style.  Brian Stack was killed.  He was a prison officer doing his job.  It is not like anything any other Member of the Oireachtas or politician retweets.  This man was killed and Austin Stack is seeking justice for his father and his family.</p></speech>

His life was cut short.  I agree with Senator Mullen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about ensuring that we allow Senator Devine the space to come to the House, if she so chooses, to make a comment.  In our online activity, none of us can support or retweet anything which is so uncaring in terms of what the Stack family is trying to do.  There is a duty on all of us, whether we are Independents, members of political parties or members of society, to be careful what we say, what we tweet or what we put online.  I have no time for cowards who hide behind anonymous Twitter handles and issue bile against all of us.  They have no place in a democracy.  As democrats, we go before the people and appear on television programmes or radio panels and are accountable.  The issue of keyboard warriors, who are cowards, needs to be addressed.  I hope Senator Devine will reflect on her position.  Other people have made comments but I have never been personal or sought someone's head in my political life.  We all have a duty to understand that this is not just any person, it was a prison officer who was murdered while doing his job.  His family deserve justice. </p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the Social Justice Ireland report.  I have not seen the report but I know Social Justice Ireland held a press conference earlier.  It is important to recognise that unemployment in decreasing and that more people are back at work, which means that people have more money in their pockets and that the level of poverty is decreasing.  I accept that we have a long way to go.  That is why, in a recovering economy, it is important to spend money on services and programmes which deliver for people.  It is also important to recognise that we have a finite amount of money to spend.  I would like someone to tell me why, given that we are spending over &euro;13 billion on health this year, people are still waiting on trolleys and, as Senator Colm Burke inquired, why there has been an increase in the numbers in management.  The fundamental structure of the HSE, which was created by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is wrong and unsound.  That is why the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published.</p><p>Senator Gallagher referred to GPs.  As Senator Colm Burke said, the talks with GPs begin now.  We should not procrastinate or allow the process to become an elongated discussion.  We need investment in primary care.  We need to get rid of the FEMPI legislation, which was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, and restore pay to doctors, nurses and those working in our health system.  That is why the all-party report on Sl&aacute;intecare was published.  It is extraordinary that we have inequalities and inadequacies in our health system at a time when we have the highest ever budget.  Something is not right.  In my opinion, it is the management structure of the HSE.  Senator Colm Burke is 100% correct.  We have too many managers and people walking around hospitals with clipboards and pens.  We need investment in real people.  I speak from experience in that regard.</p><p>I agree with Senator Bacik on the all-party motion on Syria.  I am endeavouring to have an all-party motion from the point of view of the Government, as she knows.</p><p>I join Senators Norris and Ruane in commending the students of Trinity College.  They raised the ridiculous decision to introduce a fee for students repeating exams before the St. Patrick's day break.  As I said, students are vulnerable and under stress.  The decision was wrong and I welcome the talks and intervention by the student body.  It is always important to have a good student body.  Senator Ruane was a member of the student body when she attended Trinity College.  It is important that students' unions recognise that they have power, legitimacy and a mandate from their peers to negotiate on their behalf.</p><p>I hope the referendum Bill goes through the D&aacute;il today and tomorrow.  As we discussed at the leaders' meeting last week, I hope to have the Bill in the House next week and to conclude the debate on it by Easter in order that we can allow for the establishment of the Referendum Commission.  All Senators should allow for our deliberations on the Bill to be concluded before the Easter recess.</p><p>Senator Ruane referred to social welfare inspections.  I am not familiar with the issue she raised.  We have always had social welfare inspections but there is a need for decorum and due process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Equally, there are people who are abusing the system who need to be held to account.  I agree with the Senator that there is a balance we can strike in this regard.</p><p>Senator Byrne asked when the dual-diagnosis clinical programme for addiction and mental health announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will be established.  I will endeavour to have that information provided to the Senator.  </p><p>One the eve of the anniversary of the Warrington bombing, I join Senator Swanick in paying tribute to Colin and Wendy Parry on their bravery and courage and in remembering Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, who were killed in that bombing.  We all remember the effect it had on us and so many people around the world.  The Senator is right to praise and commend them on their bravery.  </p><p>It is my intention to have a discussion on the Good Friday Agreement post Easter.  I will endeavour to have that debate the first week after the Easter recess.  We had hoped to take statements on issues pertaining to Brexit related to the North but owing to changes to the Minister's schedule, we will have to rearrange the taking of that debate.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan's contributions are, in the majority of cases, profound.  His commentary this morning regarding the rejection by the European Court of Human Rights of the Government's case around the so-called hooded men is baffling.  Those men were tortured by the British army and the RUC and their human rights were denied.  Irrespective of who they are, they are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity.  I agree with the Senator that human rights are applicable to everybody.</p></speech>

It is important that all local authorities, the Government and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, get on board with this programme.  Yesterday, President Juncker spoke about connectivity in every village and city by 2020.  I hope that we can do that.  </p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of asylum seekers in Lisdoonvarna.  All of us accept that we have a duty to take in refugees and to make them welcome here.  I am not familiar with the details of the case in Lisdoonvarna but I am certain that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, as a former Chairman of the justice committee and a person with huge interest in this area is working with the Department on this issue.  The Senator might get a speedier response were he to table a Commencement matter on the issue.  All of us recognise that we must people who come to our country with respect and dignity and that is what, I am sure, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is endeavouring to do in this case.  As I said, I am not familiar with the case.</p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of hospital parking charges.  I congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on being the first Minister to examine the issue of hospital parking charges.  To be fair, Senator Noone raised the matter here long the current furore about it.  It is important that there is recognition of the reason family members visit hospitals.  Some hospitals provide a voucher to the families of people who are in cancer treatment.  It is important to acknowledge that the review is under way.  </p> <p>I join with Senator Butler in congratulating the staff in the Athboy post office on their decision to return to work immediately and in wishing the innocent member of the public well in his recovery.  </p> <p>Senator Norris also raised the issue of European Court of Human Rights decision.  The other matter raised by the Senator is one for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  </p> <p>Senators Gallagher and Burke raised the issue of general practitioners, who play a critical role in our health system.  It is important that a new GP contract is signed immediately.  We also need an increase in capacity and to bring about reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Gallagher has become a little absent-minded in his outlook in life in respect of his contributions on the Order of Business of late.  He is coming to the Chamber with rose-tinted glasses.  He should look upon the FEMPI cuts imposed by his own party and the way in which they decimated the health system when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  Now we are seeing an increase in the number of training places and a recruitment campaign.  However, I recognise that we have a way to go and should see a reversal of FEMPI and pay restoration for our GPs, who are at the vanguard of what is done in the health system.  Primary care is important, and it is important, as I said earlier, that the talks, including the contract talks, begin immediately and do not become an prolonged talking shop.  Our GPs deserve pay restoration and improved pay and conditions.  If we are to give due recognition to reform in our health system, our GPs must be part of that and we need that done immediately.</p></speech>

It is important he is welcomed into our country.  He is the Head of State of the Vatican and the head of the Catholic Church, the Pontiff.  I would very much support and welcome an address by him to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am very much of the view that we should facilitate that if his itinerary allows him to do so.  I also hope the organisers of the conference in Dublin will recognise the diversity of family units in our country.  It is not just husband and wife; there are also single mothers, members of the LGBT community, who are well able to raise their children, and widows and divorcees raising their children.  I therefore hope the idea of family is broadened as that would be inclusive and welcoming to everyone.</p> <p>I have addressed the issue Senator Colm Burke raised.  He is right about community health care.  We should have that debate also.</p> <p>Senators Feighan and Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit and the significance of the talks next Friday.  I wish our Taoiseach, our T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, every success in them.  From our perspective, an Irish perspective, the Government and the Taoiseach next Friday will determine what happens and decide if enough progress is being made, but the important point for us is that nothing is agreed in respect of Brexit until everything is agreed.  The backstop is, as the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have said, as legally firm as the Government said it would be in December.  The decision by the UK and Europe is one on which we need to see further talks and negotiations.  Where Senator Wilson and I agree completely is that, as Senator Coghlan said, no one wants to see, and no one will countenance, having to apply to travel north of the Border in our own country or to have-----</p></speech>

There is a duty on all of us to ensure they are included in society.  It is also important that anyone having a discussion about men and women with Down's syndrome recognise that they are human beings who are well capable of thinking, articulating and advocating on their own behalf.  We should celebrate them and rejoice with them.  Equally, it is important they are not used as pawns in any debate that takes place in our society or in any campaign by anyone because they are not pawns to be put on billboards.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are men and women deserving of treatment-----</p></speech>

Aoi speisialta at&aacute; ann, anseo linn inniu faoi fhor&aacute;lacha Bhuan-Orduithe an tSeanaid.  Tugann na for&aacute;lacha sin deis d&uacute;inn cuireadh a thairgeadh do dhaoine a bhfuil obair mh&oacute;r d&eacute;anta acu i r&eacute;imse an tsaoil phoibl&iacute; agus an tsaoil chathartha chun aitheasc speisialta a thabhairt don Teach.  Theastaigh uainn Bliain na Gaeilge a chom&oacute;radh agus a ch&eacute;ili&uacute;radh agus ba dheacair duine n&iacute;os oiri&uacute;na&iacute; a roghn&uacute; don &oacute;c&aacute;id seo n&aacute; M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.</p> <p>Is duine &eacute; an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh a bhfuil an-aithne air i ngach contae agus ag gach crosbh&oacute;thar in &Eacute;irinn mar thoradh ar na blianta a chaith s&eacute; ag craoladh &oacute; Ph&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh agus go leor &aacute;iteanna eile faoin&aacute;r gcluich&iacute; n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  Agus &eacute; ina chraolt&oacute;ir den scoth, thug an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh an Ghaeilge d&iacute;reach isteach i ngach teaghlach in &Eacute;irinn agus chuig na m&iacute;lte &Eacute;ireannach at&aacute; scaipthe ar fud an domhain.</p> <p>N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in gur sheas an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh amach mar gheall ar an st&iacute;l chraolach&aacute;in speisialta a bh&iacute; aige agus an saineolas at&aacute; aige ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; peile agus iom&aacute;na, ba &eacute; freisin an modh inar n&oacute;s leis an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id, &iacute; fite fuaite leis an mB&eacute;arla, blas bre&aacute; Chiarra&iacute; le clos, chun sc&eacute;alta na gcluich&iacute; a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.

The evident goodwill that so many of our people have towards the language needs to be harnessed and their use of an Ghaeilge encouraged.  I hope that the presence of M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh here today, with the popular approach to the language which was the hallmark of his broadcasting style, will help to remind people that the language can be accessible and inspirational at the same time.</p> <p>Sula leanfaimid ar aghaidh, ba mhaith liom &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh a mhol d&uacute;inn an &oacute;c&aacute;id seo a eagr&uacute; agus a rinne go leor oibre chun an &oacute;c&aacute;id a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.

T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam labhairt faoin tionchar sin, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, a bh&iacute; ag an stair.  Bh&iacute;omar go l&eacute;ir imithe i dtaith&iacute; ar Sheachtain na Gaeilge i rith na mblianta when it was suggested to people to use whatever Gaeilge they had during that special week.  Mar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; ionann agus bheith r&eacute;abhl&oacute;ideach, revolutionary even to brand 2018 as Bliain na Gaeilge.

The sincerity must come from the top down ag tosn&uacute; anseo i dTeach Laighean, mar a bhfuil D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann agus Seanad &Eacute;ireann lonnaithe.  Nach bre&aacute; an spreagadh a bheadh ann do phobal na Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re agus d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d go bhfuil b&aacute; acu leis an teanga d&aacute; mbeadh Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag cuid mhaith dos na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la agus Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;?  It would encourage the people of Ireland who want Irish to survive if a greater number of Deputies and Senators were fluent in the Irish language.</p><p>Beidh cuimhne agam go deo ar chl&aacute;r teilif&iacute;se a craoladh le linn feachtas toghch&aacute;in D&aacute;la na bliana 2011.  During the 2011 general election campaign, bh&iacute; ceannair&iacute; na bp&aacute;irtithe ar fad faoi agallamh tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge ar TG4.  Bh&iacute; an ceathrar, an Teachta &Eacute;anna &Oacute; Coinnigh, an Teachta Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; M&aacute;irt&iacute;n, an Teachta Gear&oacute;id Mac &Aacute;dhaimh agus an iar-Theachta &Eacute;amon Mac Giollam&oacute;ir, ar a suaimhneas ag pl&eacute; na gceisteanna, na polasaithe agus mar sin de.  All the party leaders were perfectly at ease debating the affairs of the election in the national language ar an gcl&aacute;r seo a bh&iacute; ar TG4 sa bhliain 2011.  Maybe this will be expected of future leaders as time moves onwards.  N&iacute; nach ionadh go raibh pobal na Gaeilge br&oacute;d&uacute;il as an gcl&aacute;r teilif&iacute;se sin.  Bhaineadar taitneamh agus s&aacute;samh as agus thug s&eacute; misneach d&oacute;ibh.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfeicimid a leith&eacute;id go luath ar&iacute;s, maybe during the next general election campaign.  It is a question of whether the leaders of the moment will be ready.  I hear that one leader is already in training for it.  Tarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; m&aacute; bh&iacute;onn an toil ann.  If the will is there to do it, it will happen.  It will put very little strain on the national resources.</p><p>Projects and schemes that have been prepared or are about to be prepared by organisations in the wide-ranging cultural wing will need financial support if we want to drift with the renewed interest in language, etc.  As I see it, language is by far the most significant element in our culture.  Creidim go bhfuil s&oacute;rt &Eacute;ire nua againn faoi l&aacute;thair agus gur athr&uacute; meoin is m&oacute; at&aacute; &aacute; spreagadh.  T&aacute; an ghl&uacute;in &oacute;g agus roinnt mhaith de dhaoine beag&aacute;in&iacute;n n&iacute;os sine n&aacute; iad l&aacute;rnach san &Eacute;ire nua seo.  Is deisceabail iad agus is s&aacute;rchomhartha d&oacute;chais d&uacute;inn go l&eacute;ir &eacute; sin.  The new Ireland I see is of relatively recent birth.  It is accepted that the gradual decay of the use of Irish as a spoken language began in the cities and towns of eastern Ireland many years ago.  There is no need to list the causes right now, but the wheel turns if it is given time.  Eastern Ireland is now foremost in embracing a good deal of what we call Irish heritage.  For example, t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; imreoir&iacute; le Gaeilge labhartha le f&aacute;il iontu ar fhoirne Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  There are more people with fluent Irish on Dublin teams of all grades nowadays than there are on the teams of any other county outside the Gaeltacht counties.</p><p>A strong leaning towards Irish heritage is evident in most of the country and in many places overseas, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r i gc&aacute;s ceol agus rince.  T&aacute; teanga na Gaeilge chun deiridh sa r&aacute;s forbartha leis na heala&iacute;ona.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r a thuiscint gur moille forbairt ar theanga n&aacute; na cinn eile.  Is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go bhfuil na cathracha agus bailte ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don sc&eacute;im seo anois.  Is maith an m&uacute;inteoir &iacute; an stair.  Tuigimid go l&eacute;ir go raibh muintir na h&Eacute;ireann scriosta br&uacute;ite tar &eacute;is an Ghorta Mh&oacute;ir, the devastating Famine of the 1840s.  Mar a d&eacute;arfadh Peig Sayers, bh&iacute; spiorad na ndaoine le cos amh&aacute;in san uaigh agus an chos eile ar a bhruach.  The spirit of the people had one foot in the grave and the other on the brink.  That was the measure of the people&rsquo;s spirit in the post-Famine period.  N&iacute;or fhollas d&oacute;chas i m&oacute;r&aacute;n &aacute;iteacha.  Efforts were made to rekindle the spirit.  I refer, for instance, to the Fenian movement and to the agitation among tenant farmers for freedom from the power of landlords.</p><p>I mo thuairim, tharla eachtra sa bhliain 1876 a chur s&iacute;olta as ar th&aacute;inig pr&eacute;amhacha athbheochana, agus at&aacute; l&aacute;rnach i stair na t&iacute;re.  Sa bhliain sin, buna&iacute;odh an Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language&rsquo;.  This vibrant society attracted the attention of many people, including Michael Cusack, an fear a bhunaigh an GAA ocht mbliana n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Ba mh&oacute; go m&oacute;r suim an Ch&iacute;os&oacute;gaigh sa Ghaeilge roimhe sin.  Cainteoir d&uacute;chais Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; Chontae an Chl&aacute;ir.  D&uacute;irt Dubhghlas de h&Iacute;de, fear eile a bh&iacute; sa chumann a buna&iacute;odh in 1876, gurb &eacute; M&iacute;che&aacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g an cainteoir Gaeilge is fearr a chuala s&eacute; riamh.  B&iacute;odh sin mar at&aacute; s&eacute;, ach is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; gur eascair a l&aacute;n gluaiseachta&iacute;, coist&iacute; agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; as an Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language.  Chuir s&eacute; daoine ag machnamh.  There is nothing like putting people thinking.  From the varied deliberations, it became clear that the state of Irish music, song, dance, sport and drama, etc. was poor and low.  It was almost close to extinction at that time.</p><p>It was timely for the seeds of preservation of the many facets of the old native traditions to be truly sown.  The results are relevant to us today as a vital part in defining who we are.  Th&aacute;inig an d&oacute;chas thar n-ais.  Buna&iacute;odh Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael n&oacute; an GAA sa bhliain 1884, Conradh na Gaeilge in 1893 agus Sinn F&eacute;in in 1903.  Several other movements began at this time.  All of them were geared at getting Ireland to be a better place.  Bh&iacute; an seanspiorad thar n-ais i muintir na h&Eacute;ireann.  Bh&iacute; &eacute;ileamh m&oacute;r ar chraobhacha de Chonradh na Gaeilge.  Chl&aacute;raigh daoine gan Ghaeilge agus lucht gn&oacute; leo.  Is &eacute; sin an m&iacute;ni&uacute; ar an gc&uacute;is gur i mB&eacute;arla a bh&iacute;odh miontuairisc&iacute; roinnt de chruinnithe chraobhacha an chonartha sna blianta tosaigh.  That the minutes of meetings of the Gaelic League in many places were written in English suggests that people with little or no Irish were anxious to be part of the new confidence.  Is cos&uacute;il go raibh f&aacute;ilte roimh gach duine a th&aacute;inig thar thairseach isteach.</p><p>Ina ioml&aacute;ine, the last 25 years of the 1800s must be viewed as setting the scene for Ireland&rsquo;s future, with thoughts of freedom and self-government becoming more frequent as the years went on.  Bh&iacute; an spiorad i r&eacute;im ar&iacute;s, bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; linn &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; daoine cumasacha bainteach leis an Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute;, bh&iacute; M&iacute;che&aacute;l C&iacute;os&oacute;g, Dubhghlas de h&Iacute;de agus go leor eile gn&iacute;omhach ag m&uacute;ineadh ranganna Gaeilge in ionaid mar an Celtic Literary Society.  They were all active where action was needed.  M&uacute;scla&iacute;odh ar&iacute;s an tsuim a bh&iacute;odh i gceol na h&Eacute;ireann sna seanlaethanta nuair bh&iacute;odh na taoisigh Ghaelacha i gcumhacht agus p&aacute;tr&uacute;nacht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acu ar ghn&eacute;ithe a bhain leis an traidisi&uacute;n Gaelach.  Bh&iacute; an traidisi&uacute;n sin br&iacute;omhar agus foll&aacute;in agus mar a ch&eacute;ile leis na pr&eacute;amhacha eile de na seantraidisi&uacute;in, an sp&oacute;rt ina measc.</p><p>Ar shl&iacute; amh&aacute;in, t&aacute; s&eacute; ait go raibh sp&oacute;rt san &aacute;ireamh ag an am nuair a bh&iacute; na seantaoisigh ann, mar bh&iacute; bac ar dhaoine teacht le ch&eacute;ile chun sp&oacute;rt a eagr&uacute; de r&eacute;ir Acht a ritheadh 500 bliain roimhe sin agus n&aacute;r cuireadh ar ceal go dt&iacute; aimsir an Ghorta.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th n&aacute;r buna&iacute;odh aon chumann sp&oacute;irt in &Eacute;irinn go dt&iacute; gur th&aacute;inig na 1860&iacute; tar &eacute;is an Ghorta.  Bh&iacute; sp&oacute;rt ann d'ainneoin an dl&iacute;.  A very strange law that was passed in 1367 had made it illegal for any group of people to come together for the purpose of organising sport.  Chuirf&iacute; i bpr&iacute;os&uacute;n iad.  D&aacute; mbeadh an riail sin ann anois, bheadh a l&aacute;n agaibhse agus mise i bpr&iacute;os&uacute;n chomh maith.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, buille trom don chult&uacute;r a bh&iacute; ann nuair thit c&oacute;ras agus cumhacht na dtaoisigh Ghaelacha as a ch&eacute;ile tar &eacute;is Cath Cionn tS&aacute;ile na bliana 1603.  The defeat at the Battle of Kinsale dealt a deadly blow to Irish culture for a while.  The defeat of the Irish chieftains led to a road of decline for poetry, music, language and Irish heritage in general due to the lack of patronage from any source.  Is as sin a thuigtear an t&aacute;bhacht a bh&iacute; le gluaiseacht na hathbheochana sa bhliain 1876.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is as a th&aacute;inig na feiseanna a bh&iacute; go l&iacute;onmhar agus cosa curtha i dtalamh athuair ag na m&iacute;reanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la den dtraidisi&uacute;n.  I saol na linne seo, is l&eacute;as m&oacute;r d&oacute;chais &eacute; an fhorbairt at&aacute; tagtha ar oireachtas na Gaeilge le c&uacute;pla bliain anuas.  Is f&eacute;ile m&oacute;r &eacute; anois, go bhfuil aird ag pobal m&oacute;r ar le c&uacute;pla bliain.  Cad d&eacute;arfadh sibh le oireachtas breise i mbliain seo na Gaeilge agus an ceann seo amuigh faoin aer mar a bh&iacute;onn a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; na laethanta seo agus &eacute; a bheith amuigh faoin aer in aice le Teamhair na R&iacute;?  Cinnte go gcosn&oacute;dh s&eacute; roinnt airgid ach deireann Baill an Rialtas linn go bhfuil an eacnama&iacute;ocht ag treabhadh leis go maith agus c&aacute; bhfios n&aacute; go mbeadh deontas le f&aacute;il i gcomhair an oireachtas a thabhairt amach faoin aer.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go maith istigh i dtithe agus in &oacute;st&aacute;in agus sa halla&iacute; m&oacute;r ach is fearr f&oacute;s a bheadh s&eacute; anois agus ar&iacute;s amuigh faoin aer.<br/><br/>Creidim go l&aacute;idir i gcleachtadh na poibl&iacute;ochta agus nach cuid d&aacute;r n-oidhreacht &eacute;, nach duine d&aacute;r saoithe fad&oacute; a d&uacute;irt muna bhfuil agat ach poc&aacute;n gabhair, b&iacute; i l&aacute;r an aonaigh leis.  Even if you only have a puck goat for sale you should be in the middle of the market with it agus sin rud gur c&oacute;ir breis b&eacute;ime a chur air poibl&iacute;ochta an Gaeilge.<br/><br/>Leanaimis orainn anois i dtreo na linne seo agus b'fh&eacute;idir go bhf&eacute;adfaimis trusl&oacute;g fada a th&oacute;gaint &oacute; th&uacute;s na haoise seo caite go dt&iacute; an l&aacute; inniu.  Tuigim gur sa tr&eacute;imhse sin a tharla eachtra&iacute; m&oacute;ra i stair &aacute;r dt&iacute;re ag tosn&uacute; le r&eacute;iteach ar Chogadh na Tal&uacute;n le hAcht Wyndham 1903 a bh&iacute; i bhfad chun tosaigh ar Achtanna a chuaigh roimhe.  Bh&iacute; &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca sa tr&eacute;imhse sin, Cogadh na Saoirse agus Cogadh na gCarad sular buna&iacute;odh An Saorst&aacute;t.  The solution of the Land War and the events of the Rising of 1916, the War of Independence that followed agus an Cogadh Cathartha have all been well chronicled and they are familiar to the current young generations only in recent times.<br/><br/>I suggested earlier that they belong to a new Ireland.  &Eacute;ire nua ach conas ann d&oacute;?  How did it happen and why did it happen?  Athra&iacute;onn an saol de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile agus sin mar a bheidh go deo na ndeor.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go raibh tionchar an-mh&oacute;r ar fad ag an mbealach gur deineadh com&oacute;radh agus ceili&uacute;radh ar eachtra&iacute; &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach 1916 sa bhliain 2016.  Chuaigh an l&eacute;iri&uacute; agus an com&oacute;radh sin go m&oacute;r i bhfeidhm ar na daoine &oacute;ga agus daoine eile nach raibh eolach ar na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin roimhe sin.  Chuaigh an com&oacute;radh a bh&iacute; snadhmtha le ch&eacute;ile i bhfeidhm ar a l&aacute;n daoine agus thuigeadar don gc&eacute;ad uair an spiorad, an d&oacute;chas agus an &iacute;obairt a rinne daoine &oacute; gach p&aacute;irt in &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach 1916 agus na heachtra&iacute; ina dhiaidh.<br/><br/>Sin &eacute; an ghl&uacute;n nua.  D'fhoghlaim siad le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus t&aacute; siad fillte ar an nd&uacute;chas go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r na daoine &oacute;ga.  Is m&oacute; go m&oacute;r anois a meas agus a gr&aacute; ar thraidisi&uacute;in an chult&uacute;ir, n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; roimh 2016 agus gan amhras ar na daoine a bh&iacute; s&aacute;ite san iarracht chun an l&aacute; sin a thabhairt chun cinn, saoirse a fh&aacute;il agus an cult&uacute;r a choth&uacute;.<br/><br/>N&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh aon sampla amh&aacute;in a thabhairt agus is &eacute; P&aacute;draig Mac Piarais a roghna&iacute;m agus roghn&oacute;dh a l&aacute;n daoine &eacute;.  M&uacute;inteoir a bh&iacute; ann.  Bhunaigh s&eacute; Scoil &Eacute;anna i R&aacute;th Fhearn&aacute;in i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Bh&iacute; &eacute;ileamh ag tuismitheoir&iacute; ar an l&eacute;inn, an Ghaeilge teanga na scoile agus bh&iacute; b&eacute;im ar iom&aacute;int mar phr&iacute;omh sp&oacute;rt na scoile.  Bh&iacute; baint ag P&aacute;draig le heagr&uacute; com&oacute;rtais&iacute; sp&oacute;irt do na scoileanna i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  Chuir s&eacute; f&eacute;in com&oacute;rtas ar si&uacute;l.  File ab ea &eacute; agus eagarth&oacute;ir <i>An Claidheamh Soluis</i>, the sword of light, the promotional organ of Conradh na Gaeilge.  B'shin &eacute; an sort duine a bh&iacute; ann agus t&aacute; cuma ar an sc&eacute;al gur fear &eacute; a bh&iacute; thar a bheith gn&oacute;thach leis na c&uacute;raim&iacute; sin go l&eacute;ir ach bh&iacute; f&iacute;s aige.

Narbh fhi&uacute; go m&oacute;r saineolaithe a ghairm le ch&eacute;ile ag an Rialtas go luath i mbliain na Gaeilge chun teacht ar sc&eacute;im.  A scheme that would give an injection of energy and invention to the giant which is our native language.  That language is calling for extra support agus ba ch&oacute;ir go dtiocfadh s&eacute; &oacute;n Rialtas.<br/><br/>Tugaim an meon nua faoi ndeara nuair a bh&iacute;m ag spaisteoireacht ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Labhrann a l&aacute;n daoine Gaeilge liom agus is l&eacute;ir go mb&iacute;onn fonn orthu sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is l&eacute;ir dom go bhfuil m&eacute;ad&uacute; m&oacute;r tagtha ar an l&iacute;on daoine go bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as nuair a bh&iacute;onn an deis acu.  Is bre&aacute; liom casadh leis na daoine sin.<br/><br/>In a gc&aacute;s, n&iacute; m&oacute;r creidi&uacute;nt a thabhairt do thuismitheoir&iacute; agus don gc&oacute;ras oideachais &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de a thug misneach, tuiscint agus moth&uacute; t&aacute;bhachta d&oacute;ibh.  Mar a tharla c&eacute;ad bliain roimhe sin, th&aacute;inig eagra&iacute;ocht nua isteach i r&eacute;imse an oideachais go luath i seacht&oacute;id&iacute; na haoise seo caite, Gaelscoileanna.  Ar&iacute;s, n&iacute; m&oacute;r dul siar sa stair.  Rinne an Rialtas a th&aacute;inig i gcumhacht tar &eacute;is bun&uacute; an St&aacute;it iarracht f&oacute;nta lena chinnti&uacute; go mbeadh f&aacute;il ag na bunscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re go l&eacute;ir ar mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; go mbeadh togha na Gaeilge acu.  Buna&iacute;odh col&aacute;ist&iacute; ullmh&uacute;ch&aacute;in, col&aacute;ist&iacute; c&oacute;naithe in ionaid eags&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r.  Cuid acu do bhuachaill&iacute; agus scar eile do chail&iacute;n&iacute; den aois ghr&uacute;pa a bheadh ag freastal ar oideachas dara leibh&eacute;al.  De bhunadh na nGaeltachta&iacute; a bhformh&oacute;r, ach th&aacute;inig daoine &oacute; chontaetha eile chomh maith.  Gaeilge gn&aacute;th theanga na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; sin agus deineadh an m&uacute;ineadh ar fad tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.<br/><br/>Tar &eacute;is dh&aacute; bhliain a chaitheamh i gcol&aacute;iste oili&uacute;na ina dhiaidh sin, chiallaigh s&eacute; go raibh sruth de mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; go raibh togha na Gaeilge acu ar f&aacute;il chun dul ag m&uacute;ineadh ins na bunscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re ar fad.  T&uacute;s maith a bh&iacute; ann cinnte ag an Rialtas nua.  I l&aacute;r na 20&iacute; a buna&iacute;odh na col&aacute;ist&iacute; ullmh&uacute;ch&aacute;in sin ach nach bhfuil s&eacute; r&aacute;ite nach mb&iacute;onn i ngach aon rud ach seal agus cuireadh deireadh leo go luath ins na 1970&iacute;.<br/><br/>Ag an am bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n scoileanna dara leibh&eacute;al ag teagasc tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re agus baisteadh A scoileanna orthu si&uacute;d.  Th&aacute;inig laghd&uacute; de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile ar l&iacute;on na scoileanna sin agus ar an l&iacute;on a bh&iacute; ag teagasc tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge ins na bunscoileanna freisin.  I dt&uacute;s na 1970&iacute; den aois seo caite, n&iacute; raibh ach ceithre scoil d&eacute;ag lasmuigh de na Gaeltachta&iacute; ag teagasc tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus b'shin g&eacute;arch&eacute;im m&aacute; bh&iacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann riamh.<br/><br/>&Oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de, buna&iacute;odh eagra&iacute;ocht Gaelscoileanna agus &eacute; de mhian acu go mbeadh oideachas ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh b&eacute;im ar gach aon ch&eacute;im de cult&uacute;r na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna sin.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; n&iacute; raibh ach seacht scoil sa t&iacute;r ioml&aacute;n ag an am a bh&iacute; ag teagasc tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge ach d'&eacute;irigh go seoigh le gluaiseacht na nGaeilscoileanna agus na Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; dara leibh&eacute;al at&aacute; ar fud na t&iacute;re anois agus t&aacute; rath orthu.  Is foll&aacute;in &eacute; go bhfuil rogha ag tuismitheoir&iacute; oideachas tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge a bheith ar f&aacute;il chomh maith le scileanna tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla a deintear an teagasc go l&eacute;ir.  It is of the utmost importance that parents have a choice of having their children taught through the medium of either Irish or English agus glacann gach aon duine leis sin anois.<br/><br/>Sula rachaidh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; c&uacute;pla pointe breise, teasta&iacute;onn uaim sampla amh&aacute;in a thabhairt den &eacute;ifeacht a bh&iacute; i bP&aacute;draig Mac Piarais chun daoine go raibh f&iacute;s acu f&eacute;in teacht go dt&iacute; Scoil &Eacute;inne.  An ainm a luafidh m&eacute; n&aacute;, duine darbh ainm Proinsias De B&uacute;rca.  Bh&iacute; aithne agam ar Phroinsias De B&uacute;rca, fear go raibh an-aithne aige ar Ph&aacute;draig Mac Piarais.  Rugadh &eacute; i gContae Chill Dara ach d'aistrigh an clann go dt&iacute; R&aacute;th Fhearn&aacute;in go luath ins na 1990&iacute;, 1990, bliain n&oacute; dh&oacute; ina dhiadh sin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Cuireadh &eacute; go dt&iacute; scoil ch&oacute;naithe dara leibh&eacute;al th&iacute;os i gCeatharlach.

N&iacute; raibh aon dul as aige ach cruic&eacute;ad a imirt.  Ach ar &aacute;mhara&iacute; an tsaoil, mar a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; f&eacute;in liom nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa bhaile ar saoire an samhradh ina dhiadh sin, do chonaic s&eacute; f&oacute;gra i bhfuinneog siopa i R&aacute;th Fhearn&aacute;in i dtaobh scoil an Phiarsaigh.

D'fhill s&eacute; ar an gcol&aacute;iste mar mh&uacute;inteoir.  Ghlac s&eacute; p&aacute;irt san &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa GPO sa bhliain 1916 agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; i ng&eacute;ibheann ina dhiadh sin.

T&aacute; an &oacute;ige go maith agus t&aacute; n&oacute;s acu anois a bheith gafa leis na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide.  Is d&oacute;igh liom gur ch&oacute;ir b&eacute;im n&iacute;os m&oacute; a chur leis sin - le teaghmh&aacute;il idir na scoileanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.

T&oacute;gadh m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh ar an raidi&oacute; gach Domhnach.  T&aacute; guth &aacute;lainn suaimhneach aige agus lean a ghuth gach clann, mo chlann fein san &aacute;ireamh, timpeall na t&iacute;re.  Bhaineamar go l&eacute;ir an-sult agus an-taitneamh as ar feadh a ghairme ar fad.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis chomh maith as ucht an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige maidir le feabhs&uacute; agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, go h&aacute;irithe tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n an sp&oacute;irt, le 60 bliain anuas.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as an l&aacute; seo a r&eacute;iteach.  Is Seanad&oacute;ir den scoth &eacute; agus t&aacute; s&eacute; an-phaiseanta maidir le cur chun cinn agus feabhs&uacute; na Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r.</p> <p>Maidir le Bliain na Gaeilge, t&aacute; s&eacute; ar cheann de chusp&oacute;ir&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il &oacute; thr&aacute;th a bhunaithe an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine agus cearta na ndaoine a labhra&iacute;onn an teanga a chosaint.  Is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn cinnteacht i bhfad n&iacute;os dearfa&iacute; a chur ar fail &oacute; thaobh polasaithe f&aacute;dt&eacute;armacha don Ghaeilge.  Caithfear deireadh a chur leis an &eacute;iginnteacht a tharla&iacute;onn mar gheall ar an ng&aacute; a bh&iacute;onn ann go rialta le troid i gcoinne iarrachta&iacute; st&aacute;das a bhaint &oacute;n teanga.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh meas ag gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; ar an nGaeilge mar ghne &eacute;igeantach den scola&iacute;ocht agus mar &aacute;bhar pr&iacute;omhth&aacute;bhachtach sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; i gcoitinne.  Nuair is g&aacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh go rialta ag amanna toghch&aacute;in, treis&iacute;tear leis an tuiscint go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; athr&uacute; a theacht air sin.  Cuirtear an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht f&eacute;in as a riocht nuair a chuirtear c&uacute;is na teanga i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar an gcosaint.  Ba mh&oacute;r an ch&eacute;im chun tosaigh a bheadh ann d&aacute; n-aont&oacute;dh na p&aacute;irtithe go l&eacute;ir gur cheist sin nach bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; &iacute; a chur ar chl&aacute;r d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta a thuilleadh.</p> <p>Nuair a sheol an Teachta &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge ba &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad uair go n-aontaigh rialtas ar bith cur chuige cumasach f&aacute;dt&eacute;armach maidir le forbairt na teanga.  Is n&iacute; aithiseach gur bhr&uacute;dh go leor de phr&iacute;omhghn&eacute;ithe na strait&eacute;ise de leataobh leis an neamhaird ar fhorbairt phobail agus leis an s&eacute;anadh, le seacht mbliana anuas, Aire sinsearach Rialtais a cheapadh ar a mbeadh c&uacute;ram pearsanta maidir leis an r&eacute;imse sin.  Cuireadh cuid mh&oacute;r smaointe iontacha i l&aacute;thair le linn an phr&oacute;isis comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in don strait&eacute;is sin agus n&iacute;or dhearcadh orthu &oacute; shin.  Mar a tharla&iacute;onn le r&eacute;ims&iacute; eile chomh maith, is &eacute; an teip seo pleananna a chur i bhfeidhm an rud is tromch&uacute;is&iacute;.  Is &eacute; mo thuairimse gur ch&oacute;ir c&uacute;ram pearsanta maidir leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht a leagan ar Aire sinsearach agus gur ch&oacute;ir don Aire sin ceannr&oacute;da&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh ina leith.  T&aacute; an deis ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; maidir le teanga na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; &eacute;ileamh m&oacute;r i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ar an nGaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais agus seasann cuid mh&oacute;r den phobal le bearta c&uacute;nta a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an nGaeilge mar chuid de ghn&aacute;thshaol, den gcult&uacute;r agus den saol poibl&iacute;.</p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  Ceapaim gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn club Gaeilge a bhun&uacute; anseo i dTeach Laighean.  Is smaoineamh iontach &eacute; seo.</p></speech>

B'fh&eacute;idir go labhr&oacute;imid faoi sin n&iacute;os deireana&iacute;, go dtos&oacute;imid air sin d&iacute;reach anseo sa bhliain seo.  Freisin, a Chathaoirligh, roinn m&eacute; mo chuid ama le mo chara agus mo chomhghleaca&iacute; as T&iacute;r Chonaill, an Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, agus beidh me c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad n&oacute; mar sin uilig ag labhairt.  Meabhraigh dom le do thoil tar &eacute;is c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.  <br/><br/>C&uacute;pla rud &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Rugadh is t&oacute;gadh mise sa Ghaeltacht i gConamara agus n&iacute; raibh aon airgead againn; bh&iacute;omar bocht.  Is &iacute; an Ghaeilge an ch&eacute;ad teanga.  B'&eacute;igean do m'athair dul go Sasana nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina lead &oacute;g.  Chas s&eacute; le mo mh&aacute;thair ann, is as Baile Conaola do mo mh&aacute;thair.  N&iacute; raibh aon Bh&eacute;arla ag m'athair.  Bh&iacute; air an B&eacute;arla a fhoghlaim.  Bh&iacute; seisean ag iarraidh go mbeadh c&uacute;pla focal B&eacute;arla ag chuile duine againn mar d&uacute;irt s&eacute; gurbh shin &eacute; an passport a bh&iacute; agat le dul thar s&aacute;ile le jab a bheith agat.  Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia t&aacute; an saol athraithe.  Ta meas m&oacute;r ar an nGaeilge anois.  T&aacute; thart ar 1.75 milli&uacute;n duine sa t&iacute;r seo a deir go labhra&iacute;onn siad an Ghaeilge, no go bhfuil roinnt Gaeilge acu.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag pl&eacute; le p&aacute;ip&eacute;ar Gaeilge, mar is cuimhin leat a Mhich&iacute;l, <i>Foinse</i>.  An bhfuil a fhios agat c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad l&eacute;itheoir sa tseachtain a bh&iacute; ag an bp&aacute;ip&eacute;ar sin: suas le 200,000 l&eacute;itheoir sa tseachtain ag an bp&aacute;ip&eacute;ar sin.  T&aacute; suim an-mh&oacute;r ag pobal na t&iacute;re seo sa Ghaeilge, agus c&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Mar feiceann siad gur &Eacute;ireannaigh iad, agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an cult&uacute;r sa teanga l&aacute;rnach maidir le c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt daoine muid f&eacute;in.  Our language is part of who we are.  It is an asset one cannot touch, one cannot feel it, it is like the air one breathes; it keeps one alive.  It keeps us energetic, it gives that uniqueness of what we are about.  Molaim an Taoiseach go l&aacute;idir nuair a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go mbeidh 2018 againn &oacute; thaobh Bliain na Gaeilge de.  Mar a d&uacute;irt t&uacute; a Mhich&iacute;l, is rud &eacute; seo nach bhfuil ann ach deireadh seachtaine L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig.  Is rud lean&uacute;nach a chaithfimid a choinne&aacute;il ag imeacht.  Is cuma liom, n&iacute; g&aacute; go mbeadh t&uacute; ar chuid mh&oacute;r Gaeilge.  M&aacute; ta c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge agat, t&aacute; s&eacute; sin chomh t&aacute;bhachtach c&eacute;anna le duine, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, n&oacute; le tusa a Mhich&iacute;l n&oacute; mise a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar &aacute;r dtoil againn.  <br/><br/>An fh&iacute;s a bheadh agam &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de, n&aacute; go mbeadh gach saor&aacute;nach sa t&iacute;r seo in ann an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id go feidhmi&uacute;il, go laeth&uacute;il m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag teast&aacute;il uathu.  What do we mean when we say that every Irish citizen can use the Irish language on a daily basis, if and when they so wish.  M&aacute; t&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh a gcuid gas&uacute;r a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge, do we mean go mbeadh siad in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh?  If they want to send their kids to an all-Irish language education school, or institute, they can do it, they should not be blocked from doing it.  Does it mean that we actually become serious, d&aacute;ir&iacute;re &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de?  Molaim Rialtais &eacute;ags&uacute;la, &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge ach t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; le dul againn.  Mar sine &iacute; an fh&iacute;s.  T&aacute; na f&iacute;ric&iacute; ag dul ar an taobh m&iacute;cheart.  Mar shampla sa daon&aacute;ireamh 2016, bh&iacute; 39% in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  T&aacute; laghd&uacute; ag teacht air sin &oacute; thaobh an phlean 2010 go 2030.  T&aacute; na cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais ag laghd&uacute;, cainteoir&iacute; na nGaeltachta&iacute;, is &eacute; sin tobar na Gaeilge: na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Caithfimid br&uacute; m&oacute;r a chur air sin agus b&eacute;im mh&oacute;r a chur ar na Gaeltachta&iacute;, rud nach bhfuil muid ag d&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; infheist&iacute;ocht &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta laghdaithe go seacht&uacute; faoin gc&eacute;ad le deich mbliana anuas.  <br/><br/>B'fh&eacute;idir gur tuairim &eacute; seo maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; gn&oacute; de.  If one wants to really do something and make a difference where does one start?  One starts from where one is at now.  One has to understand where one is now.  C&aacute; bhfuil m&eacute; anois?  Where do I want to go?  C&aacute; bhfuil m&eacute; ag iarraidh dul?  The strategy is the road one takes to get there.  I am asking that this vision be shared, that every Irish citizen would have the ability and possibility to actually use Irish as frequently as they want, particularly in dealing with State bodies.  If that is where one wants to get to, let us look at where we are at now.  Let us make sure we build the bridge together.  That is not political, that is for the people of Ireland to get there.  Miche&aacute;l, you have inspired us to actually start thinking and working in that direction.  <br/><br/>T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go dtabharfaimid taca&iacute;ocht d&aacute;r gcomhleacaithe i dTuaisceart &Eacute;ireann, &oacute; thaobh Acht na Gaeilge de agus fhorbairt na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an cead c&eacute;anna acusan agus at&aacute; agamsa agus ag aon duine eile &oacute; thaobh labhairt agus &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-t&aacute;bhachtach, dar liomsa, domsa agus do mhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann ar fad. <br/><br/>An rud deiridh a iarrfaidh m&eacute; n&aacute;, &oacute; thaobh m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, t&aacute; an ceart ag an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  An bhfuil a fhios agat go gcaithfidh &aacute;bhar oid&iacute; dul ag an nGaeltacht faoi dh&oacute; i rith tr&eacute;imhse traen&aacute;la?  Suas go dt&iacute; c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; an Roinn ag &iacute;oc as sin.  The Department used to pay for it, now people have to pay for it out of their own pocket.  What is that saying to people who want to teach in our primary and secondary schools?  These are students and the State used to fund this.  Caithfidh athr&uacute; a theacht air sin.  It is not a lot of money.  <br/><br/>Freisin, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh seans ag chuile scol&aacute;ire idirbhliana dul go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht; every transition year student should be given an opportunity to go to the Gaeltacht for a week to learn Irish.  It does not cost a lot of money and this also supports the Gaeltacht.  There is a lot more I can say, a Chathaoirligh, but I would like to give Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, an deis c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute;.</p></speech>

Baineann achan duine &oacute; gach aois agus gach ceantar ar fud an domhain sult as do l&iacute;ofacht, do ghreann, agus do mhioneolas faoi na himreoir&iacute; agus faoina gclanna.</p> <p>Ba mhaith liom sampla den ghreann sin a chur os comhair an T&iacute;.  I would like now to break into English for a moment to remind you, Miche&aacute;l, of some of those great humorous moments in your commentaries: Se&aacute;n &Oacute;g &Oacute; hAilp&iacute;n, his father from Fermanagh, his mother from Fiji, neither a hurling stronghold;  Anthony Lynch the Cork corner back will be the last person to let you down, his people are undertakers;  and, Colin Corkery on the 45, let us go with the right boot, it is over the bar, this man should not be playing football, he has made an almost Lazarus-like recovery from a heart condition, Lazarus was a great man but he could not kick points like Colin Corkery.  That wonderful humour has done so much for our language and our games.  Before I go back to an Ghaeilge, one of the features of my childhood growing up in the same community as Senator Wilson, was young lads trying to emulate your commentaries and attempting to repeat them.  None of them ever reached the standard that need worry an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh but it was the ultimate tribute that young lads were trying to be Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaighs all over the place. </p> <p>Inniu t&aacute;imid ag ceili&uacute;radh Seachtain na Gaeilge.  Is eochair do sheoid luachmhar &iacute; &aacute;r dteanga.  Is eochair d&aacute;r n-oidhreacht, d&aacute;r gcult&uacute;r agus d&aacute;r litr&iacute;ocht shaibhir.  Is fi&uacute; &iacute; a chosaint agus a labhairt agus a fhorbairt, agus go h&aacute;irithe a labhairt.  Rinne t&uacute; an t-ioml&aacute;n don teanga, do chluich&iacute; Gaelacha agus don chult&uacute;r.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis sin agus le do chuid dea-oibre.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inne anseo dea-shampla a thabhairt agus iarracht faoi leith an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus aonta&iacute;m leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh mar gheall ar an gclub Gaelach.

T&aacute; an cuma ar an sc&eacute;al, ag amharc ar an nGaileara&iacute; inniu, gur th&oacute;g s&eacute; foireann peile leis.  T&aacute; na sluaite Gaeil linn sa Ghaileara&iacute; fosta.  Is mian liom fearadh na f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh chuile dhuine at&aacute; i l&aacute;thair.  Is &oacute;c&aacute;id cheili&uacute;rach &iacute; seo &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Bliain na Gaeilge de.  T&aacute; ardmholadh tuillte ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis as na hiarrachta&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh aige faoi l&aacute;thair chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; seo.</p><p>Mar a luadh cheana f&eacute;in, t&aacute; r&oacute;l, stair agus taith&iacute; l&aacute;rnach agus thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach agus suntasach ag an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh i saol na t&iacute;re seo, i saol Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael agus i saol na Gaeilge.  Luaigh an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh na tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; sin i stair na t&iacute;re seo nuair a bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge faoi chos agus i ng&eacute;ibheann.  N&iacute;l an stair sin chomh fada sin uainn, &aacute;fach.  Ba choinneal lasta &eacute; an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh le linn tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; mar sin.  Lonraigh s&eacute; sl&iacute; chuig an Ghaeilge f&aacute; choinne na sluaite daoine amuigh ansin.  T&aacute;imid f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och agus f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as an mh&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige ar son na Gaeilge.</p><p>Mar a d&uacute;irt an Cathaoirleach, is Feirsteach br&oacute;d&uacute;il m&eacute;.  Is Ultach br&oacute;d&uacute;il agus Gael f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il m&eacute; chomh maith.  D&eacute;arfainn go bhfuil seanaigne ag an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh ar an d&aacute;n, &quot;M&oacute;rtas Gael&quot;, as a thagann an mana a bh&iacute; ag Me&aacute;nscoil Feirste - Col&aacute;iste Feirste a thugtar air anois - nuair a d'fhreastail m&eacute; air fad&oacute;:</p><blockquote>Is Gael mise, nach uasal sin?<br /><br />Gael im' chro&iacute;, Gael im' mheoin<br /><br />Gael &oacute;n sheacht sinsear Gael.<br /><br />Gael mise agus m&eacute; &aacute; mha&iacute;omh.<br /><br />D&uacute;shl&aacute;n faoin domhan uile cine Gael a sh&aacute;r&uacute;.</blockquote> <p>T&aacute;imid iontach br&oacute;d&uacute;il as sin go f&oacute;ill.  Is cine&aacute;l r&eacute;alt sti&uacute;radh d&uacute;inn an d&aacute;n sin agus muid imithe &oacute;n scoil agus ag dul tr&iacute;d an saol.  Mar a luaigh an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh agus cainteoir&iacute; eile, is cuisle agus bunchloch na hathbheochana &eacute; an Gaeloideachas.  Is sa ch&oacute;ras Gaeloideachais a thosna&iacute;onn an chuid is m&oacute; againn ag dul tr&iacute; shaol na Gaeilge.  Mar a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh n&iacute;os luaithe, go bun&uacute;sach is saol tr&iacute; Ghaeilge at&aacute; uainn, mar shampla agus muid ag idirghn&iacute;omh&uacute; leis an Rialtas, le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it, le cuideachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha, leis na pobail timpeall orainn, le P&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh agus le Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  T&aacute; an t-iarratas bun&uacute;sach simpl&iacute; sin de dh&iacute;th orainn in achan r&eacute;imse.  Saol tr&iacute; Ghaeilge at&aacute; uainn.</p><p>Roimhe sin, d'fhreastail m&eacute; ar Bhunscoil Phobal Feirste i nGaeltacht Bh&oacute;thar Seoighe i mB&eacute;al Feirste.  Scoil aonad d'&aacute;r gcuid f&eacute;in a bh&iacute; againn.  Is cuimhin liom go m&oacute;r agus go maith nuair a bh&iacute; an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh mar aoichainteoir ag ceili&uacute;radh 40 bliain na scoile san &Oacute;st&aacute;n Europa.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; mar Ard-Mh&eacute;ara Bh&eacute;al Feirste ag an am.  Is sampla &eacute; sin den turas at&aacute; glactha ag an Ghaeilge n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in &oacute; Thuaidh ach ar fud na t&iacute;re ina ioml&aacute;ine &oacute;n tr&eacute;imhse nuair a rinneadh bagairt ar na ceannr&oacute;daithe ar Bh&oacute;thar Seoighe go gcuirfear i bpr&iacute;os&uacute;n iad mura stopfaid&iacute;s an cine&aacute;l r&eacute;abhl&oacute;ide a bh&iacute; ar bun acu ar Bh&oacute;thar Seoighe.  D&uacute;radh leo go gcuirfear i ng&eacute;ibheann iad gan bac agus deireadh a chur le scoil Bh&eacute;al Feirste.  T&aacute; tr&eacute;imhse iontach gairid agus gasta caite &oacute;n r&eacute; sin.  Nuair a bh&iacute; an scoil ag ceili&uacute;radh 40 bliain ar an bhf&oacute;d, bh&iacute; duine d'iardhalta&iacute; na scoile mar ch&eacute;ad saor&aacute;nach ar an chathair.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur shampla maith &eacute; sin den dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta san earn&aacute;il Gaeloideachais.</p><p>C&aacute; h&aacute;it a bhfuilimid faoi l&aacute;thair?  Mar a d&uacute;irt na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; a labhair romham, t&aacute; orainn a l&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a r&aacute; go mbeidh m&eacute; gasta.  Beidh pop-up Gaeltacht againn i mb&eacute;ar na D&aacute;la an tseachtain seo chugainn.  Beidh fearadh na f&aacute;ilte roimh an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; ag iarraidh freastal ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id sin.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, n&iacute;l cult&uacute;rlann againn i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  N&iacute;l Aire sinsearach don Ghaeilge againn.  N&iacute;l plean n&aacute; strait&eacute;is f&aacute; choinne an Gaeloideachas againn.  N&iacute;l an plean 20 bliain don Ghaeilge curtha i bhfeidhm go fi&uacute;ntach agus go h&eacute;ifeachtach.  T&aacute; titim tagtha ar an maoini&uacute; caipitil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht &oacute; &euro;75 milli&uacute;n in 2008 go dt&iacute; &euro;10 milli&uacute;n i mbliana.</p><p>N&iacute; theasta&iacute;onn uainn b&eacute;alghr&aacute; a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;or cheart go mbeadh na r&aacute;itis th&aacute;bhachtacha seo &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh againn ina n-aonar.  Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; b&eacute;alghr&aacute; i gceist &oacute;n Rialtas &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute; an tseachtain seo caite, bh&iacute; mana simpl&iacute; - &quot;n&aacute; habair &eacute;, d&eacute;an &eacute;&quot; ag na seanfhond&uacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute; mar cheannr&oacute;daithe i nGaeltacht Bh&oacute;thar Seoighe i mB&eacute;al Feirste.  Is &eacute; sin an t-&eacute;ileamh at&aacute; againn mar Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &oacute;n Rialtas i dtaobh na Gaeilge de inniu.  Ba cheart go mbeadh &quot;n&aacute; habair &eacute;, d&eacute;an &eacute;&quot; mar mhana ag lucht an Rialtais in achan rud a dh&eacute;anann siad &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de, mar shampla sna me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide, sa St&aacute;t, san earn&aacute;il Gaeloideachais agus san earn&aacute;il oideachais n&iacute;os leithne.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas m&oacute;r orm caint ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I sometimes have a sense of what is being said in Irish, but my confidence in speaking Irish is weak.  Today, I publicly ask for the support of others to help me improve my Irish.  I also want to ask others to be more conscious and appreciative of how we speak English in Ireland.  I will come back to the question of Hiberno-English i gc&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad.  An Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said that M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is a hero.  I think he is also greatly loved throughout this land by young and old.  People who do not have a word of Irish love to hear Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh weave between the Gaeilge and the B&eacute;arla.  I think it says something about the fact that Irish, and the way we speak English in Ireland, is oral.  It is an oral tradition.  It has not been captured by the written word and the power of a written grammar in the same way that the English language and other languages have.</p> <p>Compulsion or force is a very poor teacher.  Our first President, Dubhghlas de h&Iacute;de, who has been mentioned, founded the Gaelic League.  He referred the School Attendance Bill 1942 to the Supreme Court on the question of compulsory Irish.  In 1943, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Gaelic League, he said that "a nation without a language is like a soldier without a weapon".  If he had been from my native county of Tipperary rather than from County Roscommon, he might have said that a nation without a language is like a hurler without a hurley, but we will forgive him that one.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Miche&aacute;l went through very well in his presentation that our language and national games, through the work of the Gaelic League, the GAA and others, were vital in raising our spirit and self-confidence, which is an-t&aacute;bhachtach ar fad, prior to achieving our freedom, and as part of being able to achieve our freedom.  This sense of self is a missing ingredient in many of the former Soviet states, as I would see it.  I have travelled to many of them in my work with regard to disability, and it is restricting their development.  I have mentioned disability, and Miche&aacute;l has been a great supporter of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  He has supported my organisation with regard to our disability inclusion and equality campaigns and many others.  I thank him so much for this.</p><p>As I travelled through other states in Europe with my work, I became aware that I needed to change how I speak.  I cannot speak as I speak at home because if I do, no one will understand half of what I say.  This is mostly about stripping back my Irish way of speaking English, of which I have not always been aware.  We forget we speak English in an Irish way, with an idiom, a turn of phrase, vocabulary and grammar.  The further west, south west and north west we go in this country the more we see this.  The idea of a cumann Gaelach in the Oireachtas has been rightly mentioned, but let us also remember we have people in both Houses of the Oireachtas and otherwise, and I am thinking of some of the Kerry Members in particular, who speak English in a very Irish way.  This is something we should not lose because it is part of not having been consumed by the empire.</p><p>I want to mention very briefly Professor Terence Dolan who was professor of old and middle English in UCD.  He was the one back in the early 1980s who brought me alive to the idea of Hiberno-English and the way in which we speak and our grammar and turn of phrase, the way words have migrated from Irish into our English language and how words from English have migrated the other way.  He said that a great thing about Hiberno-English is that it is a distillation of the Irish character.  We often speak in code and people from rural areas can be very oblique.  Over the centuries, Irish people have been oppressed and, therefore, they do not want other people to know what they might be thinking or saying.  There are lots of influences.  Towards the end of his contribution, Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked c&aacute; bhfuilimid anois.  From my perspective, two legs of the stool are strongly standing.  These are sport and song and dance.  We should not be without hope that we will bolster the third leg of the stool, which is to revive and bring back the Irish language.  An important step in this is for us to be conscious of how we speak English.  We speak it in a very Irish way and we should be proud of this and let it help us.</p></speech>

Miche&aacute;l is heartily welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann to mark Seachtain na Gaeilge.  I am more than familiar with meeting him over the years, mainly in Croke Park and around the country, and I am delighted to meet him in this setting.  He has visited more dressing rooms on tension filled all-Ireland days than any player or manager in the country.  What some people here may not know is that over the years he has also been a trainer.  For many years, he trained the Kerry and Mayo players in Dublin.  He got great credit for Kerry winning all-Irelands, and he is the only man I know who never got any blame for Mayo not winning the all-Ireland.  This is unique in itself.</p> <p>He has been an excellent ambassador for the Irish language over the years, officially and unofficially.  He has been instrumental in giving people pride in our native language and has had a huge influence in popularising and promoting the Irish language, our native tongue, over many years.  I am not a fluent Irish speaker, but he gave me the love of the language to send my children to Col&aacute;iste Iascaigh and the Gaeltacht in Galway over the years.  I am proud to say some of them are now fluent Irish speakers because of this.  His influence has been paralleled by TG4 and Raidio na Gaeltachta, on which he has been many times.  They have also popularised our language, games and culture over the years.  Gu&iacute;m rath D&eacute; air agus ar an obair fhi&uacute;ntach a dh&eacute;anann s&eacute;.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh agus a chlann.  Nuair a bh&iacute; mo chlann f&eacute;in ag f&eacute;achaint ar chluich&iacute; Ciarra&iacute; ar an teilif&iacute;s san am ina raibh M&iacute;che&aacute;l f&oacute;s ag tr&aacute;chtaireacht - when M&iacute;che&aacute;l was commentating on matches involving Kerry and everybody else - chas siad fuaim na teilif&iacute;se s&iacute;os agus d'ardaigh siad fuaim an raidi&oacute;.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur mh&uacute;inteoir maith &iacute; an stair.  It is true that history is a great teacher.  I do not think Mark Twain put it as well, but he did also say history does not repeat itself as much as it rhymes.  Miche&aacute;l spoke about our greatest generation that gave us an saoirse.  In many ways, that struggle began with the cultural and language revolution of 125 years ago and the sporting revolution of the GAA.  Without all of this creativity in culture and identity there would not have been a 1916 Rising.  All of the people who were central to the language revival and cultural revolution over 100 years ago were part of that revolution in 1916.</p> <p>He also spoke about history being a teacher in terms of the fact it is also part of our future.  As well as our sport and culture being part of our future, our language must be part of that identity and future.  Miche&aacute;l touched on a number of issues and I want to address them in terms of the Gaeltacht and the need to assist it in terms of jobs and opportunities.  The election of people to represent the Gaeltacht was a step in the wrong direction.  It was not something that was positive but, of course, it can be revisited.  I agree with my colleague with regard to teaching in schools through Irish and making sure the teachers themselves are proficient.  What he has organised is great.  With regard to people having to pay to go to learn Irish, every transition year student should go and learn it.  There will be an opportunity now, with the change in the transition year teaching methods that will start this September, whereby those ideas and concepts can be embedded, but it comes down to this idea of how it is paid for.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Clare County Council &euro;35,000 was spent translating the county development plan into Irish as is required by law, which is as it should be.  While it would be the right of any citizen to have that document translated into Irish, perhaps that funding should instead be ring-fenced for an initiative to send transition year students from Clare to the Gaeltacht.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh might agree with this as a businessman.  If somebody still wanted to have it translated into Irish, so be it.  That should happen too.  However, a cost-benefit analysis should be done on what would benefit the Irish language the most.  </p><p>I take the point, which is important and which was well made, on signs and signage being in Irish and on encouraging both State institutions and others - including all our churches whether they be Catholic , Protestant, Muslim or Jewish - to have signage in Irish.  Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh also mentioned the Blaskets, which are dear to his heart, to those in Kerry and to those around the world because of their rich cultural and literary history.  He also mentioned an Irish club in Leinster House.  I know that has been done before and is ongoing.  Go mbeirimid beo ag an am seo ar&iacute;s.</p></speech>

Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, is on&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r &eacute; agus is &oacute;c&aacute;id t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; freisin.</p><p>It is very hard to address the serious points which Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has made without attempting to pay him the tribute he deserves for the important role which he plays and has played in Irish life.  D&eacute;arfainn go bhfuil tr&iacute; bhua ar leith aige gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn a bheith bu&iacute;och astu.  Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad cheann an chaoi a bhfuil s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine, is cuma c&eacute; hiad.  He is to be seen everywhere.  He could be speaking at a novena, he could be visiting a school and he is turning up on our televisions.  He is a cultural unifier in a way that is very important but at the root of it is his generosity with his time.  Is cuimhin liom f&eacute;in, nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mo mhac l&eacute;inn i DCU ag d&eacute;anamh m&aacute;istreacht san iriseoireacht, go raibh m&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh tionscnamh beag faoi stair an Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, faoi ghn&eacute;ithe den chult&uacute;r agus faoi cheisteanna consp&oacute;ideacha a bh&iacute; ann ag an am maidir le cluich&iacute; eile a bheith &aacute; n-imirt i bP&aacute;irc an Chr&oacute;caigh n&oacute; na bans &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bh&iacute; ann.  I remember how Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh did not just give generously of his time but came to meet me and shared his expertise, a shaineolas, ar go leor beala&iacute;.  T&aacute; feicthe agam &oacute; shin go nd&eacute;anann s&eacute; an rud ceannann c&eacute;anna le gach duine.  He is comfortable with the daoine m&oacute;r le r&aacute; in&aacute;r socha&iacute;, but he is just as comfortable with gn&aacute;th-chosmhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann.  That is why he is so appreciated.  </p><p>Is &eacute; an dara rud n&aacute; a thuiscint ar an gcult&uacute;r.  Spreagann s&eacute; t&iacute;rghr&aacute; ar leith at&aacute; cuimsitheach agus oscailte.  He is a cultural unifier and a carrier of an attractive kind of patriotism.  Spreagann s&eacute; an Ghaeilge gan a bheith ag cr&aacute; daoine fuithi.  B&iacute;onn s&eacute; ag moladh daoine agus ag tabhairt spreagadh d&oacute;ibh teacht leis.  It is remarkable how two of the best cultural unifiers in Irish life during my time came from the world of GAA commentary.  M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; h&Eacute;ithir, before Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, was something more than a commentator.  He had a special place in many people's hearts.  He figured at other important moments outside of sport and Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has done the exact same thing.  That is very important at a time when there are things that can divide us and when there is a screechy element in our culture.  We have been talking a lot in these Houses about social media - its use, its misuse and how people can attack each other, sometimes very gratuitously.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh go bhfuil bealach eile le point&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  He is not someone who has the uncharitable word, a mhalairt at&aacute; f&iacute;or.  He is an encourager and he brings people with him.</p><p>Is &eacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; rud n&aacute;, &eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; ruda&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha le r&aacute; aige.  N&iacute;or chaill s&eacute; riamh seans an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  N&iacute; h&eacute; an c&uacute;pla focal at&aacute; i gceist.  Bh&iacute; go leor daoine ann nach raibh s&aacute;sta lena gcuid scola&iacute;ochta agus leis an gcaoi inar mh&uacute;ineadh Gaeilge d&oacute;ibh - b'fh&eacute;idir an ghl&uacute;in a chuaigh romhainn.  D&eacute;arfainn go ndearna an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh c&uacute;iteamh t&aacute;bhachtach sa chaoi sin.  A lot of people who might have had negative experiences of the Irish language through schooling were encouraged by Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh's attractive presentation of Irish to take an interest agus a bheith b&aacute;&uacute;il don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  </p><p>Tugann s&eacute; inspior&aacute;id freisin do dhaoine at&aacute; ag dul in aois.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil s&eacute; chomh gn&iacute;omhach ag an staid seo d&aacute; shaol.  N&iacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; do gach duine go mbeadh siad chomh g&eacute;ar san aigne agus at&aacute; an tUasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach freisin.  That is also really important.  He probably has not heard of a thing called head tingles.  Perhaps he has.  I do not know if he is an expert on autonomous sensory meridian response, but that is one of the many gifts that he is supposed to have.  Somewhere in the happier parts of the Internet, one can find a video of Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh making a ham sandwich in a very entertaining way and talking about it in very sporting terms.  Apparently it caused a sensation because people thought this guy was so relaxing to listen to.  They said it caused this phenomenon. </p><p>That is the lighter side of Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh but n&iacute;or mhaith liom t&oacute;g&aacute;il, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, &oacute; na ruda&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha at&aacute; le r&aacute; aige agus at&aacute; le m&uacute;ineadh aige, mar is m&uacute;inteoir den scoth &eacute;.  As part of our response around the promotion of the Irish language ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn chuimni&uacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; gurb &eacute; an &aacute;it le tosn&uacute; an earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute;.  Ansin, rachfas daoine eile.  I understand what people say about compulsory Irish and how it can create the wrong effect but is m&oacute;r an trua the decline of Irish within the Civil Service and the fact that the rules were changed so that there are now very few people in the Civil Service who can provide people with a basic service through Irish, if that is their wish.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; gur g&aacute; le n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; lip service &oacute;n Rialtas agus &oacute; na daoine m&oacute;r le r&aacute; sa t&iacute;r seo maidir leis an nGaeilge.  We have to find ways to put Irish at the centre of life.  We need to look again at how Irish has declined within the Civil Service and to address that.</p><p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm col ceathrar Mh&iacute;che&aacute;l, Iogn&aacute;id &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, a fheiscint inniu.  Is iar-uachtar&aacute;n mo chol&aacute;iste f&eacute;in &eacute; - UCG, n&oacute; NUI Galway mar a ghlaoitear anois air.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, fear m&oacute;r Gaelach le Gaeilge &eacute; freisin.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm gur Gaeilgeoir a chomarba is d&eacute;ana&iacute;, Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh.  I mention that because, linked with the respect that our public institutions need to show for the Irish language, I was disappointed that my own <i>alma mater</i>, NUI Galway, changed the rules about the selection of presidents of the college so that Irish would no longer be a requirement.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm, I am delighted, that they picked a very fine Gaeilgeoir as well as a very competent person to be Iogn&aacute;id's latest successor as uachtar&aacute;n.  Dr. Jim Browne also had that capacity.  </p><p>I say that because ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; ind&eacute;anta go mbeadh s&eacute; riachtanach go mbeadh Gaeilge ag uachtar&aacute;n Chol&aacute;iste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh.  If some very talented person from abroad is found, he or she should be given three or four years to get to a certain standard mar t&aacute; ionada&iacute;ocht i gceist maidir len&aacute;r gcuid ollscoileanna.  N&iacute; chun airgead a mhealladh isteach ag an t&iacute;r le haghaidh taighde amh&aacute;in at&aacute; na hollscoileanna.  T&aacute; f&iacute;or-r&oacute;l ionad&iacute;ochta i gceist le huachtar&aacute;nacht agus le hollscoileanna - go h&aacute;irithe an ollscoil i nGaillimh.  I make that point in passing by way of welcoming Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh's distinguished relative, Iogn&aacute;id, but also to say that is an example of how the public sector needs to take Irish more seriously.</p><p>Leis sin gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh ar&iacute;s as ucht na n-&eacute;achta&iacute; uilig at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige go dt&iacute; seo.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis ach go h&aacute;irithe as ucht an bhealaigh agus na cuirt&eacute;iseachta at&aacute; aige agus a theachtaireacht a chur ar aghaidh.

T&aacute; n&aacute;ire orm, go h&aacute;irithe mar Chiarra&iacute;och, nach bhfuil ach Gaeilge bhriste agam.  Bainim triail as mo chuid Gaeilge chomh minic agus is f&eacute;idir liom.  One of the reasons people like me love M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is that he understands that not everybody has Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa and he encourages us to use what we can.  As a Kerryman, I am ashamed of the Irish I have.  N&iacute;l an cleachtadh agam.  I am not keeping it up.  Every now and again, I make my mind up to improve my Irish.  When my children were going to school, we used to speak Irish at the table as much as we could.  M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has made the Irish language attractive and appealing to people who do not have Irish but would like to have it.  Down through the decades, we have had a lot of coercion in relation to the teaching of Irish.  Perhaps there was too much pressure on people.  Many of my former colleagues in school would say that the manner in which Irish was taught to them meant they did not learn a love of the language.  Regrettably, there is a certain validity to that argument.</p><p>Is fear c&aacute;ili&uacute;il agus sp&oacute;irt&uacute;il &eacute; M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  Go h&aacute;irithe, is fear na ndaoine &eacute;.  He is a people's person.  I will not labour this point.  I was late for this debate because I had an unavoidable medical appointment.  I think Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has done more for the Irish language than many professors, scholars and experts.  Regardless of whether he is speaking in Irish or in English, he speaks the language of the people.  When he is commentating on a game or talking about how to make a ham sandwich, as mentioned by Senator Mullen, he has an appeal and people take to that.  I had the privilege of being ar an ard&aacute;n leis i Lios Tuathail ar L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig.  We shared a platform in Listowel last week.  Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is always willing to come when he is called.  Many people are called and do not turn up, but Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh always turns up and it is appreciated.  M&iacute;che&aacute;l O'Hehir was famously the voice of Gaelic football at one time.  There is no doubt that M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is the voice of Gaelic football and a living successor to M&iacute;che&aacute;l O'Hehir.  He is totally unique in his own way.  As a Kerryman, I am proud to be able to be here in the Seanad.  I am ashamed of my Irish, but I am certainly proud of M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.</p></speech>

Labhair m&eacute; leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh ag Com&oacute;rtas Peile na Gaeltachta ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua i gContae na Gaillimhe na blianta &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag imirt ar fhoireann an Tearmainn &oacute; Th&iacute;r Chonaill ag an am sin.  Bh&iacute; eolas an-mhaith ag an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh ar na himreoir&iacute; go l&eacute;ir &oacute; gach Gaeltacht sa t&iacute;r.  His knowledge of the GAA and of all the players who had assembled in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua in Connemara for the all-Ireland Gaeltacht football championships has stayed with me until the present day.  At the time, I was playing for a team called Termon from County Donegal.  As we spoke on the sideline, I was impressed by Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh's knowledge of the team.  He asked about imreoir an-mhaith, Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Riain, a bh&iacute; againn agus a bh&iacute; ag imirt d'fhoireann an chontae ag an am.  Thomas Ryan would have been our most famous player at that time, which was 20 or 25 years ago.  Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh knew about him and about the minors who played on the team in a small country area like the area I come from thuas i dT&iacute;r Chonaill.  It has stayed with me that he took the time to inform himself about the players from our club who had previously played with Donegal.  There is no better ambassador for the Irish language or for Gaelic games than M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  As a sporting person, I often listen to commentators as they try to explain a crucial moment during a football or hurling match.  There are some who get it and some who do not.  Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has the God-given gift of being able to capture the moment and set the scene when commentating on a hurling match in a way that allows someone travelling in a car to envisage it in his or her mind's eye.  As one listens to his commentary, it is as if one is actually looking at what is happening on the pitch.  That is a fantastic gift.</p> <p>What I like about today is that it gives us an opportunity to look back with fond memories on M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh's fantastic talent as a commentator and to hear about his love for the Irish language.  People normally have to pass away before we get an opportunity to idolise them.  I am glad Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is alive today and his family is here with him.  I am glad we have this opportunity to pay tribute to him by highlighting the respect and love that we, as a nation, have for him.  I wish him many more years of good health and happiness.  I have no doubt that he will continue to promote Gaelic games and the Irish language.  An advertisement for the Allianz football leagues that is running on RT&Eacute; at present sets a unique and iconic scene.  It shows M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, after being involved with the GAA for many years, with some children at an under age football match against a backdrop of the wild Atlantic Ocean.  It is a fantastic image and one I associate with Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  I wish him many more years of good health and happiness.  I hope we will get an opportunity to enjoy listening to him yet again, regardless of the subject matter he is discussing.  I suppose there is an onus on us all le bheith ag caint as Gaeilge.  Cos&uacute;il le mo chara, an Seanad&oacute;ir Ned O'Sullivan, bh&iacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge agam nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; &oacute;g n&aacute; mar at&aacute; agam anois.  Nuair a d'fhreastail m&eacute; ar an scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta suas i dT&iacute;r Chonaill, bh&iacute; orm an Ghaeilge a labhairt an t-am ar fad.  With the passage of time, n&iacute; cuimhin liom an chuid is m&oacute; den mh&eacute;id Gaeilge a bh&iacute; agam ag an am sin.  D&eacute;anaim iarracht an Ghaeilge a labhairt anois is ar&iacute;s.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  It is a pleasure and an honour to be in his presence here this afternoon.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  N&iacute;l m&oacute;ran Gaeilge agam.  In 1982, when I was appointed as Minister of State by Charles J. Haughey, I spent many weeks travelling to Dublin to do a Gael-Linn course.  I was very conscious of the fact that my Irish was not up to standard.  I had a driver who spoke fluent Irish, so I used to be briefed before I went into functions so that I could speak as much Gaeilge as possible.  Fortunately, my wife Mary, my daughter Orla and my granddaughter speak very good Irish.  M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has brought Irish to the fore.  Many years ago, RT&Eacute; had a very good Irish-language programme that he might recall.  He has done a tremendous amount for the Irish language and for sport.  He is basically an icon.  I am delighted that he has been given this honour in the Seanad today.  As I reflected on what he said, I wondered why, after all these years, Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has not been made a Senator.  He would be a fantastic ambassador here.  I am sure Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will decide to give up his seat.  Maybe Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will appoint Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh as well.  No greater love can one give.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Government or some Minister will research the teaching of the Irish language to make people love speaking it.  That would be a great thing for Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh personally.  All the young women who came out of the Convent of Mercy schools in Roscommon spoke very good Irish, but very few of the lads who left the CBS spoke good Irish.  We were taught Irish for an hour nearly every day of the week, but we were not spoken to about things like the weather.  My appeal is for people to be taught ordinary phrases like "t&aacute; an aimsir go maith", "t&aacute; s&eacute; ag cur sneachta" and "t&aacute; m&eacute; ag dul abhaile" so that they can speak the language.  I was not going to contribute to this debate because I am conscious of the factors I have mentioned.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan has excellent Irish.  I must say that Senator Mullen has lovely Irish.  If we are to achieve something today, I would like it to be a renewed focus on spoken language in schools to make people love the language and get speaking it as well as they can.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There should not be this kind of elitism.  Senator O'Sullivan made the point that some people who are too fanatical about the language are elitist about it, but Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh embodies the real Irish language and the love of it.  The fact that he is bilingual and so fluent in both languages is brilliant.  I am just delighted to be here today.  It is a great honour for the Seanad that Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh addressed us here today.  I wish him continued success.  He is a national figure and long may that continue.</p></speech>

Tuigim &oacute; bheith ag &eacute;isteacht leo go bhfuil s&eacute; in aigne acu anois rud &eacute;igin gn&iacute;omhach a dh&eacute;anamh i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith gn&eacute;ithe eile de chult&uacute;r na h&Eacute;ireann i rith na bliana at&aacute; romhainn.  Is maith an rud, ar shl&iacute;, gur Bliain na Gaeilge &iacute; in &aacute;it Sheachtain na Gaeilge.  D'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; rud a chur ar si&uacute;l ar feadh bliana ach n&iacute; fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh i seachtain ach an spiorad a choth&uacute;.<br/><br/>Bh&iacute; ruda&iacute; suimi&uacute;la le r&aacute;.  Labhr&oacute;dh faoi &eacute;igeantas, compulsion.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin ann &oacute;, b'fh&eacute;idir, na 1940&iacute; agus na 1950&iacute;.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ann a thuilleadh.  Nuair a th&eacute;itear isteach anois go dt&iacute; na bunscoileanna, if one goes into primary schools now, the m&uacute;inteoir is not Ms or Mrs. so-an-so agus n&iacute; h&eacute; an fear an tUasal, he or she is M&uacute;inteoir M&aacute;ire n&oacute; M&uacute;inteoir ainm &eacute;igin eile.  The students just take the teacher's name as if he or she was one of themselves.  It is a group thing.  Mar a d&uacute;irt peilead&oacute;ir &oacute; Chiarra&iacute;, Mick O'Connell, liom uair amh&aacute;in, nuair a chuir duine ceist air c&eacute; a bh&iacute; ar a mharc&aacute;il, n&oacute; who was marking him, on a given day, d&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach raibh &eacute;inne riamh ar a mharc&aacute;il ach go raibh s&eacute; ag imirt leo.  He said that he did not play against the others, he played with them.  T&aacute; an rud sin sna scoileanna anois.  T&aacute; na dalta&iacute; agus na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; le ch&eacute;ile.  It is not that one has all the power.  T&aacute; an &eacute;igeantas imithe and that is a great thing for Irish.  People who learned Irish in school in the last 20 or 30 years have a different experience completely.  The compulsion was there in a time when everything was certain agus gach rud.  It did a lot of damage.  It turned people who did not have the ability to learn Irish quickly against it.  That was a pity.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; sin thart.  <br/><br/>Luaigh m&eacute; r&eacute; nua.  We are into new times now and there is an opportunity.  It is okay to talk about things and to have strategies and everything, but one must be able to say five years later that strategy worked.  Caithfear gn&iacute;omh a dh&eacute;anamh.  That is what I like about all the people connected with that Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language.  Not alone did they point needs out but they actually went to do different things where they saw such needs and brought other people in.  From what I heard here from the Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; I am very hopeful that they will do their part.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n daoine anseo a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  If they can have any influence on it and if the people are available I would love it if, when elections come around, as well as having debates in RT&Eacute; and other stations, there were also some as Gaeilge ar TG4 - Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge nuair a buna&iacute;odh &eacute;.  <br/><br/>Ba &eacute; &aacute;r nUachtar&aacute;n, Michael D. Higgins, who launched Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, as it was called, way back in 1996.  Is cuimhin liom go maith an o&iacute;che sin agus ba ch&oacute;ir creidi&uacute;int a thabhairt d&oacute;.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; an tAire - that he was the Minister - but he also said that only for the people that went before him who got the legislation through and made the money available, n&iacute; bheadh s&eacute; ansin agus n&iacute; bheadh Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge ann.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go gcaithfear f&eacute;achaint amach ar an rud go l&eacute;ir.  Cuireann ruda&iacute; mar sin &aacute;thas orm mar n&iacute; mhaith liom ruda&iacute; caolaigeantach.  Cos&uacute;il leis na scoileanna, if the Irish club develops bheadh na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, the Senators and others meeting more often and, unknown to themselves, in a while they will be speaking as Gaeilge when the opportunity is there.  D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas le na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.  <br/><br/>There was a move a few years ago to get rid of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I do not know what the purpose of that was.  It would be a sad day.  Going way back to an old Irish poem: n&aacute; tabhair do bhreith ar an gc&eacute;ad sc&eacute;al go mbeiridh an taobh eile ort - do not pass judgment on a story you hear until you hear the other story.  You are in a better place then.  A system that allows for two levels, two views, is a better way to form positive opinions.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil mo dh&oacute;thain r&aacute;ite agam.  T&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach that the future is good.  On some aspects like the music and the dance, people are dancing Irish dances all over the world - Australia, America, and so on.

Mar a d&uacute;irt an Taoiseach ar oc&aacute;id an Rialtas a phl&eacute;, is &eacute; aidhm an Rialtas ar feadh bliain na Gaeilge, an Gaeilge a ch&eacute;ili&uacute;radh agus an gn&aacute;thduine a spreagadh p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh ann.  Sin &eacute; aidhm an Rialtais agus mar a d&uacute;irt gach duine inniu t&aacute; de ch&oacute;ir orm an Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id i dTeach Laighean, i gCorcaigh n&oacute; gach &aacute;it.  I had the pleasure of knowing Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh for a long time.  We had the distinction of working in RT&Eacute;; I was a lowly RT&Eacute; radio Cork sports commentator, Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh was a man we all admired and loved.  I had the pleasure of working alongside his daughter and his son who travelled the country with him, ag scr&iacute;obh na notes agus gach rud mar gheall ar an gcluiche.  Their love, their interest and their comhr&aacute; epitomised what this man stands for.  It is not the grand plan, it is not the overarching vision.  It is an Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id gach l&aacute;, mar a d&uacute;irt gach duine, an advertisement ar RT&Eacute; for the ham sandwich.  Fear an-speisialta is ea &eacute;, a man who deserves to be here today.  Not because of what he did in making our Gaelic games attractive, inviting him into our homes, but for the way he made the Irish language accessible.  In my humble opinion, we speak about great people like P&aacute;draig Pearse but to me, i r&eacute; nua, we have a patriot in front of us today.  This is a man who took his love of the Irish language from west Kerry and brought it to the four corners of our country.  Senator O'Mahony spoke about the exhilaration of being in a dressing room on Munster final day in Thurles or P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh.  I had the pleasure of being there too.  For every player, official, steward, maor, bh&iacute; focal leis an t-Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh aige n&oacute; aici.  He spoke to everybody.  It was not the Pope, it was not the prince, it was the ordinary person that was treated the same way.  It is the measure of a man that he treats everybody fairly.  </p><p>In his use of the Irish language and the way in which he has challenged us, he is an inspiration to a new generation.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir O'Sullivan, n&iacute;l an Gaeilge go l&iacute;ofa agam, ach d'&uacute;s&aacute;id m&eacute; &eacute;.  Rinneamar cleachtadh, go dt&iacute; an coffee dock le ranganna Gaeilge agus ar measc an Teach seo.  For as long as the name M&iacute;cha&eacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh is spoken about, the Irish langauge will always be remembered and will always be used.  For as long as we remember Mr. &Oacute; Muircheartaigh and as an Seanad&oacute;ir Reilly said, the phrases he used in his match commentary, then our Gaelic games will be safe and secure.  We stand here today Cathaoirleach, to pay tribute and say thank you, in a very humble but very symbolic gesture by us as Baill Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Bh&iacute; ceist againn ar an r&aacute;iteas, cad &eacute; &Eacute;ire nua?  What is the new Ireland?  What do we stand for?  "Reeling in the Years" was on on St. Patrick's night and Riverdance was being played.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an t-Uasal &Oacute; Muircheartaigh; Irish music, Irish song is being celebrated around the world.  We paid tribute today to Liam &Oacute; Floinn on the Order of Business.

Hopefully, we will see change in the near future.  I believe that young people should have a say.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal involves the establishment of a select committee.  It is what I speak about in my first amendment, in subsection (1), which states "A Select Committee shall be established ... ".  In general, we believe in the principle of this Bill.  I just want to let people know that.  The reason we are here talking about this Bill today is to question how can we vote on something on which we do not have all the information.</p> <p>I will explain why we are doing this and why we put these amendments forward.  I have been speaking to secondary school students in Carlow in this year commemorating 100 years of women's suffrage and I have been shocked at how unfamiliar they are with our political system.  This is common among young people.  I would even go as far as to say it is common among Irish people in general.</p> <p>When we get a voter turnout of 48%, we think we are marvellous but that is terrible.  When one looks at it in general, whether it is local elections or general elections, one is praying that it will not rain or snow, or the weather will not be bad, because one's biggest fear is the turnout.  If can be 48%, it can be 44% or 42%.  It depends on the different constituencies.</p> <p>This year we celebrate 100 years of women's suffrage.  In our history, women and men died just so that we could get the chance to vote, in private and on our own.  We have a fantastic democracy but we do not engage with the public so they cannot enjoy it.  Recently, during the cold spell, people were comparing us to Russia.  Actually, there is a grain of truth in that.  Following the election of Putin, many voters stated they did not vote because they knew the outcome.  They stated their vote did not matter.  Irish people tell me that all the time.  They see no point in voting.  If the adults in this country feel like that, how can we expect the 16 year olds to feel any different?</p> <p>The Constitutional Convention recommended the voting age be reduced to 16 years and while this Bill seeks to reduce the voting age in European and local elections to 16, the Bill is not complete, as seen by these amendments.  My party is today putting forward these amendments.</p> <p>We have tabled an amendment to have the Houses of the Oireachtas establish a select committee to consider: reducing the age at which a person shall be entitled to be registered as a European elector in a constituency to 16 years, provided that person is ordinarily resident in that constituency and is a citizen of Ireland, or a national of a Member State other than the State, and; reducing the age at which a person shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector in a local area to 16 provided that the person is ordinarily resident in that area on the qualifying date.  We further propose: this select committee be comprised of eight persons - four sitting Teachta D&aacute;la and four sitting Senators; a chairperson shall be selected by the members of the select committee; and the select committee may accept and invite submissions from interested bodies and shall prepare a report and make recommendations.  It is vital that this gets appropriate consideration and a select committee is the way to do this.</p> <p>The reason we are putting this proposal forward is that it is about all of us working together.  It is about parents, teachers and students, and everybody, working together.</p> <p>There is a need for an awareness campaign, particularly for 16 year olds but also for 18 year olds, and for people in general.  As I have stated previously, we need to look at the awareness around voting.  People died so that we would vote and it is outrageous that we are lucky, at general, local or European elections, if we have a turnout of 40% or 50%.</p> <p>I believe that, in future, 16 year olds should vote.  I can categorically say that the committee to which I refer will work to ensure that we raise awareness and we work with the 16 year olds to ensure that they have that vote.  However, to start off this process, we need to get a committee set up.  We need to get teachers, parents and students and everybody aware of the commitment of the vote.  It is so crucial.  That would be my first amendment.</p></speech>

That is particularly relevant in the time that faces the European Union, because what we are talking about here is local and European elections.  I refer to a European discourse that includes citizens from diverse settings, beliefs and cultures about how our continent might present itself.  In order to facilitate that dialogue, we need alternative political options, options that generate debate and options that involve citizens, extending the electoral franchise to include those at 16 and 17 years of age who wish to vote, and indeed, proper citizens' initiatives that are democratic because the current European citizens' initiative has been an embarrassing failure.</p><p>I quote President Michael D. Higgins:</p><blockquote>We are, in contemporary Europe, confronted with uniquely difficult challenges.  But the essential response lies in striving towards an open politically engaged but questioning, socially and culturally aware citizenship - a citizenship that develops and protects the institutions that protect individual rights and foster a sense of duty, responsibility and accountability.</blockquote> <p>That is what we are asking for.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what young people are asking for.

I remember it well as it was my first piece of legislation.  I worked alongside Senator Lynn Ruane and felt immense pride in being in a position to introduce the legislation.  I again thank the National Youth Council of Ireland for its constant support and note that its work, long before my time in Leinster House, inspired this Bill.  I do not take my role as a legislator lightly.  I believe that the work we do has a substantial impact on people's lives and on their role in shaping our society.</p><p>I introduced Second Stage on 29 March 2017.  As we know, the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties voted for a motion that delayed the progress of the legislation in 2018.  They stated that they needed more time to consider the Bill despite the issue having been debated in public forums on a regular basis, despite both parties having policies that support a lower voting age, despite the issue being considered at the Constitutional Convention, and despite the Bill being on the Order Paper for nine months before First Stage commenced.</p><p>Before the Bill was heard in this House I wrote to representatives in both parties and sought a meeting to discuss the Bill.  Unfortunately, I did not receive a response.  During the Second Stage debate in this House the Opposition <i>en masse</i>called out the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties for their cynicism, and shared that opinion.  Once Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il united to pass a motion that would delay the Bill, I set about working with both of them so that we would utilise our time and ensure that Senators were satisfied.  I wrote to the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, the current Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the two Ministers of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputies English and Phelan, and Deputy Cowen.  Eventually, I met the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, and Senator Neale Richmond.  I thank them both for their assistance. </p><p>For nearly 12 months Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular, has failed to engage in any dialogue on the Bill.  That leads me to believe that the motion it tabled today to delay proceedings, that has thankfully been ruled out of order, was a cynical attempt to again delay this issue, having previously delayed it on Second Stage.  That concludes my remarks.</p></speech>

I wish to confirm that my Labour Party colleagues and I support Committee Stage of the Bill.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, spoke eloquently in favour of the Bill on Second Stage.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, For&oacute;ige, Youth Work Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students' Union have contacted all of us to express their support for the Bill.  </p> <p>I believe that the proposal is modest and deserves support.  I echo the words expressed by Senator Warfield who criticised any further delay in bringing forward the legislation.  The Bill simply provides for the expansion of suffrage to people who are 16 years of age and over in local and European elections.  Many of us would like to see the legislation go further.  Indeed, in forthcoming referendum campaigns, like the referendum and campaign on the eighth amendment, it would be very good and appropriate if the franchise was extended to 16 year olds and 17 year olds.</p> <p>Senators have referenced the centenary of women's suffrage this year.  As chairperson of the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee in the Oireachtas, I am glad to celebrate the expansion of suffrage to women back in 1918.  Let us recall that in the years preceding the enactment of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave the right to vote to some women and only those over 30 years of age, the people who opposed the expansion of suffrage to women and opposed the right of women to vote expressed similar arguments to what we have heard about the right of young people to vote.  For example, a lack of maturity or an inability to understand politics.  Nowadays, in a contemporary and modern Ireland, we should not be afraid to extend the franchise to 16 year olds and 17 year olds, particularly in this limited way.  I was proud to support the proposal some years ago at the Constitutional Convention, on behalf of the Labour Party, and I am proud to support it again today.  I hope the Bill will be passed today and urge all colleagues on all sides to support same.</p></speech>

I also welcome the people who are seated in the public Gallery, in particular the young people.</p><p>Like previous Senators, I thank Senators Fintan Warfield, P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn and Lynn Ruane for sponsoring the Bill.  I think I have spoken about the Bill before and I fully support same.  It is important that we again state our commitment to the legislation. </p><p>As the Minister of State will be fully aware, the Young Fine Gael movement has adopted a strong line in terms of the legislation.  A number of them have contacted me, particularly after the last time we discussed the legislation.  Senator Neale Richmond was a great advocate of it in terms of his politics within Young Fine Gael and empowering young people aged 16 and 17 years to have a say.  I do not quite know how the matter has got lost in Fine Gael but that is a matter for the party.  Senator Richmond was here before and made a good case for the legislation but it never went any further, which is a pity.  </p><p>It is important that we engage with people, tap into youth and explore diversity.  Young people bring something to politics with their rich ideas and different ways of expression.  For that matter, every age brings something to politics in terms of the social life of our society and engagement with same.  Let us reflect on the fact that a 16 year old can do the following: consent to medical treatment; leave school and enter the workplace or training; be paid and be eligible to pay tax, including the universal social charge, USC, on his or her income; obtain tax credits and welfare benefits in his or her own right; the common age of sexual consent, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is 17 year of age; enter a meaningful and loving relationship; and become a member of a trade union.  I have listed some of the things that people of this age can do yet somehow we have a problem with allowing people aged 16 and 17 years of age to engage in the political process. </p><p>On 7 March of this year, we discussed the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee, the political process and the suffrage movement.  I spoke on that occasion and I shall quote the transcript of the debate.  I said:</p><blockquote>I met a girl outside the gates of Leinster House today.  She told me she was 16 years old and that she would love to be in politics.</blockquote> <p>I know that when she got through the gates she took a photograph of herself standing in front of a little statue of Countess Markievicz.  I asked her what stopped her from engaging in politics and said it was important to engage in one's school or college.  I like to think that we will be in a position by 2019, when local elections are due to take place, to allow people who are 16 years of age to vote.  The Minister of State has an enormous input into this matter due to the fact that his brief is local government and electoral reform.  It is not too late for us to do something.  If we are focused, committed and determined enough we can ensure that 16 and 17 year olds and, indeed, people who are up to 18 years of age, are able to vote in the local elections that will take place in 2019.  We should aim to achieve that goal.  I refer to the small margin of people who are currently excluded.  There is a long lead in to the local elections and the European elections but we need to get moving.  Ultimately, it is good and healthy to engage with all of the people because it will improve the political life of this country.  I urge the Minister of State to support the Bill.  I want him to set out a constructive pathway that will start this process.</p></speech>

In terms of young people being uninformed, engaged or not engaged, she has suggested that we should talk to teachers, the mammies and the daddies to raise awareness.  I presume that when we are finished doing that she hopes we will have a tea party and that we will all sit down to chat a little bit more.  For God's sake, we are talking about people who are 16 years of age.  If we engage them in politics at 16 years of age then we will have them for life.  Why does the Senator think banks go out of their way to set up school banks?  They do so because they know that if a child opens a bank account with them then he or she will be loyal and remain a customer for the rest of his or her life.</p> <p>I am sure that Members who have email addresses will have received numerous emails from youth organisations and individual young people asking for support.  The Senator has suggested a committee be set up to discuss this matter.  We all know what happens when a committee discusses an issue.  The committee produces a camel rather than a horse so a committee would not work.</p> <p>There is no need for Fianna F&aacute;il to fear the Bill.  All Fianna F&aacute;il needs to do is recruit young people of 16 years of age and over, thus providing a future for the party.  The same applies to Fine Gael and any other party that wants young people.  I can assure Senators that young people want to engage in politics.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor is right in what she said about the turnout for elections.  I believe the turnout is low because old people like me gave up voting years ago.</p></speech>

This is really serious; 16 year olds are not children.  A couple of weeks ago, we tried to amend the Data Protection Bill to raise the digital age of consent to 16 and the House went berserk.  Members said, "No, it should be 13."  They are not going to kill us and it is unlikely they will do silly things.  They will probably spend a lot more time researching how they will cast their votes than most adults of 18 plus do.  Get them young.  Get them in there.  Get them engaged.  Get them to be members of political parties.  I am delighted that seems to have brought the Minister of State to life.  I assume he will support the Bill given his broad smile.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State remember that old saying from school?  Praise the young and they will flourish.  Cherish and enfranchise the young, enable, empower and trust them.  These are all very modest political requirements for the House.  That Seanad &Eacute;ireann would, on receipt of a carefully considered Bill which has been the subject of consultation, as brought forward by Senators Warfield and Ruane, send it to an obscure, opaque committee somewhere, having seen it kicked to touch at an earlier stage, insults the processes of the House.  This is the Seanad and this is the place to table and enact laws.  It is also a great slight on those who have worked to put the Bill together and proposed it here this afternoon.</p> <p>At the earlier debate on the Bill, I noted that a pattern was emerging in the House.  I reflected on my remarks at that debate before coming to the House today.  It should be clear to a blind man or woman on a galloping horse that it has gone beyond a pattern to become a very clear, overt political stance on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il to oppose any legislation Sinn F&eacute;in brings to the House.  Sin &eacute;.  That is it.  It does not matter if the legislation reflects that party's own policy or if it is completely in unison with its stated aims.  It does not matter if giving 16 year olds the vote is the right thing to do.  Fianna F&aacute;il is to oppose it.  It is negative, nasty and base politics.  So much for new politics.  It cannot be denied any longer that this is the stated position.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il has the opportunity with young people in the Gallery.  Young people have no doubt because they are engaged in the political process as Senator Craughwell rightly said.  The notion that young people are not following this and judging it is wrong.</p><p>If Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and others had any sense, they would rush to empower and enfranchise young people.  It is a very short window of time before they will have the opportunity at 18 to vote and they will remember who taxed them at 16 and, as Senator Craughwell said, expected them to meet certain conditions in life in terms of their public contribution.  They will remember who wanted them to contribute to the State and put their trust in it but who would not return the favour and gratitude.  The coalition Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would not trust them and empower them.  They come in here and give all of the plam&aacute;s and beal gr&aacute; about how great it was 100 years ago to enfranchise some women, which it was.  At this point in time, however, it is as plain as the nose on one's face that the people driving politics not just in this State but across the country are young people.  As it has always been, they are at the fore to demand social change and progress and changes in the law.</p><p>It is as simple as I said in the last debate on the matter.  Governments of the last ten to 15 years have punished young people.  They have been on the receiving end of the worst excesses of economic illiteracy.  They have been driven into poverty and the so-called recovery in which they cannot afford a home or child care.  They can hardly get a job.  The <i>status quo</i>and the establishment are afraid of those young people being empowered and entrusted with their democratic right to vote.  I believe fundamentally as a republican in enfranchising and empowering citizens and providing them with equality and rights.  If young people are to be expected to contribute to many other aspects of political, social and legislative life in the State, why are they not trusted with the vote?  What is the rationale?  The parties say they will talk to teachers, youth groups, youth clubs and parents as if young people do not exist outside the classroom, as if they do not have an identity, life, experience and relationships and as if they do not contribute to life and politics.  The most basic courtesy we can extend to 16 year olds is to trust them and give them the right to decide on us.  I am happy to put myself out in front of 16 year olds if I have the honour and privilege to go forward for election any time in future.  I wonder if other potential candidates can say the same.</p></speech>

I am delighted and proud to debate the Bill in the Seanad.  I thank Senator Warfield for approaching me way back in July 2016 to co-sponsor the legislation.  The right to vote is the most fundamental right a citizen in an active democracy wields.  As legislators, it is our responsibility to support and encourage all of our citizens to engage in democracy at all levels.  I support strongly the empowerment of young people in all areas of public life.</p> <p>Irish people between the ages of 16 and 18 have a valuable contribution to make to the State culturally, socially, economically and, indeed, politically.  Young people are hugely impacted by political decisions.  Decisions made in the Oireachtas around education, employment and infrastructure will impact on the young most of all because it is their future for which we legislate.  Under our current laws, however, they are excluded from political decision-making which is why the Bill seeks to make a change.  Local government in Ireland is the most accessible form of democracy for young people.  Councillors are engaged in their local communities and are familiar to our young people who deserve to be given the chance to elect them.  At this critical juncture, we need now more than ever to engage young people in the debate over the future of the European Union.  That is why we have tabled this important Bill and it is why we are pressing it further through the Oireachtas.</p> <p>While the amendments were ruled out of order, I want to speak to them to highlight what their true intention was in terms of Fianna F&aacute;il putting them forward.  First, I want to comment briefly on the turnout at elections.  It is an odd thing to say a certain demographic should not have the vote because we do not have a turnout in a particular group.  If so many 18 year olds do not vote, should none of them vote?  If people from a certain demographic, perhaps with low socio-economic backgrounds, have a low turnout, maybe we should take the vote off them all.  Just because everyone does not vote, one does not exclude the ones who want to and will, hopefully setting an example for their peers and their friends to follow suit.</p></speech>

It is Fianna F&aacute;il policy but I could have torn its amendments apart.  It has had 12 months since we last dealt with this, when its members said they needed time to go through the Bill.  I wonder what Fianna F&aacute;il has been doing for the past 12 months so that its members cannot consider a Bill that is only a few lines long.  The youth wing of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are good enough to go out on the streets to canvass, fundraise and knock on doors to get people to vote for them but they are not good enough to cast a vote.  I do not understand what the parties are afraid of and I ask Fianna F&aacute;il, now that their amendments have been ruled out of order, to support the Bill and continue with their promise to reduce the voting age to 16 in local and European elections in 2019.</p><p>I remind the House that Senator Murnane O'Connor said, &quot;We support the principle of the Bill but we believe that the proper scrutiny should take place before it goes to Committee Stage.&quot;  That was a year ago and surely that has been enough time for proper scrutiny.  Senator Davitt said, &quot;Fine Gael can discuss whatever it wants to do, for example, sending this matter to a committee, but I do not know why that needs to be the case.&quot;  However, that is exactly what the party proposes to do today.  Senator Wilson said:</p><blockquote>[W]hen we resume after Christmas.  I give a commitment to this House that if this matter is not put on the agenda by the Government, I will table it on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</blockquote> <p>The party, however, tabled two amendments designed to weaken the legislation and delay this crucial Bill.  In the last debate, Senator Horkan said:</p><blockquote>I do not want anybody in this Chamber to say Fianna F&aacute;il is not in favour of implementation of this proposal in the fullness of time.  We absolutely want it to happen.</blockquote> <p>However, the party tabled amendments designed to set up a committee with no time limit, and which would clearly not have allowed Fianna F&aacute;il's own manifesto commitment to be realised.</p><p>All I ask is that Senators in this House stand by the statements they made the last time we debated this Bill.  We have already been forced to wait 12 months due to a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment stalling the Bill as they attempted to support lowering the voting age while delaying every attempt to make it happen in practice.  Let us not do that again.  Let us empower our young people to participate in politics.  We can do it today.  We do not need a special committee to write a report telling us what we already know, which is that the strongest and most vibrant democracies are those that include all citizens, young and old.  I strongly oppose any more delays to this Bill and I urge Senators to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#XX00600"><p>I commend Senators Warfield and Ruane for bringing this Bill forward.  Democracy, as we have known it, is under threat.  Governments are out of touch with their citizens and the gap between the citizen, particularly disenfranchised groups such as 16 year olds and 17 year olds and others who are marginalised or not heard, and their governments is fertile ground for the activities of the likes of Cambridge Analytica and its paymasters in the UK, the US and elsewhere.  It is truly disturbing.</p> <p>Having a committee in order to kick this Bill into touch is exactly the kind of antic which turns ordinary people off because they have no idea what it means.  They do not know what happens in such processes and they see whatever comes out at the other end as just delaying the Bill.  We need to find ways of combatting the manipulative, shadowy forces which are at work and to act urgently to make governments, including our Government, connect to the citizens they seek to serve.  One of the changes needed is to expand the franchise and to ensure that everyone is truly heard.  That is why I am supporting the vote at 16 Bill today.  Let us remember the people who will be given new voting rights if this Bill passes are often already old enough to drive, and until recently to get married, to join the Army and pay income tax.  The current state of affairs is taxation without representation, which is something we are all supposed to be against.</p> <p>If we reflect on the decisions made in these Houses over the past decade, it becomes abundantly clear that the voice and input of young people were absent and that young people bore the brunt of the great recession, as well as the one before it.  Their views, their perspectives and their realities were not reflected in these Houses and we were out of touch with them.  The ESRI states that one quarter of young people suffer from at least three of the following: income poverty; unable to afford basic goods; financial strain; poor health; mental distress; poor housing; overcrowding; neighbourhood problems; mistrust in institutions, including this one; and lack of social support or feeling safe.  In 2012, youth unemployment was over 30% and while the Government has made great progress, today the rate is still twice what it was in 2007.  Some 16,000 young people are still long-term unemployed and 90% of them said that being unemployed had had a negative effect on their sense of well-being.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, jobseeker's allowance for young people was cut from &euro;188 to &euro;100, an act of unforgivable blatant age discrimination.  With average room rents of &euro;80 per week, and maybe more, thousands of young people are left with &euro;20 to survive.  Those in work face the exploitation of zero-hour contracts or often dangerous food delivery-type jobs.  I look in horror at young people on the back of bicycles delivering pizzas and takeaways to the well-heeled.  Very often they have no sick benefit if they fall off their bike and injure themselves and that is a huge dereliction of duty which disproportionately affects young people aged 16, 17 or upwards.  This is the gig economy.</p> <p>In this House there is the blight of the unpaid internship, which happens all over the place.  Those who wish to study now pay the second highest fees in Europe and significant indebtedness is now the norm for young people.  Care leavers have been left to drift with no support and millennials are the first generation to be poorer than their parents since the Great Famine of the 1840s.  Security of tenure in housing and affordable housing, let alone owning a home, is beyond the wildest dreams of younger people these days.  The least we owe young people is a say, a vote and a voice so that we do not make the mistakes that put young people in that position.</p> <p>Reducing the voting age could be truly transformative as it is real political reform which would lead to meaningful change, especially at local level.  A lot of 16 year olds and 17 year olds are still living at home and it would be transformative in their own communities.  I hope we are not too late for the 2019 local elections and we need to act now, support the Bill today and reject any attempts to delay, committees or otherwise.</p></speech>

It is very clear and states that a person shall be entitled to be registered as a European elector in a constituency if he or she has reached the age of 16 years and if, on the qualifying date, he or she was ordinarily resident in that constituency and is either a citizen of Ireland or a national of a member state other than the State.  In most circumstances, they would be allowed to vote in European or local elections.  Given that it is such a simple and straightforward Bill, it is strange that both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il said we need to wait, perhaps for nine months, to think about it.  That is about a month for each line.  We have done that now and I hope we can demonstrate to the young people in the Gallery, who are all welcome, that we are here to legislate and not to procrastinate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are here to support this simple Bill, which, in theory, all political parties are apparently in favour of.  I have here the Fianna F&aacute;il document, Engaging the Future.  Perhaps it should be called &quot;Engaging the Future In the Future&quot; or &quot;Engaging the Future, but Just Not Now&quot;.<br/><br/>In fairness, there is a very good lesson here for the young people in the Gallery.  This debate demonstrates how pitiful politics can be at times.  I am referring to Fianna F&aacute;il, which tells people that it is in favour of the Bill, but not today.  Its document states that it wants to legislate so that young people aged between 16 and 18 can vote in local and European elections next year.  We have discovered today that what it really wanted to do was set up a committee to look into the issue in the fullness of time.  That is the phrase I use when my son is asking me for a new phone.  We know what it means.<br/><br/>Luke Casserly, a member of the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, wrote to me.  He made the case much more eloquently than I could in terms of why we need to support the Bill.  He said:</p><blockquote>I support the lowering of the voting age because I feel we need to empower young people to become actively involved in civic engagement and the political process.  I truly and honestly believe that there has never been a time when young people were so impassioned and engaged in their society.  Mental health, disability awareness, the eighth amendment and so many more issues prompt young people to write articles, start petitions and take to the streets.  It is time to empower these young people and respect them to the degree that we allow them to be equal to everyone else in Ireland.</blockquote><p>That is all we are looking to do today.  It is a shared Bill between civic engagement and Sinn F&eacute;in and we know we have the support of the Labour Party and a range of Independent Members on the issue.  According to their policies, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are in favour of the Bill.  Let us not make a show of the Chamber today.  Let us do what all of us know is the right thing to do, namely, support the Bill on Committee Stage, move it forward and ensure that the people in the Gallery and tens of thousands of others like them have the right to vote this time next year.  It is that simple. Let us do the right thing today.</p></speech>

I want to speak briefly on the section.  I wish to express my disappointment that an important measure may end up being long-fingered.  Senators Warfield, Ruane and Mac Lochlainn have done great work in getting the Bill to this stage and they outlined very clearly why the measure is needed.  I want to offer my full support.  This is a positive and progressive step to expand and improve our democracy and I would not like to see it being delayed.</p> <p>When we debated this issue in March 2017, it was agreed that the Bill would be paused for nine months to allow Senators and parties more time to deliberate on it.  There was a lot of support for the idea in principle across the Chamber, which was fantastic.  We were given the space to hear the arguments, look at the details and be ready for the Bill to return today.  Approximately one year later, it appears as though the Bill will be needlessly stalled again.  How many of those looking to delay the Bill actually used the time available to reach out to young people and youth organisations?  In the nine months granted to look at this issue, did anyone sit down with the National Youth Council of Ireland, For&oacute;ige, students' unions or the Children's Rights Alliance to hear how the Bill could help to boost youth participation?  We owe it to young people to take this issue seriously and I urge my colleagues across the House not to delay and cynically kick this to touch until after the next local elections.</p> <p>The proposal was discussed at an Oireachtas committees as long ago as 2010.  The Constitutional Convention debated and supported the proposal in 2016.  That is why the Bill is before us today.  There have been years of discussion.  I urge colleagues to support the Bill.  I appeal especially to Fianna F&aacute;il Senators to support it.  In 2017, Fianna F&aacute;il produced a manifesto which explicitly promised to lower the voting age from 18 years to age to 16 in time for the 2019 local elections.  It is only right that this promise be kept.</p> <p>We often speak about youth disengagement from politics and the lack of trust in formal democracy.  Political parties failing to live up to clear promises is a root cause of this problem.  We cannot say one thing and do another.  If we do, distrust in the system is an obvious response.</p> <p>Young people are interested, capable and want to participate.  Ireland can join a growing number of European states, including Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Malta and Norway, which have implemented or trialled a voting age of 16 years.  In particular, the enthusiasm and record turnout level of the UK's first 16 year old voters in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum showed what can be achieved when we trust and empower young people.  In response, the European Parliament officially backed voting at 16 years of age for the first time and urged member states to consider it for the 2019 European elections.  We now have the opportunity to be ready for 2019 and to allow young people across Ireland to vote in local and European elections.  I urge colleagues to support the Bill.</p></speech>

I want to tell the young people in the Gallery that I am the only Independent Senator in the Seanad.  Every other Independent Senator is part of a group.  Within that group, there is a tendency to speak for, with, by and around the group.  I am a completely Independent Senator and not, as somebody in Sinn F&eacute;in tried to point out, a person who cannot speak for herself.  That was co-ordinated into speaking against Sinn F&eacute;in because that is the way we all work in here.  It is not true.</p></speech>

I find the level of unhappiness and joylessness here fascinating.  It appears that if one does not get the vote at 16 and 17 years of age, life will never be the same.  In some ways there is a lack of joy here.</p> <p>I say a resounding and echoing "No" to the vote at 16 and 17 years of age.  It is fine at 18 years of age.  Four or five years ago, some of those in the Gallery were 12 years of age.  I am against the proposal.</p> <p>I received lots of brilliantly written emails from many students during the week.  I am not really interested in what happens in other countries.  One of the greatest weaknesses is when we copy other countries.  We should be entirely independent in the way we do things.  We are also not a students' union and do not think like one.  We are the Upper House of the Oireachtas and we have to think about the common good.</p> <p>I suggest that students stay away from politics.  It is quite sacrilegious of me to say that.  I suggest that, instead, they should get on with the creative and imaginative things I know they are brilliant at and continue to get on with their education, travel, arts, romance, music, expression and sport.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State speaks to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, he will discover that he was one of the people who advocated the council back in the day.  It has been a tremendous success.  Students elected their representatives from various secondary schools across the county onto the youth council and then those councillors attended local area council meetings and submitted to us the issues of concern.  It could have been mental health, supports around drugs or, as often was the case, resource centres.  These were issues that were pertinent to young people, and the issues they brought to our attention as councillors came from their fellow students.  I am immensely proud of it, and every time I engaged with their elected councillors I made it clear to them that they did not come to us as anything other than equals, that they had a mandate, just like we did, and that they had a right to put their issues on the table and then come back in a number of months' time to see whether those issues had been addressed.  That is an excellent model.  Those young people in secondary school are engaging with the political and democratic process.  They are realising that they have rights and the capacity to raise those rights and to ensure they are acted upon in their community.  It was empowering.  It was the right way to go.</p> <p>I found myself a number of years later watching the young people take part in the debate on the independence referendum in Scotland, discussing whether or not they would vote for independence.  It was the first time, as the Minister of State knows, that 16 and 17 year olds had the ability to participate.  I found it inspirational to see these young people so well informed on such a huge, profound issue as the future constitutional position of their country and arguing either side of that debate.  We must stop patronising young people.  We must stop talking to them as if we know what it is like to be a 16, 17, 18 or 19 year old.  I am 44.  I am totally disconnected from these matters.  People say I am young.  I am not young; I am middle-aged.</p></speech>

I have always thought so in all my times engaging with him.  I ask him to look at the potential of this in the context of the local and European elections next year.  Imagine the exciting opportunity it will present to engage with these young people I have seen who have continued to be elected in my time and since in the local authorities in Donegal and all across the country, because of course these frameworks are replicated across the State.  This is a really exciting opportunity to say to young people who are finishing their secondary school education, who have been through their transition year, who are thinking about their future, going into college and what they are going to do with their lives, that they can now participate in the process of local government and European elections.

I will just say that this is an opportunity for us in this Chamber to stop patronising young people, to involve them in a real way in the political process and, perhaps, God forbid, to capture the imagination of young people across the State and, in a tangible way, empower them to be involved in who represents them at local and European elections.  These are our future - there is that word again - leaders.  Let us stop patronising them.</p></speech>

It is perfect timing for the people of Ireland who are 16 years of age.  I have full confidence in their ability to process information and vote in European and local elections.  The school years of transition year, fifth year and sixth year are a perfect time to bring our young people of Ireland into the whole process of voting.  Therefore, I cannot understand why Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will stop this process or why, as some of my colleagues have said, they will kick it to touch and throw it back into another committee.  What exactly is the problem?</p> <p>I believe in the people of Ireland, the students, those involved in so many different committees, those who campaign and go out door to door canvassing for different parties and Independents at the age of 16 and those who went out around my home town of Tramore - my own daughters, in fact - at the age of 15 and 16, canvassing for marriage equality.  I urge the House to give the people, the students, those at the age of 16 the choice and the chance and allow them to vote in the European and local elections.  I really do not understand what some Members' problem is.  The Green Party fully supports this legislation, and I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will consider its position and support it also.</p></speech>

That is such a negative message to send to young people.  It comes from a position where politics does not affect one's life very much.  However, if someone comes from a background like mine, where political decisions to which people do not have access literally shape the environment without them being able to contribute to it, politics is very important.  I learned that at a very young age.  Maybe if one has the ability to focus solely on one's hobbies or education, then politics seems like some sort of luxury but for people who are outside the loop of politics, without access to some of those things, politics is what will decide their fate for ever more.  It will determine if they are able to access education in the first place.  It will determine whether they have a sports ground on which to pursue the hobbies Senator O'Donnell talks about.  We do not have the same access, and politics was very important to me.</p> <p>When I was 13, I remember standing out on a street after my friend was knocked down by a bus.  We had experienced a few deaths leading up to that incident.  There were no ramps on that road.  It was the first time I felt really exercised and conscious that I needed politicians to do something.  We needed ramps, and we protested for three days.  The protest was made up of children.  There was not an adult, 18 year old or 25 year old in sight.  We were aged ten, 11, 12 or 13 years old, and we barricaded that ring-road for days until somebody put ramps in to stop children from dying on it.</p> <p>Young people need to be able to have a say in their community.  We, the young people, got those ramps built.  In the schools, we got the uniforms changed for those who did not want to wear skirts.  My 11 year old is educating her class in school on the issue of trans people's rights.  I would trust her with my vote more than some people in this room, and they are elected.  She is 11 years old.  It is very patronising to tell me I should discourage young people from getting involved in politics.  I know this is verging on a rant, but it really upset me.</p> <p>Politics is about activism, involvement and community.  It is about having a say and being heard.  It is about being able to be part of a decision-making process.  It does not mean being among the lucky few that get to stand in this House.  We are the minority, and I reiterate that.  Politics takes place across the country in many forms, at many levels.  It is not all about elections or youth wings of parties.  It is about people being enfranchised, empowered and able to make change in their own lives, their communities and their families.  We should never ever discourage that.</p></speech>

It is indeed a short piece of legislation and I commend the Senators who produced the Bill, namely, Senators Warfield, Ruane and Mac Lochlainn, who is young, despite his protestations earlier as I was trying to interrupt him.  The only interruption I made was to say that his beard makes him look young.</p> <p>The Government and I support the reduction of the voting age to 16, but we oppose this legislation on the basis of the decision made last September to publish a list of upcoming referendums.  One of these, on the eighth amendment, is to be held this summer.  Two are scheduled for the fall of this year, on blasphemy and on the provisions in the Constitution regarding women, respectively.  At the same time, there is the possibility of plebiscites in Dublin and Cork with regard to directly elected mayors.  The next scheduled referendum concerns the reduction of the voting age, and this is due to coincide with the local and European elections in 2019.</p> <p>I wish that I could say, particularly to the people in the Visitors Gallery, that it would happen sooner.  I made a decision approximately 20 years ago, roughly around this time, to stand for local government.  I was 19 years of age.  My parents, friends and family thought I was absolutely mad, but it was the correct decision for me and I do not regret it for one minute.  The Acting Chairman spoke about parties getting people involved.  I joined my party when I was 15.  I was not a fund-raiser, but I was a leaflet dropper, canvasser and campaigner.</p> <p>I commend most of the contributions.  I could not disagree with much of what was said by Senators across the House.  Senator Warfield mentioned 29 March 2017, when this Bill was on Second Stage.  The Government decision to outline when the list of eight referendums would be held was made on 26 September.  We could all argue about the timing of different referendums, but the ones that are scheduled prior to the voting age are equally important measures.</p> <p>One of the privileges I have, after spending nine years as a Member of this House, is the assistance of officials who help me in my role as Minister of State.  I had their assistance in looking back at the results of the questions on the issue of voting age that were put at the Constitutional Convention.  This Chamber, including the people who are watching and those in the Visitors Gallery, is not very reflective of what the convention said, if we are honest.  It said that 52 of those who voted were in favour of reducing the voting age, 47 were not, and one person expressed no opinion.  This is central to the legislation we are discussing.  Overwhelmingly, the convention said that if the voting age is reduced to 16, it should be reduced for every election and not just for local and European elections.  Some 68% of the members present at the Constitutional Convention favoured that and only 28% favoured what we are discussing today, a partial reduction.</p></speech>

There are similar pieces of legislation in the D&aacute;il on extending voting rights.  I disagree with Senator Gavin in the sense that while his point about this being a simple piece of legislation is absolutely right, it is very fundamental because we are speaking about changing the register of electors on which every campaign and election is based.  The last time this area was broached was in terms of electronic voting, and whatever we might think about the electoral process at times, the general public guards jealously the integrity of the process.  I am not saying that increasing the register would necessarily compromise that integrity, but it would be a significant change and it is incorrect to describe it as modest or small.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan said I should be aware of what is happening in Young Fine Gael.  It is a long time since I was directly aware, I have to say.</p> <p>Senator Black stated she was in favour of the Bill, but I want to point out again the Constitutional Convention, to which numerous Senators including Senator Black referred, specifically in its vote went against this proposal.  Its point overwhelmingly was there should be a reduction across the board rather than just for European and local elections.  There is an issue with regard to whether 16 should be the age.  In principle I favour, as does the Government, the reduction of the voting age, but all of these numbers are arbitrary in a sense.  Where did 18 come from originally?  Why is it used for so many things now?  What special status does somebody who is 18 have, that somebody who is 17 years and 364 days does not have?  Lawmakers and legislators make decisions to draw a particular line, and 18, 16 or 17 are the ages at which certain coming of age events happen, such as getting a driver's licence and being able to have a drink, vote or enter a committed legally-based relationship.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan asked whether this had disappeared within Fine Gael or the Government, but it has not.  The Taoiseach took office last summer, and in September the Government decision was this should be listed as one of the referendums to be held.  As I have said, a number of other equally serious topics are to go to a referendum.</p> <p>Senator Ruane gave one of the best speeches I have ever heard.  I disagree with her on virtually everything in terms of her economic outlook, but with regard to her reasoning as to why young people should be involved in politics, I hope some people are watching what is going on in the Seanad and have seen what she said, because the decisions made here and at local authority level, mostly at local level, have such an impact on the lives of young people as well as those of older people.</p> <p>I am not sure whether Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is sometimes provocative.  The point she was trying to make, perhaps, was that young people should not necessarily devote all of their time to party politics, but politics is a very different thing and she gave as fine a description of this as anybody could on ensuring the views of younger people are represented.</p> <p>Senator Kelleher spoke about taxation without representation.  Alas, it exists.  Even for a right-winger, Fine Gaeler like me, I have long been a supporter of a points system for citizenship.  Thousands of people in this country pay a lot of tax and do not have a vote because residency does not entitle people to a D&aacute;il vote.  They might have a vote in a local or European election if they are from the EU.  The principle of taxation without representation exists, but I accept the other points she made.  She spoke about zero-hour contracts and the jobs younger people do.  There is legislation on changing the rules and outlawing zero-hour contracts, which is to be greatly welcomed.</p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan spoke about her family involvement in politics at 15 and 16.   Other Senators have also spoken.  The position is the Government has made a decision this referendum should be held in 2019.  The reason we feel we cannot support this legislation is if 16 and 17 year olds have a vote in the next local and European elections in 2019 and the general public comes out and votes against it in a referendum on the same day, while it would not necessarily be open to legal challenge, because the Oireachtas has the power to legislate on the voting age in terms of European and local elections, it would just be wrong to have a situation where people who are 16 and 17 have a vote that day but the general public might say something quite different in a referendum.  This is the position the Government is taking.  I do not think it is kicking it down the road.  I think it is a logical position for the Government to take.</p></speech>

It would engage 16 and 17 year olds now.  It would also give some statistical data to go on as to the overall engagement of 16 and 17 year olds.  The Minister of State did not kick it down the road.  He kicked it down the motorway so far I cannot see it any more.  Promises of referendums are nothing but promises that blow in the wind.  We make promises in here, in manifestoes and in all sorts of things all the time.  This is a simple piece of legislation that would offend nobody, but perhaps it is scaring the living daylights out of the traditional political parties who might have to face a young electorate in 2019.</p></speech>

The latter group were taking on the most redundant stereotypes of young people as apathetic and stuck on smartphones and they were the adults in their community in that situation.  They are in conversation around lowered voting ages across the United States.</p> <p>Senator Bacik mentioned the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 events taking place this year and on 17 April the Seanad Chamber will play host to a debate among transition year students as part of the events.  We would all support such an event and we should dwell on the irony of inviting young people to this Chamber as part of a suffrage programme while trying to deny them their suffrage.  Young people are mature enough to debate societal issues in their Parliament but we are telling them not to come anywhere near us if they want voting rights or to truly have their say.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell mentioned the promises of referenda but the referendum to lower the age at which a citizen can run for President was one of the greatest defeats of any referendum in the history of this State.  If the Government really wanted to pass that referendum in 2019 it should pass this Bill today, and follow Malta's example, where they lowered the voting age for local and European elections two years ago and have now moved to lower it across all elections.</p></speech>

It is time for the much-promised referendum on reducing the voting age to 16 or 17.  We must look at the voting age in other countries.  In Austria, only 16 year olds who are working can vote and in 2015, 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland were granted the vote for local and Scottish elections.  They had been allowed to vote in the previous year's referendum on independence, with a claimed turnout of at least 75%.</p> <p>In many South American countries voting reforms were taken in tandem with education reforms.  We must start with education and give the power of knowledge to our young people so that, one day, they might use it.  We need to introduce political studies into primary schools and offer it as an exam subject in the secondary curriculum.  I was delighted to hear of two primary schools in my constituency, Bennekerry national school and the Educate Together school, holding their inaugural student council meetings last week with students, aged between eight and 13 years old, elected by their peers.  I am told that some of them could be budding politicians.</p> <p>Our 16 year olds and 17 year olds are the future and Sinn F&eacute;in needs to realise that we all know how capable they are of voting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all have a different point of view, but we all know - and this has to be clarified in particular for Sinn F&eacute;in - that young people, 16 and 17 year olds, are capable to vote.

A referendum is supposed to be in line for next May; a referendum for young people of that age group of 16 and 17 to vote.  Is this referendum going to happen?  I guarantee that Fianna F&aacute;il and I will knock on doors about this issue to make sure these young people will get the vote.  We will then definitely look at local elections and European elections.  The young people today deserve to vote in local, general and European elections.  If Sinn F&eacute;in was of the same mind it would be making sure, from today, that the referendum is held next year.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il will work to make sure there is a referendum next year and that the young people of Ireland who are our future, our young budding Presidents, our young Taoisigh and our future Ministers will get the choice and they will be able to vote in the three elections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#EEE00200"><p>One cannot become President until the age of 35.  This is an important point given what was said previously.  I am aware that this issue was looked at in an earlier referendum, but in the spirit of the topic under discussion today it may be something we could look at moving forward.</p> <p>I could reiterate nearly everything I said in my last contribution about the semantics of the aspiration to give young people the vote for local government elections but I will not.  It applies right across the board.  I am for giving young people the vote at the age of 16 in all elections.  Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a Bill in the last D&aacute;il that sought to enfranchise all Irish citizens with a vote in presidential elections.  Part of the Bill proposed to lower the voting age in presidential elections to the age of 16.  Sinn F&eacute;in is consistent in this and we have put our money where our mouths are in the limited capacity we have in both Houses, to try to ensure people from the age of 16 have the right to be full and equal participants as we seek to tax them and seek to impose upon them laws that are created in this House, which would impact on their lives while we would not trust them to have a vote in return.</p> <p>While I support the lowering of the voting age across the board, local government elections are probably the front face of politics and they are probably the level at which most people - not just young people - engage with elected representatives.  During this debate reference was made to the Youth Forum in Belfast, which does a fantastic job.  It is very active and sometimes it puts the elected representatives to shame with the passion, energy, commitment and drive it brings to campaigns and important issues in the city.  The Youth Forum really inspires me.  There is a notion of b&eacute;alghr&aacute; and platitudes towards young people.  The previous contribution was one of the most dishonest political sentiments I have heard expressed in the House.  The position is clear for all to see.  It is on the record so I will not get into a back and forth with Senator Murnane O'Connor about it; to be honest I actually feel a wee bit sorry for her as a colleague.  The Senator has been left in here to fight the so-called good fight on her own.  It is telling as to where Fianna F&aacute;il's heads are at in this regard that they cannot come in to stand by the Senator and to try to justify the stance taken today and previously.</p> <p>I will now turn to the sentiment of the Bill.  Young people should have the vote.  It is right.  I expressed this view earlier.  Young people are energised and they are engaged on the political issues of the day, be it at international, national or local level.  This Bill seeks to empower young people in the first instance at local government elections.  I was 25 years of age when I was appointed as Belfast's youngest Lord Mayor.  I think I was 20 or 21 when I first stood in an Assembly election in the North, for Belfast East, in 2007.  Young people are engaged, they have been engaged and they will be engaged as we move forward.  We have seen this over recent referendum campaigns in this State and I am sure that we will certainly see it in the upcoming referendum campaigns.</p> <p>As I said earlier, it is about trusting young people.  It is not about coming in to the House and giving it the tired old clich&eacute;s or kicking it down the lane, as we have heard some Members profess.  In the spirit of republican politics, this is about enfranchising citizens, empowering and enabling people and giving them a full and equal say in the life of their State and their politics. </p></speech>

It is insulting.  I ask people to not insult the intelligence of young people.  We speak about encouraging and helping young people but we are not listening to them.  We are certainly not hearing them.  They say that they do not want a referendum; they want to have the votes.  We have the power to do that here and now, and we are not doing it.  By not doing that we say to them that we do not trust or respect them - end of story.  One should not insult their intelligence with a promise that something will happen in the future.</p><p>There is a practical aspect to people having a vote at the age of 16 and 17, especially in rural areas.  If a young person goes on the electoral register at the age of 16 while he or she still at school and still at the home address, there is a better chance of that person voting as he or she goes through the life cycle.  We should not be afraid of it but there is a fear.  Why will people not change things?  It is often because they are afraid of it.  The fear comes from possibility that the <i>status quo</i>might change and the order of society might, in some way, change to cause discomfort to those who have all the power.  As a mother of a 14 year old and a 16 year old it really disheartens me today to hear these are other young people being patronised around this issue.  It is very plain and simple; young people should be trusted to vote and people should be encouraged to vote and have a say in their society.  Otherwise one should forget about it and rather than giving them the words and they should simply be told it is not going to be done.  One should at least be honest.</p></speech>

It proposes to extend voting for local elections.  It is three lines in all.  Once again, I ask Members to consider the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael consider this Bill so onerous that they wanted us to wait nine months, nine months ago, for these nine lines of a Bill.  Now they want to push the boat out again.  They are very clear in saying to the young people "we are in favour of you having a right to vote, but just not yet".  This is the same as saying "until you are 18".</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State.  While I disagree with the responses he has given to the House, I acknowledge that he has responded to all of the points made.  This is a refreshing change.  I smiled when the Minister of State described himself as a right wing Fine Gael member.  There is no other kind.</p></speech>

I do not want to repeat the reason I gave initially but I will re-emphasise one of them.  The whole basis for this discussion, and for the numerous Private Members' Bills in both Houses, is the decision of the Convention on the Constitution with regard to reducing the voting age.  The vote of the convention was 52 members in favour, 47 against with one abstention.  I believe the flavour of the debate here has not been reflective of the public opinion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not share Senator Warfield's pessimism that a referendum on lowering the voting age would necessarily be lost.  He spoke about lowering the age at which a citizen can run for President, and other Members also referenced that.  A proper campaign could be fought on that issue and people are free to make up their own minds on that question.</p><p>I would refer to the results of the vote on the subject of this legislation at the Constitutional Convention, namely, the splitting of voting ages with a different voting age for local elections, European elections and D&aacute;il elections.  The results of the vote at the convention were 68 in favour of a common voting age for all elections, 28 in favour of different voting ages for them and five abstentions. </p><p>I advise Senator Murnane O'Connor that the referendum that will be held this May is on the eighth amendment.  The other amendment is to be held the following May.</p></speech>

I hope I am not coming across as patronising.</p> <p>What Senator Mac Lochlainn said earlier about older people pretending to be younger and knowing what younger people want, struck a chord with me.  I tend to agree with him on that.  However, we have an onus to be honest with people.  It would be unconscionable for any Government to vote now to reduce the voting age in marked contravention of the vote at the Constitutional Convention on this question which said that there should be a common voting age across all elections.  There is also the possibility that a future referendum might overturn that decision.  Whoever will be in government at the time will act to implement the result of any referendum on the voting age.  I am sure the Oireachtas as a whole will act to do so, but until that referendum is held, to hold European and local elections, which would have voters of 16 and 17 years of age casting a ballot on the same day that the public might make a different decision would be completely unsatisfactory to say the least.  I am not disputing the legitimacy of the arguments that have been made.  </p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke about the involvement of secondary school students.  It is a matter of luck in terms of the year one is born and when one gets a vote.  The age of 18 or 16 are arbitrary.  There are plenty of 15 year olds who are interested.  My political awakening happened when I was eight years of age and Garret FitzGerald signed the Anglo Irish Agreement.  I decided at that age that I wanted to be a politician but I was a particularly weird child.  My first vote was in the 1997 general election when I was doing my leaving certificate.  The vote on the Good Friday Agreement, which took place very shortly after that, was my second vote and I was a secondary school student at the time.  Even under our current system, secondary school students have a vote, but that is not the point.  The principle is whether the voting age should be reduced.  A decision has been made that this question should be put to the public in 2019.</p></speech>

As many Members will be aware, the ratification of the convention has been a deeply held commitment of mine since I was appointed as the very first Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues.  The very creation of this office signals a firm commitment by this Government to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p> <p>Today, 21 March, is World Down Syndrome Day.  The day is significant in that persons with Down's syndrome have a third chromosome on the 21st strand, hence the chosen date of the 21st day of the third month.  Later this evening, I will leave this House to launch a photographic exhibition organised by Down Syndrome Ireland.  The theme of the exhibition, "What I Bring to My Community", encapsulates so much of my thinking regarding people with disability in society.</p> <p>As a father to a daughter with Down's syndrome, this is an important day for my family and me.  It reminds me of one of my primary reasons for being in politics, namely, to advocate for the rights, inclusion and well-being of all persons with disabilities.  There has been some recent commentary and criticism suggesting that the ratification of the convention is a paper-based exercise or PR stunt or that it will not make any difference to people's lives.  I assure Senators that if that were the case, I would not have pursued ratification so doggedly.  The issue was so important to me that I made sure it was a part of the programme or Government.</p> <p>People ask if ratification will make any difference to everyday lives.  I firmly believe that it will.  The purpose of the convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities and promote respect for their inherent dignity.  To put it another way, the convention provides that people with disabilities should have the same rights as everyone else, and should be provided with the practical supports that make that aspiration a reality.</p> <p>Ratifying the convention signals our commitment to the ongoing improvement in the provision of disability services.  In keeping with this principle, I recognise that there is always much to be done, including ratification of the optional protocol.  Furthermore, while we have already made significant progress in reforming the law on decision-making capacity and participation in family life, there still remains some legislation to be enacted.  I accept the points on that issue.</p> <p>It was originally intended to introduce the deprivation of liberty provisions in the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 as amendments on Committee Stage.  However, owing to the complexity and far-reaching implications of the proposals and in response to feedback, the Government decided it was better to deal with the issues separately.  The provisions will now feature in a stand-alone Bill to be sponsored by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and me.  My target for the enactment of the legislation is the end of this year.  A public consultation on draft heads of the Bill on this issue concluded on 9 March.  I offer my sincere thanks to everyone who made a submission.  A number of organisations have been granted an extension until mid-April, and I look forward to receiving these submissions in due course.</p> <p>The central problem to be addressed by the new provisions is that existing legislation does not provide a procedure for admitting persons without capacity to relevant facilities in which they will be under continuous supervision and control and will not be free to leave.  Existing legislation also does not provide a procedural safeguard to ensure that individuals are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The draft legislation proposals that I published for public consultation last December are designed to address this gap by providing safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and some categories of people with mental illness, to ensure they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in certain residential facilities.  The development of these deprivation of liberty legislative provisions is a highly complex undertaking.  In addition to satisfying the requirements of the UNCRPD, the provisions must also align with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and existing legislation such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health Act 2001.</p> <p>Other implementation issues that are required to meet our obligations under the UNCRPD will be addressed via the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Government has given the approval for the Bill to receive priority within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and work is under way to progress the Bill for enactment by the end of the year, hopefully sooner.</p> <p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 also needs to be fully commenced.  A total of &euro;3 million in funding has now been allocated in 2018 for the establishment of the decision support service, with will be the engine room in the context of the UN convention.  There has been some commentary in recent weeks on the ratification of the optional protocol, which has not been ratified at this time.  It will be ratified as soon as possible following the completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle.  This will provide an opportunity to identify areas for improvement and any actions needed for a high level of compliance.  While I accept that a commitment to ratify the optional protocol at the same time as the convention was given in the 2015 roadmap, my current focus as Minister of State has been on ratifying the convention in the first instance.  This was to be the first step.</p> <p>As I have outlined, the convention and the optional protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which will require substantive cultural change.  Indeed, an analysis of some 14 complaints brought under the optional protocol since 2010 highlights a range of areas that we are working hard to address, such as the deprivation of liberty and the right of deaf persons to participate in jury duty.  Work is continuing on the final reforms needed for Ireland's compliance with the convention's requirements.  For this reason, a phased approach is seen as the most practical and realistic way of moving forward.</p> <p>The other question people often ask me about the convention relates to resources.  This has been raised many times by my colleagues in the Seanad.  I fully agree that to support people effectively in accessing their rights, the proper allocation of resources is a key consideration.  As politicians, we need to mindful of any changes in policy and resourcing that could significantly impact on everyday circumstances.  For example, since the closure of the mobility allowance, the Government decided that the HSE would continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to 4,133 people in receipt of a mobility allowance, pending the establishment of a new transport support scheme.  Work on proposals for the replacement scheme is at an advanced stage.</p> <p>I have always placed  a strong emphasis on securing adequate funding, with &euro;1.76 billion allocated by the Department of Health for disability services in 2018 representing an increase of 4.4% on 2017.  Furthermore, in December 2017, following consultation with families and members of this House, I announced an additional &euro;10 million in funding for respite care had been secured.</p> <p>It is not just about funding.  We need to focus on this point.  We need to challenge attitudes and recognise the valuable contribution that persons with disabilities can make to our economy and society when supported to do so.  We need to focus on ability rather than disability.  In Ireland, we have strong equality legislation which prevents discrimination the basis of disability.  However, people with disabilities are still only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  This is why we launched the comprehensive employment strategy in 2015.  The strategy sets out a ten-year approach, ensuring that people who are able to work and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  There is a huge pool of talent in the disability sector.  It includes commitments such as an increase in the public services employment target on a phased basis from 3% to 6%; special public service competitions, and the opening up of alternative recruitment channels; and the provision of an employment helpline, assisted by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers.  These are concrete examples of how Ireland can fulfil its obligations under the convention.  I note also that we are way ahead of some other countries that have already ratified the convention.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This country has embarked on an era of unprecedented change in services for people with disabilities over recent years which means we are now ready to meet those obligations.</p><p>In July 2017, I launched the national disability inclusion strategy.  It takes a whole-of-government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities and contains more than 100 measurable and time-specific actions that relate to the areas of education, employment, provision of public services, health, transport, and personal safety and autonomy.  The strategy and the robust monitoring framework supported by the NDA leaves us well placed to respond to the requirements of the convention.</p><p>In the context of living in the community, we will continue to implement Time to Move On to give those who currently reside in institutions the choice and control over where and with whom they live.  Relevant to this is the programme for Government commitment to reduce the number of people living in congregated settings by at least one third by 2021 and to ultimately close all such settings.  At the end of 2017, there were fewer than 2,400 people living in a congregated setting, and this year the HSE intends to move 170 more out of these old-style institutions into the community and support them to live independently.  The national housing strategy for people with a disability has been extended to support this objective.</p><p>Another key commitment in the programme for Government was the establishment of a task force on personalised budgets for people with disabilities, which I launched in September 2016.  The task force has been asked to analyse approaches in other jurisdictions and recommend an approach and an implementation strategy for the introduction of personalised budgets in Ireland.  This task force is an example of my thinking and belief regarding people with a disability that we must allow them to say how they wish to lead their own lives.  It will be a core element in responding to some of the fundamental principles of the convention that we respect dignity, autonomy, independence and the freedom to make one's own choices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#JJJ00200"><p>My colleagues and I obviously support the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This has the potential to be an important moment for tens of thousands of people living with disabilities in this country.</p> <p>Ratification has been a long time coming and we have criticised the Government for delays on many occasions.  Of course, ratification alone will not end the systemic discrimination that those with disabilities face day in, day out in this country.  One should bear in mind that ratification coincided with the fifth anniversary of withdrawal of the mobility allowance for new entrants and we are still awaiting its replacement, even though I acknowledge the Minister of State said that the replacement scheme is at an advanced stage.  For ratification to be meaningful in the longer term and to be prompt, we need to end this discrimination.  It requires each and every organisation and agency to look at itself and how it treats persons with disabilities, and it fundamentally requires the Government to end structural bias in terms of accessing services from the State.</p> <p>Ratification is a welcome step in the important journey towards equality.  Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then successive Governments have emphasised Ireland's commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative requirements under the convention are met.  We are all aware, unfortunately, that "urgent" and "immediate" do not have the same meaning in the political world as they do in the real world.</p> <p>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities follows decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with disabilities.  The UN continues to lead fantastic campaigns.  For example, I am sure the Senators are all aware today is World Down Syndrome Day.  It is a global awareness day when we, as a single global voice, advocate for the rights, inclusion and well-being of people with Down's syndrome.  The convention is intended as a human rights instrument with an explicit social development dimension.  It adopts a broad categorisation of persons with disabilities and reaffirms that all persons with all types of disabilities must enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations must be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights on areas where their rights have been violated and where protection of rights must be reinforced.</p> <p>I take this opportunity to particularly commend the work of our colleague, Senator John Dolan, in this regard.  I heard Senator Dolan state he celebrated the ratification with a cup of tea, and importantly a biscuit, with his wife and daughter.  No one knows better than Senator Dolan that this ratification, while fantastic, is only the beginning.  There are complex challenges ahead of us all.  I say "us all" because this is an issue not only for disability campaigners alone.  This is a job for every leader, every party and every public representative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#JJJ00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.</p> <p>I will not repeat what I stated previously about this issue but only say, "Well done."  It has been a huge personal ambition as well as a political ambition for the Minister of State to get the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified.  It is has been a difficult road.  I have been here and at other meetings where people have been critical.  The Minister of State has been consistent.  He has been patient.  He has built the foundations and the bricks to something important which is really positive.  I accept it was slow and disappointing and there were many setbacks along the way but I want to acknowledge, first, Deputy Finian McGrath's work.</p> <p>I want also to take a bit of time to thank a few people.  I thank the disability advocates up and down this country who, time and time again, have waited outside the gates of Leinster House in the rain.  They went all over this country.  They campaigned with Senators, Deputies and county councillors.  It is a great day for them.</p> <p>I also acknowledge - Senator Swanick was right to say so - the work of Senator John Dolan and his background team, including Ms Doreen Magee, because the day I met Senator Dolan he spoke about this and the vision to get this done.  Senator Dolan is a great advocate for the disability sector.  Senator Dolan will be aware, from those he has dealt with, there have been many disappointments and setbacks but I think we can genuinely say we are now going forward, and I acknowledge that.</p> <p>I acknowledge the work of Senator Mark Daly on his Irish Sign Language Act 2017 and what he did in terms of another strand of advocacy for the disability sector.  I also acknowledge my colleague, Senator Martin Conway, for his work on the NCBI and his other work in terms of the visually impaired.  Senator Conway has been a long-time advocate for the disability sector.  He kindly received a large delegation I invited here some years ago from the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind who were greatly taken by the fact that a Senator should take the time to invite them in, show them the House, explain the processes, and give them a sense that they could be empowered and lobby politicians.  They really appreciate that.  I salute Martin and say that I, too, was an outsider coming in and I was very impressed.  It is worth taking time out to thank people.</p> <p>Finally, I thank a champion for the disability sector in Arklow, County Wicklow, Councillor Miriam Murphy, who has single-handedly advocated in the community and the local authority.  She attends the local authority and experiences the great difficulties of being wheelchair bound, in terms of accessing her town of Arklow, her community and her council.  As she herself would say, she has continuously been a thorn in the side of officials in terms of advocacy.</p> <p>Councillor Murphy asked me to ask three questions and I will ask them for her today because I want to use my time for advocates rather than for what I think.  What sanctions will there be if people do not comply?  Can we be assured that every one of the 31 local authorities in this country will have a full designated disability access officer who will deal with the issues?  I have heard of terrible stories where persons with disabilities have arrived to public toilets in local authority offices and been told the staff are sorry that the toilets are locked or there is no one available to facilitate them.  This is unacceptable behaviour.  Hopefully, we have moved past that situation.</p> <p>Through his work as Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities, will Deputy McGrath seek to have a designated, full time, funded and resourced disability officer in each of the 31 local authorities?  I do not want this to be an appendix to some other position or some other person who does something three days a week and does disability advocacy on the other days of the week.  That is a really important question that Councillor Miriam Murphy asked me to out to the Minister of State today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Social housing and special access housing is another issue.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and this issue has exercised us.  We must be proactive on it.  The Minister of State mentioned empowering people, independence, dignity, autonomy and the right to decide one's future.  Those are key words.  However, I also know people who have lived in congregated settings and who enjoyed living in such settings.  The difference is that they do not necessarily wish to live in an old, run-down, institutional building.  People get comfort from living in community.  A person who has a disability and who has lived in care for many years might wish to continue to live in care.  That must also be an alternative choice.  I have visited people from a place which ended the congregated setting in south County Dublin.  The reports are not good.  I have met people who have been put in isolation in flats and bedsits.  They did not have the supports.  We might say it is institutionalisation but some people get comfort from being with one another.  That is not a bad thing.  Some of us like to live alone but it is all about choice.  We should not rule out the need for a modern new approach for village or community living for people with disabilities.</p><p>I wish to mention a final area.  In the disability sector, people somehow fail to realise that people have rights of expression, sexual needs and rights to be authentic as people.  These are important fundamental rights.  They are areas that people in the disability sector have spoken about to me recently.  They are personal and intimate conversations where they feel in some way that they are not allowed to express themselves and that they are not valued and supported in that way.  They feel dehumanised.  They feel that somehow they are not valued if they talk about their needs over and above accommodation, education, a job or training.  This is about respect, allowing people to feel authentic, secure and supported and expanding their horizons.  Many people never got that opportunity.  I am talking about a group of people in their 60s and 70s.  There is still a lot of living for people in those age groups.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I realise this has been a personal journey for him and his family.  He has been absolutely committed.  He has had to broker many of the frustrations and to build consensus, including within the Government which is not always easy.  The challenge now will be to have the money and resources he requires to set out his vision.  I ask the Minister of State to pass on my thanks to his staff and background team whom I have met on many occasions.  They have always been available and have been with the Minister of State consistently on this journey.  Well done to everybody.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#KKK00200"><p>Like my colleagues, I welcome the Minister of State back to the House and congratulate him on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is a significant step forward in establishing the rights of people with disabilities.</p> <p>I will start where Senator Boyhan concluded and acknowledge the backroom staff of Deputy Finian McGrath, in particular Gerry Maguire and Damien O'Farrell, who have done great work in terms of bedding down what is a relatively new Ministry.  We have not previously had a Minister at the Cabinet table with specific responsibility for disabilities.  When Deputy Finian McGrath took up his position in 2016, there was high expectation that he would deliver quickly.  Unfortunately, as with everything in life, big bodies move very slowly.  It can be very technical and challenging.  One could have the best heart in the world to get something done in a particular timeline but when one actually undertakes it one can discover complications, challenges and difficulties that might not have been anticipated.  Anybody who has ever carried out a house extension or renovation will have discovered on commencing it that much more was required to get the product right than would have initially been tendered.  I see that very much in the case of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There were probably many technical issues that had to be ironed out.  To get it over the line within less than 24 months of taking over that portfolio, given the fact that the process had been going on for so many years prior to that, is a significant achievement.</p> <p>I see the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a mission statement, to a large extent.  It is a very important one.  Our country is saying that it will do what other United Nations countries are doing.  Senator Swanick referred to Senator Dolan having a cup of tea and a biscuit with his wife and daughter to celebrate the ratification and the Minister jokingly asked where the champagne was.  The champagne will be drunk when there are plenty of employment opportunities for people with disabilities, no problem with housing for people with disabilities, when they have no problems with access to services and when we can truly say in 2028, the date mentioned by the Minister, that this is a country that respects every one of its citizens equally.</p> <p>I tend to look at the glass as being half full, although I certainly see that there is another half to go.  Throughout my personal journey with disability, I have always tried to be positive and to advocate in a positive manner.  I believe that works well.  My good friend and colleague, Senator Dolan, does the same.  Consider what this House has achieved with Senator Mark Daly's Bill on Irish Sign Language and the advocacy that is carried out by Members such as Senators Dolan and Mark Daly.  We play a role in reminding the Minister that there is a significant amount of work to be done.  We are getting there.  We are all using our personal experiences to give leadership and to cajole and push.</p> <p>I am clearly on the record in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party as stating that I would prefer to see no tax cuts in the forthcoming budgets until such time as we get the key priorities right.  These include having proper housing, not just for people with disabilities but for society in general, dealing with the hospital issues and until we have gone a long way to ensuring there is equality of opportunity and services.  As a people we should not be looking for tax cuts.  We should seek to leave the current taxes in place and if there is an increase in the budgets it should be diverted to areas where we now have a responsibility, given that we have ratified this UN convention.  It will take hundreds of millions of euro to backfill the damage that was done to the disability sector as a result of the recession and the lack of investment prior to that.  The Minister of State has my full support in terms of what I can do in my political party to push for the type of increased funding we need in the budget.</p> <p>The mission statement is there.  It is very welcome and we are all delighted.  However, a mission statement is like the introduction in a book.  We need to see the chapters.  We must have proper employment.  Increasing the 3% to 6% is a doubling of the target, but we should aim for 10% because 10% of the population have a disability.  Some 10% of the workforce in the public service should be people with declared disabilities.  That probably will not happen for a while but we should aspire to it.  The task force on individualised budgeting established by the Minister of State is important.  Many people have spoken about it.  I honestly cannot say what is the best model to work from or to aspire to have but the task force can do that.  I sincerely hope it will report within a reasonable period.</p> <p>In conclusion, I was pleased to be asked by the Leader of the House to take the Order of Business on behalf of the Government on the day after the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified.  It was a recognition of me and my story, and the fact that there are other Members of the House who have their own stories, that it was appropriate for me to lead on behalf of the Government on that day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that is the first of many instances of leading for the Government in different capacities.

I thank them for their interest and for all the work they have done and continue to do on this matter.  I thank Senator Dolan for what he has done, along with many others, including Senator Conway.  I am very heartened to hear Senator Conway, as somebody who is part of the party in government, explicitly stating that we need to put resources for both people with disabilities and people who are vulnerable within our communities before tax cuts for the wealthy.

They are the people I meet every day who struggle so much.  They have to fight so hard on behalf of their children and when their children become adults with intellectual disabilities.  We have to address this issue, and we have a huge responsibility.  That is why I, together with my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, welcome the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, especially, as the Minister of State noted, on the happy occasion of World Down Syndrome Day.</p><p>Since 2007, when Ireland first signed the convention, we have argued both in the Oireachtas and outside it that it needed to be ratified without delay.  This convention provides a framework to promote, protect and ensure the rights of all people with disabilities and promotes equal rights in all areas of life.  These are the basic fundamentals that should be afforded to any person in a decent and modern society, able-bodied, disabled or otherwise.  While all agree the ratification of the convention is most welcome, I must stress that it is only the first step and I believe the Minister of State recognises that.  The real measure of delivery of the rights that are contained in the convention will be in its timely and speedy implementation.  We are fully conscious that a raft of legislation must be introduced, amended or enacted to afford the rights that are enshrined in this convention.</p><p>People with disabilities in Ireland have long suffered at the hands of both the current Government but successive Governments.  The phrase, &quot;put your money where your mouth is&quot;, is particularly relevant when it comes to disability rights in Ireland and I appreciate the Minister of State has addressed the issue of personalised budgeting.  In his response, the Minister of State should indicate when that report will be completed because parents of people with disabilities are waiting for that report and for personalised budgeting.  This is not just an issue of resources.  We need to be able to track where the resources are going at present, and where they have been going.  We have to make sure that they get to the people with disabilities and their families to improve their quality of life and increase their access.  We cannot do that without transparency around where exactly the money is going.  </p><p>In the 2018 budget there was little mention of the resources to implement the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities to which the Minister of State referred.  People in receipt of disability allowance were afforded the crumbs of the table with an increase of &euro;5 per week.  Given the extra costs that arise for people with disabilities, &euro;5 a week just does not cut it.  </p><p>The rights that are afforded in this convention can only be delivered with the necessary immediate allocation of resources.  This is especially relevant with regard to the ongoing preparation for the 2019 budget.  It is important to discuss this issue today because, as Senator Conway and the Minister of State have noted, as we prepare for the budget, money must be ring-fenced to make sure that this ratification means something. </p><p>The convention will be rendered useless and the <i>status quo </i>will remain in place without these additional resources.  I appeal to the Minister of State to not allow this situation arise and to not further fail persons with disabilities.  We all know that travel on public transport can be a nightmare for people with disabilities.  The email all Members received from two avid campaigners about their journey to Leinster House for the D&aacute;il debate on this issue was the height of irony.  In it, the sisters described how they left Greystones, County Wicklow in their wheelchairs and got on the 4 p.m. DART with no personal assistance.  These are two women who have fought extremely hard for disability rights in Ireland.  When their day had finally come, they described the effort required to be at Leinster House as being monumental.  The Government has failed to show it really cares for children or adults with disabilities.  </p><p>I must also raise the issue of respite care with the Minister of State.  A response to a recent parliamentary question tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in revealed that the number of nights of overnight respite care provided to children and adults with disabilities has dropped by more than 22,600 in the past three years.  We need to be straightforward and honest about what resources are available.  Overnight respite is vitally important for allowing other responsibilities to be attended to and for the running of a normal household where a valuable member has complex medical needs.  There is much more I could say on this.  I trust the Minister of State.  I trust that he is going to do the right thing and that we are going to see real, tangible changes.  The changes must really matter to people of all abilities and people with disabilities.  Funding must be provided and must go where it is needed and most deserved.  </p></speech>

Given our late start, we have 60 minutes, with our time topped and tailed by the Minister of State.  I ask that the Seanad might be able to extend or come back to this matter fairly soon.  I thank the Minister of State for being here and the Leader of the Seanad for making sure we could have this early debate.</p> <p>I have no doubt but that Deputy Finian McGrath's heart is in the right place.  I have no doubt but that the Minister of State wants very much to make it happen for people with disabilities.  However, I do not have any trust in the national disability inclusion strategy.  I set out my reasons for that on 26 September when we first had statements on this matter.  This vehicle will not deliver what the Minister of State very clearly wants delivered.  It will not do it.  I critiqued it on that day and I can critique it again.  I am happy to hear any other comments on it.  The document before Members today, comprising three and a half pages, does not give me any solace that things have changed.  I will use the word "trust".  The Minister of State said he was let down and misled by officials in his Department.  He said that publically a year ago.  I put it to him last September; he did not respond to it.  This document has no reference to ratification by the end of last year, even though it was published a month after the Taoiseach had committed to it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I disagree slightly with Senator Martin Conway in this regard, with respect.  The Taoiseach intervened in the middle of June and said that even if the process had to be changed, it would happen by the end of the year.  It happened in early March of this year.  We will not quibble over that.  He said that we had to change the process and it was changed.  </p><p>I revert to the document before Members and the issue about the optional protocol.  A commitment was given, and the Minister of State says that it would be met when the convention was ratified.  It has now been changed.  There is no rationale in this document as to why it has changed.  We are doing it differently now.  The Minster of State said that the optional protocol, which was to be ratified at this current time, will be ratified as soon as possible following completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle.  When will the first reporting cycle be completed?  When does the clock start?  Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, gone to New York to sign the papers?  Has the 30-day timeline started yet?  It clearly has not.  There are real issues here but no reason is set out as to why the optional protocol cannot be signed.  This document comes from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I suggest - I might be totally wrong about this - there is a divergence of view between that Department and the view and will of An Taoiseach.  I do not wish to say this gratuitously but people with disabilities need an explanation, as do I.  There is absolutely no reason why Ireland cannot now sign up to the optional protocol.  </p><p>We need to get on with a number of practical matters very quickly.  A budget is coming up.  That budget, across all of the different Departments, has to have the smell, taste and bite of a budget that is about people with disabilities and their families and not just a package of this and that from one Department.  Let us see, between now and the end of the year, if the pieces of legislation are put in place.  I expect that the optional protocol can and should be dealt with now.</p><p>The Minister of State spoke about unemployment, and he mentioned it in his 2017 strategy.  We are now two and a half years into the ten-year comprehensive employment strategy.  The Minister of State's speech contained no figures to tell us how many people have been employed although we are one quarter of the way through the strategy.  </p><p>He has spoken about people coming out of congregated settings.  There are 1,200 people under the age of 65 in nursing homes in this country and that is a deprivation of liberty which does not require legislation to sort out.  There were 3,919 people on the social housing lists in 2013.  In 2016 it was 4,456.  The number is going up.  Poverty is increasing.  There is no sense in this document of the scale of what has to be dealt with or a resolve to actually deal with it.  I acknowledge we are told about a number of very useful and important initiatives.  </p><p>I wish to correct the Minister of State when he stated, "To put it another way, the convention provides that people with disabilities should have the same rights as everyone else".  That is incorrect.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of December 1948 stated that disabled people are the same human beings as anybody else.  This convention intends to sort out something that has not been sorted out by states across the world for 60 years.  It is about making the human rights of disabled people real, including rights to transport, employment, housing and education.</p></speech>

We are unanimous in the view that he is doing a huge job and that he is truly committed to what he is doing.  He believes in what he does every day and that is great.  He paid two visits to my native county of Cavan.  That gives me the context to ask him to comment on the progress on the progress of the Holy Family school in Cootehill, which is a very important facility for my county and to comment on his wonderful visit to Enable Ireland on the invitation of my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith.  On that occasion, he came to Enable Ireland and the point was made to him that there was a problem with waiting lists in the various sectors for professionals such as speech therapists and occupational therapists, among others.  I am happy that the Minister of State got a 4.4% increase in his allocation, meaning that the budget for this year will be &euro;1.76 billion for this year.  That is progress. </p> <p>I want to race through a few things that I believe are important.  I know, from speaking to the Minister of State, that my words will not fall on barren soil.  Living in the community is so important.  Supports need to be there in terms of home help.  We need to have a broad interpretation of home help because it is a bit narrow at the moment.  It is important that meals are cooked sometimes and that physical support is available, including help with shopping and different activities.  Sometimes the definition of home help is defined narrowly as only being available for the personal care of those who require it.  Perhaps the Minister of State could look at that.  I mention it because of my practical experience of things.  </p> <p>The carer's allowance remains important, and the increases are welcome but we need to continue to increase the allowance and to continue to make it attractive.  I was glad to see that medical cards for people in domiciliary care were introduced.  Any help we can give carers or persons looking after people, and any supports and services they can be given, should be provided.  </p> <p>I am anxious that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act be fully commenced.  It is very important, because for so long the opposite existed.  Nobody in this House needs a lecture on that situation.  We need to support people in defining their own sick care.  </p> <p>Supported housing is very important.  We have much to do in that sphere.  We need supported housing where people can live in a community with in-built support and with professional assistance available in so far as it is required, including care assistance.  That is a really important thing. </p> <p>The housing adaption grants for persons with disabilities are important.  They have been embraced in Cavan and Cavan County Council has really made a success of that programme.  However, there is still a waiting list and delays, and there remains a need for more resources in that area.</p> <p>I do not believe that the employment quota system is working very well.  It absorbs people who are ill or who have acquired disabilities within the institutions and it is not taking in any new people from outside.  That really needs to be looked at and perhaps should be increased.  It also requires a very proactive approach from the Minister of State, and perhaps heads need to be banged together on that one.  I will discuss one personal case privately with the Minister of State concerning someone who has great potential to work very positively, who has been trying to get employment for a long time but it is like banging one's head against the wall.  </p> <p>I was happy to see that the Minister of State approved the Irish Sign Language Bill and I congratulate Senator Mark Daly for bringing that Bill forward.  </p> <p>The Minister of State is doing great work and we support him on it.  I hope he will be in our constituency more often to give us more good news.  </p></speech>

We are all very clear that the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a truly historic moment for us and it is great to see cross-party support for this ratification.  However, it is only the beginning of a new journey.</p> <p>I recently visited The Hub in Strokestown, which the Minister of State visited approximately one year ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maura Hopkins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is run by the Brothers of Charity and creates meaningful employment for people with disabilities.  I also recently visited Triest Press in Roscommon town, which supports people with intellectual disabilities.  I do not like to view them in that way.  They are wonderful people who now have opportunities for meaningful employment and we need to see much more of that.  It is very positive that &euro;70,000 has been provided under a community services programme to support that company in respect of its high-tech digital centre and the services it provides.</p><p>I agree with Senator O'Reilly who called for increases for home help and home care packages.  People need to live in their communities for as long as possible.  It is absolutely crucial to support them in every way with home help and multidisciplinary team involvement.  As an occupational therapist, I am very aware of the challenges in accessing timely and specialist rehabilitation.  This is very relevant to people with disabilities.  The evidence is clear that this access gives those people better outcomes.  As a result, they have less disability and can lead more meaningful lives.</p><p>I do not want to see beds closed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have spoken to the Minister of State previously about that and some beds have been opened.  I want to see the rehabilitation unit in Roscommon County Hospital delivered as quickly as possible.  It will serve the west of Ireland and will be linked to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  People need to have the best opportunities to lead meaningful lives and that means proper access to rehabilitation as inpatients and in the community.</p></speech>

While we are one of the last countries to ratify it there were many steps legally required for it to be successful.  There are many challenges ahead to fulfil all our aspirations for people with disabilities and for our society to ensure that they have the wherewithal to reach their potential in employment, social life and interaction with the State.  Colleagues have pointed out all that needs to be done but this Government has not met all the targets set out in various strategies.  We need to do more in the way of setting targets and ensuring they are met.</p> <p>Part of the process involved in the recognition of the Irish Sign Language for the deaf community is ensuring that there are reviews of the implementation of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.  All too often we have passed legislation with good intentions, great ideas and aspirations on all sides but with no review to ensure that they are met.  The Act ensures that members of the deaf community are equal citizens of this State, have access to all State services like any other citizens and are not suffering the extreme marginalisation described during pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  That is a huge step in fulfilling one of the elements of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#NNN00300"><p>It will be a matter of pride for the Minister of State to have the UN convention ratified.  It is a wonderful accolade for a politician.  I pay tribute to Senators Mark Daly and Conway and also to Senator Dolan, my colleague in the Civil Engagement Group.  They will not rest till the option protocol is in place but, more importantly, until the necessary resources are provided to make ratification and the rights involved real.  This has come home to me because the youngest member of my extended clan, a 15 month old grand-nephew, was diagnosed at eight months as having significant challenges.  He is a wonderful smiling boy but his parents have been pulling, dragging and fighting to get a chair that allows him to live.  As someone said to me, it is hard enough for them to face this challenge they did not expect but the chair should be delivered with a bow instead of their having to fight for it.  Coming from the disability sector, I know that fight is ahead of them.  This seems to characterise how we approach disability in this country.  It is always a big bare-knuckle fight.  I would like to think we could get beyond that.</p> <p>I am glad to hear about the work on the proposals for the replacement scheme for the mobility allowance, which we talked about at the Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  That is long overdue and involved more pulling, dragging and fighting.  It should not have to be that way.  Until such time as we have not just the good intention and the rights on paper but the resources that back them up and make them real, we will not be able to go beyond offering a cup of tea and a biscuit.</p> <p>The report Time to Move on from Congregated Settings was published in 2011.  I was with the Cope Foundation at the time and there were many people in congregated settings.  It is shocking that we are pushing that deadline out to 2023.  Those institutions were due to be closed this year.  There are 1,200 people younger than 65 years living in nursing homes.  They are being detained.  We have to do better than this.  It is great that we have ratified but we need the resources to make that ratification real.</p></speech>

I accept some of their valid criticism because ratification of the UNCRPD is a common goal which should unite us all, parties, Independents, civil society groups and stakeholders.  We are all keen to see it ratified.  We are dedicated to continuous improvement where equality and human rights are concerned.  If I run out of time in responding to questions, I will reply individually to Senators.</p> <p>When I was appointed Minister of State almost two years ago, I set myself ten objectives.  The first was to deal with the crisis of 18 year olds in the adult services.  I had to ask the Minister and the Government to get an extra &euro;31 million to deal with those day places for 18 year olds.  The next issue was the restoration of the carer's grant to 101,000 families, at &euro;1,700 per family.  The third issue I moved on to was to provide medical cards for the 11,000 children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  Other issues I dealt with during the year include the &euro;3 million for the disability support service, which is very relevant to this debate today and the increase of &euro;10 in the disability and carer's allowances in the two most recent budgets, the &euro;10 million for the ability programme for education and training of young people and an increase of &euro;167 million in the HSE social care plan for 2017 and 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Members referred to the respite issue.  In December, &euro;10 million extra was allocated for respite care.  The final issue is the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  These are my objectives.  Of course I have a lot more to do, and I intend to do a lot more.  I have listened to some excellent ideas presented here today, some of which I will take on board.</p><p>With regard to the debate on the convention, if Ireland was fully compliant, we would not need a convention at all.  That is the reality for people with disabilities.  The disability Bill still needs to be enacted and it includes a range of provisions that are needed to improve compliance with the convention.  These include amendment of the Juries Act, amendment of the Electoral Act to repeal the prohibition of persons of unsound mind from standing for election to the D&aacute;il or Seanad, provisions to establish a monitoring framework involving the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Disability Authority, and amendments to increase the standards required for the provision of reasonable accommodation.  There is also a proposal to increase public service employment of people with disabilities from 3% to 6% by 2024.  I have listened to the proposals for the higher objective of 10%, which is a very concrete proposal that I welcome.  Now that the priority draft has been approved for the disability Bill and it has been decoupled from the deprivation of liberty provisions, work is under way to bring it forward to Committee Stage as soon as possible.</p><p>A number of amendments that are mostly technical in nature will be brought forward on Committee Stage and I will ensure that appropriate arrangements are made for pre-legislative scrutiny of them.  I want to talk to people and to listen to them.  The aim is to enact the legislation by August 2018, and certainly not by the end of the year.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 also needs to be fully commenced.  This Act provides for comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity that aligns it with Article 12 of the convention.  It also provides for the setting up of a new body called the decision support service.  This leads on to some of the points raised by Senator Martin Conway.  The role of the decision support service will be to support decision making by and for adults with decision-making capacity difficulties.  Key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of a high level steering committee.  The recently appointed director of the decision support service is working in a determined way to get the necessary staff, resources, processes and IT systems, expert panels, codes of practice and regulation in place to get the service up and running as quickly as possible.  I accept that there were delays in that regard, but an excellent director has been appointed and we are moving on to fill the other gaps.</p><p>Turning to the optional protocol, it is absolutely the intention to opt in and I can say this very strongly.  I want to ensure, however, that progress is sustainable and to ensure the maximum benefit.  Our time and resources in the initial implementation phase are being better spent on improving the standards of services.  These improvements, many of which have been flagged in the House today, are much needed.</p><p>It is my intention that the optional protocol will be ratified once we have completed the first reporting cycle under the convention.  This will provide us with an opportunity to reflect and prioritise actions to achieve the highest possible level of compliance.  With the ratification of the convention in place, I can now focus on using the convention - many Members are missing this point - to better equip and resource people with disabilities to improve their quality of life.  Once we have this in the bag, we can use it to push forward.  Ratification was a key commitment in the programme for Government.</p><p>Senator Dolan referred to the change of approach.  Given the advanced progress that has been achieved towards compliance with the convention, and taking into account the remaining implementation requirements, the Government has decided that the State is now ready to become bound by the terms of the convention and become accountable under the UNCRPD.  This is an important point.  I am pleased to announce that Ireland's instrument of ratification was deposited yesterday with the UN Office of Legal Affairs.  It will become legally binding in 30 days, which is 19 April.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator Rose Conway-Walsh.  The Senator has always been very involved in disability issues.  I absolutely agree with her and Senator Conway on tax cuts versus services and on the issue of parents.</p> <p>I received a lovely email today from a group of parents who thanked me, but they also asked me not to forget the parents.  We must also not forget the brothers and sisters of people who have disabilities.  They make a massive contribution.  I thank Senators John Dolan, Joe O' Reilly, Maura Hopkins and Mark Daly.  I mentioned Senator Daly earlier with regard to the Irish Sign Language.</p> <p>I know and appreciate that the people involved in this debate tonight care passionately about the rights of all people with disabilities.  In order to make this a reality, we have to put the services in place.  It is my objective to do this over the next couple of months.  I will work very hard in the interests of all people with disabilities and their families.</p></speech>
