I very much appreciate him dealing with this matter, which relates to the increase in demand there will be for home care now that we have an increasing number of older people in the country.  That number will continue to increase at a dramatic pace in the next ten to 12 years.  The figures, as I understand them, indicate that 637,000 citizens are over 65.  Within 12 years, that will be 1 million.  While there has been an increase in the number of people who are being provided with home care, we also need to plan for the long term.  In particular, we need to plan to upskill people who will be able and available to provide home care.</p> <p>The other challenge we face relates to the fact that because of the increase in employment, people will not be attracted into providing home care because there are more permanent jobs available.  We will have to look, therefore, at what kind of mechanism we should put in place to ensure that people have job security.  That is becoming more of a challenge for those who want to provide home care.  It is in that context that I am raising this issue.  I would like to know what action the Government and the Department of Health are taking to deal with this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#B00400"><p>In common with other developed counties, Ireland is experiencing the ageing of its population.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is giving rise to some significant challenges for us.  The proportion of the population aged 85 and over increased by more than 20,000 between 2006 and 2016 and is projected to increase by a further 36,000 by 2026.  This effectively means that this age group is expected to more than double over a 20-year period.  Based on current CSO population projections, it is expected that population ageing will continue in the forthcoming decades.  This, of course, has direct implications for health and social care services because demand is highest among those in these age groups.</p> <p>The HSE, working within its available resources, has sought to maintain and, where possible, expand the range and volume of services available.  These services include supporting people to remain in their own homes and preventing early admission to long-term residential care, as well as supporting people to return home following an acute hospital admission.  Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25 million allocated.  The additional resources made available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HSE's national service plan provides for a target of just over 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  Turning now to the steps that have been taken, I can advise that at the end of last year the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, launched the national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning.  The framework aims to support the recruitment and retention of the right mix of workers across the health and social care system to meet planned and projected service needs.  The framework proposes a consistent approach to strategic workforce planning together with the establishment of structures and governance arrangements that support and enable the application of this approach in the health sector and cross-sectorally where appropriate.  One of the early actions identified as necessary to implement the framework is the development of a more formal and structured arrangement for engagement between our health and education systems to ensure the development and retention of the appropriate competencies and skills in the system.  As with all health and social care workers we must ensure that the competencies and behaviours being developed by those who wish to become home care providers take account of developments in health and social care delivery.  It is essential that educational and training courses are provided to these individuals with the core competencies which are required for their future profession.  Ensuring closer engagement between health and education and training systems is vital to achieving this goal.  The development of a protocol for engagement between the two sectors is a high-level objective of the framework's implementation plan.  I am fully aware that home care providers play a vital role in improving the health and well-being of our older population by supporting and looking after them at home, which is usually their preferred environment.  In terms of the provision of training, the HSE provides training to its home support workers.  The current programme in health service skills leads to an award at level 5 recognised in the national framework of qualifications or equivalent.  This skills programme is available to staff working in the HSE and section 38 agencies.  This ensures that they have the necessary competencies required for their role meeting all the quality standards required for effective patient and client care.</p></speech>

He has acknowledged that there will be a substantial increase in the demand for home care.  In the context of the national strategy framework for health and social workforce planning, do we have a five-year or ten-year plan to develop this service or are we merely going from year to year?  My concern is that it is the latter.</p></speech>

It is staggering to think we will have 1.2 million people over the age of 65 years living in this country in the next 20 years or so.  There is a huge challenge and that is why, early in my tenure in this role, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I launched a consultation on a new statutory home care scheme that would mirror the fair deal scheme.  It would be underpinned by statute, would be guaranteed funding and would be a demand-led scheme.  Part of that is looking at our workforce planning and the issues surrounding ensuring that we have availability.  It is a challenge in many different regions and it contributes to the <i>ad hoc</i>nature of delivery today.  The upskilling and recruitment, as well as the maintaining and keeping in the system of home care workers, is part of that statutory scheme and is part of the planning process that is being undertaken at the moment.  I assure the Senator that we are aware of that challenge and that is to the fore in our development of the new statutory scheme, which we hope to have up and running within the next two to three years.</p></speech>

Two operating theatres in Merlin Park University Hospital, Galway were shut on health and safety grounds last September when significant leaks in the roof were discovered.  Repair works were completed on 1 November and yet, more than three months later, the theatres are still not open.  An independent clinical assessment has been undertaken to assess the feasibility of returning these theatres to use and I understand that correspondence was issued yesterday to the effect that one of those theatres may be in a position to open today.  Can the Minister of State confirm this?  More importantly, can he also confirm that it would be adequately resourced, keeping in mind that it is more than six weeks since the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il the Government's commitment to ensuring the restoration of a full elective orthopaedic service to Merlin Park University Hospital, Galway?  For such a service to be restored, the promised modular theatres on the Merlin Park site need to be put in place immediately.  I have been in contact with the chair of the HSE forum, Councillor Mary Hoade.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Keith Swanick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2459"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2459&amp;amp;pid=KeithSwanick&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She has echoed the concerns of all the forum members from all parties, all the staff members from University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park and, more importantly, the concerns of the public in general.  Over six weeks ago, the Taoiseach said that the tender process for these modular units was in the final stages and it was expected that a contract would be awarded in the coming weeks.  Can the Minister of State confirm whether this contract has been awarded and provide a timeline as to when work is due to begin?</p><p>With respect to Galway University Hospital emergency department, Eilish O'Regan reported last week that patients were falling victim to outbreaks of deadly superbugs in dangerously crowded hospitals.  We know that the emergency department of University Hospital Galway is dangerously overcrowded.  It has consistently been at the top of the trolley watch indicators, which is a shameful accolade.  A 2017 report found that conditions at the emergency department were chaotic and nothing short of scandalous.  The eyewitness report commissioned by the Saolta group stated that patients are crammed together, within touching distance of each other for the most part and with little or no privacy.  Is it any wonder that patients in close quarters are contracting and passing on superbugs, which are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics?  The CPE bug is particularly nasty and has multiplied and evolved since my days of working in accident and emergency.  It is dreaded because it is almost untreatable.  It is immune to some of the last resort group of antibiotics that are used when all other drugs fail.  It usually leads either to a pneumonia-type infection in the chest or an E. coli infection in the bladder or digestive system.  It kills around half of patients whose bloodstream it enters.  Some 17 new cases were detected between 19 February and 12 March in Ireland, including in University Hospital Galway.  I ask the Minister of State to update the House on the current stage of works at the new emergency department block.  I urge him to acknowledge that there is a real need to put all shoulders to the wheel in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#D00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on these matters on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The leaks in the roof of the building that houses Merlin Park University Hospital&rsquo;s orthopaedic theatres occurred in September 2017, necessitating the closure of both theatres in the interest of patient safety.  A full repair to the membrane of the roof was required to secure the integrity of the building and these works have been completed.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to inform the House that following completion of remedial works identified as part of a further external assessment, one of the theatres has become operational today.</p> <p>It has been evaluated that the best way of restoring effective capacity at Merlin Park is the construction of two modular theatres on the Merlin Park site.  The HSE has advised that the tender process for these modular units is now complete and a contract has been awarded.  Contract documents have been exchanged and active engagement with the successful company is in progress.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that the Department and the HSE have implemented a number of measures to address overcrowding at University Hospital Galway.  The Government is committed to fixing the situation in our emergency departments and breaking the cycle of overcrowding in the health service.  To do this the Department is pursuing three priorities in 2018, namely, increasing capacity across the system using evidence provided by the health service capacity review beginning with some additional hospital beds; implementing reform through Sl&aacute;intecare; and increasing services provided through primary care by negotiating a new GP contract.</p> <p>The situation in University Hospital Galway is challenging, with 41 patients waiting on trolleys yesterday morning.  Infection control issues remain of concern with six beds closed due to norovirus, which is impacting on congestion and admissions and transfers to wards.  I wish to acknowledge the distress for staff, patients and their families of the current situation.  Funding has been provided in 2018 to open 28 additional inpatient beds in University Hospital Galway and access was provided to seven additional home care packages per week and two additional transitional care beds per week for the duration of winter.  Furthermore, the Department of Health is also engaging with the HSE to fast-track the recommendations of the recent health service capacity review with a view to opening more new beds within the system as soon as possible this year.</p> <p>Both the Department and the HSE are working on alleviating the overcrowding situation at University Hospital Galway and ensuring that the orthopaedic theatres at Merlin Park are operational as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the recently announced additional family resource centre provision but, unfortunately, there is no provision for north Mayo.  I have not intervened on this matter up to now because I was sure the urgent need for a family resource centre in Erris would be recognised.  I am not sure if the Minister of State has been to Erris but I am sure he has heard of Belmullet which has a population of almost 8,000 people.  In terms of isolation and the difficulties around access to services, it is a 154 km round trip to the county town of Castlebar and a 124 km round trip to Ballina.  The primary and secondary routes connecting to those towns are prone to flooding and in need of urgent upgrade.  However, that is a matter for another Minister.</p> <p>The recent Social Justice Ireland report shows an increase in poverty in rural areas.  There is also a poverty of access to essential services.  It is not feasible for support services, such as those provided by Tusla through the family resource centres, to travel to and from Erris to meet the needs of individuals and families.  That Tusla and HSE staff have to spend half their days travelling to and from the main centres is not the best use of their time and not conducive to providing quality support services to individuals and families.  The reality is that families and individuals are being deprived of the life-saving and life-changing supports and services available to people living in other areas.  </p> <p>A family resource centre located in Erris would facilitate an early intervention and prevention approach that would assist in preventing cases escalating to the social work teams and mental health teams that are already overstretched.  Following on from the closure of community development projects in 2015, there is an even more severe gap in services for the Erris community.  Over the 13 year timeframe that the CDP was in existence, along with the one-to-one supports provided by it initiatives such as whole community responses to bullying, domestic violence, poor mental health, isolation and many other key issues, were developed.  It also acted as a facilitator and an anchor for parenting programmes, community participation in primary care and other anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives.  The combination of family support services and community development that could be provided by a family resource centre would tackle disadvantage and address the inequalities that are preventing people from living full, healthy and self-determined lives.</p> <p>Erris is a wonderful area in which to live or to visit.  The deprivation statistics included in the application for a family resource centre in Erris speak to the underlying severe disadvantage when it comes to accessing services, unemployment levels, the level of lone parents and the number of people living in isolation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It speaks to all of those things.  Young people with acute mental health difficulties must still travel to north Mayo CAMHS which is based in Ballina.  If a young person recovering from a bereavement or something traumatic needs the support of CAMHS and other services, it is not feasible to take him or her out of school for a whole day to access those services.  That is why I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the family resource centres and to put one into the Erris area as a matter of urgency.  I would not ask if it were not desperately needed.  I ask on behalf of the families and individuals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#F00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh.  The family resource centre programme was established in 1998 and was overseen by the former Family Support Agency until the transfer of responsibility to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, on its establishment in 2014.  Until 2018, there were 109 family resource centres in the programme, seven of which are operational in County Mayo at Ballina, Castlebar, Westport, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe and Kilmovee.  Family resource centres are independent voluntary organisations that deliver universal services to families in local communities based on a life-cycle approach.  Centres seek to combat disadvantage and provide supports to improve family life.  The family resource centre programme emphasises the involvement of communities in tackling the problems they face, working inclusively with service users and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory organisations at community level.</p> <p>In budget 2018, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, secured an additional &euro;3 million for Tusla to support the family resource centre programme.  The additional funding is being used to support existing family resource centres and to provide for the expansion of the programme with the inclusion of 11 new centres.  Following a public application process, Tusla announced recently the 11 centres which are being included in the programme this year.  I understand that applications to Tusla to join the programme were of a very high standard.  The criteria considered included the size and make-up of the geographical area, the social and economic conditions in the specified area and the overall population breakdown of the area that would be serviced by the proposed centre.  The criteria also considered the structure of the organisation applying to the programme, its objectives, targets, current relationships with other organisations and the inclusion of available research, community projects and needs assessments with the application.  A high number of applications, 47 in total, were received by Tusla, one of which was from an organisation based in the Erris area of Mayo.</p> <p>Tusla was faced with a difficult decision-making process to select 11 new centres for inclusion in the programme.  It is important to emphasise that Tusla recently established an online virtual child and family support network for Erris and Ballina.  Child and family support networks represent services which play a role in the lives of children and families in a given area such as statutory service providers and local voluntary and community services.  The aim of these networks is to ensure that if a family presents to a service which cannot meet its needs, the service can redirect the family to another service which is more appropriate.  The new online network will enable services to develop an understanding of the work of other providers in order to facilitate the provision of a more integrated service to families in the community.  Tusla has advised that it also funds a full-time family support worker in the local area.  The Mayo children and young people service committee also brings together representatives of State bodies and community and voluntary services who work with children and young people in the county.  The committee is currently finalising a three-year plan for Mayo which will include an audit of services working with children, young people and families in Mayo, as well as a local needs analysis.  Future commissioning of services by Tusla in County Mayo will take the completed local needs analysis into account, including any gaps in services wherever they may be identified.  Through its prevention partnership and family support network, Tusla will continue to provide supports through the targeting of additional resources to services which will impact positively on vulnerable children and families.</p> <p>I thank Senator Conway-Walsh for raising the matter.  It is of key importance that the needs of children and families are met in the best way possible, in particular in areas of disadvantage.  I assure the Senator that my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, will continue to support the work of family resource centres.  Family support is a key priority for her.</p></speech>

I have worked in the middle of all of this.  In the context of interagency co-operation and the work that can be done, what is needed is a family resource centre.  I welcome the fact that a support worker will be in place but it is not enough.  However, that is not adequate to replace the community development project and the extra family support that is needed in the area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State will know there has been severe tragedy across that area in recent years and even in the last number of months.  These services are desperately needed.  I will contact the Minister, Deputy Zappone, separately but I ask the Minister of State to ask her about this.</p><p>There are exceptional needs in this area which will not be covered in the local needs analysis.  There will be lives lost in three years.  The quality of life in those three years for people who desperately need the services which could be provided through a family resource centre will not be improved.  That really concerns me.  We have all these headline figures.  We need to get down to these people who are extremely vulnerable.  Time is of the essence in doing so.  I will write to the Minister separately to ask her to consider Erris on an exceptional needs basis.  I do not want to get caught up in an audit.  The deprivation figures speak for themselves.  This has the backing of all of the statutory agencies, which do not do things like this lightly, because they know the need.  Some of them are working in the area and people who they work with in their teams have to travel out to the Erris area.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State, but this is just the beginning of the fight for a family resource centre in Erris.</p></speech>

Tusla is doing a very good job in the area of children, an area in which I have a particular interest having chaired the relevant committee previous to my current appointment.  There was an additional &euro;3 million allocated for family resource centres this year, which was very positive and which was an acknowledgement by the Government of the good work which they do and the need for them in communities.  We are all in agreement with the Senator on that.</p> <p>As I said in my initial reply, there were 47 applications.  Only 11 were successful on this occasion.  I cannot speculate on the level of funding which will we be made available in 2019 but I will sincerely be supportive and hopeful that an additional allocation will be made next year.  If there is, I have no doubt that the Department will be more than willing to work with the Senator, the Mayo children and young people's services committee and the child and family support network for Erris and Ballina in order to identify the needs there and to recognise the very genuine and legitimate issue which the Senator has raised here today.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has kindly agreed to step in and take this issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed.  I received a telephone call from the Minister's office today informing me that he was unavoidably absent.  I fully understand and respect that.</p> <p>I want to address a number of issues.  As part of the criteria for GLAS III, there is a requirement to undertake a soil analysis and nutrient management plan.  An applicant must be compliant with that to avail of the funding and supports under GLAS III.  I have had a look at the guidelines provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of the European regulations on the GLAS payments and the co-funding for them.  I have set this out in an email to the Minister, but on page 36 there are strict criteria.  Failure to comply with the nutrient management plan and to have it filed by 31 March 2018 will incur penalties.  No GLAS payment will issue to farmers for completion of the nutrient management plan if they fail to comply with the terms and conditions.  </p> <p>My case and the case of farmers and people who have lobbied me in this regard is that we know that the land is swamped.  I spoke to a farmer in Tuam the other day.  His land is swamped with water and yet he has to have soil cores bored and tests complied with and filed by 31 March.  He will simply not be able to do it.  Anyone, urban or rural, driving around this country in the last few weeks would be aware that we had Storm Ophelia, Storm Eleanor, Storm Fionn and Storm Emma.  We had vast flooding of our grounds.  Nobody wants not to comply with the terms and conditions of GLAS III.  We heard time and time again of the failure of farmers under GLAS I and GLAS II.  We still have ongoing issues with people not receiving their payments.  Some of that was to do with compliance.  We cannot tolerate people who do not comply.  I accept that.  I am not here to make a case for people who do not comply with the GLAS terms and conditions.  I am here today, as someone who sits on the agricultural panel in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to make a strong case for flexibility and a reasonable approach by the Department and all those involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept that it had these terms.  My proposal, which I ask the Minister to consider, is that as we monitor the situation in the run-up to 31 March, the Minister and those administering the scheme, both locally, nationally and through the European funding mechanisms, should have some flexibility.  Can we extend that period for up to three or four weeks?  That is a reasonable request.  I acknowledge the Minister will have to be consulted but I ask the Minister of State to revert to the Minister and to the Department and to make a case for a reasonable, fair approach to farmers whose lands are swamped and who cannot comply with the soil testing and the nutrient management plan data they have to file by 31 March.  These farmers need leeway in order that they will not be penalised and struck off for what is effectively a substantial and important payment for them under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS 3.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-03-21a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018032100002#H00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter and ask him to please accept the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Creed, for his absence, as he is at a funeral this morning.</p> <p>On his behalf, I wish to outline the current position regarding GLAS.  We are very pleased that the GLAS scheme has proved to be such a popular scheme among Irish farmers and that the original target of 50,000 participants was surpassed well ahead of the date scheduled.  Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015, it is a remarkable achievement that this 50,000 target was exceeded within a period of 15 months.  GLAS has a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme, with provision for payment up to &euro;7,000, known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.  Last year we paid out almost &euro;200 million on GLAS and have continued payments each week this year with a further &euro;32 million paid to date.  </p> <p>GLAS, like previous agri-environment schemes, supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  GLAS was opened in three tranches.  The issue being raised here today relates to the third tranche of the scheme, known as GLAS 3. There are more than 13,000 participants in this tranche who are required to submit a nutrient management plan to the dedicated online nutrient management planning, NMP, system operated by Teagasc.  The deadline for the submission of these plans is, as Senator Boyhan pointed out, 31 March 2018.  This deadline, as with all such deadlines, is being monitored on an ongoing basis.  The relevant participants have received ongoing reminders of this deadline and it is matter for them now, in conjunction with their advisers, to ensure that they meet this deadline.  </p> <p>The GLAS scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and addresses the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the enhancement of biodiversity and the improvement of water quality.  The scheme provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that benefit all of us.  The scheme is co-funded by the national Exchequer and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  As required under EU regulation, two payments issue each year, namely, the advance payment followed at a later stage by the balancing payment.  In 2016 and again in 2017, the advance payment represents 85% of the annual payment, with a balancing payment being 15%.  The 2017 advance payments commenced on schedule in November 2017 and continue to be made on an ongoing basis as tranches of cases are cleared.  The current position is that 97% of eligible participants have now received their GLAS 2017 advance payment.  In some of the outstanding cases, applicants remain ineligible for payment until they complete the steps they must take before the Department can process their payment.  There is nothing we can do to advance these payments until the applicant completes their obligations.  In most of these cases, this relates to outstanding documentation which they must submit.  As soon as this is received and assuming everything is in order, the Department will move immediately to issue payments.  The main issues include the need for advisers to commence a commonage management plan in the case of participants with a commonage action and to submit the required documentation in the case of the low emission slurry spreading and rare breed actions.  </p> <p>It is simply not possible for the Department to make payments in these cases because the participants have not met the requirements.  I appreciate that the Senator has made the same point.  Updates are published weekly on the Department&rsquo;s website and clearly show that steady progress is being made.  While the officials are prioritising the clearing of cases and where a farmer has been contacted for additional  information, it is important that any such request is responded to as the information requested is essential to finalise all checks.  While the issue of payments is of importance, we must also recognise what the scheme is delivering in terms of the environmental and public goods.  What the buy-in to the scheme by the farming community is achieving includes the fact that the low-input permanent pasture and the traditional hay meadow actions are delivering more than 350,000 ha of diverse grassland species.  Moreover, 29,000 km of river bank are managed to protect rivers from pollution under the protection of watercourses from bovines and riparian margins actions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jim Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are over 200,000 ha of farmland bird habitat managed to protect bird species, over 20,000 ha of wild bird cover planted, providing winter feed for farmland birds, over 2 million trees planted, almost 5,000 farmers using new technologies to spread slurry, and 10,000 ha of arable land cultivated using minimum tillage techniques.

The Minister needs accurate readings and to get them one needs proper, drained soil.  There are many complications because people feed cattle out on the land and we need appropriate readings in order to comply with the conditions for grants.  The issue is a four-week extension but I accept that the Minister of State cannot tell us today that he is extending this for a month.  Nevertheless, I ask that he keep it under consideration, engage with and consult the relevant people in the area and, perhaps, come back to us before the end of the month.  There is a crisis and there will be weather issues in the next week or two.  I will not support people who do not comply but I know the Minister is flexible and reasonable.  He comes from the agricultural sector himself so he will have experience of these difficulties.</p></speech>

In the wake of Brexit and the talk of a hard border, our rugby team gives us hope and promise of what we can do when we work together on an all-Ireland basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were able to celebrate this amazing achievement thanks to the sacrifices made by the members of the team, their support teams and their family members, who do not see them for weeks on end.  I thank them and say "well done".</p><p>The second item I would like to raise also relates to sport.  Unfortunately, this House was not sitting last week when a further allocation of sports funding was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ross.  My heart was broken when I went through the list of recipients as I sat at home.  I was sure some of the large projects in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 would finally be acknowledged and much-needed funds would be allocated to assist them in their work with young people in my area.  I was astonished to see that Wesley College in Dublin was awarded &euro;150,000.  Drimnagh Castle CBS, which educates and nurtures some of the finest young men in Dublin, was hoping to get a similar grant for a similar sporting facility, but it was badly let down.  Schools in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 rear and educate our young people without the benefit of private funding and are wholly reliant on the State.  I cannot understand why those most in need of sports funding were overlooked again.  The Government pays lip service on a daily basis to how it intends to look after inner-city communities, but on this occasion it has not put its money where its mouth is.  Communities in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 are sick of being dumping grounds for services that other areas do not want, including wet hostels and injection centres.  To add insult to injury, the Liberty Saints sports club was handed a cheque for &euro;7,000 while Malahide Rugby Football Club was given over &euro;100,000.  There is absolutely no fairness in this.  Inner-city communities need proper facilities and adequate housing.  This Government is failing at every level.  In my opinion, the self-indulgence of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in giving sports allocation grants to private colleges is sickening.</p><p>The third item I would like to raise is the use and sharing of personal data on the Internet.  The mining of that data by companies has come to light as a result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  The debate on this issue, which has been raised by Senator Higgins and others in this House, had been simmering away, but now it has exploded.  When I watched "Prime Time" yesterday, I learned that psychological operations, or planned political operations, are deployed to convey selected information to audiences to influence their motives and political voting patterns.  It seems from my understanding that computer scientists and data analysts have figured out how to brainwash us, almost, and to manipulate us our voting patterns.  This is very worrying.  We need to ensure we have proper legislation in place to govern the sale and use of our data on online platforms.  Ultimately, we need to be more self-aware.  We need to question our willingness to use and share our personal and private data, thoughts and emotions online.  Did those who filled out a Facebook quiz know that the results would be used to target them for their political motivations?  Probably not.  Many of these platforms are based in and have their headquarters in Ireland.  We need to know whether they acquiesced to or had knowledge of what our data would be used for.  I am calling for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come to this House to make a statement on the matter.  How does he plan to ensure our data will not be misused and manipulated for political gain?</p></speech>

I know Senator Devine as a hard-working person here in the Seanad, but I could not allow such a thing to go without comment.  Brian Stack was a prison officer who served this country during the Troubles.  He was murdered by thoughtless people.  Like many other members of this country's security forces - prison officers, garda&iacute; and soldiers - Mr. Stack stood guard and looked after this country during the worst of times.  It is totally unacceptable that anybody would seek to denigrate his name in any way now.  In my view, Mr. Stack was a true patriot of Ireland.  He needs to be respected for standing his ground in dealing with prisoners during some of the most troubled times we have known in this country.</p> <p>I am not going to condemn Senator Devine here today.  Instead, I am asking the Leader to set aside time for Senator Devine to come to this Chamber, as a Member of the Seanad, to explain to her colleagues how she got involved in this series of tweets.  The retweeting was one thing, but to argue online with Brian Stack's son was totally unacceptable.  Many of us in this House have met Austin Stack on various occasions.  I have met him at several committee meetings.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I am absolutely devastated.  I had grave reservations about raising this issue coming in here today because one never wants to take one's colleague to task.  However, at the end of the day, the murder of a patriot in this country cannot be allowed to be in any way debased or diminished by anyone.  Nobody has the right to go after the likes of Mr. Stack.  It is so easy to say what one wants about the dead because they cannot speak for themselves.  I just think of the family.  We have all seen the bots on social media - the faceless people who attack all of us.  They will attack my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in as quick as they will those in Fine Gael or anywhere else.  We should not give these people oxygen.  I believe that Senator Devine is entitled to time to come in here and explain how she found herself in that situation because all of us have made mistakes in our lives.  The Stack family, however, are entitled to a formal apology at the very least.</p></speech>

She has rightly profusely apologised for her unacceptable actions.  Our party president, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, acted swiftly and decisively to implement the disciplinary process which led to Senator Devine being suspended from the party for three months.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about this week's report from Social Justice Ireland, which once again exposed the reality of systematic poverty which is hidden behind the flashing lights, spinning headlines and fancy presentations designed to mask the inequalities and struggles of the 780,000 people, or 16.5% of Ireland's population, who live below the poverty line.  We continue to see that having a job does not equate to coming out of poverty.  Behind all the data we see that individuals and families are working day and night while struggling to make ends meet.  These are the families that have to deliberate over whether their children are sick enough to warrant the &euro;50 or so it costs to take them to the GP.  </p> <p>They are also the individuals who end up on hospital trolleys, who have no medical card and who cannot afford medical insurance.  They are charged the standard Government levy of &euro;80 per night, regardless of whether they get a bed or not.  Can it be believed that one has to pay a Government levy of &euro;80 to spend a night on a hospital trolley while being stripped of dignity and left at risk of cross-contamination on a draughty corridor?  That is absolutely unacceptable and the Government needs to look at it in light of the huge and ever-increasing numbers of people on hospital trolleys.  The people who are being hit by this levy are the working poor.  They are the people who have already paid &euro;100 as an emergency charge.  They are the people who struggle to find the rent, the mortgage payments, the school transport charges and other household bills.  We also see that the poverty rates in rural Ireland are increased by higher costs, including travel costs, and by low-income employment.  </p> <p>Government policies which protect the extremely wealthy while draining every last cent from those on low incomes can be stopped and have to be stopped.  We have to heed the report from Social Justice Ireland, which is similar to the reports made by the Combat Poverty Agency ten and 12 years ago.  We have to seriously look at those who are working in this country and yet cannot afford a basic standard of living and who are continuously kept below the poverty line.</p></speech>

I am grateful to those who have expressed support, and I hope to bring a cross-party motion before this House tomorrow or perhaps early next week.  Perhaps the Leader could ensure that it is on the Order Paper without debate so that we can say that the Seanad has agreed this motion.  It can then be presented to the Minister, whose office I have been in communication with, and also to other interested parties, such as the Russian ambassador.  <br/><br/>I also want to commend the Trinity College Dublin Students' Union and the Take Back Trinity campaign for their campaign last week which challenged the ridiculous and sudden imposition of a new supplemental exam fee.  Along with my Trinity colleagues I was delighted to support the students and was proud to be in Front Square on Thursday when the students emerged from their occupation.  It felt like old times, to see students engaged in this sort of radical action.  The students were entirely supported by staff unions in the college, both administrative and academic, including my own union, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT.  They had really strong support from across the college community for their actions, and I commend the provost for engaging with the students.  I am glad to see the matter appears to be moving towards a resolution.  <br/><br/>I welcome the progress being made in the other House on the Thirty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution Bill.  I am glad to see that it appears to be moving to Committee Stage today.  It should be before this House next week; I know that we will be discussing that at the leaders' meeting.  From the point of view of the Labour Party, we will co-operate in any way we can to ensure that the Bill is passed before Easter so that we can run a respectful and dignified campaign for repeal.<br/><br/>However, to follow on from what Senator Ardagh said, I would have a real concern about the role that social media campaigning is going to play in this referendum, and indeed in future referendum and election campaigns here.  I want to pay tribute to Carole Cadwalladr, the <i>Guardian</i>and Channel Four teams, and the whistleblowers from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica who have come forward to highlight concerns about the misuse of the personal data of Facebook users.  Clearly there is more to come in terms of the revelations.  We see, for instance, the UK information commissioner seeking a search warrant to search the English offices of Cambridge Analytica.  It raises a bigger question for us in Ireland, given that Facebook has its headquarters here, as to how we may regulate Facebook and other such companies to ensure there is adequate protection for personal data.  The Data Protection Bill is before us tomorrow, and the Minister has indicated he will be moving certain amendments to that Bill in light of those revelations, but I would ask that in the near future we have a more broad debate over how best to resource and empower our own Data Protection Commissioner to ensure adequate regulation.  This started many years ago with the case of Max Schrems.  It was an Irish case which lead to a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice, effectively preventing Facebook from misusing data, but we are still seeing the repercussions of such misuse.  Again, there are real concerns about how this might play out in a referendum campaign.  I will ask the Leader for that debate in due course.</p></speech>

I went into the Dining Hall on the second day of the occupation and I felt very proud to see the majority of my campaign team who helped get me into that presidential office occupying the room.  They were accompanied by the students from Fossil-Free TCD, and also Students Against Fees, which are campaigns which emerged during my presidency, so I was very proud to see them all join together in a joint effort to protest the commercialisation of education and other issues.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of social welfare inspectors and the overstepping of the mark in terms of when they knock on a person's door, especially the doors of lone parents.  Perhaps this is more suitable for a Commencement matter.  I thought this practice had ended years ago, but I spoke to a few mothers over the last few weeks who have had social welfare inspectors visit them who then searched their wardrobes and presses, looking for any sign that another person is living in the house.  This must be an invasion of privacy, and there have to be rules and regulations against this type of searching.  Single parents are already living below their means.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They may already feel helpless and unable to stand up for themselves against social welfare inspectors because they believe that social welfare inspectors must have the right to go through their wardrobes.  This practice has to stop and we need to trust single parents.  One has to be able to refuse a request to go through one's drawers.  I wish to ask the Minister and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection whether this is accepted practice.  Are there guidelines in place?  Do social welfare inspectors decide to do this or are they instructed by the Department to go through people's belongings and their private space?</p></speech>

I was there when we won it in 2009 but I was watching it on the streets of Limerick when it happened this year.  It was wonderful to see a Limerick man presenting the trophy to the team and we had two Limerick players on the team, Keith Earls and Conor Murray, whom I congratulate on being short-listed for player of the year.  I also congratulate the team in general and it was a great weekend for Ireland.  Cuala and Na Piarsaigh, a Limerick team and a Dublin team, also gave us value for money and will replay on a date to be fixed.</p> <p>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced during the week that a dual-diagnosis clinical programme will be set up for addiction and mental health, which is something I raised in the form of a Commencement matter on behalf of a family whose son had both mental health and addiction issues.  I have come across a couple of families with this problem and people have been falling between two stools in respect of help, being only able to get one type of assistance or another.  Now there will be a dual-diagnosis clinical programme, with a programme manager and a national clinical lead.  There will also be a literature review.  Can the Leader find out the timeline for the establishment of this programme?  Many families across Ireland would welcome it.</p></speech>

Two bombs, placed in bins, were exploded without warning by the Provisional IRA on Bridge Street, Warrington.  Three year old Johnathan Ball died at the scene, 12 year old Tim Parry died five days later from his injuries and 54 others were injured.  Nobody was ever prosecuted for these murders and this barbaric incident shocked our two islands.  It perhaps brought a renewed focus on peace.  I worked in London and then as a GP in Wales and when one said one was from Ireland, the atrocity of Warrington was often mentioned.</p> <p>Colin and Wendy Parry, the parents of 12 year old Tim Parry, established the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, which works nationally and internationally for peace and non-violent conflict resolution.  In 2000, on the seventh anniversary of the bombing, a peace centre was opened and I am sure people like Colin and Wendy Parry never imagined the tragedy visited upon them.  When violence and death arrived at their door, however, they chose to make a difference for others.  I salute them and every other victim who had the courage to stand up and say bombings never bring people together.</p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta.

The Good Friday Agreement will be 20 years old in a few weeks and it is timely that we should have a debate on it in the Seanad.  The agreement was overwhelmingly approved in two referendums in both parts of Ireland in May 1998, only the second time in a century that the people of Ireland voted on the same issue on the same day on their constitutional status, the first being the election of the first D&aacute;il in 1918.</p></speech>

If we are to be fair and if we are to be advocates for human rights, be it in Guantanamo Bay or anywhere, we must be consistent that human rights are fundamental to everybody and justice must prevail and that due course of action must prevail.  What was alleged to have happened to those men was nothing short of a disgrace.  I want to support the Government.  I particularly support the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, in the stand he has taken.  I would appeal to the Minister to meet the victims and their legal representatives within days because what happened was wrong and cannot be countenanced regardless of the political sensitivities.  In 2014, the Government agreed to have this case re-examined by the European Court of Human Rights but the court yesterday rejected those claims.  Speaking for myself, I abhor and hate violence on any side.  I advocate justice for all, regardless of their background, tradition, creed or political affiliation.  Our thoughts must be with the men who suffered these appalling violations against them as human beings.  I simply call for the Minister to meet these men and their legal representatives soon and for the Government to give serious consideration to appealing this decision to the Grand Chamber of the court.  This is about human rights.  It is about taking a stand, regardless of how long ago it happened, against the methods of torture of people in Northern Ireland.  Torture, no matter where and by whom, must stop.  I am conscious, as I stated earlier, of Guantanamo Bay, but all over the world, we as parliamentarians must take a stand and defend human rights and justice.  I acknowledge the work the Government, and Deputy Coveney, as Minister, has done and I ask that we in this House are kept informed as to progress.</p></speech>

It is proposing that free Wi-Fi would be available in public spaces and it has launched a new project where it is giving a &euro;15,000 voucher to local authorities or local districts to provide free Wi-Fi in public spaces, such as public health centres, community centres and even main streets.  It proposes there will be free Wi-Fi in towns.  It is a welcome initiative whereby approximately 8,000 local authority districts across the European Union will be connected up with free Wi-Fi in the next two years.  It is what we need to see more of.  I encourage local authorities to apply for this funding and to work with the towns, in particular, the chambers of commerce, in order that these projects can get off the ground.  It is a significant tranche of funding for an issue that is important for us.  In my part of the world, one would hope it would be another tool in our box regarding tourism and where we are going in promoting west Cork because if one can provide free Wi-Fi in towns such as Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Kinsale, one will have another tool along that Wild Atlantic Way, which will help everyone.  It is an important step.  It needs to be publicised but the local authorities now need to be proactive and need to apply for it.  The date set for this funding is 20 May and they must look for it now.  The sum of &euro;15,000 for free Wi-Fi in every town in Cork, Dublin, or even Ireland, is very significant.  It is there and it only needs to be applied for.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the local authorities work actively to ensure we get this infrastructure because the funding is there and it can benefit everyone.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody in the Chamber does not have family who fit that category. </p><p>However, one has to compare our approach to the undocumented Irish to our approach to those who come to this country seeking asylum.  A few years ago I was chairperson of the public service oversight committee.  The committee visited asylum seekers in the direct provision system throughout the State.  We went to disused family centres, hotels and buildings and saw families living in surroundings which were entirely inappropriate for their needs.  We listened to their stories and prepared a report.  I am pleased today that the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children have oversight of that system.  </p><p>I was horrified recently to learn that the Department of Justice and Equality intended to place 150 men, women and children seeking asylum in Lisdoonvarna in west Clare, a village which has a population of 300 outside the summer holiday season.  The asylum seekers will be housed in an old hotel in a rural area.  It is a great deal for the person who owns the hotel, and good luck to him or her.  It is a great bit of commerce, but it is completely inadequate, in particular for the children in the system.  The decision is completely unfair.  In the main, those who objected did so in the interests of the families who were going to be placed in an entirely inappropriate setting.</p><p>Some attempted to misrepresent those who objected as racist or whatever, but that was not the case.  They raised the same issues as those raised by our committee, namely, that 150 human beings, in particular children, from all parts of the world were being sent to a hotel in rural Ireland without the necessary amenities or community support.  How dare the Department of Justice and Equality make a decision like this without consulting asylum seekers and the local community.  I appeal to the Leader to stop the hypocrisy of talking about the undocumented Irish in America while treating asylum seekers, in particular children, in the manner in which we do in this country.  We need to sort out this issue.</p></speech>

It is long overdue.  A man whose wife has cancer spoke on RT&Eacute; recently.  Over a six-month period he paid &euro;1,000 in parking charges.  My local hospital in west Meath, Navan, charges &euro;4 for parking whether one is there for two minutes or two hours.  There is a simple solution to this.  If a person is not well over a long period of time and is staying in hospital, there should be no charge for parking for close family members.  It is as simple as that.  Some hospitals give free passes for certain cases, but this is not common knowledge and most patients and family members are not told about it.  They have to keep paying the charges and it is just not good enough.  I hope the Minister for Health can come before the House and provide us with a positive outcome.  The review is long overdue.</p> <p>There was a violent post office robbery last week in my constituency of Meath West.  I hope the staff get over their terrible ordeal.  The staff had to go back behind the counter and give out pensions and other entitlements.  Fair dues to them for doing that.  It is to be hoped that the brave man who tried to stop the robbers getting away recovers from his injury and the perpetrators are caught.  I congratulate the staff on reopening the post office and giving people their entitlements in such difficult times.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach very much for that information.  If this is a decision for the Committee for Procedure and Privileges then we will have time to discuss this matter.  I hope it will be a positive decision, otherwise there will be no excuse for anybody to complain about it.</p> <p>I also wish to raise the decision of the European Court of Human Rights that what happened to the hooded men was not torture.  Of course it was torture.  A blind bat could see that it was torture.  This is extremely important.  I do not refer to historical importance pertaining to the people involved in the case.  This is used as a precedent by other countries, including the United States of America, to justify extraordinary rendition and torture, including waterboarding.  This is where it leads.  We have to stand up.  The European Court of Human Rights is a creaky old body, and it does not like reopening cases.  It has to be pressurised into doing this and I urgently ask that the Minister appeals this matter.  It is essential that Ireland appeals this matter to the Grand Chamber.  We cannot permit torture, which this plainly was.  The European Court of Human Rights got it wrong.  It was reluctant to reopen this case.  It must do so in the name of humanity.  </p></speech>

It is an issue I have raised in this Chamber many times, and I refer to and compliment the work recently done by <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, which conducted a survey of GPs throughout the country to ascertain the extent of the problem.  The results of that survey showed that 64% of GPs surveyed have now closed their doors to new patients.  What does that mean?  In County Monaghan, in both Carrickmacross and Monaghan town, GPs have closed their doors to new patients completely.  I encountered a young couple who returned home with their two children to set up life again in County Monaghan.  They approached every GP in the town and none would take them on.  Where are these people meant to go?  I can only imagine how stressful that is with two young children.  They have now been told to approach doctors on call.  That is the only option available to them.  The doctor on call service is now so overwhelmed that it has capped the number of patients not registered with GPs who will be seen.  That cohort includes this family.  This is a very serious situation and it has been allowed to get worse under the Government's watch.  I ask the Leader to call the Minister for Health before the Seanad to advise Members and the people as to what he is doing to address this serious issue.</p><p>The reality is that if someone gets sick he or she cannot go to his or her GP.  Now we find that such people cannot go to a doctor on call service.  Where will they end up?  They will end up queueing, like everybody else, in accident and emergency departments.  It is simply not good enough.  Everyone knows that the GP is the first line of defence when someone gets sick.  We talk about promoting primary care in order that we have a properly functioning system that alleviates the problems in accident and emergency departments.  Here is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

What happened at the weekend falls far below the standard expected of anybody in elected office.  In recent years Mr. Austin Stack has been engaged in a long-running battle to find out what happened to his father.  As everybody knows, Deputy Adams facilitated a meeting in 2013, and he was taken to that meeting in a blacked-out van, which was ridiculous in 2013.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the time, Austin was told that the perpetrators of that attack on his father were still alive and they had been disciplined.  I use inverted commas - as youngster do - on the word "discipline" because if the discipline is anything like the discipline our colleague received at the weekend than I am not inspired.  Perhaps by way of making a proper apology to the Stack family for what happened at the weekend, our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the House and in the D&aacute;il might encourage their colleagues in the IRA to actually help the Stack family to find out exactly what happened to their father, and perhaps bring the perpetrators to justice?</p></speech>

The GP issue has been brought up with me regularly in Limerick also.  It is a real concern and is worthy of debate because perhaps we need to look to a new model of GP services delivery.</p><p>I wish to speak today about Liam O'Flynn.  It is important to remember Liam O'Flynn, who passed away last week.  He was particularly close to my heart because when we lived in England in the 1970s, the emigrant experience was much tougher for my parents back then and for people of that generation.  They would not get home to Ireland that often, maybe once a year if they were lucky.  The music of Liam O'Flynn, and especially on the first album <i>Prosperous</i>, by Christy Moore - which is a Planxty album in all but name - really spoke to those people and it resonated with that generation.  Like so many others, I followed Liam O'Flynn's career with huge admiration.  I was lucky enough to be at the Planxty reunion concert in 2004.  When the sound of Liam's uilleann pipes came soaring in at the beginning the huge cheer that went up from the audience was completely spontaneous.  It spoke of the huge admiration for the splendour of his work.  It is very important to mark the passing of this man.  Liam O'Flynn worked with Seamus Heaney and with Shaun Davey.  A piece of work by Liam O'Flynn is a song written by Shaun Davey called Winter's End.  It is from a 1993 album called <i>Out to An Other Side</i>and I contend that it is the most magnificent piece of music ever written.  It is important to commend the work of Liam O'Flynn and remember the great man who passed away last week.</p></speech>

This obviously helped with the election of President Trump.  Over the years we have talked of dirty tricks and underhand methods in elections but they are in the ha'penny place to what is happening now.  We need a debate on this issue with regard to bribes, ex-spies, dirty tricks and fake news.  We certainly need a debate to find out what exactly is happening with social media.  As we have discussed today, it is far from user-friendly and is being used to model human behaviour.  It could be used to undermine the democratic process in elections.</p> <p>Senator Gavan referred to the UK.  I was in the UK for most of the week.  I was in Cheltenham, in Twickenham and in the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  There is goodwill towards the Irish in the UK but we need to discuss Brexit.  It is looming large and if the United Kingdom leaves the EU it will have a huge impact on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>The Irish people in England and the Irish on the island of Ireland were united with the wonderful result last Saturday.  I am more of a soccer man than a rugby man but this year it is 30 years since Ireland beat England 1-0 in Stuttgart.  As with the uilleann pipes, Shaun Davey and Planxty, sport also gives the Irish people living in the UK a great sense of pride, nationalism and patriotism, without spilling any blood.  I believe the Cathaoirleach worked in the UK.</p></speech>

I am disappointed, however, that there seems to be no indication that the Pope will visit the North of Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would be regrettable if it is the case.</p><p>My main reason for raising this issue is to ask the Leader if he would indicate whether there is any proposal to invite Pope Francis to address both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a proposal that has been made in the past by Senator Norris and there was general acceptance and agreement that that should be the case.  It would be appropriate that the Pope, as the leader of hundreds of millions of Catholics throughout the world and head of the Vatican State, should be invited to address a meeting of both Houses.  I ask the Leader to indicate whether that is being considered.  If not, I propose that it should be considered and ask what process must we engage in to ensure that it happens.</p><p>On Senator Feighan's comments regarding Brexit, it is time that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came back to the House to give us an update on the situation pertaining to Brexit, which is changing on a day-to-day, week-to-week and month-to-month basis.  In recent weeks, we have heard indications from certain elements of the Conservative Government that perhaps a solution to the Border difficulties would be that people from the Republic of Ireland who intended to travel to the Six Counties would register their intention to do so.  As somebody who comes from a Border community, who was born and reared in that community and who saw at first hand the detrimental effect it had on that region, both economically and personally, I want to put it on the record of this House that I and the community from which I come have no intention of registering our intent to visit another part of our country.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to come before the House to provide an update on Brexit, especially as it pertains to the Border region.</p><p>Finally, I welcome those from St. Mogue's college in Bawnboy, County Cavan, who are visiting both Houses this afternoon.</p></speech>

He is a huge loss.  It is important that we give recognition to those who have made a major contribution in the promotion of Irish music over a long period.</p><p>I have raised with the Leader on a number of previous occasions my concerns regarding the issue of the GP contract.  I welcome that the Minister for Health has announced that the negotiations for a new contract are to start in April but I would hope that this is not another process <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The contract has been in place for over 40 years.  We need to progress the issue of how GPs are supported in the community and, as a result of their contribution, how they support people in communities and keep them out of hospital.  On the Commencement debate earlier, I raised the need to train and upskill people in the context of providing home care.  Likewise, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient number of GPs - working together with public health nurses, community nurses and those who provide home care -  to provide care in the community and keep as many as possible out of the hospital and nursing home systems.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Although it will not happen before Easter, I suggest that it might be timely to have a debate after Easter on community care and health care outside the hospital structure.  All of our focus has been on the hospital structure and the HSE.  It is something we should really consider doing.</p><p>In respect of priorities, I am concerned that staffing levels in the HSE have gone up by 11,000 in the last three years.  There is now nearly one new person in administration or management in the HSE for every general practitioner in the country.  That is a disproportionate growth in administration and management in the HSE.</p></speech>

We have a fine tradition in this country of inviting visiting Heads of State to address these Houses.  As he is the Head of the Vatican State, which we have long recognised, it would be appropriate that he be invited to address the joint Houses of the Oireachtas.  I join with Senator Wilson in asking the Leader to make the necessary inquiries as to how this could be set in train.</p> <p>I also support what the Senator has said about Brexit.  I do not think any of us would want to be getting involved in any paperwork and that we would frankly refuse to do so.  I think it is accepted by both sides, anyway, and indeed by the EU, that this will not happen.  Hopefully they will facilitate an all-encompassing trade agreement involving the entire EU and the UK.  They will not enter a customs union but they may call it something else, a customs partnership or whatever, and that would satisfy the matter, please God.  Some of us are going to spend Monday and Tuesday of next week in the so-called palace of Westminster, meeting committees of the Commons and the Lords.  We will be delighted to give the House an update when we return on Wednesday or Thursday.</p></speech>

It is also international Down's syndrome day.  It is a day to reflect on the joy that those good people bring into so many people's lives, the inspiration they are for so many.  It is also a day to reflect on our need to include them and people with disabilities generally more and more in our society.  We have had debates here during which we have probably all spoken from time to time about special needs, education and so on.  It is a good day to remember that we still have a long way to go towards genuine inclusion.</p> <p>I compliment people and companies in the private sector who make space within their workforce, sometimes quite visibly, for persons with Down's syndrome, who make a wonderful contribution.  I also pay tribute to those people, prominent and not so prominent, who do their best to make them more visible in our society.  I would encourage colleagues, if they have not already seen it, to look at a documentary called "A World Without Down's Syndrome?", produced by a woman called Sally Phillips a number of years ago.  Some Senators may know of Sally as an actress.  She featured in "Bridget Jones's Diary" and she set out to explore in an emotional but quite compelling way why it is that with increasing possibilities of screening, such children are being screened out in other jurisdictions, to the point where it is predicted that after a period of years children with Down's syndrome simply will not be born.  There is a lot of food for thought for us in that.  I would recommend to people to watch that particular documentary, produced by Sally and featuring her son, Olly.  It is really very compelling.</p> <p>Most of us have been called on to comment on what our colleague said on social media.  It is an embarrassing situation because the person making that call, Austin Stack, is somebody who needs to be heard.  He is an important voice for the justice that is due to his family over what happened to his father.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, it would be wrong of us to engage in a kind of an embarrassed collegiality and just pipe down.  Equally, it would be wrong for us to engage in the business of virtue signalling, which goes on a lot in politics these days where we want to show how well behaved we are.  Senator Devine has already apologised but I would like her to have the space to do so in this House as well.  I have always believed that a culture of allowing people to up their game and learn from their mistakes, and let us face the fact that we all make mistakes, is better than a culture of calling for heads to roll.  The reconciliation, apology or amends must be sincere and for too long there has been tribalism in politics where people say they embrace new politics but fall back to embracing oppositionalism and hostility.</p></speech>

It seems to concern bots which seems to be where robots imitate human beings.  Perhaps when it comes to social media we need to avoid the phenomenon of human beings acting like robots, in other words robotically getting into a language, and I am not just talking about the particular incident I have mentioned.  There is too much abuse, negativity and nastiness in social media and that is why some of us are pulling away from using social media, to a certain extent.  Let us, as politicians, given the privileged position that we enjoy, give a lead in the responsible use of social media and point the finger at ourselves as much as we might be tempted to point it at others.</p></speech>

I have attended matches in Twickenham a good few times but, unfortunately, the result mostly went the wrong way.  The people of west Cork have a huge claim to Tadhg Furlong who wore the No. 3 jersey because his mother comes from Whiddy Island.  The people of west Cork are very proud of him.  His number one supporter is his grandmother, Mrs. Noreen O'Leary, who still lives on Whiddy Island.  She is a lovely lady and I have often had the good fortune to visit her house for a cup of tea.  When I go to these matches, although it is not often, I always claim that a man from Bantry or Whiddy Island - where only 20 people now reside - is on the front row of the Irish team.  His mother took up a teaching job in south Wexford and I am sure his father, James Furlong, will have a different claim.  I have been very fortunate to have met him on a few occasions and they are lovely people.  This was a great and uplifting occasion for the country.  I felt that I had to make those remarks.</p> <p>In terms of No. 5, Private Members' business, Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill 2016, can the Leader clarify whether the Order for Committee Stage and Committee Stage will be taken together?  </p></speech>

I thank the 20 Members of the House for their contributions on the Order of Business.  I begin by joining with all of the Senators in congratulating the Irish rugby team on their magnificent success on Saturday.  The occasion brought great joy and celebrations to us as a people.  I also congratulate Rory Best and commend Joe Schmidt on their leadership and tremendous success in winning the Grand Slam, in particular winning in Twickenham on St. Patrick's Day.  I thank all of the supporters, clubs, mentors and family members who supported or assisted all of these players to reach the pinnacle of their professional careers last weekend.</p> <p>I thank the Irish supporters for the way they celebrated and behaved during the course of St. Patrick's Day.  I commend all who organised and participated in the St. Patrick's Day parades that took place across the country.  It was a wonderful showcase for us, as a people.  It highlighted the importance of community, creativity and art in this country.  I join with Senators Gavan, Feighan, Coghlan and t&uacute; f&eacute;in, a Chathaoirleach, in paying tribute to and remembering the late Liam O'Flynn.  I wish to convey on my own behalf, and on behalf of the House, our sympathies to his family on his sad passing.</p> <p>I wish to refer to the contribution made by Senator Gavan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would love to have been at the Planxty reunion.  The evocative image Senator Gavan created this morning is something Liam O'Flynn did through his music, work and art.  I wish to be associated with the remarks on his sad passing.</p><p>Data protection was raised by Senators Ardagh, Bacik and Feighan, among others.  The misuse of personal data is both wrong and worrying.  The Data Protection Commissioner is having a meeting with representatives of Facebook.  It is important that we realise the significance of what has taken place with Cambridge Analytica and to commend all involved in unfurling this issue.  It is a cause of worry.  It is our personal data and data harvesting, whether is on Facebook or elsewhere, is wrong and cannot be condoned.  Whether it occurs in the United States, Ireland or the UK, we must be careful and cognisant of it.  I am sure part of the Minister's Bill tomorrow will address some of the issues involved.  However, we must be vigilant in how we use our information online and how we use online apps and information.  It is critical to ensure that what we do online is not given away.  I realise there are some who will use this as a stick with which to beat people but Facebook's European headquarters is in this country.  It has a duty to live up to its obligations and I hope it does so.  The Minister will be in the House tomorrow to discuss the Data Protection Bill and I hope he will address some of the significant issues mentioned in the House this morning.  However, it is a worry.  The trend has begun and I hope it can be curtailed and eliminated.  We have a precious democracy and our vote.  We do not have electronic voting but there is the ability to be influenced by online platforms, as we have seen in other jurisdictions.  I hope that cannot continue.</p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the sports capital funding.  For the record, 35 of the 149 appeals under the sports capital programme appeals process proved successful.  I am not familiar with the information the Senator gave this morning with regard to the school she mentioned, but schools are eligible to apply.  It is ironic that the Senator is complaining about the sports capital programme given that the party of which she is a member closed it down and deprived clubs and schools of the ability-----</p></speech>

Rather than playing one school against another, the sports capital programme is about investing in community, sporting and educational facilities.  There was an appeals process.  There were some clubs in my constituency that were unsuccessful.  I wish they had been successful.  It is important to understand the importance of the sports capital programme.  Many clubs, community groups, schools and facilities are celebrating the sports capital programme, having been awarded an allocation from it.</p></speech>

As regards the point made by Deputy Ardagh about Dublin 8 - to be fair, she has made it previously - I certainly hope that Dublin 8 would not be seen as a dumping ground for the issues the Senator raised.  The people of Dublin 8 and surrounding areas are fine people who invest in their community, promote it and have a great sense of community.  I will be happy to arrange that debate with the Minister in the House.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell, Conway-Walsh, McFadden and Mullen raised the tweet by Senator Devine.  In my political life I never call for a head or make a matter personal but it is fair to say that Senator Devine's actions were grave and catastrophic, to quote Deputy McDonald.  The response of Sinn F&eacute;in has been less than adequate, to be honest.  I will not get into a political row about this because that is not my style.  Brian Stack was killed.  He was a prison officer doing his job.  It is not like anything any other Member of the Oireachtas or politician retweets.  This man was killed and Austin Stack is seeking justice for his father and his family.</p></speech>

His life was cut short.  I agree with Senator Mullen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about ensuring that we allow Senator Devine the space to come to the House, if she so chooses, to make a comment.  In our online activity, none of us can support or retweet anything which is so uncaring in terms of what the Stack family is trying to do.  There is a duty on all of us, whether we are Independents, members of political parties or members of society, to be careful what we say, what we tweet or what we put online.  I have no time for cowards who hide behind anonymous Twitter handles and issue bile against all of us.  They have no place in a democracy.  As democrats, we go before the people and appear on television programmes or radio panels and are accountable.  The issue of keyboard warriors, who are cowards, needs to be addressed.  I hope Senator Devine will reflect on her position.  Other people have made comments but I have never been personal or sought someone's head in my political life.  We all have a duty to understand that this is not just any person, it was a prison officer who was murdered while doing his job.  His family deserve justice. </p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the Social Justice Ireland report.  I have not seen the report but I know Social Justice Ireland held a press conference earlier.  It is important to recognise that unemployment in decreasing and that more people are back at work, which means that people have more money in their pockets and that the level of poverty is decreasing.  I accept that we have a long way to go.  That is why, in a recovering economy, it is important to spend money on services and programmes which deliver for people.  It is also important to recognise that we have a finite amount of money to spend.  I would like someone to tell me why, given that we are spending over &euro;13 billion on health this year, people are still waiting on trolleys and, as Senator Colm Burke inquired, why there has been an increase in the numbers in management.  The fundamental structure of the HSE, which was created by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is wrong and unsound.  That is why the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published.</p><p>Senator Gallagher referred to GPs.  As Senator Colm Burke said, the talks with GPs begin now.  We should not procrastinate or allow the process to become an elongated discussion.  We need investment in primary care.  We need to get rid of the FEMPI legislation, which was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, and restore pay to doctors, nurses and those working in our health system.  That is why the all-party report on Sl&aacute;intecare was published.  It is extraordinary that we have inequalities and inadequacies in our health system at a time when we have the highest ever budget.  Something is not right.  In my opinion, it is the management structure of the HSE.  Senator Colm Burke is 100% correct.  We have too many managers and people walking around hospitals with clipboards and pens.  We need investment in real people.  I speak from experience in that regard.</p><p>I agree with Senator Bacik on the all-party motion on Syria.  I am endeavouring to have an all-party motion from the point of view of the Government, as she knows.</p><p>I join Senators Norris and Ruane in commending the students of Trinity College.  They raised the ridiculous decision to introduce a fee for students repeating exams before the St. Patrick's day break.  As I said, students are vulnerable and under stress.  The decision was wrong and I welcome the talks and intervention by the student body.  It is always important to have a good student body.  Senator Ruane was a member of the student body when she attended Trinity College.  It is important that students' unions recognise that they have power, legitimacy and a mandate from their peers to negotiate on their behalf.</p><p>I hope the referendum Bill goes through the D&aacute;il today and tomorrow.  As we discussed at the leaders' meeting last week, I hope to have the Bill in the House next week and to conclude the debate on it by Easter in order that we can allow for the establishment of the Referendum Commission.  All Senators should allow for our deliberations on the Bill to be concluded before the Easter recess.</p><p>Senator Ruane referred to social welfare inspections.  I am not familiar with the issue she raised.  We have always had social welfare inspections but there is a need for decorum and due process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Equally, there are people who are abusing the system who need to be held to account.  I agree with the Senator that there is a balance we can strike in this regard.</p><p>Senator Byrne asked when the dual-diagnosis clinical programme for addiction and mental health announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will be established.  I will endeavour to have that information provided to the Senator.  </p><p>One the eve of the anniversary of the Warrington bombing, I join Senator Swanick in paying tribute to Colin and Wendy Parry on their bravery and courage and in remembering Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, who were killed in that bombing.  We all remember the effect it had on us and so many people around the world.  The Senator is right to praise and commend them on their bravery.  </p><p>It is my intention to have a discussion on the Good Friday Agreement post Easter.  I will endeavour to have that debate the first week after the Easter recess.  We had hoped to take statements on issues pertaining to Brexit related to the North but owing to changes to the Minister's schedule, we will have to rearrange the taking of that debate.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan's contributions are, in the majority of cases, profound.  His commentary this morning regarding the rejection by the European Court of Human Rights of the Government's case around the so-called hooded men is baffling.  Those men were tortured by the British army and the RUC and their human rights were denied.  Irrespective of who they are, they are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity.  I agree with the Senator that human rights are applicable to everybody.</p></speech>

It is important that all local authorities, the Government and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, get on board with this programme.  Yesterday, President Juncker spoke about connectivity in every village and city by 2020.  I hope that we can do that.  </p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of asylum seekers in Lisdoonvarna.  All of us accept that we have a duty to take in refugees and to make them welcome here.  I am not familiar with the details of the case in Lisdoonvarna but I am certain that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, as a former Chairman of the justice committee and a person with huge interest in this area is working with the Department on this issue.  The Senator might get a speedier response were he to table a Commencement matter on the issue.  All of us recognise that we must people who come to our country with respect and dignity and that is what, I am sure, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is endeavouring to do in this case.  As I said, I am not familiar with the case.</p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of hospital parking charges.  I congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on being the first Minister to examine the issue of hospital parking charges.  To be fair, Senator Noone raised the matter here long the current furore about it.  It is important that there is recognition of the reason family members visit hospitals.  Some hospitals provide a voucher to the families of people who are in cancer treatment.  It is important to acknowledge that the review is under way.  </p> <p>I join with Senator Butler in congratulating the staff in the Athboy post office on their decision to return to work immediately and in wishing the innocent member of the public well in his recovery.  </p> <p>Senator Norris also raised the issue of European Court of Human Rights decision.  The other matter raised by the Senator is one for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  </p> <p>Senators Gallagher and Burke raised the issue of general practitioners, who play a critical role in our health system.  It is important that a new GP contract is signed immediately.  We also need an increase in capacity and to bring about reform.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Gallagher has become a little absent-minded in his outlook in life in respect of his contributions on the Order of Business of late.  He is coming to the Chamber with rose-tinted glasses.  He should look upon the FEMPI cuts imposed by his own party and the way in which they decimated the health system when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  Now we are seeing an increase in the number of training places and a recruitment campaign.  However, I recognise that we have a way to go and should see a reversal of FEMPI and pay restoration for our GPs, who are at the vanguard of what is done in the health system.  Primary care is important, and it is important, as I said earlier, that the talks, including the contract talks, begin immediately and do not become an prolonged talking shop.  Our GPs deserve pay restoration and improved pay and conditions.  If we are to give due recognition to reform in our health system, our GPs must be part of that and we need that done immediately.</p></speech>

It is important he is welcomed into our country.  He is the Head of State of the Vatican and the head of the Catholic Church, the Pontiff.  I would very much support and welcome an address by him to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am very much of the view that we should facilitate that if his itinerary allows him to do so.  I also hope the organisers of the conference in Dublin will recognise the diversity of family units in our country.  It is not just husband and wife; there are also single mothers, members of the LGBT community, who are well able to raise their children, and widows and divorcees raising their children.  I therefore hope the idea of family is broadened as that would be inclusive and welcoming to everyone.</p> <p>I have addressed the issue Senator Colm Burke raised.  He is right about community health care.  We should have that debate also.</p> <p>Senators Feighan and Coghlan raised the issue of Brexit and the significance of the talks next Friday.  I wish our Taoiseach, our T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, every success in them.  From our perspective, an Irish perspective, the Government and the Taoiseach next Friday will determine what happens and decide if enough progress is being made, but the important point for us is that nothing is agreed in respect of Brexit until everything is agreed.
