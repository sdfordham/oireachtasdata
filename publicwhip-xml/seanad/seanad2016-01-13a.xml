This matter relates to Four Masters Bridge and Lennox Bridge which connect Kinlough in north County Leitrim to Bundoran and Ballyshannon in County Donegal.  Lennox Bridge is a single lane bridge that has been in place for many years.  It is cracked and the most recent head-on collision on it happened last weekend.  On this occasion there were relatively minor injuries, but it is one of the worst roads in the country.  Urgent action by the Government is required to upgrade it to a two lane bridge and make it safe.</p> <p>Four Masters Bridge is further downstream on the River Drowse which separates the two counties.  It was badly damaged by the recent flooding and is unsafe.  It is a protected structure and the road is closed.  Approximately 4,000 crossings take place each day on Lennox Bridge as members of the local communities go about their daily business in Ballyshannon and Bundoran in doing the shopping, commuting to schools and engaging in other administrative tasks.  Following the closure of Four Masters Bridge, the number of crossings has increased.  However, as I have illustrated, accidents occur frequently and, sadly, a fatal accident may not be far away.  As we witnessed in Leenane, County Mayo, these are old bridges that could be swept away in future flooding.  This could cut the communities in question off completely.</p> <p>I am not aware of plans for the immediate upgrade of the two bridges.  I have contacted the managers of Donegal and Leitrim County Councils in the hope they will urgently petition the Minister for immediate funds and support in this regard.  It is a critical issue in this part of the country, not least in the context of the tourism industry.  The Drowse fishery is important.  I spoke to the owner and he has said this time of year is as crucial to this part of the country as 12 July is to some in Northern Ireland in terms of tourism revenue.  People are trying to catch the first salmon of the season which has yet to be caught.</p> <p>When there are crises in this country, whether they are related to refugees, flooding, homelessness and so on, regardless of the financial constraints on Departments, the Government can come up with funds when it is forced to do so.  All of these causes are worthy of Government support and moneys can always be found to attempt to solve these difficulties, but the communities of north Leitrim and south Donegal are no less deserving.  These two bridges have been left to the elements for too long.  The integrity of Four Masters Bridge has been seriously damaged and it is closed, while Lennox Bridge is a single-lane, accident prone crossing point.  I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to liaise with both councils to come up with an urgent remedy for both crossings.</p></speech>

I will also be doing so in the D&aacute;il this afternoon.</p><p>As the Senator is aware, the most extensive impact of the weather to date for the transport sector has been on the road network and within that I include the kinds of bridges to which the Senator refers.  It has caused very serious disruption to daily life in many areas and led to the cutting off in some cases of small communities and households from others.  The priority of local and national agencies to date has been public safety and there has been ongoing communication between local authorities, State bodies and residents in affected areas to ensure  people were aware of the safety messages that issued relating to travelling in flooded areas and road closures or diversions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authority staff, along with other relevant agencies, have worked closely to ensure that warning signs have been put in place, diversion routes organised and signposted, with information and advice made available to the public via websites, social media and local radio.  The Road Safety Authority has been very active over the past month in supporting and disseminating safety measures for all road users.</p><p>With regard to the scale of damage and responding to the issue raised by Senator MacSharry, local authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, have advised my Department that it is not possible to get a comprehensive view of damage to road pavements until the floods fully recede and investigations and assessments are carried out.  Bridges damaged as a result of flooding and storms, including bridges mentioned by the Senator, will need to be inspected, with a detailed assessment of the damage undertaken.  TII has engineering consultants on a bridge framework available to commence inspections once flooding has subsided.  Underwater inspection is a specialist area and only a limited number of consultants have the capability to undertake such inspections.  The chief executive of TII has written to local authorities offering the services of the framework consultants if there are non-national road bridges of concern that they consider need to be inspected.  In certain cases, it may be months before full information is available on the cost of repairs whereas in other cases, where water levels have receded more quickly, the timeframe will be shorter.  In any event, my officials and those in TIl will engage with local authority officials to minimise the timeframe associated with critical repair works.</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been taking the lead in responding to the immediate needs of local authorities arising from the storms and flooding and provided funding to local authorities to allow them to deal quickly with the clean-up and measures needed to protect public safety.  That Department has also sought submissions from local authorities setting out both the estimated short-term costs and the costs related to damage to infrastructure, including transport.  This is to give a full picture of the full cost, and I am working on putting that cost together.</p><p>So far, 25 of the 28 local authorities have reported on their estimated infrastructure damage costs and my Department is now reviewing these estimates.  The capital budget for my Department for this year is very tight and I have asked my officials as a matter of urgency to assess areas - such as those referred to by Senator MacSharry - where funding can be reprioritised or reallocated in order to deal with the consequences of the storms.  The scale of the damage incurred and the overall cost will be very large and require a response across the Government and I am working with Ministers on that.  The infrastructure mentioned by the Senator is an example of the kind of work that I accept we will need to respond to in the coming months.</p></speech>

Sadly, that was a very generic response and it could probably apply to most counties in Ireland with respect to flooding damage and so on.  I am disappointed the Minister did not say that he has spoken to officials in the Department and that they will engage with the county managers of both counties to prioritise this.  As the Minister stated, the community has effectively been cut off.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is awful flood damage throughout the country and I commend all the services that are undertaking great work to address it.

He is correct to say that I have given him a national overview of the situation.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate that while this is a very important project to the Senator and the community on whose behalf he is raising the issue, my challenge is that we now have hundreds of these issues throughout the country.  I am working within Government to come up with a plan to allow us to respond to that and I will certainly consider the bridges to which the Senator has referred.</p></speech>

The chronic traffic situation we experience in Galway on an ongoing basis is getting worse.  I propose one immediate solution to bring some relief which I want to discuss with the Minister and seek his advice on its implementation.  The issue is the need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to discuss the effectiveness of high-occupancy vehicles - those carrying two, three or more persons - being allowed to use bus lanes in Galway city and how we would go about its implementation.  I have looked at international evidence and I suggest this to the Minister as a short-term measure to alleviate gridlock and traffic delays, including panic and danger, as I will outline to the Minister.  I suggest it also on the basis that the bus system is not optimised in Galway city.  The system is very poor and I have had discussions with the National Transport Authority which confirms that the bus system is not optimised.  Galway City Council and the NTA will report on a major traffic study in February but immediate traffic solutions are needed for Galway city.  I have prepared a website called <i>galwaytraffic.ie </i>in which I propose four solutions of which this is only one.</p><p>The first one I propose is a dedicated school bus system for Galway city.  There are approximately 30 schools in Galway city and the traffic is better during school holidays.  The situation would be better if those kids were using a bus instead of relying on parents to drive them, because mostly there is only one child per car.  The evidence is that only about 3% of people use buses in Galway while 80% use cars.  Those figures are confirmed by two studies carried out by Galway Chamber of Commerce and Lewis Lesley, who has a long-standing interest in this area.  The other solution I have mentioned is the high-occupancy vehicles, HOVs, which I will speak about here.</p><p>There is no bus lane across the Quincentenary Bridge.  In Galway, people live mostly on the west side of the city whereas most people work on the east side.  There is no bus lane, which means that everyone has to go through the city centre, which is ridiculous.  Of course, an engineering solution would need to be found to make that safe.</p><p>Finally, I propose a light rail system for Galway city.  At least 30 cities in Europe with fewer than 100,000 people have light rail systems.  It is possible and I am very aware of the peak hour passenger figures that are needed for that.  I am working with the NTA on that and we are about to carry out a peak hour passenger count.  I can assure the Minister that, based on the evidence I have, there is support for it.</p><p>To return to the issue of the high occupancy vehicle that I mentioned, peak hour traffic is very bad between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  Outside those times, it is not so bad.  The Minister will not be surprised that at 3 a.m. the streets are empty.  Immediate action is needed to ease peak hour congestion and that is why I suggest this solution, which as I say is a short-term solution in the absence of real solutions.  At the moment, four out of five peak cars have only one passenger; the remaining cars have two or more.  We need to incentivise this.  As a pilot study, during one peak hour, cars carrying two or more passengers should be allowed to use the bus lanes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is evidence that chronic traffic delays elsewhere in the world have been reduced by 30%.</p><p>I would not be making this proposal to the Minister if we had an adequate bus system in Galway.  The NTA has pointed out to me that if we had an adequate bus system for peak hours, there should be buses running every three minutes.  There are just five bus lanes in Galway city, with only an occasional bus using them.  This is a waste.  Can the Minister imagine how frustrating it is for people to sit in chronic traffic while there is an empty lane to the left with an occasional bus or taxi in it?  I understand the importance of compliance and so on and the importance of safety in the context of how the lanes would merge.  However, because the bus lanes are only in certain areas, traffic is obliged to merge at the end of the lanes in any event.  I do not believe, therefore, it would cause any unnecessary dangers.  The evidence also shows that this measure would be very symbolic and that it would encourage people to start talking about how to car-pool and to consider how to improve our environment.  The Minister knows that Ireland is facing huge environmental fines after 2020 if we do not look at transport as a major cause of emissions.  This measure could be effective in the short term, it is highly symbolic and it will start people talking about solutions.  I know the Minister is going to report that there is a by-pass in the offing, but that may or may not happen.  That is the history in Galway and I will conclude by putting it to the Minister that Galway needs immediate traffic solutions now.  I am keen to hear his response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#E00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I agree there is a need to reduce traffic congestion within Galway city and county, to improve commuting times and to reduce emissions.  No one would argue against encouraging higher vehicle occupancy where possible.  Four people travelling in one car is a much more efficient way of using resources than each taking a separate car.  However, the specific point raised by Senator Healy Eames relates to whether allowing multi-occupancy vehicles to use bus lanes would be an appropriate way to encourage multi-occupancy.  The short answer is that it would not.</p> <p>We must remember what is the purpose of bus lanes and why they are in place.  The rationale for creating the bus lane network was to provide on-street priority for buses.  The intention is to make bus services faster and more reliable to attract more people out of their cars and onto public transport.  This helps to reduce congestion and pollution.  The construction of the bus lane network was done at some expense to the public in order to enable this to happen.  The legislation governing usage of the bus lanes is set out in the Road Traffic Regulations 1997, as amended.  Under this legislation, buses and bicycles are allowed to avail of bus lanes, as are taxis in the case of with-flow bus lanes only.  Cyclists were permitted to use bus lanes as they are inherently vulnerable as road users and are considered safer in bus lanes rather than in general traffic.  It may interest the House to know that taxis were initially not allowed into bus lanes.  It was only after the introduction of bus lanes that it was agreed to allow taxis to also use them.   This was done after much consideration and was a concession based on the fact that taxis are available for on-street hire.  Vehicles used by members of the emergency services - the Garda, the fire brigade and the ambulance service - in the course of their duties may also be driven in bus lanes in order to prevent delay in reaching the scenes of emergencies, transporting people to hospital, etc.  Since the introduction of the bus lane network, my Department has received numerous requests - indeed I have been in this House on many occasions to discuss such requests - in respect of the need to open bus lanes to other categories of road users.  Some of those requests related to multi-occupancy cars.  In all cases, my predecessors and I have taken the view that extending the use of bus lanes to other categories of vehicles would undermine the original purpose of the lanes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The overriding concern in considering these applications is the carrying capacity of bus lanes.  We do not want their primary role of providing bus priority to be undermined by allowing other vehicles access.</p><p>As a result, we have chosen to maintain the current restrictions on use of bus lanes.  While in some cases the numbers of vehicles involved might not be large, conceding access to bus lanes to any new class of vehicles would make it difficult to argue against doing so for any other.  We also need to remember that last year in this city alone, passenger numbers on the Dublin Bus network rose to 122 million on the company's 110 public service routes.  In the Senator's city, the numbers using Bus &Eacute;ireann's services are up from 3.5 million in 2012 to more than 4 million in 2014, a huge increase of 14%.</p><p>As the country gets back to work and the recovery strengthens, we must ensure that taking the bus to school, college or work is an attractive option, so that people leave their cars behind and reduce congestion on our roads.  One of the ways to do that is by ensuring bus lanes are free flowing and journey times are as short as possible.</p><p>In light of the original reasons for creating bus lanes and the sound reasons for rejecting previous proposals to extend access to other classes of vehicle, I remain of the view that there is no ground for changing the law to allow multi-occupancy vehicles into bus lanes.</p></speech>

The Minister said taking the bus to school or work is a good idea.  There are no buses in Galway city to take people to school.  That is the problem.  That is why I said one of my solutions was a dedicated bus system.  There are not adequate buses.  The response of the National Transport Authority, NTA, to me was that for 2,000 passengers per peak hour, one bus every three minutes is needed.  We do not have that.</p></speech>

With respect, if the Senator tables a matter and asks me to respond, I will respond to it.  I can respond to her broader question because I participated in a forum on how to respond to the management of traffic in Galway.  The short answer from a public transport perspective is that we need to provide more buses.  We have funding in our capital plan to do that, which is the very reason I do not want to change the use of bus lanes.  If we increase the number of buses available across the country, which we will, it will be up to Bus &Eacute;ireann to decide where to deploy those buses.  As more buses become available, it is very important that we make sure to keep the bus lanes clear for the use of those buses.</p> <p>The broader reason, specifically in respect of using bus lanes, is that if I were to make them available to more than one additional form of road user, the demand to make them more widely available would continue to increase.  I want to have more buses using the bus lanes in Galway and elsewhere and that is why I continue to hold the view that we should keep the lanes free for current buses and more buses.</p></speech>

It is level with the national park where the deer are free to roam.  At a recent inquest, the coroner said that while he could not find traces of deer in that fatal accident, there were traces of deer in three fatal accidents previously.  Many minor accidents have occurred on that stretch of road.  Last week, I spoke to a woman who told me a deer wandered onto the road, hit the windscreen of her car and smashed it and broke the mirror.  Many such accidents occur at that location but many people do not report them.  I have been on to garda&iacute; in Killarney who told me they get between 70 to 100 calls every year from people reporting deer on the road posing a danger.</p><p>The Minister will appreciate that if a farmer had livestock in a field, he would have to have a ditch or a fence to stop cows, sheep or other animals wandering onto the main road where an accident could happen.  There used to be a high wall at that location but for some reason, it was removed and there is nothing in its place to prevent the deer wandering onto the road.  The Minister should not get me wrong.  I love the deer.  They are a big draw in terms of visitors to Killarney town and we are very proud of them but we must ensure the safety of motorcyclists and pedestrians on that stretch of road.  It is the main Ring of Kerry road on which many tourists travel.  There is a warning sign with a deer on a yellow background and there is also another one indicating that horses are crossing as the road is used by a riding school.  Signs should be erected that will have more of an impact on tourists and make them aware that accidents occur at this location and that deer wander onto the road.  </p><p>I am aware there has been some resistance to putting up a fence in this area.  It is difficult to establish who owns the land because in response to a motion put down by someone, the council said the land was in the ownership of Bord F&aacute;ilte.  I would have thought it was in the ownership of the Office of Public Works but I believe now that it is under the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We should try to establish who has responsibility for that stretch of land and ask that a barrier be put up to stop the deer jumping onto the road and causing many accidents in that location.  I will await the Minister of State's reply before I refer to the matter further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#G00200"><p>I thank Senator Moloney for raising the matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  It should be noted that while the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht licenses hunting of deer, the Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Deer Management in Ireland - Framework for Action in March last year, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish deer management forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the report.  The forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations as well as representatives from both Departments.</p> <p>With regard to calls for increased fencing relating to incidents of deer presence on public roads in Kerry, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has no plans to fence the national park.  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and I am advised it is not part of the remit of the Department to cordon them onto specific areas of land.  Moreover, fencing the national park would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  The presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and so fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.  The park is more than 10,000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task which is unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is 8 in. off the ground while red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The erection of a fence of this scale could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.  There are many deer outside the park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists.  The Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved, possibly larger, signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  Officials from the Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand the council has recently undertaken works to improve sight lines in the Ballydowney area for the benefit of motorists.  Additional or relocated advance deer warning signs, or both, may also be provided by the local authority.</p></speech>

Who is going to protect the motorists?  Three fatal accidents involving deer have occurred in that area.  How many more people must die before we do something about it?  I cannot understand it.  There was a wall there previously but it was taken down.  Why was the wall there in the first place if we were trying to let the deer roam freely?  Someone made a wise decision to erect a wall there but now that wall is gone, which poses a danger for motorists.</p> <p>I know this issue is not in the Minister of State's remit and he cannot answer my questions on it, which is why I would have liked the Minister to be here to respond.  I want to know why the wall was taken down.  Why do we feel we can do nothing about a stretch of roadway which has seen many accidents involving deer?  We can protect the animals and their habitat but we cannot protect the people.</p></speech>

If it is the case that there was a wall there, perhaps some form of secure fencing could be erected in the area to protect motorists.  It is terrible to hear that deer may have been responsible for accidents in the area.</p></speech>

I am not sure how much the Minister of State knows about this particular drug, Orkambi.  There are a number of people in north Wexford who have children suffering from cystic fibrosis and they believe or expect that this drug could have a major impact on their children's lives.  There has been some degree of misinformation about this issue and I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position of the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE with regard to the status of this drug.  Following the evaluation process, when will this drug come to the market?  If it comes to the market, will it be made available to cystic fibrosis sufferers?</p></speech>

I am aware of the effects that very specialised drugs can have on relatively rare conditions.  Cystic fibrosis is a relatively rare disease, although it is not so rare in Ireland, particularly in the south of the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Decisions on which medicines are licensed for use in Ireland and reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts the health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  It is appropriate that there should be no political or ministerial decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determining the extent to which patients can benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p><p>As the Senator may be aware, Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, CF, in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and the European Medicines Agency on 19 November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the past few months.  Its manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted a rapid review application to the NCPE on  26 November 2015.  This rapid review represents the first step in a pricing and reimbursement application.  The NCPE has completed the rapid review and recommended a full health technology assessment of the drug.</p><p>Based on pricing details in the rapid review file, the HSE estimates that reimbursement would cost approximately &euro;90 million per year.  However, the company has yet to submit a full pricing and reimbursement application to the HSE&rsquo;s primary care reimbursement service.  Since early 2013, the HSE has reimbursed more than &euro;60 million for CF patients receiving Kalydeco and there are approximately 140 patients being treated with this drug.  In the next decade the HSE expects to spend well over &euro;200 million on this small but unique group of patients.</p><p>While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever price a drug company demands, the interests of the health service as a whole require that we only reimburse the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.  I also appreciate and fully understand people suffering from cystic fibrosis will be most anxious for an early and positive decision on reimbursement for Orkambi.  However, it would not be appropriate for me to appear to prejudge decisions which are for the HSE in the first instance under legislation passed by the Oireachtas in 2013.  I trust that the Senator will understand the position.</p></speech>

However, I would like to hear her view.  I am glad that she has come to the House to respond on this issue because I am aware of her role in the use of Kalydeco and the benefits to be gained from using it.  If Orkambi can do what is said it can, I ask her to ensure an early and favourable decision is made on the issue.  By all accounts, people suffering from cystic fibrosis could benefit enormously in terms of their quality of life.  The Minister of State has been involved in a similar issue previously and I would like to hear her personal view in this instance which would be appreciated.  She has said she has a close personal friend who is suffering.</p> <p>I find it distasteful that before Christmas a Member of this House effectively misled people on this matter.  There was a conversation about Commencement matters and a vote was taken.  However, the message was sent that the use of Orkambi had been discussed in this Chamber, that we had voted on the matter and that Members on one side of the House had voted against making the drug available.  That is reprehensible and not the way we normally do business.  We should not and cannot go down the route of playing politics with people's illnesses.  Many people were misled.</p></speech>

That is not how the process works.  It is not a political decision.  It is very much a decision made on scientific and economic grounds.</p> <p>I have been listening to the debate on this issue over the Christmas and new year period, and more recently.  Even those who advocate on behalf of the CF community, some of whom I know, admit that this drug is too expensive.  As regards to if and when it is approved, I have no opinion on that and I do not think it would be right for me to offer an opinion on it at this stage.  This issue should be dealt with on a Europe-wide basis.  Even though our CF numbers are exceptionally high, it is easy to take a small country like Ireland and pick us off saying, "There's our price and that's what we're getting."  It is much easier to deal with a greater population base, so the EU should come together to negotiate the purchase price for all drugs on a Europe-wide basis.  </p> <p>As I said, even those advocating on behalf of the CF community admit that, as it stands, this drug is way too expensive.  These people are not foolish; they know the consequences and the possible effect it could have.  Equally, however, they understand that there is not a bottomless financial pit.  While it is important for us to take on board what they are saying, we need to move swiftly towards the point where Europe negotiates with the pharmacological industry, rather than smaller countries and regions doing it alone, such as in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Luxembourg or Liechtenstein.  If not, we will be left isolated and unable to negotiate a better deal for ourselves.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#O00600"><p>I wish everybody a happy new year, the best of luck in terms of their work over the next few weeks and varying degrees of success in that regard.</p> <p>I raise with the Leader the issue of the rate of pay for new Garda recruits, which issue the Leader has also raised in the past.  According to a recently published report, the starting salary for a garda is &euro;23,171 per annum.  The comparable rate of pay for a PSNI trainee, in euro terms, is &euro;32,000.  As Members will be aware, the rent allowance for garda&iacute; of up to &euro;4,000 per annum, along with 29 other allowances, has been abolished.  Some of our best and brightest are joining the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, within which a two-tier system in terms of pay now operates.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The Government, rather continuing to reduce taxes for the highest paid workers in this country, needs to ensure protection of our front-line services, particularly in this instance An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The starting salary for a member of the London Metropolitan Police Service is &euro;35,000, which means pay scales here are way out of kilter.</p> <p>Garda numbers also need to be increased significantly.  Fianna F&aacute;il, if returned to government after the next general election, is committed to increasing Garda numbers to 14,000 over the lifetime of the next Government.  It is important there is pay equality in this area.  Will the Leader raise this matter directly with the Minister for Justice and Equality?  It needs to be addressed and the Government needs to make a statement in this regard.  It is not equitable that a garda protecting our State would be paid significantly less than another garda doing the same job.  Reform in this regard needs to start with Garda recruits.  I do not think anybody would agree that it is right that the starting salary for a Garda, on completion of his or her training in Templemore, would be just over &euro;23,000.</p> <p>I note the Leader's comment that a debate on flooding is being held in the D&aacute;il today and that a similar debate will be held in this House next week.  I welcome that.  I am not sure if Members are aware of the OPW's catchment flood risk and management, CFRAM, study of flood risk areas throughout the country, which was commenced prior to the recent flood events and seeks to determine whether particular areas are flood plains.  My concern in this regard is the lack of notice given to householders or landowners living in those areas.  The deadline for observations on this study was 23 December 2015, which was the day before Christmas Eve.  I understand that in the case of the Leinster region, only 12 submissions were made by the public to the Office of Public Works.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reason for that was that people were not aware that this study was taking place.</p><p>I have further found out that the OPW in its draft report did not even use its own flood maps.  They are desk surveys and it has been proven in a number of instances that it is not even using its own data.  While we need to ensure that we protect areas from flooding and that we map where future areas at risk of flooding may be, surely to God the OPW should be basing its study on its own maps and, more importantly, it should seek submissions from the public who have that information.  Something has gone desperately wrong if only 12 submissions have been made in the whole of Leinster.  That is because people do not know about it.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to pause this process right now and to republicise what the OPW is doing in order to let people have their say and to let home owners and landowners make their submissions.  They have the local knowledge.  The CFRAM started in 2009 and we are now in 2016.</p></speech>

I also congratulate Mr. Peter Finnegan on his new appointment.  I thank the Leader for facilitating a debate on flooding next week.</p> <p>I express sympathy to all those who have been affected by the terrible floods of recent weeks.  I hope we will see some resolution of the difficulties with insurance cover.  It is very important that insurance companies are made to play their part in ensuring that people are not so badly affected by the floods.</p> <p>I look forward to today's debate on Innovation 2020.  I welcome the launch today by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Education and Skills of the Pathways to Work programme setting out 86 actions with the aim of increasing the numbers at work to 2.2 million by 2020.  It is an ambitious target but it is realistic and achievable, particularly in light of the targets achieved in job creation and, as the T&aacute;naiste said, in light of the very welcome further reduction in unemployment in the past month, which has now come down to 8.8%.</p> <p>I believe this will come up in this afternoon's debate.  It is a concern to see high dropout rates, particularly in the STEM subjects, science, technology, engineering and maths, in third level institutions.  I know Senator Barrett, in particular, will agree with me on that.  We need to focus our debate on that aspect because clearly it has the potential to have a detrimental effect on job creation.</p> <p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned garda recruitment.  I wish to raise a particular issue that I may well submit as a matter on the Commencement next week.  A number of constituents have raised with me the upper age limit of 35 for garda recruits and I am sure it has been raised with others.  I raised the matter with the then Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, in 2013.  At that point, he said there would be a review of the upper age limit to see if it could be raised.  I understand the age in Northern Ireland is higher and it seems to be a somewhat arbitrary cut-off point for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly now that recruitment has reopened, which is a very welcome development.</p> <p>I commend those United Nations workers who have been engaged in delivering aid to the besieged citizens in Syria.  I support the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, who spoke today about the need to end war crimes in Syria, noting that 400,000 Syrian people are living under siege in 15 locations across Syria and that besiegement of civilian populations is being used as a war crime by a number of parties to the conflict, notably by the Syrian Government.  I commend all those humanitarian workers engaged in providing such much-needed assistance.</p></speech>

There is a considerable amount to say and I think some other Senators will support me.  Last week's "Prime Time" programme contained a very good report on Portlaoise.  Senator Whelan has worked hard on this issue and I congratulate him.  For 15 years, the residents around the Enva plant in Portlaoise have suffered from the effects of noxious fumes.  They are powerless, as is Senator Whelan, to get anything done about it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Ann O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2389"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2389&amp;amp;pid=MaryAnnOBrien&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Members will know from the debate on the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last summer that we tried to table an amendment to it to raise the issue of the immunity that protects the EPA under section 15 of the Act, which indemnifies the director general, other directors and authorised persons against legal action.  The residents living in the vicinity of that plant have been trying to get their voices heard for 15 years but such immunity protects the group which controls our environment.  We are discussing the issue of flooding but air quality is becoming an issue we must think about every day.  We must make a huge commitment to our environment from here on in.  It ranks high up there with jobs and health because we are talking about the future of the health of our population and the future of our country for future generations.  We can no longer ignore the environment.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly must intervene.</p><p>During the past five years as a Member of this House, I have represented a group with respect to the Aughinish plant.  There is a nightmare scenario in that location.</p></speech>

This has to stop.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, in her closing speech to the debate on that Bill, stated "I can assure and inform Senator O'Brien that the Minister has confirmed to me that the Department will expedite the completion of the current review and a comprehensive report on this subject will be presented before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 90 days".  Ninety days from the commencement of that Act was 4 November 2015 and today is 13 January 2016.  I received a letter from the Minister's Department on 30 November stating that final edits to the draft report are being made and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will be reviewing it in the coming days.  The Minister needs to come in to the House and lay that report before us.  The issue of  why the EPA has such immunity needs to be raised in order that we can have legal conversations, if necessary, about it.</p></speech>

Many families continue to suffer in parts of the country, including in parts of County Galway.  The emergency services, particularly the local authorities, the Red Cross, the Army and the Garda did amazing work in helping communities.  They went above and beyond the call of duty and they were stretched, physically and mentally, as were many of the householders and landowners who were experiencing very difficult times.</p> <p>As the waters subside our attention must turn to putting solutions in place that will reduce the risk of flooding in the future.  Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study.  I have a much more positive story to relate with respect to the CFRAM study, the OPW and Galway County Council.  We had a fine gathering in Ballinasloe on Monday.  It was the second such meeting to have taken place, the first one having been held in February, where five different options were rolled out for comment by the local communities.  Up to 100 people from Ballinasloe and the surrounding areas attended that meeting and they will come back in May or June with the preferred options for solving the problem in the Ballinasloe area.</p> <p>With respect to the &euro;430 million that the Government has allocated for the next six years, it is imperative that the deadlines for completing the CFRAM studies are met with respect to prioritising projects and that the investment in the worst impacted areas takes place as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The small schemes projects is a fine programme organised through the council councils.  It is important that adequate funding is made available to ensure those schemes proceed quickly.  I very much welcome that &euro;18 million has been provided to local authorities for a big clean-up, but much damage has been done to roads throughout rural Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that county councils quantify the damage as quickly as possible and inform the Department and that the Government then make funding available to repair roads as quickly as possible in order that a semblance of normality can be restored to rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I also congratulate Ms Maria Louise Fufezan and Ms Diana Bura who won the BT Young Scientist of the Year award last week with a project on enzymes in animal foods.  They attend Loreto College in Balbriggan.  The event was a huge success and, as Senator Ivana Bacik said, will feed into our discussion later on Innovation 2020.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement yesterday of the development of a &euro;1.5 million radio astronomy facility at Birr Castle.  There is a significant tradition of astronomy and science in general among the Parsons family who own the castle and the future of that tradition is assured.  This will also feed into the discussion on Innovation 2020.</p> <p>Like the Cathaoirleach, I welcome Mr. George Hamilton to the House.  He played the cello in Methodist College, Belfast, which suits him as he presents "Hamilton Scores" every Saturday and Sunday.  He also studied modern languages at Queen's University Belfast, which means that he can pronounce all of those unpronounceable names of foreign footballers.  His educational career suited him well for his two current posts.  A tribute has been paid to him but because he was in Genoa at the time, he may not know about it.  During the famous penalty shoot-out following two hours and 42 minutes of football the Taoiseach of the day, the late Mr. Haughey, suspended a press conference in Dublin Castle to mark the end of Ireland's EU Presidency because everybody wanted to see Packie Bonner and David O'Leary and hear George.  We all wanted to hear a memorable phrase and his was, "The nation holds its breath."  He is welcome.</p></speech>

I commend colleagues who have approached this issue in a non-partisan, apolitical way because it is not only about pollution but also about public health.  Our time in this Seanad is running out and it is time for action because the time for reports is over.  We need answers to establish why the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, behaves as a lazy, lax, limp and lame lapdog instead of as a watchdog in the public interest.  No one watching Mark Coughlan's report on "Prime Time" last Thursday night could have had a scintilla of confidence in the so-called Environmental Protection Agency.   I do not and those at the top, including the director of environmental enforcement and the director general, should step aside if they have any respect for their jobs or the organisation they purport to represent.  The programme was a great example of public service broadcasting, but it should not have taken the perseverance of the journalist to bring this issue into public view.</p> <p>We first tabled motions on the issue in the House two years ago when Mr. Phil Hogan was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Three reports were ordered by him and his successor, but on each occasion, the EPA came back stating, "There is nothing to see here.  Everything is squeaky clean.  You can sleep easy in your beds."  The people of Portlaoise are not sleeping easy in their beds.  One does not need to have won an award at the young scientist exhibition last week or to be a rocket scientist to know that if one boils oil at 80, 90 or 100 degrees, the toxins and carcinogens emitted will not good for people's health.  This is wrong; it is a scandal and needs to be addressed.  It needs to be stopped.  We have a responsibility in that regard.  I commend the Leader for running on orderly and good House.  He has facilitated us previously by bringing in Ministers on umpteen occasions to address this issue, but the EPA continues to dodge and duck and fail to answer the question.  It has failed to do its job and protect the public interest.</p></speech>

Barrett in welcoming Mr. George Hamilton.  He and I were colleagues as far back as the Moscow Olympic Games and the trajectory of his career has been much higher than mine.  It could not have happened to a nicer person.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I will continue the theme initiated by my colleague, the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, Senator Darragh O'Brien, in the context of Garda pay.  It is somewhat extraordinary that, on one hand, the Labour Party speaks about inequality and unfairness in society and states that it is part of its philosophy to address it while , on the other hand, in the past week alone it has been statistically proven that young graduates are leaving this country in droves.  These include young people involved in nursing and teaching who do not receive or enjoy proper pay or conditions.  Garda&iacute; putting themselves in the line of fire are being treated abysmally in terms of pay and conditions.  It is rather interesting to hear the spin being put on the fact that recruitment has restarted because the reality in this regard shows a net reduction in numbers as a result of retirements, career breaks, etc.  The Garda force is currently over 200 short of 12,000, which is way below the figure that we in Fianna F&aacute;il have proposed if we are returned to Government.  We favour a restoration of the force's strength to 14,000.  Such a move is necessary and anybody living in rural Ireland in particular will know that more garda&iacute; are required on the ground.</p><p>There is a very well-educated cohort in society that wants to stay, work and live in Ireland.  These people have graduated as nurses and were told there was a nursing shortage but the Government has failed abysmally to attract back nurses under a scheme proposed last year.  One figure indicates that fewer than 50 people have taken it up.  Why is this?  It is because they are not receiving or enjoying the proper pay and conditions commensurate with what they have learned.  Not only that, it is a competitive environment and they are being attracted elsewhere.  It is extraordinary that a couple of years ago we had teachers who could not get jobs but now we have a teacher shortage that will, according to the information publicly available, get worse.  This is despite the Government's indication that it will provide a significant number of extra places next September.  There will be no teachers around at that stage because they will be in Dubai where they can get more pay than they do here and it will be tax free.</p><p>I call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to come before the House to debate the position with regard to this group of people and what the Government, in its dying days, is planning to do in order to give some meaning to the question of how to treat people in society who have gone through the educational system, who have a reasonable expectation of having jobs in their own country but who find they cannot do so because they will not receive sufficient pay and the conditions under which they are asked to operate are totally unacceptable.  I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to call the Minister, Deputy Howlin, before the House.</p></speech>

Judge Catherine Staines questioned why the EPA took the case to the District Court on learning that she did not have the power to suspend the operations of the plant.  The EPA must answer questions on wider issues to answer in this regard.  There are plants that can operate efficiently, effectively and within the rules.  I am not suggesting that this is happening but if certain plants are taking shortcuts, perhaps for economic benefit, and,  consequently, are a danger to the environment - not just an apparent danger but are having a real and current effect - as a result, then the EPA must to be held to account and get its act together.</p></speech>

Obviously, it will be shorter than in previous times.</p><p>I am impressed by some figures that have been given to me for visa length and tourist numbers.  I grew up in the tourist business and believe we have not done enough to encourage tourism.  Ireland is losing potentially hundreds of thousands of tourists compared to other countries.  Schengen countries such as France attract many more tourists, for instance from China, as it is much easier for tourists to visit such countries.  In Ireland holiday visas are only granted for short stays and never exceed 90 days.  If we were to increase visa length, we would cut down on red tape and paperwork and encourage more people to visit.  It would make sense to increase the length of visas, perhaps not to ten years as happens in the United States but to a period that would result in a decrease in red tape and an increase in tourist numbers.  We also need to think about reducing the overall paperwork involved.  A lot could be done on that basis.</p><p>The other issue being talked about today and which is on everyone's mind is flooding.  We should look at a clean-up of rivers which contain masses of rubbish.  It would have a massive benefit for the environment and also help tourism.  There is potential for schoolchildren and volunteers to become involved.  I will quote from an article in a British paper on a massive ongoing project in the United Kingdom which is experiencing great success:  </p><blockquote>There were shopping trolleys galore, of course, including 24 in a Sheffield lock alone; countless bikes and hundreds of tyres. Thousands of plastic bags, umpteen gas bottles, several car batteries and other debris were among the other objects removed from rivers, canals, locks and bridges during clear up operations across England and Wales by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust.</blockquote> <p>The article in <i>The Guardian</i>is entitled, From a hand grenade to a Mercedes.  It actually found a hand grenade dating from the Second World War in the clean-up of rivers and it still had the pin in it.  We should not just ask the Government to do this, we should also encourage it to see what we could do in local areas to have rivers tidied up to help in the battle against floods.</p></speech>

It is welcome that a number of Ministers, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, yesterday met members of the insurance industry to see what could be done about insuring people who found themselves distressed as a result of flooding.</p> <p>I raise an issue about a recent HEA report which is of enormous concern, given that we are now heading into CAO applications time.

There have been a number of questions asked about why this is happening.  One is why do students make ill-informed choices.  It is very late in the day to call for a debate, but if it was possible, it would be beneficial to have a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue.  There are enormous costs to society, which have been identified in terms of the need for computer science, maths, construction and engineering graduates, but I am more concerned about the cost to individual students and their families.  A number of students cited such reasons for not progressing as poor health, cost and the lack of accommodation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aideen Hayden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very sad to see students who find themselves, after just one year of an educational experience, effectively removed from the opportunity of pursuing a third level education.  There needs to be a national consultation on why this is happening in which second level students and students in universities through the Union of Students in Ireland will be engaged.  It is not enough for the HEA to simply produce a report; a lot more needs to be done.  The debate and discussion needs to be extended to really discover what can be done to prevent this dropout rate which is very high by international standards.</p></speech>

Will the Leader arrange a debate on the HSE's programme for progressing disability services for children and young people?  If not on that specific topic, perhaps the debate might be on the more broader themes of primary care facilities and disability services in general.  Members are aware that &euro;4 million for an additional 80 posts was provided under that programme in 2014 and that an allocation of &euro;6 million was announced in 2015 for 120 new staff appointments.  The rationale was to achieve a targeted reduction of waiting lists, but the reality is that this did not happen.  In figures released to me in debates on Commencement matter in this House and through direct interaction with the HSE we find that waiting list numbers for appointments for children's physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy are phenomenally high.  We need to make sure disability services are cognisant of demographic changes and that the funding provided has been increased to cope with additional demand.</p> <p>I will highlight some waiting lists figures in County Cavan.  There are 102 children who have been waiting for six months or more for physiotherapy; 177 children have been waiting for six months or more for occupational therapy, while 25 children have been waiting for six months or more for speech and language therapy.  With regard to speech and language therapy waiting lists, national figures at the end of September 2015 showed that 12,587 were waiting for assessment, while 8,437 were awaiting treatment across all services.  The issue is not confined to one region; it arises right across the State.  I know that the Minister of State has addressed Commencement matters in this House, particularly issues affecting my county of Cavan, but it is important, in the context of the upcoming general election, from which none of us can hide, that this issue be at the front and centre and that children have access to assessments and services when needed.  The children on waiting lists are in their formative years and there is no point in being given an appointment two or three years down the line if the services are needed now.</p></speech>

We have phenomenal GPs the length and breadth of the country.  The GPs who operate in rural areas of County Clare have the absolute respect, loyalty and support of the people living in those areas.  This was evident, in particular, in the past few weeks at public meetings called to discuss rural practices and the problem of attracting young doctors into rural practices.  Young doctors have no confidence that they could make a living in rural practices.  Owing to other commitments I was not in a position to attend either of the two public meetings held, but I received a full report on them.  It is quite shocking to think GPs have to hold public meetings to gain basic benefits.  At the last meeting held one week ago GPs requested that action be taken immediately and that commitments be made and honoured within two weeks.  I do not see these commitments being made, honoured or followed up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Leader organise a debate on rural GPs in which the Minister for Health can update us not just on restoring what has been taken from GPs, which should never have been taken because of the vital role they play in society, but on his and the HSE's plans to support and develop rural GP practices?  Health is the most important thing to all citizens but those living in rural Ireland, particularly rural Clare, worry more about this because of the decline in many services.  I want to see all the requests the GPs have made honoured and to hear the long-term plan for them.  This House is the ideal place to have that discussion.</p></speech>

It is a bit ridiculous.  The Senators should get real.</p> <p>Hunger strike has been a weapon of last resort in Ireland as far back as bards and poets who used it during the time of the Brehon laws and it has been used by political prisoners from Thomas Ashe to Bobby Sands.  Even Mahatma Gandhi took the example of the Irish hunger strikers.  A Palestinian journalist, Muhammad al-Qeq, is being held without trial in an Israeli jail and has been on hunger strike for 50 days.  He has been moved to hospital and is near death.  Will the Leader please express our sincere concern for this prisoner and make representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to convey that to the Israeli Government?  It is not a situation that any of us should be comfortable with.  </p> <p>I note the Cathaoirleach welcomed George Hamilton to the Visitors Gallery.  Senator Whelan spoke about a nation holding its breath and the people of Portlaoise holding theirs on the issue of pollution.  Another of George&rsquo;s famous phrases was &ldquo;danger here&rdquo;.  We have been looking for answers from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is one of the biggest bloody oxymorons in the lexicon of Government agencies because it does not protect the environment, high up or low down.  The director general of the EPA has said that she does not see her role as being one of a watch dog or of prosecuting polluters.  We in this Chamber have called time and again for immunity to prosecution to be removed from the EPA.  If the EPA is doing its job correctly, there is no need for it to be protected by immunity to prosecution.  What is it afraid of?  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Ann Phelan, told us here that they would report to us on the immunity but they have not bothered to do so.  They keep buying time and fobbing us off.</p> <p>I am sick of being fobbed off.  I second Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government come to the House today to answer questions about the EPA.  Too many people are suffering ill health because the EPA is not enforcing the proper regulations on known polluters, as identified by the European Union.</p></speech>

It is interesting that it is Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Independent Members who are coming together on this side of the House to find out how we can boil town-wide tankers of used oil in Portlaoise, whose smell has a huge effect on health, without getting an answer from the EPA.</p> <p>I am quoting the national broadcaster but the most interesting aspect of the documentary was that the EPA made the weakest defence I have ever come across, trying to tell us what it was, why it was like that and whether it was good, bad or indifferent.

I would like the Minister to tell us - the Leader might facilitate us in this regard - where exactly this report is, what it states and why we have had such weakness from the Environmental Protection Agency at a time when we are all talking about climate change, the effect of atmosphere on water and the need for cleanliness in our atmosphere for health regarding the explanations from companies like this one previously fined for such pollution.

On this day, 13 January 1800, Daniel O'Connell made the first of many speeches opposing Ireland's union with Britain.  It was his first ever speech and it was made in Dublin at a protest meeting against the union.  As Members will be well aware, the introduction of that Act was the exact opposite of the aims of the United Irishmen and the purpose of the 1798 rebellion which, it is important to remind ourselves, was supported by Protestant, Catholic and dissenter, and it might be useful to draw on a short excerpt of a speech by Daniel O'Connell, which expresses his sentiments in this regard.  He stated: "Let every man who feels with me proclaim, that if the alternative were offered him of Union, or the re-enactment of the Penal Code in all its pristine horrors, that he would prefer without hesitation the latter, as the lesser and more sufferable evil."  O'Connell went on to proclaim that he would rather confide in the justice of his brethren, the Protestants of Ireland who liberated him, than lay his country at the feet of foreigners.</p> <p>In this centenary year of the Easter Rising, it is appropriate that we rededicate ourselves to complete the final chapter in ending British involvement in Ireland or, more precisely, in the Six Counties, as De Valera famously put it at his meeting with Chamberlain in London in April 1938.  A debate in this House on achieving that objective would be a fitting tribute to the sentiments of Daniel O'Connell, the memory of the patriots of 1916 and the subsequent patriots in our War of Independence.  I hope the Leader can find time to accommodate that request before the election is called.</p></speech>

A recent documentary on RTE 1 did the country some service.  It was by Dr. Eva Orsmond who has a reputation as a hard-liner on this issue and came to be known through "Operation Transformation" some years ago.  Most people who watched the documentary would have found it shocking, although it was no surprise to me.</p> <p>There was one good suggestion in the documentary.  I am often accused of being somewhat like a nanny state in my approach to this issue but it is clear that something must be done.  We cannot continue to say "No" to all the small measures that might help this issue.  Parents need a hand when it comes to the issue of their children's health.  They cannot be totally in control of what their children eat.  Everyone tells me that the problem comes back to the parents but we are on track to be the fattest country in Europe in a relatively short period of time.  I have stated in this House 100 times that one in four children is overweight or obese.  Children are having their teeth removed at a very young age.  Imagine them going through life without their primary teeth, which they are losing before the age of ten.  It is a frightening issue.  I am blue in the face talking about it.  I feel as if I am bashing my head against a brick wall.</p> <p>We have not done enough about this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government, of which my party is a member, has not done enough about this.

We cannot continue leaving it up to parents because clearly nothing is being done in the short or longer term by them.  Education is very important.

As a rotund gentleman, some might argue that I would not have a lot to say about obesity but I paid and am paying the price for obesity.  I have type 2 diabetes and am grossly overweight, although I am trying to do something about that.  The No Fry Zone movement is calling for chip shops not to be located within 500 m of schools.  There are schools in this country from which children are popping out every day of the week to buy bags of chips and bottles of cola.  This is worthy of a discussion in this House and I support Senator Noone's call in that regard.

The one area where we have let the education system down, for which we are now paying the price, is that of guidance counselling in schools.  We must have a debate in this House with the Minister for Education on the issue of guidance and drop out rates at third level.  I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate although I know that time is a bit tight.  I note that Deputy Rabbitte has suggested that the general election will be held on 26 February, so time is getting very tight.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Quinn's points about ways in which tourism numbers could be increased.  We are all delighted that in 2015 Ireland had its best year ever in terms of tourism and we are on target for growth of 6% in 2016.  We had 7.9 million visitors here in 2015 and they spent more than &euro;4 billion, a huge sum.</p> <p>However, there is a danger looming on the horizon, namely, price gouging to which the chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently referred.  He said that Dublin prices present a danger and that the creeping upwards is unacceptable.  The problem is principally manifested in Dublin and those Members of this House who hail from outside the Pale have become aware of it over the past year.  This is an issue which we must watch closely.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been very successful with its promotion of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, conference business and so forth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am delighted to hear it is spending more and promoting that further.

However, if prices continue to rise unacceptably, particularly in our capital city, the current Government or the next will have to review the 9% tax rate, which would be unfortunate for tourism.</p></speech>

As Members are aware, a variety of issues face farming families throughout the country and today one of the farming organisations is lobbying in the vicinity of the House.</p> <p>There is an issue in particular in regard to anti-competitive practices and those in Border counties are particularly aware of this.  As a result of these practices, the export of cattle to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom is impeded.  Between currency exchange rates and the lower prices factories are prepared to pay here, the price for cattle north of the Border is 82 cent more per kilo than here.  We are exporting weanlings to Italy, Tunisia and other countries, but we cannot sell our animals just a couple of miles across the Border where there are buyers and there is demand and where the benefit would be a greater yield and return to farming families throughout this country.  This issue needs to be examined as it is an anti-competitive practice. </p> <p>Other issues of concern include the reduced competition in terms of processors.  With respect to all those involved in processing, it seems that the well known Slaney and Irish Country Meats plant at Camolin is set to merge with one of the larger players.  I am not sure this best serves the industry as a whole, processors themselves or farming families throughout the country.  It would be useful to consider these issues in advance of the general election.  Clearly, agricultural issues will be matters of debate for people seeking to be elected to the D&aacute;il as farmers are putting these on the agenda.  We could assist that process and assist the pursuit of a better regime for farmers, processors and consumers by debating the issue in this House.</p></speech>

In a nutshell, he lit up every room he came into and that was widely felt at his funeral yesterday in Galway.</p> <p>I support the call for a debate on the health impacts of excessive sugar consumption.  That was quite a documentary broadcast this week by RTE.  There must be legislative solutions in this regard.  As we have said for a long time, there is an urgent need for a debate on career guidance given the high number of drop-outs in third level education, particularly in first year.  However, the main reason I rise is to speak about the human misery that has befallen those affected by flooding.  Half of Ireland is under water and has been for the last month.  The bottom line is that anyone whose property was flooded last year and in 2009 has been failed by this State and the Government.  We have a great example of successful works in Moneymore, Oranmore, where we got all the agencies into a room and got the National Parks and Wildlife Service to agree that the OPW could take the lead.  Some 52 farmers worked together and these families are relieved their properties have not been flooded again this time.</p> <p>We must examine various solutions, some of which were mentioned by Senators Mullins and Quinn today.  The Woodland League has approached me with an interesting solution that has worked in Wales, in particular.  A Bangor University study, led by farmers, has shown that where uplands are planted by native trees with deep roots, they can absorb rainfall 67 times faster than grassland.  In Wales, they have experienced a 29% decrease in flooding in their lowlands with just an extra  5% planting of native trees.  That is good news and something we should seek to replicate.</p> <p>Norway has almost no flooding because it has allowed for the natural regeneration of its forests for 50 years.  We have not done that.  I am glad the Leader has said the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will attend this House next week.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, should seriously examine this recommendation.  We need to discuss planting perhaps 10% of our uplands.  At a conservative estimate, this could result in 40% less flooding.  </p> <p>Last week, Bob Geldof visited Thoor Ballylee and committed to help us raise funds to alleviate the awful flooding there.  While he is helping us, that is not a sustainable solution.  I am talking about planting our uplands with native trees because there is evidence to support it.  We should incentivise farmers through grant diversion to be flood protectors.  Would that not be a wonderful outcome since climate change is on its way and will be here to stay?</p></speech>

I also wish to commend the work undertaken on this issue for some time by Senator John Whelan concerning the Environmental Protection Agency in Portlaoise.  The arguments have been well set out here, so I urge all Members to support that amendment.</p> <p>As we are short of time, I will briefly mention two other issues.  I call for a debate on the accident and emergency department crisis.  I raised this matter directly with the Minister for Health here before the Christmas recess, including the situation in Beaumont Hospital.  However, things have deteriorated quite rapidly in the intervening period.  Last week, a wheelchair user had to sleep in a wheelchair in Beaumont Hospital for two nights because there were no trolleys or beds available.  The situation is very serious, so I ask the Leader to try to schedule a debate on that with the Minister for Health.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express concern about the health of a Palestinian journalist, Muhammad al-Qeq, who is currently on hunger strike.  He was sentenced to six months without any trial under Israel's system of administrative detention.  His health is deteriorating rapidly and there are serious concerns that he is near death.  This is an issue Ireland should raise with the Israeli authorities - not just the individual circumstances but also Israel's blatant violation of international law in its use of administrative detention to send people to prison for months or years on end.  Thousands of Palestinians have been sent to prison without charge, trial or due process.  It is a very serious issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Averil Power:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is more than one year since the House unanimously passed a motion calling on the Government to recognise the state of Palestine.

He was a highly regarded sportsman and ambassador not only for Galway but also for Ireland.</p> <p>I welcome the intervention of the Taoiseach with the insurance industry following the floods across the country.  This is a huge issue in the case of houses prone to flooding.  In the run-up to Christmas I spent many days in the Claregalway area, where a number of houses were flooded in 2009.  There is a big question, in particular, in those areas where works have taken place.  There needs to be an assurance that insurance cover will be available for homes and to families once works have taken place to deal with flooding issues.  I welcome the Leader's indication that there will be a debate on the issue in the House next week as it is serious.  We need to start dealing with it now, as well as planning for the future.</p></speech>

He is quite correct in that new trainee garda&iacute; receive a basic allowance of &euro;184 a week, plus a living allowance of &euro;77.92.  After 32 weeks training, they are attested and put on the first point of the garda salary scale, &euro;23,171, rising to a maximum of &euro;45,793 after 19 years service.  The garda pay scale does not include allowances and does not reflect the full earnings of a garda.  Newly attested garda&iacute; are assigned to front-line duties and work the garda roster, work which attracts unsocial hours payments.  Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings.  Even at the entry level of &euro;23,171 and the lower end of the unsocial hours scale, the payments will add almost &euro;5,800 to the salary of a new garda.  This was the reply given by the Minister in the other House.  I take on board what the Senator and Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned about salaries.  The Leader of the Opposition is quite welcome to table a Commencement matter on the issue.  However, these are the facts tas outlined by the Minister in the other House and I do not think the answer would be any different.</p> <p>Senator Darragh O'Brien also mentioned Fianna F&aacute;il's policy on what he called "higher earners".  Fianna F&aacute;il describes those on salaries of &euro;32,000 or more as higher earners.  In the past two budgets it voted against provisions for tax increases and benefits for those earning less than &euro;32,000.</p></speech>

It is still the No. 1 priority of the Government to reward people who are in work and get more people back in employment.<br/><br/>I note also Senator Bacik's comments on the upper age limit for entry into the Garda, which is 35 and which she suggested should be examined.

The Department is aware that, following concerns raised about the emissions from the facility in question in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 9th July 2014, the EPA was requested by the previous Minister to prepare a report on the operation of the facility in question, and that a report was subsequently published on 13th May 2015, and is available to the public on the EPA website.<br /><br />As regards the future of the EPA, it should be noted that an independent Review of the EPA was carried out by an expert Review Group and was presented to the Minister in May 2011.  The Report's general finding was that the EPA overall has provided &quot;considerable benefit for Ireland's environment and for the health and well-being of its people&quot;.  The EPA Review report, which is available from <i>www.epa.ie</i>made a total of 58 recommendations, with an implementation plan developed to address these.  A progress report on the implementation of the recommendations was published in August 2014, which shows that substantial progress has been made in terms of their implementation.  Of the 58 recommendations, 43 have been fully completed/implemented with the remaining 15 being addressed either as on-going activities or still needing to be progressed for completion.  Also, in the context of the Government's programme to reduce and rationalise statutory bodies, the EPA was further restructured as recently as 1st August 2014, when it was merged with the former Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII).<br /><br />In the circumstances, there are no plans to undertake any further restructuring of the EPA at this time, though it is the case that public bodies under the aegis of the Department are kept under regular, on-going review, and are also subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas.<br /><br />The Minister is confident that the EPA will continue to meet its mandate to safeguard and improve Ireland's environment.</blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is the reply which I received from the Department as the Order of Business progressed.

A point was raised by Senator Paul Coghlan on the Order of Business, who used the phrase, "price gouging".

Senator Quinn also spoke on flooding and the need to clean up rivers and how, in many cases, this could be done on a voluntary basis.  It is a point he certainly should raise next week when the Minister will be present.</p> <p>Senator Hayden referred to the drop-out rate of students in third level education, which is due to many reasons including costs, accommodation, etc., and called for a debate on that issue.

It is recognised by all sides that should a majority of the people of Northern Ireland vote in favour of a united Ireland, the British Parliament will agree to it.  Relationships between Ireland and Britain have progressed and long may it continue.  </p><p>Senator Catherine Noone raised the issue of obesity, a matter she has raised in the House on numerous occasions.  She has suggested we are not doing sufficient in this regard and called for the introduction of a sugar tax.  Her call was supported by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell.

Craughwell, Terry Brennan and Hildegarde Naughton spoke about the untimely death of Christy O'Connor Jnr. who was a wonderful ambassador not only for his sport but also for the whole country.

Innovation 2020 is based on a shared vision of Ireland becoming a global innovation leader, driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society.  Its launch was the culmination of a year-long process of collaboration and consultation on how Ireland should aim to achieve this vision.  We have discussed this issue in debates here in the past year or two which contributed to it.  I also acknowledge the significant contribution made to the development of Innovation 2020 by Ireland's research and scientific community and enterprise, as well as by many Departments and Government agencies.  We conducted an extensive consultation process with stakeholders from industry, academia, the public sector and civil society and I had the pleasure of hosting a consultative forum in Farmleigh in July last year.  Many of the issues raised and discussed are reflected in the final strategy.  I have met many of the people who contributed to the process and was struck by the shared sense of drive and ambition for Ireland's future. </p> <p>We have made significant progress in our national innovation system, which started from a very low base by international comparisons, over the past ten or 15 years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland has today become home to nine of the top ten global ICT companies, nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies, 17 of the top 25 global medical devices companies, and more than half of the world's leading financial services institutions.  Ireland is now in the global top 20 for the quality of our scientific research.</p><p>Our investment in research and innovation has been instrumental in strengthening indigenous enterprise, securing, diversifying and growing foreign direct investment, licensing new technologies, establishing new companies, and providing the highly educated workforce needed to grow the economy and contribute to society.  In Innovation 2020, we commit to building on this significant progress.  Key to delivering our vision is a commitment to increasing public and private investment in research.  During the period 2008 to 2013, public funding was redesigned to improve its impact and incremental improvements to the research and development tax credit were introduced to support growth in business expenditure on research and development such that more than two thirds of expenditure on research and development occurred in the business sector, with just under one third of expenditure coming from the public sector. To ensure that we are best placed to build on what we have already achieved, we present a path to obtaining an increase in public research investment and to thereby leverage greater private investment in order to bring Ireland's public and private research and development expenditure to 2.5% of GNP by 2020.</p><p>Increased investment will be targeted at increasing the number of research personnel in enterprise to 40,000; increasing annual research masters and PhD enrolments by 500 to 2,250; doubling private investment in research and development within the public research system; further developing the network of centres, building critical mass and addressing enterprise needs.  They are our research centres, and today we launched ADAPT in Trinity, introducing a successor to the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions to provide investment in new research facilities and equipment, and the maintenance and upgrading of existing ones.  A key part of the message coming out of our universities and institutes of technology is that we must invest in new infrastructure but also make sure we preserve the equipment and infrastructure we built over the past ten or 15 years and keep it running to the highest level, which involves allocating money to maintenance also.  Expanding Ireland's participation in international research organisations, including CERN, is also part of the actions.</p><p>Our enterprise base must be resilient and internationally competitive, and innovation is central to ensuring that these aims are achieved.  We are putting in place supports to encourage greater engagement in research and development in both indigenous and foreign owned enterprises and in both small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and large-scale enterprises.  Enterprises will be supported through direct supports, research and development tax credits, and the new knowledge development box.</p><p>We will also simplify and streamline supports for enterprise and make them more easily accessible.  A key part of the strategy was to make that road map clear so that people could see where they could plug into the system.  We also had our second innovation showcase in December, which was about displaying what we have on offer to the public research system, encouraging more companies to get involved, and seeing where they fit into the system.  The aim of this is to get more companies involved in the public research system in collaboration with our education institutes where we will achieve our best results.  We will achieve innovation leadership in key sectors where we can sustain a competitive edge and will continue to target investment at strategically important areas of commercial opportunity.</p><p>We are fully aware that our indigenous companies need to perform research and continually innovate to remain competitive in a global marketplace.  The fact that we have established a strong research system is one of the main reasons we continue to be able to attract important foreign direct investment to Ireland and encourage many companies, both from Ireland and abroad, to set up here.  Last year we had the highest number, with over 19,000 companies starting up here.</p><p>To achieve our vision of becoming a global innovation leader, there are a number of areas on which we plan to focus.  We want to see greater numbers of enterprises engaging in research and development, and more enterprises progressing to a point where innovation is embedded as a key part of their business model.  We intend to continue to concentrate the majority of our competitive public research funding on the sectors where we believe Ireland can achieve the greatest return on our investment.  The world is constantly changing, and we must continually re-evaluate our priorities to ensure that our investment in research and innovation is optimal.  In implementing this strategy we will seek to identify areas of strategic commercial opportunity to ensure that Ireland can respond to and gain competitive advantage in new areas.</p><p>Innovation is completely dependent on knowledgeable and skilled people, and we have significant competitive advantage in our people.  With one of the youngest populations in Europe and one of the most highly educated in the world, Ireland has a resource that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere.  We will continue to develop our talent base with exceptional educational programmes and facilities, complemented by and integrated with world-class research programmes.  As Minister with responsibility for skills, developing the talent of our population is of particular interest to me, and is an underlying aim of Innovation 2020.  When we talk to people in companies who choose to grow or locate here from another country they tell us it is about talent, and there is a talent war taking place.  They are coming to Ireland because they know we have the skills they need, but we cannot take that for granted.  We have to build on it and make sure we have the talent for the future to ensure those companies will be able to grow and expand. Talent is critical to the successful realisation of our national vision and giving Ireland the capacity to exploit opportunities, both established and emerging.  Our success in delivering on our vision will depend on our people undertaking the research, working in and creating successful enterprises, and contributing to the society in which we live.  Ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of trained people to deliver our strategy will be key.  We plan, therefore, to increase the number of research personnel in enterprise to over 40,000 and to increase the number of research masters and PhD enrolments to 2,250 by 2020.</p><p>We will support the full continuum of talent development from primary level through to postdoctoral research.  We are also committed in this strategy to supporting the full continuum of research from basic to applied, including frontier research as well as research aligned to current priorities.  Frontier research ensures diversity and provides resilience and responsiveness so that as new challenges and opportunities emerge, we will be positioned to respond quickly to the changed circumstances.  We will support qualified researchers to undertake project-based frontier research across all disciplines on the basis of excellence and the Irish Research Council will have a key role in supporting that.  It is also a major factor in making sure we have the talent we need.  We have to fund across disciplines to make sure we get the talent that both industry and our public research system need to be able to grow and expand.</p><p>Continued support for a well-equipped research environment is an investment in the tools that will keep us at the cutting edge of research and innovation.  We will further develop our research infrastructure to ensure that we are providing the platform for excellent research activity.  Yesterday, we made another announcement of &euro;28 million to over 21 different projects through Science Foundation Ireland.  That is investing in the infrastructure that is needed if we are to continue with the excellence of our research.</p><p>The full range of research activity includes research for both economic and societal benefit, and research in either of these often benefits both.  Research in the public sector is crucial for underpinning a strong, developed economy and developing a progressive, sustainable society delivering modern public services efficiently to meet growing needs and expectations.  We will adopt a challenge-centric approach by bringing partners across academia, business, public service and civil society together to collaborate and focus on research that has the potential to address national and global challenges.  It also gives us the opportunity to engage the wider public in setting those challenges by asking them what they believe are those challenges.  Much of our work in terms of this agenda is advocacy and encouraging people of all ages to get involved in the science agenda and take up the STEM subjects.  Asking them to identify the challenges for society is a way of engaging them in the process.</p><p>The importance of collaboration in research cannot be underestimated, and a key part of this strategy is collaboration, both nationally and internationally.  Collaboration across disciplines can provide new insights and lead to the development of novel products and services with commercial potential.  Ireland has an advantage in pursuing this type of interdisciplinary research.  The relatively small size and highly interconnected nature of the Irish public research system greatly facilitates collaboration and co-operation.  Over the course of implementing the strategy, we will further promote interdisciplinary research.</p><p>We will also further incentivise collaboration between institutions and centres to create the critical mass necessary for world-leading research and ensure optimum use of research facilities.  At the launch of the ADAPT research centre in Trinity today, I complimented the educational institutions for working together through those research centres because as is the case with those of us in politics, we work together but we are also in competition.  Our research institutions are also in competition but when it is important they also work together.  Through our research centres the best brains in our universities and institutes of technology can work together, which is key, and unique to this country.  It is not seen in many other countries.  We are the envy of the world in the way our system encourages people to work together on projects.  We want to encourage more of that.</p><p>Collaboration between the enterprise sector and the public research system is also essential if the full value of investment in the public research system is to be realised.  Our enterprise development agencies and Knowledge Transfer Ireland will focus on increasing the breadth and depth of collaboration between industry and academia for mutual benefit.  A key part of our work in recent years was to make it possible for companies to get involved, and we are trying to maximise the resources.  Already, taxpayers are funding over &euro;700 million in terms of the research agenda, and we are looking to increase that greatly in the years ahead but to get the best value for our money it must be matched with money from the private sector.  We are achieving results because of that combination of both private and public money, and taxpayers deserve no less.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They deserve to see their money being used to its maximum potential.</p><p>As well as encouraging research at a national level, both in the public and private sectors, it is crucial for Ireland to participate in international collaborative research.  The benefits of international and EU collaboration in research and innovation accrue not only to our researchers but also to our enterprise base and public policymakers.  These include access to shared infrastructure and facilities and collaboration in addressing global societal challenges.  By collaborating with international partners, we aim to secure &euro;1.25 billion from the current framework programme for research and innovation - Horizon 2020.  We had the opportunity to debate that here a number of months ago.  There is a good deal of interest in Horizon 2020 and Ireland's success in that respect.  We are ahead of our targets for the past two years, which is good.  If we are to reach the high target of securing of &euro;1.25 billion, we need more companies, including in small and medium enterprises and multinationals, to get involved in making applications for, and bidding to win, funding from Horizon 2020.  We have exceeded our first year target and up to May last year we had secured almost &euro;180 million in funding from Horizon 2020.  We are committed to leveraging international and EU engagement to Ireland's advantage, including through our membership of international research organisations and boosting our returns from EU programmes.  We will continue our membership of existing international research organisations and build on that by opening negotiations on membership of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN, and the European Southern Observatory in order to obtain the best deal for Ireland.</p><p>Key to supporting an innovative enterprise sector is an effective regulatory framework for protecting intellectual property.  We will encourage a competitive business environment, promote the commercialisation of products from publicly funded research and help ensure competitive advantage by assisting enterprises to use intellectual property to increase their levels of innovation.  Considerable intellectual property has been built up in our educational institutes over the years and it is now time to put that  to use for this country and turn it into products and services that will benefit society and also create jobs.  We will try to do much more of that through this strategy over the next three or four years.  We will seek to maximise the transfer of knowledge between research performing organisations and enterprise to promote greater application of research results.  This will result in more licensing of technologies, the creation of more spin-out companies and, ultimately, jobs.</p><p>Research contributes to the success of the enterprise sector but it also adds to societal well-being in other areas such as education, health, housing, environment, mobility, connectivity, culture, and policy formulation.  Innovations in these areas contribute greatly to improving the quality of life and they can, in turn, create opportunities for enterprise, as products and services developed to solve a problem in Ireland can be commercialised and implemented elsewhere.  Many of our companies are building their success off the back of that.  We want to encourage more of that, to make it easier for those companies and to facilitate that as best we can. </p><p>We will realise the full potential of public service innovation to provide better and more efficient public services.  Innovation is key to driving continuous improvement in the way public services are delivered and is crucial in improving the efficiency and quality of service delivery, while reducing the costs involved in providing those services.</p><p>Science and innovation have the capacity to improve our quality of life and to deliver a better society for all but we can only deliver on the vision set out in this strategy if we work collectively and in concert with others.  The strategy was put together by and will be implemented and driven through collaboration.  It is of key importance that we get that message out.  I thank Senators for affording me the opportunity to outline the strategy and to have a discussion with them on it.  I am aware there is great interest among them in the research and science agenda. </p><p>The process of developing this strategy during the past year was a journey for many people involved in it who might not always have been familiar with what is involved in the research agenda by our top researchers in this country.  Many Departments now realise the importance of funding for this area and also the importance of carrying out their own research to be able to deliver public services in a better and more efficient way, again making better use of taxpayers' money.  I believe we have the commitment necessary from all the stakeholders across the system to do this and to achieve this.  It is an ambitious strategy.  Effectively, it will provide for doubling the spend, between taxpayers and private industry, in this sector over the next four or five years but we have to do that.  The Taoiseach is very much behind this.  He launched the strategy and he believes in it.  He has met many of the Departments and stressed the importance of prioritising this sector when it comes to budget time.  He understands the importance of this sector, as do many Ministers and Members across all parties.  This is continuing the journey we started in the past ten to 15 years and we will continue to build on it.  We need to be ambitious to aim high.  If we are to compete with Denmark, Sweden and Finland, we have to spend this kind of money.  We have to fund this kind of research and development to drive innovation.  If we consider what is happening in Israel, we can see that this is the level we must target.  We have a five-year plan and we will need further plans thereafter.  I thank Members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#KK00200"><p>That was a super presentation and I congratulate the Minister of State on it.  I am totally supportive of all that he said.  I would like to highlight the area of education for innovation.  The Minister of State said:</p><blockquote>Innovation is completely dependent on knowledge and skilled people, and we have significant competitive advantage in our people.  With one of the youngest populations in Europe and one of the most highly educated in the world, Ireland has a resource that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere.  </blockquote> <p>I had the honour of being the rapporteur for the Oireachtas joint committee on its report on important key issues for female entrepreneurs and women in the technology industry.  We made 12 recommendations and there was cross-party support for all of them.  I will outline an important element, namely, the skills required to innovate.  There is a national challenge in the context of increasing the number of second level students - boys and girls - who take the STEM subjects, namely, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Without a grounding in these subjects at second level, students are not able to pursue the related courses at third level.  They then become excluded from a range of exciting careers in multinational and growth Irish companies.  Likewise, they are unlikely to go on to spot entrepreneurial possibilities in these specialist areas and lead start-up companies to exploit such possibilities.  There have been a series of policy responses to increase interest in STEM subjects.  The awarding of extra points for higher mathematics achievement at leaving certificate by a former Minister for Education, Mary Coughlan, is one direct incentive which is proving effective.  Smart Futures is a collaborative Government-industry programme promoting STEM careers to second level students in Ireland and highlighting opportunities in careers such as pharma, medical devices, information and communication technologies and energy.</p><p>From my research as rapporteur for the Oireachtas joint committee report, I note there is a particularly acute challenge of encouraging girls to study the STEM subjects.  The committee had access to research findings which provide valuable insights on the attitude of women to STEM subjects and related careers.  The submission by a transition year student, Ms Anna Porter, contained original research among 216 women who had made a career in STEM-related subjects.  A genuine interest or passion for STEM subjects and a subsequent career in this area emerged as the main motivation for the majority of respondents.  Parents and teachers were the predominant influencers on choosing these subjects and careers.  Peer pressure was cited as another important influence.  The key recommendation by this young person was that STEM subjects need to be presented in as interesting a way as possible at school level.  To counteract gender stereotyping, these subjects need to be taught in a way that will appeal to students in general and will, in particular, stimulate girls' interest, passion and curiosity.  I spoke with a women in enterprise group comprising some 45 females last night and I made the point that one will not thrive unless one has a passion for the subject area in which one is working.  We need more women to participate in the STEM subjects and in the information technology sector.  Sadly, only 25,000 women out of a total of 125,000 are employed in it.</p><p>The Accenture company, as part of the Women Invent Tomorrow programme with the Silicon Republic company, has carried out extensive research on the barriers facing parents, young girls and teachers when it comes to making choices about STEM-related subjects at school and which, in turn, will facilitate or not their choice of subsequent career.  The original survey covered 1,000 persons - young women aged 18 to 23 years, secondary school teachers and parents with daughters in post-primary education.  The key barriers identified include negative stereotypes persist that STEM subjects are more suitable for boys and that the subjects are overly difficult.  From my research and the evidence I have gathered over my lifetime, I have found that if one has good teachers, one will learn anything.  I am referring to teachers who are fully competent to teach the STEM subjects but I am not sure that is the case everywhere.  Parents lack information on STEM career options, yet they are the main influencers when it comes to advising their daughters on how to define educational and career paths.  A disconnect exists between industry&rsquo;s skill needs and students subject choices for leaving certificate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M. White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2011"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2011&amp;amp;pid=MaryMWhite&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would put full responsibility on parents who should encourage their daughters to take STEM subjects, including maths and engineering.  I believe it is down to them, but they do not understand; they think it is just being at a computer every day.  It is exciting and if one talks properly, women can find and follow their North Star if they have the education and backup they need, but parents need to have vision to encourage young women to do it.<br/><br/>I refer to two recommendations made in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on key issues for female entrepreneurs in Ireland and their participation in the tech sector.  What we are talking about is all about innovation.  Recommendation 11 reads:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that a more powerful, sustained and clear campaign to inform parents, teachers and girls of the intrinsic value and career benefits of studying STEM subjects and considering related careers should be undertaken, this should be led by Government, engaging industry to a greater degree, as well as teachers and parents associations.</blockquote><p>Recommendation 12 reads:</p><blockquote>The Committee [for which I was rapporteur] recommends that the capacity and frequency of existing programmes operated with the support of Enterprise Ireland to assist women entrepreneurs (such as Female Founders and Female High Fliers Programme) become more proficient in technology should be enhanced substantially so as to give much more women the opportunity to participate in them.</blockquote><p>I commend the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, Ms Julie Sinnamon, and Ms Jean O'Sullivan for their encouragement and drive to have more women entrepreneurs.  What Enterprise Ireland has done indicates that when there are special programmes for women to become entrepreneurs with high-class products and opportunities to gain expertise, it does work.  I commend the speeches made.  They were fabulous and really interesting to listen to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1187" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#LL00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This five-year strategy has been broadly welcomed by all stakeholders involved in research, teaching and industry.  As has rightly been said, it is ambitious and without ambition progress is rarely made.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on jobs, enterprise and innovation, I warmly welcome any policy that seeks to advance Ireland as an innovation hub.  If this strategy is handled in the same way as the Action Plan for Jobs, I have no doubt it will bear fruit and that we will see its success across the country.</p> <p>As Science Foundation Ireland has indicated, this innovation plan is a key element of the Government's overall jobs strategy, aimed at building a new economy based on exports and enterprise and delivering full employment on a sustainable basis.  The strategy is aimed at building on the significant successes delivered by the Government's science strategy in the past decade, which has seen Ireland dramatically improve its performance globally in this area.  The next phase of the strategy is aimed at building on existing infrastructure and achieving ambitious private-public collaborations.</p> <p>A key ambition of the strategy is to increase total investment in research and development in Ireland, led by the private sector, to 2.5% of GNP.  On current official projections, this means that more than &euro;5 billion will be invested per year in research and development by the private and public sectors by 2020.  This will represent almost a doubling of current levels of investment.</p> <p>Among the other ambitious targets the Minister of State mentioned are: the number of research personnel in enterprise to increase by 60% to 40,000; research masters and PhD enrolments will be increased by 30% to 2,250; private investment in research and development performed in the public research system will be doubled; there will be a 40% increase in the share of PhD researchers transferring from SFI research teams to industry; Ireland's participation in international research organisations will be expanded; the network of centres will be further developed, building critical mass and addressing enterprise needs; a successor to the programme for research in third level institutions will be rolled out to include investment in the creation of new facilities, the maintenance and upgrading of existing facilities and equipment and ensure their full utilisation; and funding of &euro;1.25 billion under the EU framework programme Horizon 2020 will be drawn down.  These are just a few of the overall ambitious targets set and are most welcome.</p> <p>I have a few queries about the strategy that I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention.  Perhaps he might keep them in mind as the strategy is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The first issue is Irish patent activity.  According to the State's own figures, there was a rise in patenting activity until 2006, after which it hit a plateau.  Our patenting rate seems to be lower than in those countries with which we find ourselves in competition.  Perhaps the Minister of State might investigate ways by which our levels of patenting could be increased.  The strategy is a little silent on the issue which could be constructively pursued.</p> <p>This is more of a general comment rather than any criticism.  Our ranking as an innovation hub largely depends on foreign multinationals rather than indigenous companies.  As an example, on the 2014 EU industrial research and development investment scoreboard ranking of the top 1,000 EU companies, the Irish list shows that Seagate was ranked 59 and spent &euro;889 million, while Accenture spent &euro;518.5 million.  Of the big indigenous Irish groups, the Kerry Group was ranked 154 with a spend of &euro;158.2 million, while Glanbia was ranked 590 with a small spend of &euro;17.7 million.  There is a significant gap between the spend by foreign multinationals and that of domestic groups.  While Ireland is viewed very positively by foreign multinationals, which is good, I would like to see greater emphasis on increasing the prominence of indigenous groups as we roll out the strategy.</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State and his departmental officials for their excellent work on job creation since the Government came to power.  We are really seeing the benefits of it now and it is important that that work should continue.  The strategy is an essential part of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#LL00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  We had the experience of working together when he was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I thank the Leader for finding time for this debate.</p> <p>In discussing Innovation 2020 I welcome the Government's investment in this area.  It is vital we make that investment to ensure we remain competitive.  I cannot fail to mention that while the Government calls for businesses and individuals to innovate, when people speak about certain types of innovation and science, it backs away.  Some of the controversial issues include nuclear power, genetically modified organisms and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.  These may be at the cutting edge of innovation and may cut emissions or create jobs, but they are just too politically controversial and we do not seem to go there.</p> <p>As Senator Hildegarde Naughton said, it is clear that we are not doing very well when it comes to patenting products.  I hope the report can spur on some activity in this area.  The programme calls for a strengthening of intellectual property awareness and I am interested in the form that could take.  Given that the issue of patents is quite complicated, I wonder if local enterprise offices have the capacity to advise people.  Does the Minister of State have any concrete measure in mind to help SMEs in this area?</p> <p>We should make it easier to set up businesses in order to support entrepreneurship.  One simple way to support and foster more entrepreneurship is to make it easier to set up a business.  I have raised this issue so many times that people will think I have a particular hang up about it and I do.  It is far too lengthy a process and costly to set up a new business in this country.  For example, to start a business in Ireland takes four procedures and six days and costs &euro;130.  However, in New Zealand which ranks as the best in the world in starting a business it takes just one procedure and half a day and costs less than &euro;100.  That is very quick and it is a totally online procedure.  We should follow New Zealand's example and allow for the procedure to start a business to be undertaken completely online, which involves a very low cost and takes a very short time.  Making it quick and simple may help to nudge people towards starting their own business.  The Government should aim at having one online procedure lasting a maximum of a couple of hours and costing a maximum of, let us say, &euro;50 to set up a business in Ireland.  If we could do this, we would be getting somewhere.</p> <p>I refer to the lack of access to credit for SMEs.  The programme makes no mention of crowdfunding.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am a great believer in crowdfunding, which is developing quickly, but is not mentioned in this report.  The report mentions the need to ensure the availability of a comprehensive and competitive range of financial services to meet the needs of innovative enterprises.  However, it totally fails to mention crowdfunding, which is a system that is growing hourly and is perhaps the most innovative way for a business to gain access to credit.  Can the Minister of State give any reason for the omission of crowdfunding from the report?</p><p>I would like to see it made easier for SMEs to access research and development credit.  The report states there should be more enterprises engaged in research and development investment, including enterprises in the locally traded sectors, to drive productivity performance.  However, how are we to get these enterprises, particularly SMEs, to invest in research and development?</p><p>I would like to address two other areas but I am aware it will not be possible to cover them fully because of time constraints.  The report states agrifood research is to be informed by consumer insights and to improve translation of research input into commercial products on the market.  I hope these consumer insights do not only include national insights.  I believe we have a hang-up in that regard and that we should be looking at international insights.  For example, Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy co-operative is developing dairy products specifically to cater for the tastes of the Chinese consumer.  I believe the fragmentation of our dairy industry is hindering us.  We also have a lot more to do in terms of food innovation.  It should not just be about selling Irish food products abroad.  We are doing a very good job in that area but not enough.  For instance, we should be developing country specific products and tailoring to them to the specific market.  Of course, this would mean selling a slightly different taste in cheddar to the Chinese market, taking on board its taste.  It is extremely important to listen to the consumer in the different markets.  We can do something in this area.</p><p>I was interested to read in the report the request for Departments to use research to inform evidence-based policy and regulation.  This is important.  Perhaps staff in some Departments do not have the capacity to undertake research on policy, such as taxation which has an impact on taxpayers, but one of my main concerns relates to when the Government increases things such as the minimum wage by a nice round figure rather than basing the increase on more detailed economic research.  The "latter curve" is a well known economic principle.  It shows that sometimes when a government puts too much tax on a product, the tax revenue goes off a cliff.  We have seen plenty of examples of that.  Governments sometimes assume that if they increases the tax on something, they will automatically get extra money.  However, increasing a tax often produces the opposite result and sometimes a reduction in tax produces a greater return.  This message must be sold to the Department of Finance as I do not believe that principle is fully understood.</p><p>It was good to have this debate and to hear what the Minister of State had to say, despite the restrictions on time.  I believe his heart is in the right place and while he may get a bigger job in the next Government, I hope he will continue with the same enthusiasm he has shown in the past.  I believe that with that enthusiasm, he will be able to make the necessary changes.</p></speech>

I wish to echo Senator Quinn's words about the Minister of State's enthusiasm for and commitment to this, which is greatly appreciated.  I also wish to acknowledge that Innovation 2020, Ireland's new strategy for research and development in science and technology, represents an enormous achievement, a coming together and culmination of a great deal of consultation.  The Minister of State noted the significant progress we have made in innovation, for example, the fact we host nine out of the top ten global ICT companies, nine out of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies and 17 out of the top 25 global medical devices companies.  These are significant achievements for a country which started from a low base in terms of investment in research and third level education.</p> <p>I want to address a number of points relevant to the development of innovation and research, in particular at third level.  However, as we consider the results of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in the RDS, I would like to acknowledge the importance of first and second levels in the context of innovation and research in this area, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the STEM subjects.  As a parent of children in primary school, I have a particular interest in this.  It seems to me we are not doing enough at primary level to foster the right sort of enthusiasm among primary school children.  Others have mentioned it already but it is vital enthusiasm is fostered in children at primary level.  For example, in the history area, there is huge innovation going on around the 2016 centenary celebrations and we see innovative and imaginative projects that are capturing children's imagination.  However, we do not see the same sort of innovation in regard to the development of science education at primary level.  The position is better at secondary level and the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition plays a significant part in that.  However, we need to do more at primary level.</p> <p>I mention this in light of the reports of the high dropout rates in STEM subjects at third level highlighted by the HEA this week.  Some of the figures have been contested but we undoubtedly need to ensure higher retention rates in STEM subjects.  This has been a long-standing concern in the IT and university sectors.  On the issue of the STEM subjects at third level, Senator White has spoken about the need for greater recognition for gender balance in this area.  It is a concern that we continue to see a disproportionately lower number of girls entering engineering, computer science and maths based courses.  I commend the women in science and engineering research, WISER, initiative or project in Trinity College, which has done significant work in trying to foster more enthusiasm and a higher take-up rate among girls in these subjects.  Part of this involves generating knowledge about female role models in science research.</p> <p>While we are focusing on science and STEM research, as a humanities researcher I would like to make a pitch to ensure we do not overly focus on the STEM subjects at the expense of humanities research.  Ireland has a great deal of strength in this area also.  The Minister has spoken about Horizon 2020 and EU funding but we must also ensure that our researchers are facilitated and supported in applying for EU funding in the humanities and social sciences as well as in the STEM area on which we are focusing much of our resources.</p> <p>To reflect a view held among third level, in particular among university researchers, we need to ensure there is a balance between research which is linked to industry or applied research and research which is more in the line of frontier research or "blue sky thinking" ideas based research.  We must recognise that a great deal of time is often needed to develop ideas from their very abstract stage to the applied stage.  William Campbell, whom we claim as our new Irish Nobel prize winner in science, made this point very eloquently.  We need to ensure we have that balance.</p> <p>I welcome the target to grow our total research and development budget to 2.5% of GNP by 2020.  However, I would plead on behalf of the university system, which has been underfunded in this regard.  There has been a significant cut in budgets over the past decade despite an increase in student numbers and this has contributed to a fall in rankings which has a knock-on effect in terms of attracting not only students, but researchers and academics.  I welcome the focus on the need to increase the number of research personnel to 40,000 in enterprise and to increase the number of enrolments in MA and PhD programmes to 2,250 by 2020.  This is welcome but we need to ensure adequate supports are put in place at third level to provide for the increased focus on PhD research.</p> <p>I welcome the successor to the PRTLI and the renewed investment generally in research infrastructure.  I also welcome the challenge-centric approach, provided it does not impact negatively on the research opportunities for principal investigators or individual researchers which currently may be too small a percentage of the overall funding portfolio. </p> <p>I am conscious that we are time-limited in this debate but I wish to welcome the launch by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills of the Pathways to Work programme, which sets out 86 actions to increase the numbers in work to 2.2 million by 2020.  This is very much linked with Innovation 2020 in terms of seeking to ensure we have increased numbers at work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This sort of target is ambitious but, as I said earlier, it is achievable given that under this Government, unemployment has dropped from more than 15% to a current rate of 8.8%.

I thank the Minister of State for coming in to debate this excellent subject, which focuses on the future of our country and on our youth.  Picking up on Senator White's very good speech earlier, I bring the Minister of State's attention to the New York Academy of Sciences, which has announced the global STEM alliance.  This alliance brings world-class curricula and mentoring to students of all ages, anywhere, to fulfil the unmet needs of nations needing highly skilled workers in science, technology, engineering and maths.  The initiative aims to meet a particularly critical need to feed economic development by creating a STEM-literate population and inspiring children around the world to pursue STEM interests and careers.  In April 2014, I brought this to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, who very kindly responded.  Although the Department recognised the need to provide ready access to STEM career role models and pathways, it said that at the moment, the Government had no plans to interact internationally but was incorporating STEM for students in primary and post-primary schools.  I bring this innovation to the attention of the Minister of State this evening and will e-mail him the information.</p> <p>If we were to pretend we were young and I said Senator White could join this alliance, she would be very excited.  The members of the alliance can interact and discuss science, technology and maths with counterparts in participating cities, including cities in the United States, Spain, Australia, Malaysia, the UK, Poland, Serbia, Kuwait, Qatar, China, India, Nigeria, Mali and so on, but Ireland has not joined.  Students can participate in mentoring relationships with the most brilliant early-career scientists around the world.  Each country that joins the global STEM alliance will bring its best and brightest into this elite network of mentors, providing advice, career guidance and STEM inspiration.  They can elect to take cutting-edge science courses from leading educational organisations, either online or through scholarships, and learn what a day in the life of a scientist is like for those who work for major STEM companies like ExxonMobil, Rockwell, Lockheed, Cisco, Infosys and Goldman Sachs.  They can get advice on entrepreneurship and innovation and build career resum&eacute; points and a network of global elite science peers for life.</p> <p>Through the wonderful world of the web, the social media hub that is being built among this STEM global network is something that our young people should join.  I thought I would bring that to the attention of the House this evening as a little bit of information.  If Senator White and I were a couple of years younger, we would join this alliance.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State has not seen it, he should watch it.  I know he is not Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine but he could be one of these days.  I am a sort of a wannabe nutritionist and have been since 1990.  I love nutrition and am very interested in nutritional science.  I was perplexed and in awe of this documentary which was a little bit frightening.  However, to criticise it, it did not give Irish people solutions for how to deal with the issues.</p> <p>I am involved in the food industry.  Sugar is everywhere.  It is in tomato ketchup, baked beans and soup.  I am not talking about having a cup of coffee or a piece of cake.  This debate is not about food.  All I will say is we are the third biggest users of sugar in the world.  By 2030, we are going to be the biggest in the world.  Our children are literally alcoholics, suffering from liver disease from eating sugar.</p> <p>Senator White is smiling at me because we are in the chocolate business.  I am not talking about a little bit of chocolate or a little biscuit.  I am talking about what is hidden everywhere, in breakfast cereals or things I did not know, such as apple juice and orange juice.  We are all in such a rush and everyone is stressed, so everything is hurried and, unknowingly, we are now consuming sugar.  Children are suffering from liver disease.  Tooth decay is at an all-time high because of sugar.  It is being proved that anxiety and depression are being caused by over-eating of sugar.</p> <p>Ireland is just so far ahead in agriculture, food and exports.  We are good innovators in the food sector.  We have the Kerry Group with its centre of excellence in research and development in Naas.  The Minister of State must push us hard and use the EU to innovate quickly in the free-from market in order to help public health.  It used to be fat but sugar is the latest thing.  Senator White and I will be looking at lower-sugar chocolate.</p></speech>

I complimented the Minister of State earlier on the Order of Business on being in Birr yesterday to launch the radio telescope.  The family there has been at the centre of science in Ireland for many hundreds of years.  It was a great endorsement by the Government.</p> <p>Action No. 5.10 of Innovation 2020 is to "bring forward legislative proposals to implement reforms recommended by the Copyright Review Committee aimed specifically at exploring greater use of certain copyright exceptions to promote innovation."  I have a present for the Minister of State.  We did that in the Copyright and Related Rights (Innovation) (Amendment) Bill 2015.  We got the people associated with that review to write an explanatory memorandum and a Bill and I ask that it be brought forward in the time that is remaining.  We were glad to make that contribution as we thought it was important.  The Bill is on the Order Paper.  I am sure the Leader will give the Minister of State the details.  It is offered in that positive spirit.  </p> <p>We have a problem with STEM, particularly in primary schools, as previous Senators have said.  It was a serious mistake for the two highest ranked universities in Ireland, TCD and UCD, to virtually opt out of teacher training.  My model is that the maths department in a university should be teaching maths to teachers of maths.  Separating it into separate teacher training colleges under that cluster arrangement was wrong.  The teaching of maths to teachers of maths is much more important than teaching maths to people who will become stockbrokers or accountants.</p></speech>

Mathematicians and mathematics departments in Ireland have a duty to explain their subjects to young people.  Writing articles in learned journals and so on is one thing but we need the supply of STEM people.  When we are all gone and the articles are on dusty shelves in libraries, it will be time for the next generation of maths teachers, economics teachers and so on.</p> <p>We have been neglecting undergraduates.  According to the figures given by Mr. Boland of the Higher Education Authority to the Royal Irish Academy seminar on these issues, we have reduced expenditure per student in Irish universities from &euro;11,500 down to &euro;9,000 since 2006.  There is no point in putting cliches in reports about how much Ireland cherishes higher education.  We are not doing that, nor are we dealing with the number of unqualified maths teachers at second level or the inadequacies of teaching maths at primary level.  The surveys show that most people teaching maths at primary level feel inadequate and nervous about the subject, although they are superbly confident in subjects like English and history.  We have to deal with those problems.</p> <p>Innovation 2020 also states that public sector policy making should be informed by research.  I proposed an amendment to the climate change Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D.

The Government is not doing research.  The legislation relating to alcohol was debated in this House but hardly any research was carried out in respect of what would happen if the price was changed.  The publican and the off-licence owner would be made richer but no research was done on whether what was proposed would change consumption levels or whether, if the latter occurred, there would be a cost to the Exchequer.  The same applies to the Legal Services Regulation Act.  No research was done on the cost of the conveyancing monopoly or the fact that one cannot access a barrister without a solicitor.  We need much better research on legislation coming before the House.</p><p>The quality of the education system is vital.  We need to deliver it as part of our public services.  It is stated that we intend to revolutionise innovation in the health service.  Where is the evidence for this ?  We cannot even put in place a booking system for people in accident and emergency departments.  Let us stop claiming credit for things we are not doing but let us go ahead and do them and promote that level of innovation.  There is a concern that we have chosen priority areas, that original thought and blue-sky, or frontier, thinking is not encouraged and that a person will lose out if he or she is not working in one of the chosen areas.  There is the tilting within universities in respect of research at the expense of lecturing to undergraduates, which will give rise to huge costs.  To quote the jargon, undergraduate education has to be teaching-centric.  Those who go in and take on 400 people - 600 in some cases - in a lecture hall should not be bypassed because someone wrote an article in a journal that hardly anyone reads or received a large grant for writing that article.  We have taken our eye off the ball in preparing the next generation of people in the humanities, arts and social sciences.</p><p>The excluded Departments in the research exercise referred to at the end of the Innovation 2020 document include the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht - about which the Royal Irish Academy is extremely concerned - Transport, Tourism and Sport and Social Protection.  Why can we not research new ways to tackle poverty?  I applaud what the Minister of State is doing and the commercial emphasis it involves but many Departments did not turn up when he was promoting - with an enthusiasm that has been commended - more interest in innovation and research.  There is a need for a vast amount of research on how the Department of Children and Youth Affairs should contribute to the development of children as citizens.  Extending the remit of the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation much more widely should be considered.  This strategy is going in the right direction.  The Minister of State mentioned 40,000 researchers and I commend him in that regard.</p><p>On page 39 of the strategy, reference is made to "scoring applicants who have successful industry linkages but lower numbers of publications/citations than candidates with a purely academic record".  That is a silly use of language.  We have to compete at the highest level possible, that is, with the Harvards, Yales and so on.  Making a dismissive remark about people with a purely academic record seems to me to be rather strange.  The other strange emphasis in the strategy, which, in a sense, does down Ireland, is the four countries we have chosen as our exemplars and comparators.  Denmark, Finland, and Israel are to be compared with Ireland.  Ireland has a substantially higher GDP per head than Denmark and Finland and has performed massively better in economic terms than Israel.  We have a GDP per head of &euro;51,000; Israel has a GDP per head of $36,000.  I wonder from where those strange models came.</p><p>As the banking inquiry comes to an end, there is a need for serious consideration of what was called contrarian research.  Professor Morgan Kelly compiled 40 papers on collapses and bank busts and so on but was ignored by the establishment, namely, the Government and the Central Bank.  We have to get away from that type of approach and have more original thinking.  We need more tolerance for people whose views diverge from what could be a very rigid, almost Stalinist kind of system.  Some of the people left out of scientific research do feel rather cross when their subjects are downgraded.  In particular, we have to start investing money into mathematics teacher training and undergraduates.  Expenditure on undergraduates has decreased by &euro;2,500 each, from &euro;11,500 to &euro;9,000.  We cannot say we are investing in it and that it is the finest education system in the world yet continue to deny it funds.</p><p>I know we have had an appalling problem bailing out banks and so on and that is the context.  No one did this deliberately.  However, we need to develop this for the future.  Senator Bacik mentioned Professor William C. Campbell, the Nobel Prize winner, who paid special tribute to his mentor at TCD.  If that is not going to happen any more, we will not see that many more Nobel prizes and we will not see graduates performing at the level we would wish.  The number of dropouts also has to be taken seriously.  Some courses have a dropout rate of 80%.  I commend the people who ran the courses-----</p></speech>

However, there are serious problems in this area that remain to be tackled.  Innovation 2020 is open on that.

I thank the Senators for their support for and recognition of the importance of Innovation 2020 and the science strategy.  This House certainly understands the importance of investing in research and development.  This is taxpayers' money and we have a duty to invest it properly.  We have had this discussion before about following the money and tracking it to ensure we are getting a return on it.  We are trying to do that.  We are trying to put in place the procedures and the metrics to measure the return to which I refer.</p> <p>I say it often to the various lecturers across all disciplines.  I ask them to help us track their students so that we can see where they are going.  These students are having major influence when they leave Trinity College Dublin or other universities, be it UCD or DCU.  They are heading out into industry and they have an influence across many areas in society.  Consider William C. Campbell, who won the Nobel Prize.  He is an Irish person abroad.  We want to have someone from here, funded by Ireland through the taxpayer, to do likewise.</p> <p>Part of measuring the return on taxpayers' money is to follow our people to see where they are and what they are doing.  As well as all the other methods of measuring spin-outs, companies and jobs, we need to track these people.  This will help us win more money.  Much of what we are trying to do with the science strategy involves constructing a roadmap in order to develop and make a business case for increased investment of taxpayers' money and private investment.  Advocating STEM subjects and encouraging young people to take them up, which is where Senator White started, is so important.</p> <p>I have asked the research community and all those who are doing great work about this.  I have visited all the different facilities around the country and the potential is there but what is being developed behind the scenes and is coming through in all the research centres needs to be talked about more.  We need to show off.  Researchers are probably quiet by nature.  We need them to talk more about what they are doing and to get young people interested in them in order that they might follow their stories.  It goes back again to parents and grandparents who are making decisions for students-----</p></speech>

We all need to encourage awareness, be it through the science strategy or the work with SFI and the discover science programmes.  We need to get the message out there and open their minds to it.  That is what we are trying to do here.  There is a report on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, from Professor Brian MacCraith from DCU about STEM education at primary level and second level.  There are many interesting recommendations in the report.  I hope we can progress it and get it through the system in the next couple of weeks.  We need to be going into second level schools and getting the message across.  We have to do it.</p> <p>Enterprise Ireland produced figures recently which show that the level of female participation in entrepreneurship has gone way up.  We are also trying to encourage this.  I am sorry but I have not read the report to which Senator White referred.  However, I certainly will obtain a copy of it now.  I like some of the material quoted from it.  We will try to do that because it is important that we would do it.  We have actions in this strategy to try to encourage people's participation.  I would know it myself given my experience over the past six or seven months.  There was a lot more of a gender balance at many of the awards I was at through SFI and in the different grants announced.  In some cases a lot more females were leading the charge.</p> <p>The issue concerns career development and keeping them in the system.  Certainly at an earlier stage, for various reasons which we know, females drop out and do not get back in.  We will try to fix that.  SFI are targeting it, in particular, with new supports being introduced.  Through STEM subjects in schools, we need to get them more involved in the first instance.  However, one would be surprised at the levels of participation.  I was at the BT Young Scientist and Technology exhibition last week in the RDS.  I would say there were a lot more females present than males, but we need to keep them in the system and ensure they pick those subjects at third level and continue with them thereafter in industry as well.  This is a major area for us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we have more time I will answer some of the questions, if that is allowed.  If not, I can come back to them later.  </p><p>A study on the interest in STEM was done by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, recently, Science in Ireland Barometer, and I was surprised by the result, but it was genuine.  I do not believe the results of all polls, particularly when they are about us, but this was on science and the importance of STEM.  It involved talking to people in their homes, and there is an interest among the public.  They do understand the importance of it.  The results showed clearly that the parents value STEM; they just do not realise that it is their children who should be doing it.  That is the message we are trying to get across and we must work on that.  Science Week is another opportunity to open young people's minds to the benefits of the sciences and what they are doing, be it science, technology, engineering or mathematics, and their relevance to everyday life.  We would not have an IPhone without science and research, and we need to get that message across.</p><p>Senator Hildegarde Naughton is correct about the Action Plan for Jobs process.  We now know that process works.  It brought about a whole of government approach to creating jobs.  It has gone way beyond its targets.  We are using the same approach with the science strategy.  There are more than 90 actions in this and they are assigned to different people.  We will track this implementation body to ensure those actions are carried out.  There are ambitions in this strategy but we will not achieve those unless we follow the same logic as An Action Plan for Jobs because it does work.  It has been proven to work, so that is what we are trying to do.</p><p>There is flexibility built into this plan to allow for change and new ideas as we go along.  It is a five-year plan.  Some would say we could do with a ten-year science strategy.  We could but things move so fast it would be pointless having such a plan.  That is the reason it is a five-year strategy but with flexibility to allow for change as we proceed.</p><p>The patenting activity is dealt with in the strategy, and some actions are proposed, but also along with Enterprise 2025 in terms of dealing with the low numbers of patents.  We want to encourage more and get back to the previously high levels.  There will be a referendum on patenting some time this year or next year, which will start the conversation around that issue and encourage more people to do that.</p><p>Regarding the difference in the research and development spend between indigenous and foreign-owned companies, through our research centres we are getting them involved.  Over 1,000 small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are involved in the research agenda and, likewise, we are trying to encourage more multinationals to become involved also.  There is a higher volume of SMEs involved in it, although not to the same level.  The idea behind this science strategy and the different supports is to encourage more companies to get involved in the public system and work together because everyone gains that way and gets the best value for their money.  That is in the actions in Innovation 2020.</p><p>This is about job creation; that is what we are trying to do.  The Senator mentioned this Government's success in job creation but much of that is the private sector creating jobs with Government, through our Departments and agencies, supporting and facilitating that, and getting out of the way sometimes, and putting an environment in place that encourages enterprise-driven and sustainable jobs.  That is the duty of all of us here, and I know the committee, of which Senator White is a member, does good work in trying to put forward new policies, which is something we must keep an eye on also.</p><p>Senator Quinn raised a number of issues about patents which we dealt with.  We are trying to deal with that throughout the strategy.  He spoke about access to credit and crowdfunding.  I am a big fan of crowdfunding.  We had a discussion on that in the committee when I was a member.  It is not for this science strategy to deal with the different routes to access finance.  That is for Enterprise 2025 to do.  All those strategies work together but each individual type of funding is not for a science strategy but crowdfunding is an innovative way to do it.  It is something I would encourage and of which I would be supportive.</p><p>Agrifood innovation is essential.  We talk about research-based decision making.  What we are saying in this science strategy is that we want our public agencies and Departments to carry out much more research to increase their own spend on research but to use it. </p><p>Senator Quinn mentioned fracking and other areas of energy.  Fracking is a prime example in this regard.  We have not even heard from the scientists whether Ireland is the right place to do it.  The start of any conversation should be to ask our researchers and the science community about the story for Ireland, and whether it is right or wrong, and then have a discussion thereafter on whether we want it, but we must start with the science and the evidence.  That is why we want to encourage much more of that.  If we talk to our colleagues in the science agencies in Denmark, whom Senator Barrett mentioned, we see there is more of an acceptance in some countries of science-based evidence and research evidence.  It does not always happen here but that is the duty of politicians.  When we have science-based evidence before us we should use it and make decisions based on it.  However, we must carry out the research in the first place, and that is what we are trying to do.  I hope I have not missed other issues raised by Senator Quinn.</p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien raised the issue of the documentary, which I have not seen, on the danger of hidden sugars people do not know about.  That was the point the Senator was making.  If people choose to eat chocolate they know it contains sugar, and in the right quantities that is fine.  It is the hidden sugars in every other product that they do not know about.  Senator O'Brien is right that there is a potential for Ireland in this regard.  We spoke about research bringing societal and economic benefits, and through our food production we can make inroads in that regard.  We will be benefiting society but there will be an opportunity to create jobs also because it is an issue that does not just affect Ireland.  We are one of the leading food producing innovators so that is exactly what we should be doing.</p><p>Senator O'Brien also referred ti the New York Academy of Sciences Global STEM Alliance.  I am very interested to hear about it.  It is not something that has crossed my desk but I will check it out.  I thank her for highlighting the information because that is what we are trying to do, namely, make it more interesting.  Senator White spoke about making the education system more interesting for people to take up STEM subjects.  That is exactly what is happening in junior cycle reform.  We are trying to make the education system more interesting for young people who have access to all the information in the world.  Our duty, as educators, is to make that more interesting and to help them collate that information and use it to do projects, but they are able to get the information.  Our duty is to reform our system as we go along.</p><p>On the humanities and social sciences, most people will see from the commentary around this science strategy that there is an acceptance that we will try to rebalance it to make sure there are routes to funding for all disciplines, and that all those disciplines are encouraged to recognise the importance of that.  There is no better way to do that than in the talent agenda.  If we do not fund all disciplines we will not have the people we need coming through the system to operate in the public research system and into industry also.  New initiatives have been set up to enable and encourage that.  I have met many people from the different disciplines and I believe we have got the balance right in the strategy.  It is important that we get a return on our money in terms of jobs and so on but we must make sure the balance is right.  That is why the frontier research funding mechanism is included, which the Irish Research Council will drive and publish.  That relates to the opportunity and access to funding.</p><p>Senator Barrett mentioned challenge-based funding and the opportunity for all disciplines to be part of that and to set challenges.  We will try to track the money through the system.  We are very clear that there is a balance in this strategy and that it deals with that.  In terms of blue skies or frontier research, we can call it what we like.  It is allowed for in this strategy.  What we announced yesterday in Birr, County Offaly, is proof of the pudding.  I cannot be any clearer than that.  Some years ago Professor Peter Gallagher might have said he could not get funding for that but he understood working with the system and engaging with SFI.  He won an award yesterday which will have a major impact across Europe as well.  We are trying to encourage and to prove that if a project reaches a bar of excellence, we can get funding for it.  That is the bottom line.  It is setting that bar high on excellence.  I am probably-----</p></speech>

It is because they are comparative countries.  They are investing heavily in research and development and they are driving innovation.  They are countries with which we are competing and we have to match them and be ahead of them.  They are already well on the road to being global innovation leaders.  That is where we want to position Ireland.  We use some of those countries because the population size is similar to ours, and to show where we should be heading because if we do not get there we will be left behind.</p></speech>

I did it when I was on Senator Landy's side of the House and I am happy to do it here.  It would be better to see more of it in politics.</p> <p>As of today, 55% of people have paid their Irish Water bills, that is approximately 750,000 homes.  I calculate that at 51% but I will go with the Government figures of approximately 55%.  That is &euro;146 million in revenue.  Expenditure is &euro;41 million on interest payments so far; &euro;25 million on administrative costs; &euro;550 million on water meters; &euro;45 million on operating costs; and more on bonuses that we do not quite know, amounting to approximately &euro;785 million.  Not an extra cent has been spent on water infrastructure.  More than 40% of people refuse to pay.  We are a long way off the &euro;5.5 billion of investment in the programme that was envisaged for Irish Water to undertake work throughout the country.  We do not know how that money will come in.  There is no private sector money coming into it.  The organisation cannot borrow off balance sheet.  We failed the EUROSTAT tests so, all told, it is a disaster.  It is not of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation&rsquo;s making, although he has been sent in here this evening to take the bullets.  Most people in Ireland acknowledge that a disaster of this level requires action, admission of failure and for the nation to stop digging with very valuable State resources.</p> <p>Far from the &euro;5.5 billion investment envisaged for Irish Water, it is now beginning to scale back on schemes planned for many years.  I can give examples from Sligo and I am sure other Senators can give examples from their regions.  Will the Minister of State ask his colleagues to look into what is known as the "bundle" scheme in Sligo, for Tubbercurry, Strandhill and Grange, where sewerage upgrade plants are required?  It has come to my attention this week that Irish Water, while still long-fingering the work that has to be done on upgrading those projects, is trying to scale back on their capacity, whereby they will meet current capacity with a very small amount of additional spare capacity without taking any account of the national housing crisis.  In Sligo, 1,000 people are on the local authority list.  That does not include any private sector, industrial or enterprise demand, which may grow, and I am sure the Minister of State and the Government would like to see that happen.  </p> <p>Apart from its accounting disaster that I have just outlined, Irish Water is scaling back schemes, stifling the potential for growth and recovery in communities such as Strandhill in County Sligo.  A trail of Ministers over the past five years has visited that location and wallowed in the beauty of that part of the country.  The Government is preventing Strandhill, Grange and Tubbercurry from performing to their potential.  They need existing water and sewerage upgrades.  Irish Water acknowledges that but it is long-fingering the work.  In so doing, it intends to stifle the capacity to grow.  When Deputies McLoughlin and Perry and Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe go out to knock on doors in Tubbercurry, Grange and Strandhill and ask people for their number one vote, they should tell them not to forget that Irish Water seeks to stifle the potential to grow in this area and the ambition people might have for their communities to have new neighbours or more enterprise.</p> <p>Sligo city is one of the large urban areas in the country.  It is supplied by two water plants.  One is known locally as Foxes Den, the other as Carns Hill.  Irish Water plans to close Carns Hill down, with only a basic upgrade to the Foxes Den plant, which will ensure that Sligo city, where there are 1,000 people on the housing waiting list, will have no spare capacity for private or local authority housing.  The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, is undertaking the development of a 70 acre industrial park there, which we all yearned for in the north west because we want the employment.  Senator Comiskey agrees with me.  The Minister of State should tell Deputies McLoughlin and Perry and Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe when canvassing in Sligo to remind people that they are endorsing Irish Water to limit the capacity of the town to grow and perform to its potential.  They are not allowing any spare capacity for water for housing or the new IDA enterprise park.  This is being replicated in other parts of the country.  Surely the Minister of State is not happy this is taking place.  No doubt he has been given a brief to tell us about the great successes of Irish Water but it is an abject failure. </p> <p>I will never forget the big mistakes of the previous Government because we all got it in the neck, and rightly so.  The last Government was punished for its mistakes.  That was just but this Government should face up to some of its own mistakes.  Irish Water is one of them.  I recall the voting machines debacle and cringe when I think of the waste of &euro;50 million and the storage costs.  It pales into insignificance when one considers the waste of &euro;785 million of the people&rsquo;s money so far, when we did not have it.  What would local authority staff, from Waterford to Sligo, from Kerry to Louth, with excellent water services personnel who have service level agreements with Irish Water have done in all those counties, including in Dublin, with &euro;785 million to invest in infrastructure?  Irish Water does not listen to the people on the ground who have the local knowledge.  Not a single cent extra has been spent on the delivery or improvement of any water infrastructure since this deformed love child of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government was born.  It is perhaps the biggest indictment of the Government.  There is no need to remind me of the failings of the previous Government.  It is important that they were faced up to and the people rightly adjudicated on its performance.</p></speech>

Instead it is gone, &euro;540 million has been spent on redundant meters, &euro;45 million on top-heavy management salaries; and &euro;41 million so far and &euro;25 million per annum on interest payments.  This is the people&rsquo;s money.  The House should take some of these figures on board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The figures do not lie.  I have given Sligo as one example of how the shoddy work of Irish Water so far is to be further extended to undermine the capacity of counties such as Sligo in the north west, on the periphery of our nation in trying and yearning to benefit from the little recovery that is beginning in Dublin.  What chance have we got in the north west if there is not even water for a single extra resident, much less the thousands of people who are homeless nationally, the thousand who are on the local authority waiting list in Sligo, the private demands that will come and for the 70 acre industrial park that God knows the north west needs?  However, the Minister, the Government and its creation, Irish Water, intend to completely undermine this and stifle growth because they do not have the capability to provide the water.</p></speech>

This could be our last Private Members' motion before a general election and this issue has not gone away at all.  Senator MacSharry has outlined very clearly the issue of water waste.  In fairness to the Minister of State this was a Fine Gael brainchild from 2009.  The reality of it was to set up a separate water utility with a view to future privatisation.  Members of this House passed a motion earlier in 2015 that there would be a referendum on the ownership of Irish Water and that water would stay in the ownership of the people in perpetuity.  That was opposed by Fine Gael and Labour Members.  It was passed by the Seanad but it stopped there.  Very recently the Minister of State's own colleague, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, said in an interview that it would be a good idea.  Can the Minister of State indicate what has changed? I believe it is the proximity to a general election that has changed.  There is no doubt that massive investment is required in water infrastructure.  The figures outlined by Senator MacSharry show that between 2000 and 2010 there was approximately &euro;550 million to &euro;600 million invested in water infrastructure.  </p><p>I acknowledge that the first couple of years of the Government taking charge - like the last couple of years of the last Government - were extremely difficult.  However, water infrastructure investment has dropped by up to &euro;200 million per year.  We are investing &euro;200 million less in 2015 than was invested in 2010 at the height of the crisis.  Why is this happening? It is because the Government has spent more than &euro;0.75 billion establishing a water utility that no one wants and, worse, which was not actually required.  An NRA type model for water could have been established that would co-ordinate the water infrastructure across local authorities which would leave the experience and knowledge within the local authorities.  The current set-up is not working and the public are saying that by withholding their payments to water infrastructure.  Why invest all that money in meters that are not being used? Most people, and I include myself, agree with water conservation and agree with a form of charging in the future when the infrastructure is in place and up to speed.  Why should someone who is going to conserve water pay the exact same as a person who is not conserving? It makes no sense.  The &euro;100 conservation grant was seen for what it was - a total joke.  It was not a conservation grant.</p><p>We saw the failure of the EUROSTAT test, which Minister Noonan and others had claimed as a <i>fait accompli </i>when EUROSTAT actually said the figures would not wash.  That should have been the final message to the Government that Irish Water is dead and buried.  Irish Water is now on the balance sheet of the State and cannot borrow independently of the State.  In the intervening period &euro;200 million less investment has been made in water infrastructure than was made during the worst year of the crisis in 2010.  That is an absolute fact.  If this is not working will the Minister of State clarify why we should keep throwing good money after bad at this problem?  Go back to the drawing board, scrap Irish Water, suspend water charges and vest control back with the local authorities with an overseeing model equivalent to the NRA.  That is what should be done and there is no doubt it would work much better.  Water infrastructure is incredibly important, we know and understand that.  However, because of the pride of the Government we are left with a utility that no one wants and which last year cost the Exchequer over &euro;20 million.  That has been the net cost to the Exchequer of this crazy plan.</p><p>Senator MacSharry has outlined clearly why we believe Irish Water should be scrapped and why charges should be suspended.  The general election itself will give all parties - and those of no party - the opportunity to put forward their alternative to a company that is not working.  Anyone who deals with local authorities knows that the process has become elongated, more complex and the works are not happening on the ground.  It is as simple as that.  Specific instances have been raised in the north west by Senator MacSharry where works were supposed to be in place but are not.  It is true that Irish Water is scaling back on its operations.  That is not what was promised.  I ask the Minister of State why the Government would not put it to the people in a referendum - as agreed by Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - that water would stay in the ownership of the people.  That at least would remove doubt from people's minds that this utility would not be privatised in the future as has happened in the UK and in many other European countries.  I am interested in the Minister of State's response and I strongly support the motion, which we intend to press.  Senator MacSharry has outlined it clearly.  It must be looked at with a cold eye.  A new Government is coming in and it will change things.  Irish Water will not be in its current guise, post-election.  I am of the firm belief that water charges will be suspended by the next Government and that we will return to the drawing board on this issue.  The situation cannot continue because the State is losing millions of euro each year and, since this Government took over, an average of &euro;200 million per year less is being invested in required infrastructure.

I will start at the end of the Senator's comments when he said that the figures for setting up Irish Water were &euro;750 million.  The establishment costs for Irish Water were reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation which approved an amount of &euro;172.8 million to be capitalised in the opening regulated asset base of the utility and that is a fact.  I hope the Senator is writing down the figures because they should be read into the record.  The energy regulator is an independent organisation which does not play politics with a serious issue.  I was surprised to see this issue, proposing to get rid of a charge, on the agenda without actually proposing where the money would come from or what services would be cut.  When people serve on councils they are normally told that if they propose to cut a budget, the money must be found elsewhere. However, it appears this money is like manna from heaven and it is going to fall out of the sky like water.  While we have had plenty of that recently none of it is treated and it is a very expensive job to treat it.  </p><p>Irish Water and the Government have made more progress in two years than was made in the previous ten and the facts speak for themselves; Irish Water invested &euro;343 million in 2014 and &euro;411 million in 2015, a total of &euro;754 million to date.  Those figures are a couple of months old as we had debated this to death before.  An expected &euro;533 million will be invested in 2016.  Last year's &euro;411 million represents a 37% increase in just two years.  They are the facts.  Figures can be read out for one area or one county, particularly Sligo - as referenced by Senator MacSharry.  I will refer to Clifden in County Galway, a region in the west of Ireland with which I am very familiar.  It has a new sewage treatment plant.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The people there are delighted.  Prioritisation is required in the context of a national organisation.  Piecemeal patching of the system in various counties is no good.  By the end of this year, Irish Water is expected to have completed 35 treatment plants and 26 waste water treatment plants and to have upgraded 72 plants.  There is no doubt that the record of the local authorities in the past in this regard is not comparable.  I commend the local authority workers on the ground who had to deal with these issues before the establishment of Irish Water.  </p><p>Before the establishment of Irish Water, approximately 944,000 people were dependent on drinking water supplies which required remedial action, while almost 20,000 people were on boil water notices.  A full 49% of all treated water was lost through leakage but that has now been corrected by Irish Water.  My own area of south County Dublin had the best record in this area, with a loss of only 16% of treated water through leakages.  I will not mention the county with the worst record, except to say that it is in the midlands.  Irish Water is now correcting that situation.  A total of 44 urban areas throughout Ireland saw untreated sewerage going into rivers and the sea, posing a major risk to human health.  This is now being taken in hand in a co-ordinated way at national level. </p><p>People naturally care about their water, given that it is one of the elements essential to our survival.  A European-wide poll asked participants to name the five biggest environmental issues of most concern to them and water pollution topped the list.  The pollution of our waterways is now being corrected.  All around the country raw sewerage was being released into our waterways but nothing was done about this by the local authorities.  In 2000, the Water Framework Directive forced member states to establish a national system of water treatment but this was totally ignored in the past.  The current Government rightly saw this inaction as unacceptable and decided that the establishment of a single national body was the best option in terms of tackling this problem.  Indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il agreed that a single national body was the way to go and also agreed with the troika that charging for water was a good idea.  The proposed charges were a good deal higher than those introduced by this Government.</p></speech>

Charging for domestic water was seen as new departure here but is not new in other EU countries.  Furthermore, it was not a new departure in rural Ireland, where farmers, business people and others have paid for their water for many years.  Do we want those in rural Ireland to bear the brunt of the charges for water, while letting their urban counterparts away with paying nothing?  The water charges here are the lowest in Europe by a large margin.</p> <p>By 2021, Irish Water will have invested &euro;5.5 billion to bring our water services up to an acceptable standard.  It will reduce leakages to 38%, saving 180 million litres of water every day.  At the moment, this treated water is going down the Suwannee.  It will also stop all pumping of raw sewage into our rivers and surrounding seas.  It will cut costs by &euro;1.8 billion; already Irish Water has reduced costs by 14%.  One third of these costs reductions will be in the payroll area.  I have already referred to the situation regarding boil water notices and to the new treatment plants.  Irish Water has also produced a plan to deal with lead pipes all over the country which is essential in terms of human health.  It has repaired or replaced over 750 km of pipe work, which is saving 32 million litres of water every day.  </p> <p>The proposal before us denies the progress that has been made to date and fails to establish an alternative model for our water services.  It loads the costs onto our citizens who are already paying for water.  Many of those who have proposed the motion are from rural constituencies but the farmers in those constituencies would not like to continue to pay for water while urban dwellers pay nothing.  I accept that the public relations around Irish Water could have been handled better.  However, people are now beginning to realise that Irish Water is working well.  I do not know when those in Fianna F&aacute;il changed their minds on this issue because they previously agreed with the troika that setting up a single utility was a good idea-----</p></speech>

I would have been asking what we should do to restore the peoples' faith in us and how we could communicate that because the party's communications network seems to be very wishy washy at present.</p> <p>I would point to three major elements in the Water Services Act that are very interesting and must be revisited.  The first is the plebiscite on the ownership of Irish Water.  This section provides that in the future where a Government proposes to initiate legislation which amends the ownership structure of Irish Water, such a proposal cannot be initiated without a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas approving the changes and, subject to such resolutions being passed, the proposal will be submitted to a plebiscite of all people eligible to vote in a referendum on a proposal to amend the Constitution.  That means that 80% of the Upper and Lower Houses would have to agree.  Unless we are going to have a takeover from North Korea, that is not going to happen.  Therefore, the idea of Irish Water not being in the ownership of the Irish people is not true.  I would also point out that Fianna F&aacute;il voted against that provision when the Bill was being debated.  It voted against the Irish peoples' ownership of Irish Water.  That is the first thing it voted against.</p> <p>The second matter is that of the public forum.  The Government proposed a public forum which has since been established.  The purpose of the forum, to be established by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation, was to represent the interests of customers of Irish Water and the Irish people.  It was proposed that the forum would have between 12 and 16 members and would review and comment on the strategies and plans of Irish Water, including those concerning investment, water charges and so forth.  What did Fianna F&aacute;il do?  It voted against that proposal.  It voted against allowing people to be a watchdog.</p> <p>The public forum now exists and functions as a watchdog for Irish Water.  What did Fianna F&aacute;il and others on that side of the House do?  They voted against it and shot themselves in the second foot.  They voted against the watchdog, but the best is yet to come.  Members of this and the Lower House know that water to households can never be turned off.  It will not and must never be turned off, despite lack of payment and regardless of what customers owe.  That is part of the Water Services Act.  Guess what Fianna F&aacute;il did in that context?  It voted against that provision too.  That is marvellous.</p></speech>

They left 20,000 people on boil water notices year in, year out.  Their inaction were the cause of 49% of water leakages.  They left a situation in Dublin city where capacity was down to between 1% and 2%, where in most European countries there is a headroom of at least 15%.  They left 44 urban areas throughout the country with untreated sewage.</p> <p>I recall as a new councillor being part of a deputation that had a meeting with one of the Senator MacSharry's ministerial colleagues at the time, who subsequently became infamous, to try to get sanction for a sewerage treatment plant for my town.  I had photographs of five locations on the River Suir where raw sewage was flowing into the river and the Minister of the day had not the manners to take the photographs out of my hand and look at them.  The next time the Labour Party was in government in the 1990s that sewerage plant was put in place.  That is what we are doing across the country now, as was outlined by Senator Keane with regard to the number of new sewerage treatment plants, remedial works, upgrades, etc., that have been put in place.  </p> <p>When we debated this subject in the House two years ago, the figure thrown out by Fianna F&aacute;il was that the charge for water per household would be &euro;750.  Then it depreciated the figure to &euro;400.  However, it was wide of the mark in all its figures, as it is with respect to the costs set out in this motion.  The cost of setting up Irish Water was &euro;172.8 million, not the figure of &euro;750 million, which Senator MacSharry obviously plucked out of the sky, as he did with most of the other figures in the motion.</p></speech>

The answer I got from practically all of them was that they were positively disposed to the system that is in place now.  I had reason to telephone the call centre in November as the water had gone off in the area where I live.  On three occasions in seven hours I got a call back from the centre in Cork and the final call was to advise that the water would be restored within one hour of the last call, and that is what happened.  With respect to the criticism I had at the time about the centralisation issue and the removal of autonomy from councillors, I have been proven wrong about that, and I am glad to say so.  The system is working in terms of fault reporting and fault responses to elected representatives.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has put down this motion in the hope of trying to make a position for itself on this issue.  Many of its councillors across the country are happy with the establishment of Irish Water.  Many of them have told me openly that despite the fact that they did not think it would work, it has worked.</p> <p>We saw the attempts to try to stir up opposition to the implementation of water meters.  I saw that in my town.  The resources of the State had to be applied in very nasty situations where people who wanted water meters installed in their homes  in order that they would be able to beat the water services allowance - some 40% of people are now beating that allowance and paying the minimum amount - were prevented from having them installed  by people who were transported into the town.  Those people travelled in buses around this country causing opposition to the work of Irish Water.  Having that matter dealt with in a motion would be more relevant than what Senator MacSharry has attempted to do in this motion.  He probably compiled it some day last week when he was not on the stage in Sligo doing a bit of acting.</p></speech>

It is a fair political charge because it is the reality and it was part of the four year EU-IMF troika plan to which Fianna F&aacute;il signed up.  It is politics and we are going to have an election campaign.  The facts of the position taken by all the parties should be put forward and we should have a robust debate on all of them.  Water charges have been very emotive for many people for all sorts of reasons because people need water to survive.  It is a very important issue.</p> <p>When those of us who opposed domestic water charges, although not investment in water services, say we want water charges to be abolished, we are accused by the Government parties of fairytale economics and that it cannot be done.  The cost of abolishing water charges would be &euro;80 million.  When one would strip out the conservation grant, which would go with it, the net cost would be &euro;80 million.  Yet the Government, especially Fine Gael - the Labour Party has its priorities and it will set them out in its manifesto and I believe it has committed to this too - has said that it will abolish in its entirety the universal social charge, which would cost &euro;3.5 billion, which is 50 times more than what it would cost to abolish water charges.  It seems that this type of auction politics is acceptable where billions can be promised.  The first act of Fine Gael and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is to say that their first priority would be to cut the top rate of USC that will benefit the top earners, the top 14%, who happen to be the same people who benefitted in terms of the last five Government budgets.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let us be realistic and honest about the propositions that are being put to people.  Let us dismiss all of the nonsense tags that are being made.  Tax cuts have been promised by Fine Gael which are irresponsible and cannot be met.  The Government cannot say it will abolish the universal social charge and, at the same time, say it can deal with the housing crisis, the problems in the health service and the problems with floods, and give money to local government.  It is simply not possible and, as the election goes on, people will see that.</p><p>Whatever propositions we put forward, as we have done every year with our alternative budgets, there is the matter of fiscal space.  There is &euro;7 billion of extra Exchequer funding over the next five years, as we are told by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance.  Any manifesto put before the electorate has to work within that fiscal space.  Then it is a matter of political choices.  What would each candidate do with that &euro;7 billion over the course of five years?</p><p>One of the things we would want to do is abolish domestic water charges and the property tax.  They are unfair and regressive.  There is something fundamentally unfair about charging people for water in the first instance.  It is also unfair for millionaires and very wealthy people to end up paying the same for these services as those on very low incomes and social welfare, including carers and people with disabilities.  Many Senators will be going around the country knocking on doors and dealing with people who are in very dire straits.  If they have not seen it already, they will then see that people are put to the pin of their collars.</p><p>I will accept that there is a recovery and will give the Government some credit for some of the policy decisions it has made.  However, we also have a responsibility to hold the Government to account.  There is nobody on the Government side who can say that the establishment of Irish Water was a success.  It was an absolute disaster from start to finish.  Hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money were squandered, there is no doubt about that.</p><p>If domestic water charges are abolished, the question will then be how we fund our water services.  We can do it through general taxation.  We have commercial water charges in place.  Domestic water charges are only a fraction of what is actually necessary to fund our water services.  Billions of euro are already spent every year so &euro;80 million in the grand scheme of things is not going to make or break investment in our water infrastructure.  It would, however, make a difference to those families who were told that the property tax was going to fund local services, including water.  No sooner was the property tax in place but it was followed by water charges.</p><p>There was a lot of sense in what Senator O'Donnell said about Fianna F&aacute;il's arguments, even if it was a bit theatrical and obviously politically biased.  She has an entitlement to make political charges.  I do not accept the argument about checks and balances in respect of privatisation.  My understanding is that a majority of Oireachtas Members is required, not 80%.  All it takes is for a Government to decide we are going to privatise it and then the legislation can be changed by introducing a Bill which simply repeals the Bill the current Government brought in.  That is why Members voted against the Bill.  It was not just about some of the so-called protections that the Government was trying to pretend would paper over the cracks.  We voted against the entire proposition of setting up Irish Water in the first place.</p><p>Let us remember that this Government brought in four different water services Bills.  The first was guillotined in the D&aacute;il after two hours of debate and, because of that, we were back within a short couple of months with the water services Bill mark II.  Many people, including those on the Government side, raised concerns about water conservation and were not listened to.  We should have a genuine debate about water services.  Let us not pretend that abolishing water charges is fairytale economics; the parties that say so are promising billions of euro of tax cuts in the same breath and it just does not stack up.  That is a debate we will have in the election campaign.</p><p>Water conservation and investment in water infrastructure are important but abolishing domestic water charges is not going to make or break all of that investment.  It is a separate issue and we need to have a debate about the fiscal space that is available and how much of that money should or could be put into investing in our water infrastructure.</p></speech>

This matter has received lengthy debate in this and the Lower House as it is such a dominant matter.  Water is one of our most important resources and it is crucial that we do all we can to utilise it effectively and ensure that we do not waste it.</p> <p>I strongly disagree with the motion stating that Irish Water has been an absolute failure.  That is simply not the case.  Irish Water has increased investment in water and improved water quality.  In my own county of Leitrim, investment in water supply, wastewater treatment systems and schemes will be in excess of &euro;8 million under the Capital Investment Plan 2014-2016.  This investment has allowed for a water supply scheme and reservoir and sewerage schemes.  There are also plans for two wastewater treatment plant upgrades, a water treatment plant expansion and pipelines and reservoir upgrades.  This investment was badly needed in County Leitrim to improve our water services.  Similarly in County Sligo, investment in water schemes will be in excess of &euro;16.1 million under the capital investment plan.  I think it ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il is calling Irish Water a failure, especially when I look at my neighbouring constituency of Roscommon where, in 2015, some 17,300 people came off boil-water notices.  Some of these notices have been in place since 2009.</p> <p>Irish Water is by no means a perfect solution but the problem surrounding Irish Water is not a perfect problem.  The metering programme has led to increased water conservation.  The installation of 804,000 meters has enabled people to measure how much water they are using.  Metering data have shown us that approximately 40% of customers are beating the cap charge through lower usage.  This fact is to be welcomed and proves the effectiveness of water charges.</p> <p>I note that the Opposition motion also calls for the suspension of the present charging regime until our national water infrastructure is brought up to international standards.  If we do not implement charges, how are we going to bring our water infrastructure up to such standards?  In an ideal world this might be possible but in reality we need the charge as a source of finance to reform our water infrastructure.  We need to work with Irish Water to support progress and help build the best quality water utility in the world.  Furthermore, all of us in rural Ireland down through the years have been involved in building and running group schemes and we know how much that has cost us over the years.</p></speech>

This is an issue that brought 100,000 people onto the streets.  Looking at the record of this Government, which has much to commend it in many ways, this was the low point.  It really annoyed the citizens and I am not so sure that the annoyance is at all gone away.  Last week we had the Ombudsman complaining that he is not allowed to investigate Irish Water.  There were more comments in another paper about the level of consultancy fees that Irish Water charges.</p> <p>The tax system is a poll tax.  Paying for water through progressive taxation, going by the budgets of this Government, would involve people on &euro;100,000 paying about six times more in taxes than people on &euro;20,000.  The poll tax aspect has annoyed people.  I was at one of the Maynooth marches against water charges and there were people who genuinely did not have &euro;160 to spare.  That is why they objected.  "We never paid before" is a completely fallacious argument.  We paid our taxes and the Exchequer ran a surplus for ten years.  The water industry in Ireland was unable to prepare proper projects to submit to the Department of Finance.  It wanted its own exchequer and invented this.  The issue has seriously damaged the Government in many ways.</p> <p>We also took on the surplus staff.  John FitzGerald of the ESRI has commented on that; there are probably about 4,000 people doing the work of 2,000.  The McLoughlin report on local government, which was published in 2010, estimated that there was a 30% surplus in county managers, a 20% surplus in directors of services, a 15% surplus in senior and middle managers and a 10% surplus in corporate service staff.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D.

All those people were transferred, which was a major mistake.  It was documented and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government knew very well the extent of the over-manning.</p><p>Another unacceptable act was to put the onus on the consumer because water was being wasted.  The idea was that if there was a charge for water, consumers would not be as wasteful.  More than 90% of the waste occurred within the province of the county engineer and blaming little old ladies for drinking too much water or having too many baths and putting the onus on them was completely wrong.  Leitrim was one of the best counties for not wasting water, as it had a figure of 36.5% for wasted water.  The worst area was Roscommon, as has been mentioned, with 58% of the water wasted.  It was wasted by the people employed in the water sector.</p><p>We decided to have a national quango that has hired extra staff and public relations personnel, with a large cost base.  That has been well documented but why did we do it?  The least amount of waste was in Fingal, which is right beside County Meath, with a figure of 21.6%, whereas Meath had a rate of 47.6% for waste, which was 2.2 times the amount in Fingal.  We abolished both local water authorities.  Why did we not take the efficient local water authorities and allow them to run the inefficient bodies?  I gave an example of two authorities beside each other and where there was a vast difference in the amount of water wasted by each.</p><p>We did not research the project properly and it is financed in a way that is extremely regressive.  The organisation has increased expenditure, overheads and the number of consultants, which has annoyed the Irish public like nothing else has done in the past number of years.  This has damaged the Government's reputation among the public.  It was a mistake and this should never again be the model for setting up any quango.  There were local authorities which could do the job properly and there were those which could not.  How could we reform the bodies not doing the job properly?  If the bodies were over-manned, everybody should not have been given the guarantee of a job and a headquarters should not be set up, with corporate image consultants and major legal and accountancy firms.  That was completely unnecessary.  Trying to get this off balance sheet was an economic con job that was disallowed by EUROSTAT in any case.</p><p>I agree that we must properly invest in water but this is a crazy way of charging for water and this is a crazy organisation set up to do that.  A recent opinion poll indicated that this is the most unpopular organisation in the public or private sector by miles in the country.  I do not feel any need to defend it, although I would defend many things that this Government has had to do.  Irish Water was its biggest mistake.</p></speech>

Our water services are in a terrible state and they must be fixed.  This can only be done by a single national body and the old way of doing it, through 31 local authorities, has not worked.  Everybody recognises this.  We need more than &euro;13 billion to fix Ireland's water services and the first &euro;5.5 billion is in the Irish Water business plan.  It will fix the worst problems by 2021.  We must remember that Irish Water has already fixed more in two years than had been fixed in the previous ten years.  For example, 20,000 households have been taken off boil water notices, many of them affecting families that had to boil water before drinking it for years.</p> <p>The Irish Water model of a public water utility is the norm for water services throughout the world.  It is the proven model to deliver these services.  Metering works, as 40% of Irish Water customers with meters are paying less than the cap bill, as has been mentioned by some of my colleagues.  I have surveyed 100 houses that were metered and 92 or 93 of the occupants were amazed at what they were being charged through the meter for water.  We should review the cap.  Almost 50% of treated drinking water is lost through leaks and we pump out raw sewage at 45 locations throughout the country into our oceans and rivers.  That is unacceptable in 2016.</p> <p>There are 5,000 customers who still have to boil water before they can drink it.  Water supplied to 700,000 customers is at risk of contamination.  We do not have enough clean water and wastewater treatment to support future economic growth and the future of our country depends on our economic growth.  We need treated water.  This was the position before Irish Water came along and it is there to fix this problem.  It has achieved much in the past two years and it will achieve more.  We need a single national body to fix this problem.  After many parts of our country were flooded recently, there were calls for a single national body to deal with those issues, including waterways and flood planning.  Some of those calls came from people who have said they do not want this type of utility for Irish water.  A single national body is the only way in which to have a full picture of all the issues nationally, plan for the long term and prioritise the most urgent problems, delivering the required actions in an integrated way.</p> <p>Fixing our water and wastewater infrastructure is a massive national project that can only be sorted out by a dedicated national expert body.  We have set up Irish Water as that national organisation and we now have a single utility with the systems and expertise to take on the challenge of fixing our water services.  It now has responsibility and is accountable for getting the job done.  We need more than &euro;13 billion to fix Ireland's water services properly and the first &euro;5.5 billion is in the Irish Water business plan.  That will fix the worst problems by 2021.  Irish Water will invest that &euro;5.5 billion to bring water services to an acceptable standard, eliminating all boil water notices and reducing leakages to 38%, saving 180 million litres of water that is lost every day of the week.  All pumping of raw sewage into our rivers and seas will be stopped and costs will be cut by &euro;1.1 billion.  Irish Water has already reduced costs by 14%, which should also be recognised.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il believes in a clear, new policy for the future.  First will be the abolition of water charges but we will provide an alternative.  The botched implementation of the water charges regime by the Government has shaken public trust in the quango that is Irish Water.  This is evident from the fact that 57% of households have not paid.  Fianna F&aacute;il calls for the immediate abolition of charges.  Domestic water charges should only be introduced when our national domestic water infrastructure is brought up to international standards and is in accord with the key three tests relating to water quality, supply and leakage.  Fianna F&aacute;il will ensure there are no charges in the lifetime of the next Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il will abolish the super-quango that is Irish Water.  Fianna F&aacute;il consistently opposed the creation of Irish Water and the controversy over consultancy costs, bonuses and overstaffing at the super quango has borne out our fears.</p> <p>What proposals does Fianna F&aacute;il have?  It proposes that responsibility for domestic water be returned to local authorities.  In the same way the National Roads Authority has been able to develop our national road infrastructure under the local authorities, our national water supply will be developed.  The Fianna F&aacute;il proposal is for a new, slimmed-down water infrastructure company with 100 staff in respect of which the Oireachtas will have control over consultancy costs and there will be no bonus structure.</p> <p>In regard to water infrastructure for the 21st century, the upgrading of our infrastructure to ensure it is fit for purpose must be a national priority.  This will ensure we have a supply that is safe, reliable and adequate for homes, business and industry.  I am embarrassed when I hear about the situation in Roscommon, where the water is not fit to drink.  I cannot believe this is the case.  This is symbolic of the mess and incompetence in certain areas of our economy.</p></speech>

I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this motion because it exposes much of the inaccurate and untrue information it has put before the House tonight.  Fianna F&aacute;il is now bringing forward unrealistic proposals.  The abolition of Irish Water would be a retrograde step at this point.  Irish Water was established with a view to redressing years of under investment in our water infrastructure and to putting together a structure that would invest in our water and waste water systems in a realistic manner rather than in the piecemeal way done through the local authorities.  We had a crazy situation where every one of the 31 local authorities did its own thing in regard to water infrastructure investment.  Infrastructure stopped at the county boundary and could not move into the next county.  This was ludicrous.  Since Irish Water has been established, we have seen significant investment in infrastructure, with some &euro;343 million invested in 2014, &euro;400 million in 2015 and an expected &euro;500 million in 2016.</p> <p>We judge an operation or utility on how well it performs and on whether it is producing results.  It is said, "By their deeds, you shall know them."  In parts of this country and in my new constituency of Roscommon-Galway where we canvassed during the by-election, reference was made at every second door to the boil water notices and we were asked when they would be lifted.  During 2015, those notices were lifted for over 17,000 people in County Roscommon.  Some of those individuals had been subject to such notices since 2009, which was unacceptable.</p> <p>Reference has been made to costs and the need for everybody to pay a little for their water.  I see nothing wrong with asking people in towns, villages and cities to make a contribution to the provision of water.  In rural Ireland, where people depended on group water schemes during the past 40 to 60 years, they contributed to the cost of their water supply.  They gladly paid but wondered why people in cities and large towns did not pay any contribution towards water and sewerage services.  We can only admit that was not fair.  I believe it is appropriate that everybody should make a modest contribution towards the provision of water and wastewater.</p> <p>Let us consider what Irish Water inherited when it assumed responsibility for water provision just two years ago.  I listened with great interest to what Senator Barrett said regarding this utility being a hated entity.  There certainly was controversy over its establishment and there were quite a few teething problems.  Mistakes were made but the company has bedded in well and is now making a significant contribution to expediting the provision of a good and safe water supply for homes.  It inherited a situation where almost 1 million people were dependent on drinking water supplies that required remedial action.  Almost 20,000 people in Dublin were on boil water notices and spare capacity was between 1% and 2%.  I am informed it is now close to 10% as a result of the fixing of leaks and the remediation of supply problems.</p> <p>I am pleased when I walk through my home town to see Irish Water engaged in a major project to upgrade the water and wastewater system of the town of Ballinasloe.</p></speech>

It exceeds all other bad decisions taken by the Government, many of which have impacted on the most vulnerable.  There has been a total disregard of people who are vulnerable.  The decision to establish Irish Water and the resultant imposition of water charges impact on all those severe income issues.  Despite the fact that the Government had set out in its manifesto that it would abolish many of the quangos established in the past few decades, a proposal I supported, it established the mother of all quangos in Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  As stated by Senator Michael Mullins, the figure of &euro;750 million referred to in the motion for the cost of establishment of Irish Water is not correct.  The motion actually states the cost is over &euro;750 million.  The true figure is &euro;785 million.  </p> <p>For the benefit of Senators on the opposite side, I will outline the profligacy of the Government.   According to consultants, the set-up cost of Irish Water was to be &euro;172 million.  It is well known that low-performing public servants, of whom there have been many in local authorities during the years, will always cover themselves by commissioning consultants' reports, regardless of the cost, which, in the event of something not working out in the way intended, will excuse them.  The manner in which the sume of &euro;172 million was spent constituted a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers' money.  The cost of water meter installation in 2015 was &euro;540 million, yet the meters will not come into operation until, I think, 2019.  Given that at that stage we may be approaching another election, my suspicion is that their operation will be postponed such that, in effect, we will derive no benefit from them.  The cost interest payable on the loan is &euro;25 million, while Irish Water administration and wage costs for the year are &euro;45 million, all of which bring the figure to &euro;785 million.  I, therefore, agree with Senator Michael Mullins that the figure of &euro;750 million is not correct.  It is, in fact, too low.</p> <p>The establishment of Irish Water could have been achieved more economically by creating a dynamic within local government.  Many county and town councils which were abolished by the Minister who established Irish Water were on top of their wastewater programmes and the provision of quality water schemes.  While some were not, the cure was to make chief executives within the local government system to perform better.  Structures should have been put in place to ensure this would happen.  This should apply across the public service.  However, what happened was that the local government officials involved were transferred to the new quango known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  When the level of overstaffing was exposed, we were told that the position would work itself out by 2026.  </p> <p>Everybody here knows that owing to the economic downturn we have experienced many people have either lost their jobs or are in jobs that pay low wages.  Many of the people involved are over-leveraged in terms of debt and struggling to meet repayments on their homes and have little discretionary income.  I have no objection in principle to water charges.  When they were first proposed in 1983 by the then leader of the Labour Party and Minister for the Environment, Dick Spring, the majority of Fianna F&aacute;il members on the council on which I served, urged by me, supported their introduction.  Subsequently, when Deputy Joan Burton was in danger of losing her seat to Deputy Joe Higgins in a by-election, it was decided to do away with water charges, leaving the Government with a political conundrum of having to introduce them.  As a former colleague in this House often said, "It is never the wrong thing to do the right thing."  The lesson for the Labour Party is that it is never the right time to do the wrong thing, which is what is happening.</p> <p>It is my understanding that approximately 55% of consumers have not paid their water charges.  Again, it is a case of overloading the willing horse.  If that is the case, what will happen to those who refuse to pay?  What action will be taken against them and what does the Government propose to do in terms of the investment needed?  As I understand it, an investment in water infrastructure of &euro;5.5 billion is required.  Irish Water has no hope of raising that capital on private markets because it has failed the EUROSTAT test.  As such, the reason for its establishment has been undermined.  I support the call made in the motion for its dismantling and the abolition of water charges until such time as the water infrastructure has been put right.</p></speech>

People are getting the benefit of meters by paying less than the standing charge for their water usage, so meters are useful.  In fact, some people cannot get meters installed because their water supply is to the back of the house.  I am raising this issue with Irish Water because they want meters.</p> <p>When I was a wee fellow in Haggardstown, one of my duties each day was to go to the well to get water.  The well was a good bit away from the house.  It was a big enough task - perhaps even a chore at times - so it was fantastic when the rural piped water scheme extended to our area.  It was a wonderful day.  If some Opposition figures had their way, we would still be getting water from the well.  At that time, we said the rosary every night at home.  We then had the litany of the saints.</p></speech>

I do not think he was a fan.</p> <p>A contract was awarded to Glan Agua for a &euro;6.1 million water treatment plant in Roscommon on 11 January 2016 to serve the north east Roscommon and Ballyleague regional water supply scheme.  On 11 January 2016, Irish Water announced the signing of a contract which will involve an investment of approximately &euro;2.7 million in upgrades to the Kildare town sewerage scheme.  On 8 January 2016, the boil water notice on the Whitegate regional water supply scheme was lifted, benefiting 10,000 customers very soon after the problem was identified.  On 9 December 2015, Irish Water identified the preferred site for a &euro;30 million wastewater treatment plant in Arklow.  On 8 January 2016, it was announced that contracts had been signed for an &euro;18.4 million investment in wastewater infrastructure in Killybegs, Bundoran, Glencolmcille and Convoy.  I hope the Opposition is fed up listening at this stage but I could go on until the cows come home.  This is only in a couple of weeks.  </p> <p>Notwithstanding the good work carried out by local authorities over the years, this level of work and investment would have been unheard of before Irish Water was set up.  Notwithstanding his opposition to water charges and Irish Water as an entity, we have heard the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in praise the work of Irish Water in County Louth, a fact to which Senator Brennan will testify.  It is a topsy-turvy old world indeed.  Talk about having your water and drinking it, to mix a metaphor.  The Cooley regional water supply scheme in County Louth has been completed.  This has been on the agenda for many years - certainly since I joined Louth County Council in 1999.  I often heard Senator Brennan raise it at Louth County Council.</p></speech>

I mean that in a respectful way, of course.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate in this debate and to propose the Government's amendment to the motion in response to what I believe is an ill-conceived Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  This debate presents an opportunity to outline the real improvements that Irish Water has already made to the public water and wastewater systems in this country through increased investment and new approaches to services and infrastructure delivery.  In moving towards a more sustainable model for funding investment in water services, the debate tonight will remind the House that these improvements are addressing the many legacies of under-investment in our water and wastewater networks - legacies inherited from the many years of under-investment by the previous Administration.  It is an opportunity to outline the work that remains to be done, which is vital for the protection of public health, economic growth and the environment.  By investing more in our public water system and by standardising how services are delivered and assets are managed, Irish Water is improving water quality, making water supplies more secure and reliable and increasing wastewater treatment - progress we can all agree is critical for our local communities and local and national economic well-being.</p> <p>At the outset, let me dispel any Opposition claims about lack of extra investment in water services.  Some of those arguments were rehearsed here tonight.  They are, frankly, untrue.  Since the national utility assumed responsibility in 2014, Irish Water has increased investment significantly.  In 2013, local authorities invested approximately &euro;300 million through the water services investment programme.  In its first year alone, Irish Water invested &euro;343 million.  This increased to &euro;411 million last year.  That is a 37% increase in investment in just two years.  This year, Irish Water expects to invest &euro;500 million in the network.  The actual figures do not lie.  </p> <p>The increased investment by Irish Water, which has contributed to improvements in water quality, supply and wastewater treatment, has not been curtailed by EUROSTAT's decision last year to categorise Irish Water expenditure as Government expenditure.  There has been no change to the planned level of investment or level of water charges.  Irish Water's capital investment plan for 2014 to 2016 remains unchanged from that included in the baseline forecasts in the stability programme update and the spring economic statement last year.  Irish Water continues to be funded by a combination of external debt, Government contributions and revenue from customers.</p> <p>This investment is critical if we are to address the legacies of decades of under-investment that Irish Water faced when it became the national water services authority in January 2014. </p> <p>Let me recap for the Fianna F&aacute;il Members, who seem to be suffering from selective amnesia, the legacy left behind by the previous Government.  This included the reality of approximately 945,000 people being dependent on drinking water supplies requiring remedial action; almost 20,000 people on boil water notices, which was an abject disgrace; 49% of all water produced lost on leakage; and 44 urban areas throughout Ireland seeing untreated sewage going into rivers and seas, posing a major risk to public health and the environment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is Fianna F&aacute;il's legacy of underinvestment.  Since then, Irish Water's investment has delivered 24 new treatment plants, 20 for wastewater, four for drinking water, as well as 32 upgrades.  Up to 750 km of pipework has been replaced or upgraded, representing a saving of 32 million litres of water per day.</p><p>For too many people, particularly in Roscommon, the reality of having to boil water before using it for drinking or cleaning had become all too familiar.  For the residents of Castlerea, for example, boiling water before use was a regular daily occurrence from November 2009 to June 2013.  I am pleased to report that last year, 17,300 people in Roscommon no longer had to boil water coming out of their taps.  This is real progress making a difference to people's lives; progress in which Irish Water's expertise and work has been instrumental.  The number of people dependent on water supplies listed on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s remedial action list of works requiring remediation has reduced significantly from a high of almost 945,000 two years ago to 770,000 today.</p><p>Irish Water's domestic metering programme is additional capital investment to the main investment figure outlined earlier.  In a programme of scale and ambition unmatched anywhere, Irish Water has installed close to 804,000 meters in less than two and a half years.  Three quarters of all homes to be metered under phase one of the programme can measure how much water they use.  I must compliment the contractors on the ground on the way in which they have performed their work with great dignity and commitment in an often difficult and sometimes threatening environment.  Nobody going about their daily work should have to experience that.  As well as facilitating metered charging, which the OECD and others have deemed the fairest form of charging, meters are incentivising customers to conserve water and are assisting in the detection of customer-side leakage, which Irish Water estimates accounts for 6% of all water produced.</p><p>Through metering's identification of customer-side leakage, Irish Water has been able to offer householders a first-fix repair scheme.  Meter data enables the utility to alert householders to significant leaks within a householders' property.  Before this, local authorities did not have the capacity to do this.  Where the leak is between the boundary of a property and that of a house, Irish Water has offered to repair the most significant leaks it has encountered.  In addition, more than 2,200 customers, through Irish Water's leak notifications, have undertaken repairs of leaks internal to the house.</p><p>Between Irish Water and customer repairs, 28 million litres of water are now being saved per day.  When added to the 32 million litres per day being saved through pipework replacement over the past two years, 60 million litres of potable water is being saved daily in this country.  To put this in context, Cork city requires 62 million litres of water per day.  Irish Water's conservation focus over the past two and a half years is already equivalent to the daily water needs of our second city.  The better management of our existing water supply infrastructure in this way will provide medium-term capital investment savings.  It makes far more sense to save existing water than to build new plants without addressing leakage on both the public mains and customer sides.</p><p>Another benefit from the metering programme has been the identification of possible lead piping in householders' properties.  The problem of exposure to lead in drinking water is a legacy of lead piping used in the construction of houses built up to and including the 1970s.  Though the issue is in the main the responsibility of individual householders, as all lead piping has been replaced in the public network, sustained exposure is a possible health risk, particularly to pregnant women, the unborn and new born babies and young toddlers.  For this reason, last June the Government published a strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water.  Irish Water is playing its part in implementing the strategy.  It has written to 27,000 households informing them of the likely presence of lead piping in their property and provided them with customer advice on dealing with the issue, including health advice from the HSE.  Again, the effectiveness of this first national strategy on the issue is enhanced by the data available from the domestic metering programme.</p><p>In parallel with increased investment, Irish Water has introduced new approaches to asset management and maintenance.  For Irish Water, asset management underpins its infrastructural investment with central strategic planning now based on accurate data on asset performance and full control of all investment decisions.  It plans investment consistently across the asset base rather than on the basis of large scale, one-off investments.  This approach, including the use of new technologies, for five major projects alone, including the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade, is expected to result in savings of &euro;240 million.  That is equivalent to the entire Exchequer funding of capital investment in the network in 2013.</p><p>In terms of asset maintenance, Irish Water has commenced a major programme to repair known defects across the public water system, including national programmes of disinfection, pH correction and chemical optimisation for drinking water treatment.  Similar programmes are under way for wastewater treatment, along with work to control trade and abnormal discharges to public sewers.</p><p>Irish Water has made a significant contribution already to bringing our water services up to the standard that its customers demand.  It has made important improvements to the quality and supply of drinking water.  It has begun addressing the large deficit in wastewater treatment.  It has introduced new initiatives and systems to standardise services, manage assets and plan new infrastructural builds with a national approach.  For the first time, we now have a national water services strategic plan in place with a 25 year time horizon, coupled with Irish Water&rsquo;s business plan for 2014 to 2021, which demonstrates how the objectives will be delivered in the immediate period ahead.  Increased investment, one of the main aims of the Government's reform programme, has enabled some of these improvements but the national utility approach has also been crucial.  The introduction of domestic water charges - more modest than what Fianna F&aacute;il had planned to impose - was necessary and has contributed to the increase in investment through providing a sustainable long-term funding model through the creation of a direct link between the usage of water services and payment for them.</p><p>Irish Water has an ambitious programme of work to tackle the ongoing legacies of underinvestment.  Its business plan contains important goals to reach by 2021, such as lifting all current boil water notices; eliminating the risk of drinking water contamination for people currently on supplies in the EPA's remedial action list; ending the discharge of untreated wastewater at 44 locations; reducing leakage from 49% to 38%, saving 180 million litres every day; implementing the national lead strategy to reduce risk of contamination in up to 140,000 homes and an additional 40,000 homes on shared services; and significantly increasing water and wastewater capacity to support social and economic development, including 15% spare capacity in Dublin.</p><p>A critical underpinning of the business plan is the achievement of efficiencies, namely, &euro;1.1 billion in operational costs and &euro;500 million in capital spending.  These efficiencies are driven by the holistic and asset management approach to delivery of water services through the national utility model.  This addresses the problems of the previous delivery model which involved a fragmented system with many different ways of working, a lack of economies of scale and insufficient integration between operational and capital investment decisions, which impacted particularly on capital maintenance leading to underperformance and deterioration of existing assets.  I remember when I was on Louth County Council along with Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and Brennan, we had to go cap in hand to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, begging for moneys to address infrastructural deficits in our water supply services.</p></speech>

What about performing to our potential?  My information about Irish Water is that it is scaling back all over the country because it does not have the money to function.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-01-13a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016011300002#AAA00300"><p>In regard to the raw sewage that is still being pumped in various places throughout the country, the 28 million litres that are being saved per day, as the Minister of State mentioned, the 24 treatment plants, the 32 plants upgraded and the 750 km of piping laid since Irish Water took over, let us imagine how much more raw sewage we could have stopped being pumped into our waterways, how many more plants could have been built, how many more plants could have been upgraded and how many more kilometres of pipes could have been laid if we had not thrown &euro;785 million down the drain.  The Minister of State is correct in saying that &euro;400 million has been spent this year, give or take, that approximately &euro;350 million was spent last year and that in the region of &euro;300 million was invested the year before.  As Senator Darragh O'Brien said, that is still &euro;200 million less than was being spent at the height of the crash in 2010.  The reality is that we have thrown good money after bad.  I have clearly outlined the scaling back which prevents the capacity to cater for the rising population to which the Minister of State referred.  That is what needs to be acknowledged.  Even given the little bit of work that has been done, which cost &euro;200 million less than the spending at the height of the crisis, as we have seen, can anyone imagine how much our local authorities could have achieved throughout the country in Waterford, Tipperary, Sligo, Fingal or Dublin city in making those improvements?  If we split up that &euro;785 million three years ago and said, "That is for you, that is for you and that is for you", how much work would have been done?</p> <p>Let us use one of Irish Water's own figures, namely, the &euro;1.5 billion required to upgrade the system nationally.  My God.  If we had a Minister worth his or her salt and a Government with the ambition and vision to do it, we could have had our existing staff, who have service level agreements with Irish Water, roll out half of those improvements already with the &euro;785 million and have &euro;35 million to spare.</p></speech>
