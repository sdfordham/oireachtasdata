The scheme provided multi-annual funding for such national organisations toward core costs associated with the provision of services.  Priority is given under the scheme to supporting national organisations which provide services that target disadvantaged groups.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, in the summer of 2014, 23 health and disability organisations were excluded from the scheme.  The Minister will also be aware that bridging funding was provided for 12 months by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to help these organisations, but, unfortunately, this funding will end in June.  The organisations are now in limbo as they cannot receive confirmation from the Minister's Department as to whether there will be a continuation of funding after June.  In January they were told by officials of the Department that they would know by the end of March, but that information has not been forthcoming.</p> <p>One may wonder why the provision of funding for a health and disability organisation comes under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but not everything is about a health issue.  Many people, having been diagnosed with a disability, are well able to contribute to and participate in community organisations.  The funding is used to support people to live as full a life as possible and continue their involvement in the community.  It also supports the families of those diagnosed with a disability.  It is vital for the continuation of support groups.  Last year the Minister provided &euro;1.28 million to avoid an adverse impact on the organisations involved.  The work that they carry out is invaluable.  Organisations such as the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, to name but two, are the umbrella support bodies for many groups such as those which support people with multiple sclerosis, stroke victims and people suffering from dementia.</p> <p>As laid down in the criteria, the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, is a key element of the State's commitment to support the role of the sector in delivering services to enhance the quality of life of many in Ireland and contribute to the creation of a vibrant civil society.  Similar to A Vision for Change in the mental health sector, these organisations are endeavouring to help people with a disability to move from residential care to community settings where they can integrate with the community and achieve independence.  Neurological organisations which account for 12 of the 23 organisations affected are providing critical front-line services and support for over 700,000 people affected by neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injury.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Moloney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Being excluded from SSNO funding means a loss of income of &euro;600,000 which will result in a loss of critical services such as counselling, helpline and home support, vital services that empower people to live in their homes and communities.  The withdrawal of SSNO funding will result in potential job losses of one full-time and 11 part-time staff, while two organisations may close.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position on funding for these organisations and confirm the continuation of funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015040100002#B00200"><p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad on the funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector and thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</p> <p>The scheme aims to provide multi-annual funding for national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  During 2013 a review of the scheme was undertaken.  It found that while the scheme had fulfilled its main objective of providing multi-annual funding for national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services, there was a need for the organisations funded under the scheme to demonstrate clearly the added value of the work proposed.</p> <p>A new scheme to support national organisations was advertised for applications early last year.  The Department requested Pobal to undertake an assessment of the applications received, given that organisation's significant experience and expertise in both the design of assessment criteria and the completion of assessment functions.  In this context, Pobal put in place a dedicated team to deal with inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback.  Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which it is considering.  Some 157 applications were received by Pobal.  A total of 55 applications were approved for funding in the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  In excess of &euro;8 million is being provided by the Department in the two-year period, representing an increase in funding of more than 10% per annum compared to the previous scheme. </p> <p>The Government is very mindful of the valuable work undertaken by national organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  While it was known that the existing scheme was ending on 30 June 2014 and applications were sought for the new scheme with no guarantee of continued funding, it was clear that organisations had become increasingly dependent on this funding.  Against that background, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, announced on 18 July 2014 the allocation of bridging funding of &euro;1.4 million to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations for a 12-month period, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector.  The Department is engaging with the Department of Health to advance the review.  The review has been designed to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and the avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support for organisations working in the sector.  I confirm that all organisations in receipt of bridging funding and a number of others were invited to make submissions as part of the review process.  It is intended to complete and publish the outcome of the review as soon as possible.</p></speech>

She repeated what I had told her.  I want an answer to the question as to whether funding will be continued for these organisations.  She referred to an appeals process.  The organisations submitted appeals almost 12 months ago, but no decision has been arrived at.  Surely it is time the Department pulled out its finger and made a decision on the appeals to let the people concerned know what the position is, as they are caught in limbo where jobs are at risk, yet nobody is giving them an answer.  All I hear from the Minister of State is that they were invited to make submissions as part of the review process and that it is intended to publish the outcome of the review as soon as possible, but where does this leave the organisations in question?  They do not know whether they will receive funding or whether they will have to close their doors.  Somebody needs to provide an answer to their questions quickly.</p></speech>

I undertake to bring the Senator's concerns back to the Department and discuss them with my officials.  We will try to provide her with a more detailed response.</p></speech>

I wish to outline for her the reason Galway County Council's municipal district of Connemara should be designated as a separate stand-alone lot under the social inclusion programme, SICAP, and to suggest social inclusion funding should be awarded accordingly.  The decision taken by the Department, overseen by Galway County Council, has caused uproar in Galway.  On 12 March I attended a meeting of 650 people at Maam Cross in Connemara.  The decision made at the meeting was to make Galway, including Connemara, it one lot for the receipt of funding under the SICAP.  Previously it had been divided into two lots.  East Galway had come under Galway Rural Development, GRD, and west Galway under Forum Connemara.</p> <p>Galway is the second largest county in the country and east and west Galway are radically different, as I know being a public representative for the county.  West Galway, west of Lough Corrib, includes Connemara, while, for the most part, east Galway is a different constituency.  I live in east Galway, in the Oranmore electoral division.  I am very happy with the services provided by Galway Rural Development which has won this funding, but that does not mean Connemara should not be a stand-alone lot.  It is a vast area which contains more than one third of the population of the county.  Its terrain and everything else are different.</p> <p>I support Forum Connemara and wish to explain why Connemara should be designated as a stand-alone lot.  The proper way to deal with this issue is to divide Galway into two lots, one encompassing the area west of Lough Corrib, Connemara, and the other the east, the GRD area..  Unfortunately, this did not happen and for that reason, I call on the Minister to make it happen.  I spoke about the meeting I had attended, attended by 650 people, and their disillusionment with the decision which had been made.</p> <p>I have grave concerns about how the local community development committee, LCDC, put the new arrangement in place, through the acting county CEO.  It seems to be undemocratic and divisive.  There are serious concerns about the way in which the vote on the designation of the SICAP took place, when only five of the 19 people were eligible to vote.  Everyone else had a conflict of interest or was absent.  This has serious implications for the committee as regards future decisions, not least on the distribution of these funds.</p> <p>On the night of the meeting, with others, I called for a public inquiry into this decision.  I understand a judicial review is under way, although I cannot confirm any more this.  If Forum Connemara is dismantled in this fashion, will it not also affect the committee's membership and eligibility?  </p> <p>Let me outline some of the benefits to be gained from reviewing the decision.  The provision for one lot only in terms of SICAP funding for Galway means social exclusion, not social inclusion, the opposite of what we want to happen.  The general view at the meeting was that Forum Connemara was of vital importance to the community in Connemara.  There is hardly a person in Connemara who has not had some contact with its services.  People told their stories about the value of Forum Connemara to every demographic grouping in Connemara.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Young people, sports people and older people spoke.  For example, the only working acupuncturist in Connemara started her practice in 2010.  She provides a health service to 420 people who are rurally isolated in the area.  These are people whom the mainstream health service had been unable to help and for whom travelling to Galway, a distance of possibly 50 or 60 miles, for this service was difficult and expensive.  Had it not been for the services of FORUM in Letterfrack, she says she would not be in the position she is in today.  She says she received guidance and support in starting a new business from FORUM when Enterprise Ireland in Galway would not even reply to her e-mails or telephone calls.  She now pays tax whereas before she drew down jobseeker's allowance and she buys locally and circulates her earnings locally.  She says the new arrangement would suggest she would have to travel to Athenry under the GRD-----</p></speech>

They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than existed heretofore with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p> <p>There was a tendering process.  In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP was subject to a public procurement process, which is in its final stages.  In stage 1, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes, for example, smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations, were invited to submit joint applications.  The closing date for stage 2, invitation to tender, was 19 December 2014.  Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender and local and community development committees are in the process of finalising contracts with the successful tenderers.</p> <p>LCDCs have managed and implemented stage 2, invitation to tender, of the SICAP tendering process.  SICAP was tendered for on the basis of lots.  In most areas, this was one lot per local authority area.  This reflects Government policy and the alignment process.  In some areas, a decision was taken by the LCDC to divide the lot into smaller units.  That was a decision of the LCDC in each case.  The LCDC and not the Minister made this decision.</p> <p>The LCDC is independent of the local authority in the performance of its functions.  This independence is provided for explicitly in sections 49A(2) and 128B(8) of the Local Government Act 2001.  Any decisions made by an LCDC when carrying out its functions is solely a matter for that LCDC.  That said, my Department advised in a letter to all LCDCs in July 2014 that in order to reduce the administrative burden for each LCDC, it would be prudent to have one lot only for each LCDC.  I am satisfied that the decision of Galway LCDC to tender on the basis of one lot was taken with probity.</p></speech>

I hear what the Minister of State is saying about national policy.  That is not at issue here.  I accept that the national devolves to local, etc., but the issue here is the way the committee made its decision.  It is not putting people first at local level.  If it was, this decision would not have been taken, given the vastness of the county and the differences in people's needs in west Galway and east Galway.  The general view at the meeting, including that of people who are members of the LCDC committee, is that they did not know on what it was they were voting.  That is a serious issue.  Does the Minister of State accept how serious it is?  Only five out of nineteen committee members could cast a vote.  How could that be a democratic decision?  The view in the room and the view of everyone I am meeting is that the committee process which made the decision was flawed in the first instance.  In summing up those circumstances, how can we revisit the LCDC decision so that people will be informed on the next occasion?</p></speech>

I again draw the Senator's attention to the fact that in some areas the decision was taken by the LCDC to divide the lot into smaller units.  The LCDC is independent and the decision remained with the LCDC.</p></speech>

He has a very busy schedule and he did not receive much notice about this matter.  I am therefore delighted he is here today.  I also welcome Martin Plummer, the chairman of the National Chauffeur Drivers Association and Mick Devine and his son, Shane Devine, who are members of the association and who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider their situation.</p> <p>The National Chauffeur Drivers Association is an independent and non-profit organisation representing the chauffeur-drive industry in Ireland.  The association comprises more than 120 chauffeur-drive companies nationwide with members operating more than 400 high-end vehicles.  They perform an ambassadorial role for Ireland because they meet business people as well as representatives of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and tourism interests coming to Ireland.  They present a very positive side of Ireland, its people and its culture.  I congratulate Mick Devine on receiving an international award for his work in that regard.  He has driven luminaries such as Bruce Springsteen and others who are great ambassadors for Ireland.  Regular clients include guests of the Government, trade delegations, diplomats and leading business executives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The NCDA also has strong links with many important groups in the commercial and tourism sectors.  Its members are regularly called on by the Government, Departments and leading businesses to service visitors in a professional, positive and welcoming manner.  I was a guest in Taiwan and the airline, Emirates, provided chauffeur driven cars to collect clients at Dublin Airport to fly on to the Middle East and onwards to Taiwan and elsewhere.  They are providing great employment opportunities.  On the way back from the airport we were stopped by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who reminded the driver that he could go only certain ways as we drove down O'Connell Street.  He was not in the bus lane.</p><p>That is the background.  I could not believe that people performing such a service, working for airlines on tight schedules cannot use empty bus lines going to the airport.  They are dealing with prominent business people coming here with the major international companies.  Nine of the ten largest companies in the world are here, including Google, and they require speedy access to business meetings with Ministers, the Government and business contacts.</p><p>After the Minister makes his point, I will present the document to him but I do not have time to outline all of the points today.  In summary, the Minister is a progressive Minister, which everybody accepts.  When the late Seamus Brennan was Minister, he was on the verge of granting the concession to paid-up members who paid the full fees.  In this modern Ireland, they should be granted this concession to drive in bus lanes when appropriate.  They would not necessarily use them on every occasion but when required and it is an option they should have at their disposal.</p><p>I would like the Minister to take up the case.  He has other issues on his desk, including Aer Lingus, and while this may not be a priority it is a priority for members who came here to listen to the words of the Minister.  We hope they will get some encouragement in this regard.</p><p>There are no objections from other organisations in this regard.  This is a niche market providing great employment opportunities and those involved are great ambassadors in my experience.  I was driven by two of the members from the airport when going out and coming back to Taiwan and their manner was positive as far as Ireland is concerned.  In this regard, I would appreciated the Minister considering their case for using bus lanes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-01a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015040100002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator Terry Leyden for raising this matter.  I am pleased to come to the Chamber to respond and I acknowledge representatives of the industry in the Visitors Gallery.  I see Senator Terry Brennan also has guests in the Visitors Gallery.  They are all welcome.</p> <p>The legislation governing the usage of bus lanes is set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, as amended.  Under this legislation, buses and bicycles are allowed to avail of bus lanes, as are taxis in the case of with-flow bus lanes only.  The rationale for introducing this legislation, and for creating the bus lane network itself, was to provide on-street priority for bus-based public transport.  The intention is to make bus services both faster and more reliable, thereby attracting more people out of private cars and onto public transport.  This, in turn, helps to reduce both congestion and pollution.  The construction of the bus lane network was done at some expense and inconvenience to the public in order to enable this to happen.</p> <p>Cyclists are permitted to use bus lanes because they are inherently vulnerable road users, and would be safer in bus lanes than in general traffic.  Initially, taxis were not allowed into bus lanes.  It was only some time after the introduction of the lanes that it was agreed to allow taxis to use them.  This was done only after much consideration, and was a concession based on the fact that taxis are available for on-street hire.  Limousines, of course, are not.  Vehicles used by members of the emergency services - Garda, fire brigade and ambulance - in the course of their duties may also be driven in bus lanes, in order to prevent delay in reaching the scenes of emergencies and in getting people to hospital.</p> <p>Since the introduction of the bus lane network, my Department has received numerous requests to open bus lanes to other classes of road user.  These have included requests relating to motorcycles, hackneys, and multi-occupancy cars.  The issue of access for limousines has also been raised from time to time over the years.  In all cases, my predecessors and I have taken the view that extending the use of bus lanes to other categories of vehicle would undermine the original purpose of these laws.  The overriding concern in considering these applications is the carrying capacity of bus lanes.  We do not want their primary role of providing bus priority to be undermined by allowing other vehicles access.</p> <p>As a result, my predecessors and I have chosen to maintain the current restrictions on use of bus lanes.  While in some cases the numbers of vehicles involved might not be large, conceding access to bus lanes to any new class of vehicles would make it difficult to argue against doing so for any other.  In light of the original reasons for creating bus lanes, and the sound reasons for rejecting previous applications, I remain of the view that there is no ground for changing the law to allow limousines into bus lanes.</p> <p>Senator Leyden made the point that other organisations do not have an issue with this.  I imagine they would be quite supportive of it happening because once any new class of vehicle comes in, it sets a precedent for arguing that more vehicles should be included.  In the near future, I hope to see the number of buses in our country increase and that will mean even more demand for use of the bus lanes, which in turn makes it more difficult to allow other vehicles in.</p> <p>The Senator has some documentation and information on the matter he has raised and I am happy to take that from him on the completion of this debate.</p></speech>

As a former Minister of State, I know the Minister has set a certain precedent and he has not had the opportunity to study this in detail.  I hope he does so in due course.  Chauffeur driven cars will not stop in a bus lane, unlike taxis that may pick up passengers.  Chauffeurs go straight through with no delay and they add a certain prestige to the whole process of promoting Ireland.  Many other issues are involved and we have prestigious business people coming in.  In addition, Emirates Airlines and others are using chauffeur driven cars in Dublin.  They are providing much employment.</p> <p>From a transport and other points of view, this does not require new legislation but a ministerial order.  Perhaps we could do this as a test run and make the concession to chauffeur driven cars during certain busy periods of the year, such as summer months in a pilot scheme to see how it would operate in reality.  Would it affect traffic flow?  Not many cars are involved and it is not a case of liberalising the entire situation.  I will leave it open and will say nothing further because the Minister has a liberal approach to ministerial responsibility.  In due course and after consideration and meeting representatives, the Minister may look at this afresh.</p></speech>

The review identifies three potential options for Grid Link and four possible solutions for Grid West.  It is a draft document for public consultation and, as I said, there are three potential options for Grid Link, one of which the Senator regards as preferable.  The consultation process can facilitate that response.  EirGrid will continue its evaluation of the options with a view to making a submission to the independent expert panel.  It will be required to and will balance the wider economic, environmental and technical considerations and, most importantly, the views of industry, policy makers and the people to find the best outcomes.  On foot of its consideration of EirGrid's submission, the independent expert panel will submit a report to me which, to reassure the Senator, will be followed by a further round of public consultations.  There is evidence that EirGrid has much improved its engagement with communities and the public and in a recent report it recognised some shortcomings in that aspect of its work in recent years.  It has taken significant and commendable steps to address the issue.  I would be upset if individuals who engaged with it were not satisfied with the responses received or received inconsistent responses.  I would like that issue to be addressed and I am sure it will be.</p> <p>In terms of the exports initiative, I would not describe it as dead in the water or complete history, the term used by the Senator.  The project will not go ahead and I do not believe there is any prospect of a similar project going ahead in the near to mid-term but, looking to 2020 and beyond, there are possibilities and potential for the future.  Even if there is no potential for exports, we still need to continue to make progress and up our game in the renewables sector.  Onshore wind energy projects will be one aspect but not the only one.  The necessity to increase the use of renewables and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels will continue, but we should do so in a prudent way and only build infrastructure when it is necessary do so.  I agree with the Senator on that point and EirGrid has made an assessment of what is necessary.  Let us not build infrastructure unless it is absolutely required and let us have regard to the needs, wishes and views of communities.  Both imperatives are reflected in its recent report, for which it is to be commended.  This was reflected in my discussions with it in recent months.</p></speech>

Approximately 300 garda&iacute; have undertaken their training of 104 weeks in total with 32 weeks in Templemore.  I am alarmed as I am dealing with a couple of cases at the moment in which the Department of Social Protection is refusing these trainee garda&iacute; the family income supplement, FIS.  I believe the Department is in breach of three very clear statutory instruments that are long standing.  The chief superintendent of the college in Templemore has also been assisting trainee guards who are now employed by the Department of Justice and Equality, are paying tax and USC and are earning &euro;182 per week gross during their training.</p> <p>Many of these garda&iacute; genuinely cannot afford to feed their families because of the stance the Department of Social Protection is taking.  The Department's answer is that "student garda&iacute; are full-time students doing a B.A. in advanced policing and are not employees".  The FIS section has put that in bold in its response to me.  This is the fourth time I have written to them.  However, according to the Department of Justice and Equality, these garda&iacute; are employees of the Department of Justice and Equality and are completing their training to become fully-attested garda&iacute;.</p> <p>I know the Leader of the House is very familiar with this.  It is not an acceptable situation.  I have been corresponding with the Department for the guts of eight or ten weeks and have gotten nowhere and am asking for the Leader's assistance and that of other colleagues, particularly on the Government side, in raising this matter with the Minister for Social Protection.  It is a small number of garda&iacute;.  I have spoken to one garda with three young kids.  The bank has given him a mortgage holiday for the period of his training.  People are making a lot of sacrifice to become garda&iacute; and are certainly not doing it for financial gain.  I would have thought the State should give them some support.  This is an anomaly and the FIS section within the Department is taking a very hard line on it.  I ask the Leader's assisance in raising the matter with the Minister and getting it resolved quickly.</p> <p>As regards the Fennelly report and investigation into the resignation or retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, the cloak of the Bailey case has now been disposed of so there should be no impediment to the Taoiseach informing us as to whether he was recalled by Fennelly to answer queries about the original evidence he gave to the investigation.  I still do not understand why the Taoiseach will not himself now make a clear statement as to his role that evening and what he asked the former Secretary General to say to the former Garda Commissioner.  Did he overstep his own statutory powers by directing the former Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to effectively resign?  These are very serious issues and there is no reason the Taoiseach cannot answer these questions.  I know he does not want the report published before the general election and is just trying to kick it down the road.  I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il find it completely unacceptable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It would be appropriate for the Taoiseach to make a statement on this matter and to clear it up.  In that regard, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach would come to the House, make a statement and clarify whether he was recalled by Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly to answer queries on the original evidence and outline what he said to the Secretary General and the message he asked the Secretary General to relay to the former Garda Commissioner.  There is no legal impediment on the Taoiseach in addressing these matters.  All he is trying to do is hide behind this investigation.</p></speech>

This will come as a welcome boost to the Government's campaign to lobby the European Commission to ensure that the spending limits will be lifted to some extent.  I note the Fiscal Advisory Council's position that the current spending limits set by the EU are far more constraining than required due to the averaging out over the ten year period.  This is very welcome news.  I heard the chair of the Fiscal Advisory Council say this morning that he thinks there should be a positive reception at the EU for the Government's lobbying campaign, and the good news on that coincides with the figures published today on unemployment showing that unemployment has reduced to 10% for the first time since early 2009 and that 90,000 jobs have been created since the Government's action plan for jobs in 2012.  Many of us have asked the Leader for debates on job creation and unemployment.  We might have a debate on that again in due course because it is a good news story that needs to be highlighted.  We need to speak about it again, particularly after the Government's economic statement scheduled for the end of this month.</p> <p>I ask for a debate also on policing in light of the welcome announcement today by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has sanctioned the recruitment of 250 new recruits to the Garda.  I listened to Senator O'Brien speak on that but it is worth noting the welcome increase in Garda recruits.  There are 300 new recruits-----</p></speech>

The Minister is addressing the AGSI conference today but this is very positive.  It is welcome also to see the positive reporting, particularly in the wake of the murder trial last week and the excellent policing practice that goes on in this country.  At the domestic violence conference I spoke about earlier this week, there was also a recognition and acknowledgement of the excellent practices going on in some quarters in the Garda on policing of domestic violence.</p> <p>I remind colleagues that we have a Labour Private Members' motion tonight on integration with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  It commends the Minister for the work he has done to date with new communities and in particular highlighting last week's inaugural Polska &Eacute;ire Festival 2015, which was hugely successful.  There will be people from that in the Visitors Gallery so I hope colleagues will participate.</p></speech>

Carol Coulter and her team are providing an invaluable service to us.  One of the issues highlighted in the reports is the lack of specialised mental health services for children so I reiterate my call for a debate on children's mental health services.  We are seeing far too many reports published showing where we have failed.  I would like to have a debate in this House to allow us determine what can be done and how we can ensure that children will get the mental health services as they need them, not a long time after we have failed the system.</p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is one I had put down as a Commencement matter so I ask the Leader not to ask me to do that because it was ruled out of order.  It concerns the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which is stalled on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il since December 2013.  Today, 1 April, marks the launch by Inclusion Ireland and a coalition of disability groups of the Fool Me Once campaign to repeal the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  It is a 144 year old Victorian law that defines people with mental health difficulties as idiots, lunatics and of unsound mind.  The campaign has attracted 2,000 signatories to date and remains open for the rest of the week.</p> <p>With regard to some of the comments people made about the reason they feel so strongly about this, one parent stated, "As a parent of 3 children on the spectrum I&rsquo;m appalled at this bill.  It&rsquo;s outdated, inhumane and it needs to be scrapped immediately".  Another stated, "A change long overdue!  My son is not a 'lunatic'!  It's a 19th century law for people living in the 21st century".  Another signatory stated, "I have a sister who suffers with Down's Syndrome.  The idea that the law can refer to her as an Idiot or a Lunatic makes my blood boil!  This is disgusting and needs to be changed ASAP".  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, older people, equality and mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to come into the House to answer these questions.  Will the 2013 Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill be enacted before the general election?  Why has the Bill remained at Committee Stage for so long, and what is the likely timeframe for Ireland to incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into Irish law, which is long overdue?  Families are living with this archaic, Victorian law.  We need to progress this legislation and I ask the Leader to do everything in his power to ensure that happens.</p> <p>Finally, I would like to welcome Raheny Girl Guides to the Visitors Gallery.</p></speech>

That brings the total since September to 550, which is a very welcome development.  We all know the pressure on Garda numbers and this news is very much to be welcomed.  The Government recognises the pressures and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has committed to never closing Templemore College again, as was done by the previous Government.</p> <p>I note also that the Investec manufacturing PMI study out today also records strong improvement in March.  That is helped by a record high rate of employment and has led to a sharp increase in output, with strong new orders.  It is noted that operating conditions have improved in each of the past 22 months.  That strong manufacturing growth is supported by rising domestic and export business.</p> <p>It is clear that while many difficult decisions have been made, the results of those are now bearing fruit.  Our economy is expanding at a significant rate and our tax take is up.  That is allowing us to provide services such as increasing the number of Garda recruits.  The rising tide is not based on a property.  It is based on a more stable approach which is spread over a wide range of areas in the economy.</p> <p>I ask the Leader, in view of the forthcoming spring statement, to ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to come before the Seanad because it would be an opportune time to discuss the economy.  The spring statement will be an outline of the way our economy will grow on a sustainable basis in the years to come.</p></speech>

It is time Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly's interim report was published.  It would be useful to do that in the interests of everybody, including the Taoiseach.  I do not believe the rumours about the Taoiseach having shafted the then Garda Commissioner are useful.  Whether they are true or not, we need to get the facts of the matter and the people are entitled to it.  Announcements of additional garda&iacute; being recruited will not cover the fact that people yearn for that and are entitled to it.</p> <p>I would also like to ask for a debate on public sector pay.  The Government may have plans for a forum in this regard, and we look forward to participating in it, but many of the reductions in the public service in terms of pay and conditions in recent years were seen as temporary.  Now, as things are beginning to improve, it is only fair that the squeezed middle would be looked after in some way.  There is much celebration, particularly on the Labour Party benches, with regard to the 250 Garda recruits announced and the 300 completing their training in Templemore but all of those are being paid 35% less than the average industrial wage.  That is a possible subject for a motion at the Labour Party conference.  These people are our best and brightest.  Are they not entitled to the same rates of pay as their superiors and equals?  It is clear that some are more equal than others.  The same applies to teachers and nurses.  The cost of living has increased in many instances.  The cost of rents has certainly increased and we expect these people to work for 30% to 35% less than the average industrial wage.</p> <p>If there is an improvement in the national coffers, if unemployment levels are falling and things are so good that we have to have Private Members' motions this evening and every other evening commending the Minister of the day for their superior action on behalf of all of us, surely these people in the front line are entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  That is not the position, so I hope the Labour Party and Fine Gael can deal with this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marc MacSharry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Young garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and civil servants all over this country have been squeezed in the middle.  Now that they are seeing much debate and celebration by the Taoiseach and senior Government Ministers as to the State's perceived recovery, they are wondering when it will visit their door.  I think they are entitled to know.</p></speech>

We saw fantastic work being done before Christmas concerning the homeless in this city and other cities.  Today I am pleased to acknowledge and welcome the next phase of this work, which is tackling local authority housing waiting lists.  Through building, buying and leasing, the Government will spend &euro;1.5 billion which will reduce housing waiting lists by 25%.  In one action we will see a massive reduction in waiting lists.</p> <p>In my own county of Tipperary alone, we will see 832 new houses either built, leased or bought at a cost of &euro;57 million.  Some 832 families will have their own homes for the first time.  This is a massive development which I warmly welcome from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Not alone will this development provide houses, but it will also provide the stimulus that has been spoken about by all parties in this House for many years.  It will directly create jobs for builders and builders' providers - the breakfast roll men.  This is a good news story which should be welcomed across the House.</p></speech>

This is despite the fact that the Garda met with the Taoiseach in his constituency office prior to Christmas.  These are serious allegations.  I am reluctant to say this because I think the Taoiseach is a nice man personally, but it is quite obvious now that he is refusing to answer direct questions that are being put to him.  He is doing it on a regular basis with our own party leader, Deputy Martin, and he was at it again yesterday.  It was quite obvious from looking at the exchanges between the Taoiseach and Deputy Wallace that he did not even attempt to address the specific questions being put to him.</p> <p>We also have the Fennelly report.  Several months ago, I put on the record of this House information that had come to me that an early morning phone call was made to the former Garda Commissioner Callanan by the Secretary General of the Department under the direct instructions of the Taoiseach, which prompted his resignation.  These are also serious allegations that need to be teased out.  It is incumbent upon the Taoiseach to attend this, the Upper House of the Oireachtas.  It is not enough for him to hide behind his vast majority in the Lower House.  He should answer questions that will be put to him here.  </p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of variable mortgage interest rates, which our leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, raised here yesterday.  What is the point of the Government, which represents the State, owning 99% of one of the major pillar banks and 15% of the other pillar bank?  Yesterday, when our colleague Deputy Michael McGrath raised a motion on the variable mortgage rate issue, a junior Minister told the D&aacute;il that the Government had no role.  What are the directors doing there?  They are supposed to be there in the interests of the people of Ireland.  Even on a commercial basis, as directors in the State interest, they are holding a 15% equity in one bank and a 99% in another bank, but do they have any influence at all in the boardroom?  Are they just turning up for the tea and biscuits?</p></speech>

It is good news for the young people involved, as they will now get good jobs in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will also mean a lot for the security and policing of our State at difficult times.  In addition, it will bring the force up to that magical figure of 13,000.</p> <p>I also welcome the news that milk quotas will now be abolished, which will create up to an estimated 1,000 jobs.  Over the past 30 years, people have not had the chance to expand production because of milk quotas.  However, dairy farmers are currently making a huge investment in dairy programmes for the future.  The abolition of quotas will create more jobs and will provide an opportunity to export more output from our growing agri-food business.  All in all, therefore, it is good news for the agricultural sector.</p></speech>

Niall Molloy 30 years ago, on 8 July 1985.  He was our local curate in the Castlecoote Fuerty parish, so I knew him well personally.  It is a shame and a scandal that nobody has been found guilty of the manslaughter/murder of Fr. Molloy in Kilcoursey House, Clara, in 1985.  The current Government gave commitments to the family of Fr. Molloy, prior to the general election, that there would be a full sworn inquiry into the tragic death of Fr. Molloy, but this did not take place.</p> <p>The outcome of the report by Mr. Dominic McGinn SC states that there will be no further inquires into the controversial death of Fr. Molloy.  That is not acceptable to the families, however, who feel that justice should be done and be seen to be done.  </p> <p>I followed up this matter at the time and met Judge Frank Roe who was president of the Circuit Court.  The judge, who is now deceased, directed the jury not to find a particular person guilty of manslaughter, even though he himself was a personal friend.  A lot of issues arose-----</p></speech>

I suppose the question really is what are they there for?  We like to think they are there to defend the public interest, but is that the reality?  Or are they there basically as directors to defend the banks' balance sheets and, ultimately, the bottom line?  There is a little bit of schizophrenia going on here.  On the one hand, we want the banks to return to profitability so that they can repay us, the shareholders, the money we have pumped into them.  There is a real issue there that needs to be discussed.  Do we need to change the role of the directors of the banks in question?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aideen Hayden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would require a change in the legislation.  Interest rates is only one of the issues that needs to be raised with the Minister for Finance and debated.  The Taoiseach this morning called on the banks to pass on reductions in interest rates but again, that is a request as opposed to an instruction.  There is a real issue there for us as to what is the role of these directors and who are they there to serve.  If we want banks to pass on lower interest rates and if this is going to have an impact on the bottom line, are we prepared to say that we are willing to accept that when it comes to ultimately what amount of money is to be repaid to us and how quickly it will be repaid?  </p><p>I find it deeply frustrating when I think of the number of times I have stood up here to ask for a debate on banking but we have not as yet had that debate.  A number of issues could be debated, not least the issue of the banks, interest rates, mortgage arrears and the whole issue of the Central Bank caps and so forth.  This debate needs to happen.  I ask the Leader to please pursue that request with the Minister for Finance specifically and no one else.</p><p>I welcome the announcement this morning of the &euro;1.5 billion allocated to every local authority in the country, along with targets for the delivery of the social housing programme.  I am delighted to see an allocation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, my own local area, to cover nearly 700 housing units.  I join with calls from all sides of the House for a fuller and more robust debate on the issue of housing and the construction sector generally.</p></speech>

The first recruitment drive since 2009 began in 2013.  This is a welcome increase in Garda numbers because we need garda&iacute; and they need proper facilities and services as well as extra numbers.</p> <p>I wish to raise and call for a debate on the issue of jury service and those who are called to serve on juries.  In a recent case the jury served for more than four months.  Certain categories of people are excused from jury service, for example, Oireachtas staff, local authority staff, HSE staff, harbour authorities staff, doctors, dentists and chemists, over a range of occupations, but these are all State jobs as opposed to private sector jobs.  This has always been the practice.  Jurors are not paid for doing jury service.  However, not alone are people out of pocket but they may also have to pay for child care for many weeks and months.  I ask for a debate on this issue.  Some years ago the Law Reform Commission asked for a review of the voluntary aspect of jury service and whether expenses should be paid to jurors.  At least we should discuss the issue to see if this would be possible.  It is not fair on self-employed and those employed in the private sector.  People lose opportunities for job promotion while they are away on jury service for a lengthy period.  Jurors are chosen from the electoral register at random.  The Law Reform Commission suggested that the methodology of selection of jurors should include the electoral register for local and European elections in order to allow long-term residents of the State to participate in the jury system.  It is only fair that every resident would be entitled to be represented on juries.</p></speech>

This is brilliant news for many adults and children the length and breadth of the country who have been exposed to sustained and sometimes orchestrated campaigns of abuse online.  This issue has been allowed to fester because of the lack of clear legislation in this area.  The Commissioner's commitment is particularly important because, in my experience, social media companies have shirked their responsibilities entirely when it comes to providing a duty of care to their users.  This has been made abundantly clear to me in recent days because only last week I wrote to Twitter and Facebook as a result of the inordinate number of messages that I received from people who have been subjected to online abuse.  I have asked these social media companies to confirm how many complaints they have received, the length of time it has taken them to investigate these complaints and how many of these complaints have been referred by them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To date, they have failed, refused and-or neglected to provide me with this information.  Their reluctance to acknowledge any duty of care whatsoever to their users is quite baffling.  Despite the fact that they have the benefit of a favourable tax rate in this country, it is about time that they showed some corporate social responsibility and at the very least, responded to specific questions and quitted their powder puff PR spin.</p> <p>I commend the Garda Commissioner on taking action in attempting to bring some degree of decency back to online discourse.  I urge her to ensure that there is cross-Border co-operation between the policing forces to ensure that people can be brought to task for the kind of vile vitriolic messages that are being posted online and that these people face penalties and sanctions.  </p> <p>I ask the Leader to set aside time to discuss and debate this matter with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement that in Cork city and county over &euro;205 million has been allocated for the period 2015-17.  It is very welcome that an extra 2,500 houses or apartments will be built and made available.  However, I have concerns about the ability of local authorities to be able to respond to the funding.  My concern arises with regard to Cork City Council which was allocated over &euro;10 million last year for regeneration in the north-west area of Cork city but over &euro;5 million of that allocation was not used.  It is extremely important that in allocating this funding appropriate actions are taken to ensure that the funding is being spent appropriately and delivered on time.  There needs to be a mechanism between the Department and the local authorities so that if local authorities are not delivering that action, will be taken.  This allocation over three years is very welcome because allocation from year to year is no longer acceptable as it does not allow local authorities to undertake long-term planning.  However, the checks and balances need to be in place at an early stage.</p> <p>I wish to raise an issue which I have raised previously which is the cost of medical insurance for those practising medicine.  There is a concern that a number of people are retiring from practice because of the cost of medical insurance.  I met with the Medical Protection Society this morning on this matter which the society has been raising for more than a year.  For example, the cost of insurance for an orthopaedic consultant is over &euro;104,000 per annum.  This amounts to &euro;2,000 a week for professional indemnity insurance.  The capping levels need to be looked at.  If people are forced out of practising medicine in the private sector there will be more people looking for service in the public sector which does not have the staffing levels to deal with that increase in workload.  I ask the Leader that this matter be brought to the attention of the Minister and that appropriate action be taken by the Government in order to assist all those involved in medical practice so that the cost of medical indemnity insurance is lowered.  This needs to be done urgently.</p></speech>

Guidelines may be needed.  The State Claims Agency handles much of the litigation where the State is concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The agency is actually the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, operating under a different guise.  The NTMA reports directly to the Minister for Finance on the performance of its State Claims Agency functions.  I request a debate with the Minister on this matter and the need to put guidelines in place, particularly in the light of the experience of one family in County Kerry whose case was highlighted in the media recently.  The family's son was born at Kerry General Hospital in May 2006 and, tragically, suffered a severe brain injury at birth.  He has cerebral palsy and is completely dependent on others for all of his daily needs.  The family which recently reached an interim &euro;2.8 million settlement with the Health Service Executive, HSE, states the consultant who delivered their child met them shortly after his birth, apologised for what had happened and cried with them.  However, it was not until February that the HSE admitted liability.  The boy's mother said the attitude adopted by the HSE had caused huge stress to the family and resulted in a long legal battle.  In turn, the HSE indicated that the State Claims Agency, not it, made decisions on the legal approach taken in such cases.  It also stated it did not know why it had taken so long for a settlement to be reached and that it had a policy of open disclosure at the earliest opportunity whereby it would admit liability in cases of wrongdoing.</p><p>In many instances there is a clear tort leader which gives rise to liability on the part of a hospital.  In such cases the only legal issue to be determined is the extent of damages or the level of compensation to be awarded.  This can be done in an application to the High Court to measure damages where liability is not an issue.  Clear guidelines governing the manner in which the State Claims Agency approaches cases in which there is clear liability and this has been acknowledged by the HSE and the hospitals involved must be put in place.  The HSE and hospitals should not be allowed to withhold an admission of liability as a negotiating tactic in circumstances where there is an implicit threat to the family.  It should not be a case of people being told, "Accept our offer of damages or risk a court case".  It is unseemly for a State agency to treat families in the manner I have outlined, particularly where there is the option of using the relatively non-adversarial procedure of asking the High Court to measure damages.  In many cases families seek only an apology and funds to allow them to offer long-term care to their disabled children.  Such families should not be put through the wringer by any State agency.  It is clear that guidelines are necessary.  I would appreciate it if we could engage in a debate with the Minister on this specific issue.</p></speech>

This development will allow many jobs to be created throughout the country, not just in particular areas.  Ongoing and valid criticism to the effect that employment was limited to certain locations in the past has been levelled at the Government and those which preceded it.  Jobs will be created in every parish and county throughout the land.</p> <p>Another issue I want to raise relates to the allocation of &euro;1.5 billion in funding for the provision of social housing.  It is about time such funding was provided.  I am not going to criticise what happened in the past, particularly as money was not available.  However, money is being made available now.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to come to the House to explain how the funding is being allocated?  I have just examined the numbers and wish to make it clear that I am not very pleased.  I could only scratch my head when I discovered that certain counties or constituencies were receiving half of what was being given to counties and constituencies with similar populations.  I have been very critical of the way Fianna F&aacute;il did business when it was in government.  The way in which that party did business was that a Minister would look after those in his or her neck of the woods and everybody else could just shag off.  The current Government comprises Fine Gael and the Labour Party and that is not the way we do business.  However, what is happening in the allocations to which I refer seems to indicate that we are, in fact, doing it in that way.  Members will note from my tone that I am very displeased.  I will inform the House why that is the case.  Under the allocations that have been announced, County Wexford where I live will receive &euro;25 million, while County Tipperary where the Minister resides will receive &euro;57 million.  I would like the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to come to the House at the first available opportunity to explain the numbers to me.  What is being done in the context of the numbers smacks of the way in which Fianna F&aacute;il used to do business.</p></speech>

That said, however, I seek a debate on housing, particularly in the context of what Senator Colm Burke said about expenditure.  The funding to which Senator Michael D'Arcy and I refer is being allocated for new builds, long-term leasing arrangements and the purchasing of houses.  I am confident that the CEO and director of services of Kerry County Council will ensure the money which has been allocated will be spent prudently.  However, I still believe there is a need for a debate on the issue.</p> <p>On many occasions I have raised the issue of staff levels at Muckross House.  I am glad to announce that funding has been made available for the recruitment of eight new guides.  I take the opportunity to thank the Leader and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, for their interventions.

However, there are questions to be answered.  The project to link Dunnstown, County Kildare with County Wexford which was supposed to cost &euro;500 million.  Now, however, Californian and Russian involvement means that it will cost half that amount.  I am seeking a debate after Easter with the relevant Minister on EirGrid's new findings, the north west and Dunnstown to Cork lines, the plans envisaged and the public consultation process that will take place.

I am sure the justice committee will also take up the matter. </p> <p>Senator Lorraine O'Higgins welcomed the statement of the Garda Commissioner on the intimation of garda&iacute; and members of the public on social media.  I agree that social media outlets have a duty of care to their users and will ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, to come to the House to debate the matter.  </p> <p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned the allocation of &euro;205 million for more than 2,500 housing units in Cork.  I agree with him that appropriate measures should be taken to ensure these units will be delivered on time.  I am sure the Minister and his Department will be pushing the local authorities to ensure this happens.  </p> <p>The Senator also raised the matter of the cost of insurance for professionals in the medical sector, a matter he has sought to raise with the Minister on several occasions.  I will renew my representations to the Minister on the matter. </p> <p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen spoke about the State Claims Agency and the admission of liability.  The Minister for Health has commented on this issue and I am sure he is aware of the Senator's comments on the admission of liability which have been broadcast on several occasions in the newspapers and elsewhere</p> <p>In addition to speaking about milk quotas, Senator Michael D'Arcy expressed disappointment at the allocation for the provision of housing in his county.  Each local authority was asked to bring forward specific building projects up to 2017.  As part of that strategy, targets had to be agreed with each local authority in 2015.  I am sure the allocation lies somewhere between what a local authority had sought and what it agreed to.  The Dublin local authorities will be set housing targets by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government over and above what they proposed to ensure strong delivery where the need is greatest.  The combined total up to 2017 for the Dublin local authorities comes to more than &euro;500 million.  Approximately 300 separate building proposals are being assessed by the Department and projects will be announced in a number of phases starting in mid-April.  Construction work is under way on social housing projects on approximately 33 sites throughout the country.  It will continue apace in the next two to three years.  </p> <p>Senator Tom Sheahan mentioned that &euro;62 million had been allocated in housing grants in County Kerry.  He also welcomed the funding being put in place for the recruitment of eight new guides at Muckross House, something he had been for quite some time.  I am sure it will be welcomed by the people of County Kerry.  </p> <p>Senator Darragh O'Brien welcomed the announcement by EirGrid.  The matter was raised on the Order of Business yesterday.  It was also raised as a Commencement Matter in the House this morning by Senator Denis Landy.  The Senator might look at what the Minister had to say during that debate.</p></speech>

We disagreed strongly on what the amendment was seeking to do and on our view of what would be reasonable in terms of a notice that employers would be obliged to provide for employees in the workplace in respect of employment rights. </p><p>The amendment provides that each employer shall display in a prominent position in a place of work a notice or notices in a form, manner and in an appropriate language or more than one language that is reasonably likely to be understood by the employees concerned.  This notice would contain information either generally or by reference to particular enactments or a particular class or particular classes of enactments or to employees of one or more than one particular class or description.  It would also contain information about complaints procedures concerning entitlements under employment legislation and the contact details of the workplace relations service.  This would refer to the various different Acts under which employees are protected, the contact details for the workplace commission service and the procedure for making a complaint.  It would make people aware of the various Acts under which their rights are covered and what they need to do in terms of accessing the workplace relations commission.  Not every worker is in a union, as the Minister knows.</p><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recommended the provision of an obligation to display a notice of basic employment and equality rights information.  If the Minister is not minded to accept this amendment, would it be possible for the workplace relations commission to examine what is possible and feasible?  This could be one of its jobs of work.  It could examine ensuring that employers provide basic information to employees.  I imagine the Minister wants this commission to work properly.  This is about streamlining the system and making it more efficient in terms of employment rights for both employers and employees.  I imagine the Minister wants people to use the service and to be aware of it in order to avail of it.  In very simple terms, if we make this service available to people, it is only to the good of the Government which is proposing this commission.  </p><p>Notwithstanding any concerns the Minister might have about this amendment, will the Minister reflect on the broader point and update the House on what he considers reasonable in terms of the responsibility an employer would have to provide information to employees in respect of this new commission?  This is the purpose of the amendment.  A new entity is being set up.  There should therefore be an obligation on employers to ensure that employees have access to it, know about it and that the contact numbers are in their places of work if they need to avail of the service.</p></speech>

The last time we discussed this in the House, the Minister was somewhat concerned about the amount of information that would need to be on the notice and how those notices would find their way through the entire workforce.  In my previous life as a trade unionist, I found that lack of information frequently led to more workplace disputes and the escalation of workplace disputes throughout the country.  The Minister referred to the amount of detail that would need to be on any such information posters the last time we were here.  It could be very simple.  It could be as simple as a telephone number and a website address.  It should be mandatory in every workplace.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

When someone commences employment, he or she should be handed a copy of the poster in miniature form in order that unnecessary workplace disputes will not arise in the future.  A provision in this regard would be a welcome addition to the Bill.  Bringing together the various strands is a great idea and I am of the view that what I am suggesting would represent the icing on the cake for workers.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-04-01a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015040100002#BB00200"><p>I thank Senators for the constructive spirit in which they have presented this amendment.  Section 11(1)(a) states that one of the core functions of the workplace relations commission will be to "promote the improvement of workplace relations, and maintenance of good workplace relations", while section 11(1)(h) states that the commission shall "provide information to members of the public in relation to employment enactments".  Essentially, the job of the commission will be to maintain good relations and to provide information to which people will have access.  The difficulty I have with Senator Cullinane's amendment is that the legal obligations of an employer emanate from the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, which sets out what an employer is obliged to provide to each employee in a written statement of terms and conditions and so on.  As already stated, when one enters the realm of putting in place an obligation to provide information on 30 items of legislation, one goes beyond what is reasonable both in terms of being absolutely bang up to date with the development of terms and conditions and also the obligation to provide such information.</p> <p>The Senators make the point that the commission should examine how it will ensure that information will be accessible in the workplace.  While I cannot commit the commission to a course of action in advance, it is clear from its terms of reference, particularly those set down at sections 11(1)(a) and (h), that this is the sort of area in respect of which it could become involved.  I have no difficulty with the principle outlined by both Senators.  What we are trying to do is make compliance the norm among employers and ensure that workers will be knowledgeable about what they have a right to expect, etc.  That is the culture of what will be involved.  However, taking the next step and imposing very explicit legal obligations regarding the provision of information in respect of the myriad legislation to which I refer - I must admit that I have difficulty recalling all of the Acts involved - would be to go beyond the bounds of what constitutes reasonable expectation.  I will convey the Senators' views to the new commission in the spirit in which they were offered.</p></speech>

I will not delay proceedings because there are many other amendments with which we must deal.  The amendments in this group make provision for the necessary monitoring and compliance mechanisms in anticipation of the industrial relations (amendment) Bill, which is yet to be introduced and which will provide the legal framework for the reinstitution of registered employment agreements, REAs, and registered employment orders, REOs.  The amendments contain provisions that would allow access to workplaces for designated union officials and the right for employees to be represented by trade unions.</p><p>The amendments also seek to ensure compliance.  The Minister referred to compliance in his final contribution in respect of amendment No. 27.  One of the things I would like to emerge as a result of the enactment of the legislation and the establishment of the new workplace relations commission is a much higher level of compliance.  The vast majority of employers in this State are decent and good and they treat their workers well.</p></speech>

Those individuals or companies do a disservice to their counterparts who are decent and good.  Compliance is extremely important.  One can have all the legislation in the world but if it this not enforced and if there is not compliance with it, difficulties will arise.  The penalties and sanctions for those who deliberately breach employment law must be robust.</p> <p>I had a discussion in respect of the subject matter of this Bill with an individual who worked as a trade union official for 40 years.  He informed me that on numerous occasions he had cause to bring certain unscrupulous employers before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the rights commissioners and so on in respect of instances where they deliberately refused to pay their employees that to which they were entitled.  He indicated that when these employers were brought before the employment rights bodies, they were informed that they had to pay because the money involved was owed to the relevant workers.  No penalties were imposed on them, despite the fact that they deliberately held back payment of peoples' wages.  If one walks into a shop and removes groceries or other goods without paying, one cannot merely hand them back and apologise.  Sanctions and penalties will be imposed.  Compliance and enforcement are extremely important.  Part of the logic behind amendment No. 29 is to try to strengthen the position in the context of REAs and REOs.  Decent employers have nothing to fear in the context of compliance or enforcement.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of employers will work with the workplace relations commission in a very constructive manner.  That can only be for the common good.</p> <p>The amendments in this group are consistent with those we tabled on Committee Stage.  We were hoping the Minister might give further consideration to the matters to which they relate and we look forward to his response.</p></speech>

In that context, the Bill is lacking to a certain degree in that it does not contain any recognition of the special place trade unions should occupy.  We are moving towards the American ideal whereby workplace committees are replacing registered trade unions, which is regrettable.  The trade union movement has played a great role in the development of this country and has assisted many companies in their efforts.  I am of the view that the type of responsible trade unions we have here can help the country work a great deal better.  Companies frequently come here, establish operations and set up workplace committees and then erode employees' terms and conditions over a period.  I support these amendments, particularly Nos. 30 and 31.</p></speech>

As a result, neither worker nor employer knew where their obligations lay.  This did not assist in the context of compliance.  There were also problems in the areas of enforcement and recovery.  I have sought to bring forward a balanced set of amendments to improve the process and make it more effective to operate.  I have also sought to improve the position with regard to recovery whereby if people fail to honour their obligations, it will be easier for workers to pursue them and recover any moneys due.  That is the overall purpose of the Bill.  A higher level of compliance is the goal.  In any modern workplace, the human resource is the key resource of any company.  Where employers to do not respect their employees and treat them with dignity, they fail themselves and they treat those to whom I refer in a bad way.  We are trying to promote the highest standard of workplace relations.  In my view, the latter is crucial to our long-term ambition to grow the economy, bring about full employment and so on.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to the central role trade unions have played for many years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to recognise that our approach has always been voluntarist and that has been at its core.  The success of bodies such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court has been in the way in which they have been able to manage difficult situations.  Often even the most intractable dispute has through that process reached a conclusion.  It has served us well and we seek to remain within that voluntarist tradition.</p><p>The sections of the Bill we are dealing with here relate to the appointment of inspectors and their powers.  Senator Cullinane himself recognises that his amendment is going a bit beyond these sections in that he seeks to anticipate legislation that we will introduce in due course.  That legislation is in preparation and we will, I hope, bring it to the House soon.  The debate on that legislation should be for that day. </p></speech>

We may table those amendments to it if it does not deal with the issues.</p> <p>A voluntarist model of collective bargaining or trade union recognition is always very attractive but the difficulty is that some companies do not accept, or recognise and will not work or engage with trade unions.  One such employer, as we know, will find itself in difficulty tomorrow when there will be industrial action involving low-paid workers at Dunnes Stores.  It is much better for workers who are members of a trade union, who pay union dues, to have a right to be represented by that trade union because they are paying into a service where somebody with expertise, skills and an understanding of how the employment rights system works is there to represent them.  The employers who will not recognise trade unions have an array of resources, barristers and qualified people to advise them.  The worker on the shop floor in a low-paid job, which can be very difficult, should be entitled to be represented by a trade union.  No decent employer will have a difficulty with that.  Only those who want to treat their workers unfairly have a difficulty recognising trade unions.  I know there is collective bargaining legislation in the offing too.  I hope the Minister will bring it forward before the Government dissolves at some point in the next 12 months.  I hope it does not slip through the cracks.  The reference to allowing trade union officials access to represent the workers is one that I will push because it is vitally important.</p> <p>I fully support the streamlining and the new effective way of dealing with employment rights because it is good for employers and employees.  Employers should have a legal responsibility to recognise trade unions and allow their workers access to their trade union officials.  I feel strongly about that despite what some might see as the attractiveness of the voluntarist model.</p></speech>

It is at a very advanced stage.  It will deal with cases where employers who refuse to recognise trade unions and fail to offer reasonable terms and conditions comparable with other areas, and will make it possible for trade unions to go to the Labour Court to get an adjudication that could become legally binding upon the employer.  This will provide a way in which trade unions representing workers can pursue a case of that nature and get a binding determination.  That legislation will come before the House and we can debate it then.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me, however, not to support what Senator Cullinane has said about the Dunnes Stores industrial relations, which is appalling and is the opposite of what this Bill is trying to achieve.  It is archaic and backward.  I am shocked that a company of that size would treat its employees in this awful way with short-term or low-pay contracts.</p></speech>

This is to give some protection to businesses to ensure they have a record of what documents have been taken.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are particularly vulnerable if certain documents are taken.  If a business has a record of what documents are taken that will help in future legal proceedings.  This amendment is to bring in some safeguards for businesses particularly SMEs.  If an inspector is able to take documents away he has to be able to leave a record of what he has taken away with that business.  It seems quite logical and I got the impression that it was likely to be accepted when we discussed this on Committee Stage. </p></speech>

Senator Quinn is speaking from the employer&rsquo;s side and I speak from the trade union side but I agree totally with what he has said.  I have seen case after case become complex because documentation was missing or lost.  I have seen one side accuse the other, saying it did or did not produce the documents and at the end of cases documents were not available.  It is a very reasonable amendment.</p> <p>It will not substantially change the Bill but it will provide some degree of security for employers who may be reluctant to hand over full documentation at the start of a case.  I listened to what the Minister said on the last Stage but I am still on Senator Quinn&rsquo;s side on this issue.  Both ends of the spectrum support this amendment, all that is needed is for the Minister, who is in the middle, to accept it.  Senator Barrett, who is also in the middle, supports it too.  I do not think it will do any harm to include this amendment.</p></speech>

I have done that and I am informed that it is currently the standard practice of NERA to issue a receipt in circumstances where it is necessary to remove original documents either for copying or for use in the course of the inspection or court proceedings.  It is also NERA&rsquo;s standard practice to return the originals as soon as it has finished with these records.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If for some reason NERA wishes to retain the original records it will give copies to the business on request.  It does not issue receipts for copies of records given to it by an employer where it retains the originals.  I am informed that there has never been any issue raised by employers regarding the manner in which NERA currently deals with this matter.  </p><p>As I said on Committee Stage, the power given to an inspector by section 27(1)(c) to remove any such books and detain them for such period as he or she reasonably considers to be necessary for the purposes of his or her functions under the Act is an appropriate, necessary and proportionate power.  I envisage that it will ordinarily be used only in cases of suspected fraud.  There is nothing in section 27 which prohibits an employer from whom records are being temporarily removed from requesting an inspector to allow him or her to take copies of such records before they are removed by the inspector.  It is intended that the practices in this regard, which have been successfully operated by NERA since its establishment, will also be adopted by its successor to the WRC compliance service following the enactment of this Bill.  Therefore, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to put these procedures on a statutory footing.</p></speech>

To extend liability for the debts of an insolvent company to the officers of the company would, I am advised by the Attorney General, be constitutionally suspect and would represent a major departure in company law.</p> <p>The overriding principle of company law is that a director's duties are owed to the company and not to individual shareholders or employees.  If there is a breach of duty on their part which causes damage to the company they can be sued and held liable for damages.  Claims can be brought by shareholders, a financial institution or on a director versus director basis.  Liability may arise out of the lack of care and skill in the performance of the duties, such as negligent advice or misstatement.  Any act which goes beyond the limits of the company's constitution, such as excessive borrowing, unauthorised payments, a failure to disclose the full extent of the director's interests or a failure to comply with requirements, may involve a director or officer in a personal liability.  </p> <p>Company law penalties vary from restrictions to disqualification orders to fines or periods of imprisonment.  The new companies Acts provide for a four-tier categorisation for most of the offences with the exception of fraudulent trading or market abuse.  The Companies Acts also contain a new provision whereby a judge, following a conviction for an offence under the companies Acts, may order that they remedy any breach of the Companies Acts in respect of which they were convicted.  In effect, the provision in the Companies Acts is a more constitutionally robust rewording of section 383 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 100 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</p> <p>From a company law perspective, the proposed amendment challenges the entire principle of company law.  If it were to be implemented then the doctrine of separate legal personality would become an exception rather than the rule.

Can the Minister tell us why there are so many Government amendments?  He must accept that it does not represent good practice.

One has to ensure the original legislation is correctly amended to reflect the new process.  That involves going back over swathes of legislation to ensure everything is correct.  In all cases the amendments are technical and tidy up legislation but the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel tries to ensure the legislation carries no risk of ambiguity.  Scrubbing the text goes on throughout the process.  I accept that it is a bit frustrating but all I can do is assure the Senator that they are not substantive amendments.  If the amendments made any change of which the Seanad needed to be aware we would alert Members accordingly.</p> <p>The Senator will be able to imagine the geometry of the legislation where 30 pieces of legislation have 40 sections each.  We then change parent legislation and that causes a domino effect, so the Senator will imagine the multiplication of work involved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I understand fully what Senator Cullinane is saying, from my point of view it is better to get all these technical things done right and done now than to come back and be obliged to start the process again.</p></speech>

For this reason, the Senator's proposed amendment is inappropriate, as it is inconsistent with the section taken as a whole.  Essentially, the issue here is that agencies share information where there are suspected criminal offences.  However, there also is a balance to be struck in respect of confidentiality and privacy of people's dealings with individual agencies.  Consequently, if no suspected offence is being pursued, there is no automatic right or expectation of sharing.  This provision seeks to strike a balance in order that anyone pursuing an offence absolutely has a right to get access to this information but other than that, people have a right to expect a degree of confidentiality and privacy in their dealings.  That is the balance that is being struck here.</p></speech>

As I will not be pushing it to a vote, it is okay.  This amendment pertains to enforcement of the national minimum wage.  The question of whether it is increased or decreased will now be an issue for the low pay commission, which is a different story.  However, this amendment seeks to increase the minimum fine from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000 for non-compliance.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this amendment will deal with vexatious employers who will seek to delay compliance and this reverts to the issue of compliance about which I spoke earlier.  In Britain, new legislation has been introduced that provides for fines of up to &pound;20,000 for non-compliance or non-payment of the national minimum wage.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not advocate a penalty of that size and believes it is being reasonable in this regard.  Moreover, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions also has asked for consideration to be given to increasing the fine from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000 to act as a sufficient deterrent to employers who may not pay the minimum wage.  If there are increases in the minimum wage, the Senator may have concerns that some companies may not be able to afford to pay them.  Again, I imagine the Minister or the low pay commission will deal with this issue.  There are mechanisms in place for employers who genuinely cannot pay any increase in the national minimum wage not to so do.  As there is an inability-to-pay element to all of that, I do not believe it should be a real concern.  As for those who can pay, if they can do so they will pay and no major issue arises.  However, this amendment is about those who can afford to pay but do not, which is a different story.  The proposal is to increase the penalty from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.</p></speech>

This provision is dealing with fixed payment notices and the penalty for such fixed payment notices.  Essentially, they are minor offences and these are fixed charges that are issued without proceedings and they concern only limited offences.  One is a requirement on the employer to consult with employees' representatives in respect of collective redundancies, another is to provide an employee with a payslip and a third is to provide a written statement of the hourly rate of pay.  Penalties of this nature can be set by way of a fixed charge without a substantive case.  It is a limited category and is not the broad category to which the Senator refers.  Obviously, were one to opt for higher penalties in this regard, there would be a conflict between the fixed charge without a process, the seriousness of offences and the scale of the penalty.  These are minor offences with minor charges, which are appropriate to a fixed notice procedure.  I do not propose that the fixed notice procedure would apply in cases like failure to pay the minimum wage, which of course would be a criminal offence.  There may be something of a misunderstanding in the Senator's amendment here.  These are very limited cases for which I am providing in this regard and I do not believe the doubling of the penalty as suggested would be appropriate.</p></speech>

It is implicit that the consent of both parties is a prerequisite to all forms of mediation and case resolution.  The Senator's proposed amendment therefore is superfluous in this regard and inappropriate, in so far as it focuses only on the claimant.  Essentially, mediation is a voluntary process and the mediator is a professional person who seeks to use whatever ways he or she can to reach an agreement.  At any point, however, both sides can withdraw and consequently, to try to be too prescriptive of the approach would not be helpful to the successful execution of the mediation.  Therefore, I do not believe it is appropriate to make this amendment.</p></speech>

This amendment seeks to introduce a new subsection to section 39, which would provide that a case resolution officer could direct either or both parties in the dispute or complaint that is the subject of mediation to produce documentation and evidence to the other party upon which that party intends to rely in respect of their respective cases.  As I stated earlier, mediation is a voluntary process from which either party can withdraw at any stage in favour of pursuing the adjudication option.  Giving a case resolution officer the power to direct the parties to produce information would undermine the voluntary nature of the mediation process.  The Senator's proposal to include a new section 39(9) is inappropriate, as what is proposed confuses the case resolution and adjudication function.  The point being made is that in adjudication, it is clear that there should be production of documentation that people can see and so on but where one is mediating between the two sides, using mediation as a form of discovery would not be appropriate.  It is not the environment in which mediation is being considered.  It is where two sides are seeking to find a resolution without going to the ultimate adjudication.  The view is that this provision would not be helpful to a successful implementation of mediation.</p></speech>

The training programme covered areas such as employment equality and industrial relations law as well as administrative law and human rights law, how to conduct an inquisitorial hearing and how to write comprehensive and reasoned decisions.  The training programme has concluded and all the participants have undertaken an examination and assessment.  Only those who successfully pass that assessment will be formally appointed as WRC adjudicators and assigned cases.</p> <p>That deals with the concern raised by the Senator.  All applicants have been through a rigorous training process.</p></speech>

The 2012 Act is a unique employment law in that there are three actors involved: the employee who is the agency worker; the employer who is the agency and the hirer which is the entity for which the agency worker carries out the work.  The 2012 Act clearly distinguishes those sections of the Act where an employee can take a case against the employer from those sections of the Act where an employee can take the case against the hirer.  As the purpose of the Workplace Relations Bill is to streamline structure and processes rather than to make any substantive changes in the employment rights legislation, it is important that section 42 of the Bill, which deals with the presentation of complaints, clearly reflects this distinction.  The amendments being made in section 42 do not change the broad scheme of section 42 as it relates to the temporary agency workers Act.  It remains the case that those provisions of the temporary agency workers Act which can be subject of a claim against an employer included in Schedule 5 of the Bill.  The amendment being made to subsection(1) clarifies that the provisions listed in that Schedule are those where a complaint can be made that an employee's employer has contravened any of the proposed provisions in Schedule 5.  The previous text did not specify against whom a complaint could be made, simply stating that an employee or a specified person could present a case or complaint to the director general that a provision in Schedule 5 had been contravened in relation to the complainant.  This ambiguity is now being clarified.  Instances where a complaint under the temporary agency workers Act can be made against the hirer are dealt with in Paragraph 3A and there is no change in this regard as no clarification was deemed necessary.</p> <p>This distinction between hirer and employer has to be reflected accurately in the making of a complaint to clarify that in certain cases it is the hirer who is responsible and not the employer.</p></speech>

Section 42 does not apply directly to employment equality and equal status cases but rather sections 84 and 85 amend the Equality Acts and Equal Status Acts and make them consistent with the provisions of section 42.  There is no merit in requiring a separate hearing of equality cases from the other employment matters which may be in dispute between an employer and an employee.  If there was an employment and equality aspect to a case, this could lead to four separate hearings of the same case with the same facts, two at first instance and two at appeal.  There is no justification for this and it would add unnecessary cost to the employer, employee and the State.  The Senator's proposal runs contrary to what the Bill is trying to achieve by providing a fast and effective independent streamlined adjudication service.  Therefore, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It reflects the drafter's proposed reconfiguration of the Schedules.  Senators Norris and Craughwell queried why trade unions had been singled out for mention in section 42(3)(a) of the Bill.  This section 42(3)(a) provides for the presentation of complaints by an agency worker or any trade union of which the agency worker is a member, that a hirer within the meaning of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) 2012 has contravened sections 11, 24 or 14 of the Act.  The language used mirrors the wording of Paragraph 11B of Schedule 2 of the temporary agency workers Act which sets out the redress provisions under the 2012 Act.  I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that this wording is not in fact unique to the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act.  Many pieces of employment rights legislation use the same wording which provides that unions can present a complaint on behalf of an employee.  These include the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act.  The wording in each piece of employment rights legislation is the product of careful consideration of the nuances around each piece of legislation and consultation with stakeholders.  Section 42(3)(a) simply reflects the wording of Paragraph 11B of the said Act.  This is how it should be and the Workplace Relations Bill is not the appropriate place to make substantive changes.  There was a concern that there were different treatments in different Acts but that is the nature of the originating Act which makes different provisions which we do not wish to disturb.</p></speech>

I have carefully considered this issue and thoroughly explored the matter with officials in my Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not satisfied that an amendment to this effect is warranted for a number of reasons.  The system that will apply following the establishment of the workplace relations commission provides for mediation to be offered if, in the opinion of the director general of the workplace relations commission, the complaint or dispute is capable of being resolved without being referred to an adjudication officer.  Only cases where mediation is not offered or is unsuccessful will proceed to adjudication.  This amendment would allow an adjudication officer to refer a case back to a mediation officer for mediation following referral of the case by the director general for adjudication.  </p><p>The philosophy underpinning the new workplace relations system is that issues should be resolved as informally as possible as soon as possible.  To this end, the system is designed to provide information in order that, where possible, issues can be resolved at the level of the employment without ever being referred to the workplace relations commission.  Where this is not possible, a complaint can be made to the commission.  Where parties indicate an interest in mediation delivered by the early resolution service or face-to-face mediation, such an intervention will be offered, subject to capacity constraints.  Where the issue is not resolved or the parties are not interested in mediation, the case will move to adjudication for a decision.  The role of the adjudicator will not be to broker a settlement but to consider the case made by both sides, apply the relevant law and come to a decision.</p><p>The proposed amendment would fundamentally alter the role of the adjudicator as envisaged in the new system.  Mediation is already provided for at an early stage in the new system.  To refer the dispute formally back to mediation would add time and cost to the entire process, possibly making the process twice as expensive for the State.  One would have the costs of the first adjudication, the costs of mediation where the case is referred back and the costs of a second adjudication if the mediation is not successful.  Both parties have the option of engaging in mediation before the adjudication and both have the option of reaching agreement and withdrawing the case before it goes to adjudication.  Both parties also have the option of reaching an agreement and withdrawing the case during the adjudication hearing.  In practice, an adjudicator would adjourn for a short period to facilitate this option if exercised.  Introducing a second chance of mediation would reduce the incentive to reach an agreement at the initial mediation stage and lead to inefficiency in the system, increased costs and knock-on delays for other cases.</p><p>I assure the Senator that we gave much thought to whether this amendment was a good suggestion.  I hope the reflections I have outlined set out a reasonable case for sticking to the approach we have adopted, which I believe to be fair. </p></speech>

As drafted, the section allows the prosecution to prove all of the ingredients of the offence by way of statements in a document.  The prosecution would not be required to call witnesses and, consequently, the defence would not have an opportunity to cross-examine, which is a fundamental requirement in any proceedings for an offence.  As a result, section 47 is to be replaced by a modified version of this provision, which is proposed as an amendment to section 75 of the Bill.  The modified provision will result in a new subsection being inserted into section 21 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  The section created an offence of failure to appear before the Labour Court on foot of a summons to so appear.  As originally drafted, section 47 would have allowed the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence in question by way of statements in a document.  The prosecution would not be required to call witnesses and consequently the defence would not have an opportunity to cross-examine, which is fundamental to proceedings for an offence.</p></speech>
