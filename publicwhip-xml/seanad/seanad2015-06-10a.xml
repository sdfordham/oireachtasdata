The matter is self-explanatory - the need for the Minister to confirm that funding for the schools completion programme will not be cut in County Clare or any other county and to consider increasing the funding for this valuable service for children which was established in 2002.  The programme has had a significant positive impact on the retention levels of young people in primary and second level schools and the numbers of pupils who successfully complete the different cycles or their equivalent.</p> <p>Another of my concerns is the teams and their understanding of whether funding is to be cut and their role in the future.  As in the past, I rarely speak unless I know the people who are administering and delivering a service.  To give them their Christian names, I know &Aacute;ine and Catherine and the level of work they undertake to ensure vulnerable children - probably the best words to use - come to school every day and receive an education with the best possible support.  We must have people like them in the school completion service.  I am sure there are many others like them throughout the country who seek to ensure the service is delivered.  I am aware of two children who, as recently as last week, had to be helped and encouraged into school to start their examinations.  Nine times out of ten the staff go beyond the call of duty.  It is not always a nine to three job, as a great deal more work is involved.  We heard a comprehensive presentation recently in Ennis, but I already had an understanding of the type of work done, given that I deal with many schools.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills DEIS action plan.  It involves 124 projects and related initiatives operating in 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools.  These projects provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support approximately 36,000 children throughout the country who have been identified by local management committees as being at risk of educational disadvantage.  Typically, projects offer homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, social and personal development programmes, out-of-school supports, including music, art and sports, and a range of activities during holiday periods.  </p> <p>Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014 the agency allocated &euro;24.756 million and a similar allocation is being made for 2015.  There are two projects in County Clare - the Ennis school completion programme, with an allocation in the 2014-15 academic year of &euro;255,947, and the Kilrush school completion programme, with an allocation of &euro;119,978.  The Ennis project involves four primary and two post-primary schools, while the Kilrush project involves one primary and one post-primary school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The agency asked chairpersons of local management committees to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015-2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the agency by last Friday, 5 June.  Following receipt of these plans, all school completion projects including the two in County Clare will be notified of their allocations for the 2015-2016 school year.</p><p>The Senator may be aware that a review of the school completion programme by the ESRI is almost complete.  The review is an important initiative in regard to planning for the future development of the school completion programme.  The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future.  The review is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials of the Child and Family Agency, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>The review will, among other things, examine the school completion programme structures and their fitness for purpose to support an integrated approach to address early school leaving.  It will analyse the interventions provided and make recommendations for evidence informed supports designed to secure the best educational outcomes for young people.  The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, which was also prepared by the ESRI, and which refers to the school completion programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education.</p><p>The report is almost finalised and it is expected it will be available in the coming weeks.</p><p>I have advised the agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services. The school completion programme is an important service within the agency's educational welfare services.  It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.  I am pleased to confirm for the Senator that there will be no cuts to the programme.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister is now in a position to ensure that there will be no further cuts and that the services will be maintained, if not enhanced, by the recommendations in the report.  He fully understands the value of the services provided to those young people and, in that respect, the supports have to be provided to the school completion programme.  I thank the Minister for his acknowledgement of that.</p></speech>

I am awaiting the outcome of the ESRI report but I am confident it will be very positive.  I believe it will give us further evidence to underpin future development of the scheme and strengthen my hand in regard to the Estimates process in the coming year to try to get further funding for it.  Nonetheless, we all have to be cognisant of the fact that our economy, although recovering, is still fragile.  That recovery must be guarded, and we have to continue to make sure that all the funding we seek and receive is used to the best possible outcomes.  That is why evidence based research and the ESRI report will be so important.</p> <p>I am very pleased that in this year's budget we got our first increase for the Child and Family Agency.  All of that money went into Tusla so that it could address the many needs it faces, and in particular many of the unallocated cases of children who were in requirement of social worker assistance.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this Commencement matter.  The nub of what I want to raise is the importance of introducing a parents charter and to ask when we can expect it and when this new section 28 can be brought in to the school admissions policy.</p> <p>Recently, I became aware of numerous cases of people having problems trying to get in contact with their child's school to raise an issue.  In terms of the current process, as the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will know well, the Department's website asks if the parent has contacted the Department of Education and Skills, which many parents think they should do, but the Department of Education and Skills, despite being funders of education, has no role at all.  Schools are running themselves under the board of management.  I believe there is a much greater need for parents to be involved in the running of the school so that when they do have an issue, it can be dealt with effectively.</p> <p>I was made aware of a case recently where an issue was brought to the attention of the principal, was ignored for seven months and was only responded to when the parents in question contacted the chairperson of the board of management.  They were then informed that if they had a complaint they should write to the secretary of the board of management.  The secretary of the board of management and the principal are one and the same person.  The parents did that.  They were first told that all letters were only opened at a board of management meeting and that the secretary was not aware of it.  However, it now turns out that it was the secretary who opened the letter and who was present while the decision was taken on the course of action that would be taken to address the parent's complaint, and it was the principal who contacted the parents.  These parents were concerned that it is very much a one-sided process.  Despite the school saying it is open and transparent, the parents were not present in the school when it was discussed but the principal was present.  There is no recourse for a parent to get somewhere with a genuine concern. In addition, if one checks with someone in the Department of Education and Skills they will say the trustees should be contacted.  The trustee in most of our voluntary secondary schools is the bishop or the organisation.  If someone contacts the bishop, the bishop will say they will now contact the chair of the board of management, but that is the person about whom the complaint is being made.  It is totally up to them.</p> <p>In the four years I have been a Member of this House I have been contacted by numerous people who have had difficulties in getting school principals to return calls or answer letters.  It is wrong for a principal in a school to ignore a letter for seven months and only respond when this parent took the matter to the chair of the board, even though the chair of the board referred it back to the secretary, who is the principal.  There is an urgent need to ensure the parents charter is incorporated in the school admissions Bill and have this process in place because parents are under the misguided belief that it is the Department of Education and Skills they should contact when the Department, as far as I can see, has no role in the matter.  I raise this Commencement matter so that concerns of parents can be addressed and that schools are held accountable for complaints procedures or concerns parents may wish to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#B00600"><p>I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, to thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, is in the D&aacute;il answering oral questions.  I welcome the opportunity to address the role and clarify the position of the Department of Education and Skills in the complaint procedure process for secondary schools.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that, under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed by the school board of management on behalf of the school's patrons or trustees or education and training board, ETB, known as the management authority.  It is the management authority that employs the school's teachers and other staff members.  In ETB schools, the ETB is the employer.  The school principal manages the school on a day to day basis.</p> <p>Accordingly, whereas the Department of Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools neither the Minister nor the Department has legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension in accordance with section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p> <p>In dealing with parental complaints, the Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against the school can be progressed.  Where parents feel that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 28 is the section of the Education Act 1998 that provides for parental complaints in schools.  It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school.</p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills is not satisfied with the current provisions of section 28 and plans to revise it to provide in law for a parent and student charter.  Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of the charter.  Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important.  If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision, they are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions. </p><p>A core objective of the charter is to shift away from reacting to problems only after they give arise to grievances.  The emphasis will be on improving the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools in order that grievances will not arise or will be resolved quickly and informally.  As a result, the need to resort to a formal grievance process should be much reduced.  The Minister's intention is to amend section 28 of the Education Act 1998 to require every school to have a parent and student charter in accordance with principles set down in legislation that will set a national standard.  Her plan is to have this change introduced during the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  He referred to a complaint continuing on to the Ombudsman for Children.  Unfortunately, if a child is 18 years old, this will not count.  The guildelines of the Department of Education and Skill provide that the principal must arrange a meeting and that the complaint must be resolved within ten days.  The parents in question wrote a letter in March and did not receive a reply until the end of April, at which time they were told the principal was too busy to meet them within the ten day timeframe.  They then received a letter giving three hours notice of a meeting, which was not suitable either.</p> <p>Young people are at the heart of this issue.  The voluntary contribution is also relevant.  It is supposed to be voluntary, but they are hearing that pupils in class are either radiators or sponges.  Those who have paid their voluntary contribution are the radiators radiating warmth, while those who have not paid are the sponges in society.  This is totally unacceptable and we urgently need to look at the matter.  Schools should be held accountable for dealing with issues such as this, which are very damaging to young children.  </p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  As a fellow former teacher, we share the same passion for students, those whom we taught and those yet to come down the road.  That is why this issue needs to be dealt with in legislation as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

While an incident such as a student being described as a sponge is rare, it would be outrageous if such a comparison were to be made that one student was a radiator, while another was a sponge.  Most professionals never use that terminology, but, unfortunately, such instances can and sometimes do occur.  As the Minister has stated formally in her reply which I have given to the House, it is her absolute intention to introduce a student and parent charter in legislation by amending section 28 of the Education Act 1998 by means of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.</p></speech>

The figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and acknowledged by the HSE indicate that more than 13,000 people, primarily in Cork city and county, are waiting for more than 12 months to see a consultant in the three Cork hospitals, the South Infirmary, the Mercy Hospital and CUH.  Some of them have been waiting for as long as 18 months.  Even having seen a consultant there is a further delay of 12 month or 15 months - sometimes up to two years - to get the surgery done, including hip replacement and knee surgery.  </p><p>I ask the Leader to have the issue of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which has basically been stood down by the current Government, looked at again.  It is an appalling vista to have thousands of people waiting first to see a consultant and then to have their operation.  That is not acceptable in this day and age and many of these people are elderly.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was established to address a bottleneck in our health service with people waiting for operations.  It allowed operations to be done in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and the system should be revisited.  Instead of getting better, the reality is that this time five years ago the then spokesperson for health in opposition, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, was pontificating that if he was in power, within 12 or 15 months he would have it all sorted out and in fact it is getting worse.  The matter must be addressed.  I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business because I want the Leader to reflect on these waiting list figures with a view to having a full debate on them and the role of the NTPF before the summer recess.  I intend to revisit the matter.</p><p>I raise the issue of Irish Water and the farcical situation of thousands of homeowners being supplied through lead pipes, which are widely known to contaminate water and have adverse effects on people's health.  We have discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>the funding of Irish Water, rushing to install meters everywhere and putting the cart before the horse.  The first thing the public want is good-quality water through good pipes and that is not happening at the moment.  There are issues with potable water even in areas such as mine in west County Cork.  It is not acceptable that approximately 200,000 households are getting water through the lead pipes.</p><p>I urge the Leader to organise a debate on the direction of Irish Water with the Minister responsible, hopefully before the summer recess.  A two or three-hour debate in this House would highlight the problems.  Things are not getting any better.  Approximately &euro;600,000 and possibly up to &euro;750,000 has already been spent.  Instead of Irish Water serving the needs of the people, the whole situation is deteriorating.  It is wrong to have a total rush to install meters with a view to collecting money rather than ensuring a proper supply of potable water that is lead-free.  I hope we can debate these issues in the Chamber and be provided with answers.  Otherwise, whether it is next week or the week after, either I or my Leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, will table amendments to the Order of Business to pressurise for a debate on these very important issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#H00400"><p>On the issue of lead pipes, which came to public attention a short while ago, there is an implication in some of the media reports that Irish Water discovered the problem and wrote to 28,000 households to advise that they had lead pipes that are a health hazard.  I find it somewhat disturbing.  It is my understanding that lead piping was used to supply households up to the 1970s and even up to the 1980s.  This should be the subject of an inquiry, perhaps by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The damage done by lead in the water system has been known for decades.  It is linked to development issues in children and is also linked to kidney problems, cancer and even to dementia.</p> <p>I wonder about the role of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government back in the 1970s and 1980s, and indeed the 1990s and 2000s, when it must have been known that local authorities were installing lead piping in the country even though it was known to be a health hazard.</p> <p>There is an issue of accountability of local authorities and an issue of the accountability of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Why should it be down to householders to put their hands deep into their pockets to pay for this?  That local authorities might be held accountable for doing something that was damaging to public health when they knew better is worthy of investigation.</p> <p>The ESRI has warned the Government against putting &euro;1.5 billion of a budget boost back into the economy.  The good news is that it is lauding the economy's performance and noted that we would have a growth rate of 4% next year and 3.5% the following year, accompanied by significant drops in unemployment - down to 8.3% by 2016.  All of this proves that the Government has succeeded significantly in turning the economy around.</p> <p>I do not accept its advice to Government that we should put our hands in our pockets and let the economy do its job.  I do not think the ESRI is aware that this Government and the previous one were forced to take significant amounts of money out of public services that impacted on some of the most vulnerable people in Irish society despite our best efforts to try to preserve basic rates of social welfare.  In particular we owe it to people who suffer from disability, for example, who need resources put back into the health budget as my colleague on the other side of the House has said.  We also need to support those who need housing, who need education and people with young families who, we know, have suffered from what has happened to this country over many years.</p> <p>I agree that we should not under any circumstances lead the country into another bubble, but we must restore public services and we can do so without fuelling private debt and without bringing the country into a situation of crisis.</p></speech>

If anyone knows anything about pregnancy and pre-natal practice, it is she.  She is certainly an expert on the subject.  It confirmed the fears I had about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill when it came to this Chamber.  I could not vote for the Bill at the time because I felt it did not go far enough in that it did not give the necessary protections I believed should have been afforded, especially to women who suffer a fatal foetal abnormality or women who become pregnant due to rape or incest.</p> <p>The latest figures indicate that ten women a day must travel from this country to England to seek the necessary medical treatment, which is absolutely outrageous in this day and age.  The country has moved on a considerable amount since the 1980s but the Legislature has not moved with the times on the issue.  There is no reason in the world a woman diagnosed with a fatal foetal abnormality should be forced to bring her pregnancy to full term.  It is an absolutely cruel practice, one we should not force on any woman.  Legislation covering such matters in this country result in discrimination against women, especially those who come from poorer and more deprived areas who possibly cannot afford to make the trip to England and who are forced to self-medicate.  Women buy all sorts of experimental drugs and take the treatment into their own hands at home without proper medical supervision.  We should be able to have a mature debate in this House on the eighth amendment.  Before the Government&rsquo;s term ends it should put a referendum on it to the people.  Most people are sensible when it comes to rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality and they are matters on which we should legislate.</p></speech>

There is now a major problem in that regard.  Part of the problem is due to the lack of long-term planning, in particular from 2003 on when we did not employ enough consultants.  The last time I inquired about the matter when the HSE attended the Committee on Health and Children, it was confirmed that more than 325 consultant vacancies existed out of a total of 2,500 posts.  I agree with what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said about the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  We should look seriously at the matter again, in particular in cases where people have been waiting for a considerable period.  However, if that option is chosen, it must be done properly.  There was a case in the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital where people were referred to a private hospital for consultation and reports were made but then the HSE consultants had to review the patients before they could carry out the procedures.  That should not have been done.  If such an approach is taken, it should be done properly in the way it was done previously where people were assessed and operations were carried out in the private sector.  That option needs to be reconsidered and it would be appropriate to have a debate on the matter in the House.</p> <p>I agree with what my colleague said about a debate on the Amnesty International report.  A presentation was made to the Committee On Health and Children yesterday but I decided not to take part in it because I had not fully read the report.  Parts of the report have been taken out of context, which is unfortunate because it gives a very false impression of the medical services that are available in this country for women.  It is wrong that such an impression is given.  I raised the matter with the head of Amnesty International in this country after the meeting.  I accept issues arise that need to be dealt with, in particular that of fatal foetal abnormalities.  I worry about the accuracy of some aspects of a report based on interviewing only 60 people and I have concerns about it from that point of view.</p></speech>

It is something that has been known about for some time.  The Government is not responsible for it as it dates back to the previous century when lead piping was used extensively in buildings.  It is very important that the matter would be rectified.  I hope the Government will introduce some form of grant system to allow householders who are affected by the situation.  We should have a debate on the matter and other issues regarding water transportation.  For instance, asbestos pipes were used in the 1970s.  The Castlerea regional scheme had asbestos piping from the Longford Springs to Ballintubber and surrounding areas.  The matter was brought to my attention a long time ago by people in that area who were concerned.  They were assured that asbestos would not be carried in the water but it is a health issue and the Government should examine it.</p> <p>Even though a report was published on the fluoridation of water, I have strong reservations on the matter.  I chaired a committee in the Department of Health which was mainly composed of dentists and professors of dentistry which came out in favour of adding fluoride to water.  Since then, however, I have developed strong reservations on the matter.  Why would one add something to a product that is beautiful and clear?  Fluoride is a drug.  It is a dangerous chemical.  It is used to protect teeth and it is said that the addition of it to water has been a wonderful success in this respect.  However, it is also being given to animals in drinking water.  I have strong reservations on the matter and I would like to see some international studies on the issue.  Most countries are discontinuing water fluoridation.  The problem is that each administration administers fluoride in its own way and there is no overall consistency in the approach taken.  Some people might dump a tonne of it into the water while others put in less.  It is a very inexact, unregulated system.  It would be worthwhile if the Leader of the House could give Members an opportunity to debate water.  I hope Irish Water gets involved in the wider debate.  The company has enough people working for it in its public relations and communications area for it to listen to the words spoken in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for that matter.</p></speech>

Let us all talk about the real bank, which is the post office.  I want the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection to come to the House to explain about the new social welfare forms.  I want them withdrawn.  The Irish Postmasters Union said that all post offices will be under threat of closure if social protection transaction business is taken away.  We really need to take this on board because savings and savings certificates in the post office are probably the most valuable savings people have in any bank in Ireland because the post office does not rob people and then come back and ask people to pay for the robbery.  I request that the forms would be reissued and that the Minister would come to the House to confirm that is the case.  Social welfare payments account for more than 30% of transactions and if they are removed, the core business is gone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I acknowledge what the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, has said on the matter, we should be treating the post office network as a national asset by taking its social and community value into account.

We are good politicians in this House, and this is the forum from which we can support our post offices, as the most valuable resource in every town, county and urban area in Ireland.  We should be extending them and giving them more powers rather than shutting them down and capitulating to the banks.  I urge Senators to support me in introducing a framework that would allow the post office network to remain independent and to grow under the Houses of the Oireachtas.

I met representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union yesterday.  The form shows clear bias towards financial institutions over post offices.  It directs people to use a financial institution instead of a post office.  That flies in the face of the assurances given by the Ministers for Social Protection and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that there is no inherent bias towards financial institutions when it comes to social welfare payments, and that post offices and banks are treated equally.  That is simply not the case.  If Senators read the forms they will see what they are telling people.  They even state that it is in individuals' interest to go to financial institutions.  That is even worse than a clear bias because if people withdraw from their post offices and go to financial institutions, there will be job losses and closures of post offices.  Post offices have already closed in many rural areas.  I need not rehearse the argument about the impact on rural communities and even urban centres, where post offices provide a crucial social service.</p> <p>In regard to the one parent family changes which come into effect in July, the SPARK organisation is protesting outside Leinster House today.  These changes will drive more families and, especially, women into poverty.

I wish to highlight the issues associated with living on an island off the coast of Ireland and call for a debate on policy on the islands in general.  Today we are hearing a presentation from the Aran Islands air service action group, which is concerned that the islands' air services are under attack.  This brings into focus the issue of living on the islands of our coast.  It appears the new programme will not include a Leader company with the specific purpose of supporting the islands.  The islands face specific infrastructure and transport difficulties, and I would welcome a debate on them.</p> <p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Cullinane, on SPARK and the cuts to lone parent payments.  A protest is also being held by the Dublin greyhound owners and breeders association.  I have previously called for a debate on the greyhound industry because it has been some time since our last debate on the matter.  The association is concerned that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, have dropped the ball on the greyhound industry.  It is currently in free-fall, with owners and breeders leaving the game in their droves.  They believe that the board is being filled with political appointments and that the Minister is proposing to sell the greyhound racing stadium in Harold's Cross while keeping others open, even though it makes a profit.  Concerns were also expressed about the lack of financial transparency from the board, the fact that the 2013 accounts have not yet been made available and irregularities in the industry in terms of substances used by unscrupulous trainers.  This debate is long overdue and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, should come to the House at the earliest opportunity for a full and honest discussion on the future of the greyhound industry in Ireland.</p></speech>

A recent report on food provision in post-primary schools prepared by the Irish Heart Foundation contained some worrying findings, including the high availability of unhealthy foods, but it also identified ground-breaking approaches to providing nutritious food in schools.  Secondary schools can play a key role in improving children's health and well being by providing nutritious food options, which are essential for growth, development and protection against heart disease.  The wide-ranging report found that food products with high levels of fat, sugar and salt were available in more than half of the 39 schools surveyed and that 40% of schools did not provide free drinking water, which was only marginally more widely available than Coca Cola and other energy dense soft drinks.  This report deserves debate and it would be appropriate to have a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the provision of appropriate food in schools as part of the fight against obesity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Leader might consider this more appropriate for the Minister for Health but both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills should take a keen interest in this report.</p></speech>

Capital gains tax is now becoming the focus of attention for many people.  The rate, which was 20%, has been increased by the Minister to 33%, which is close to where it was many years ago.  In those times, indexation was allowed, meaning that this is currently a very penal tax that is impacting fairly seriously on people, and particularly those who have suffered losses.  This has become a very convoluted area that must be simplified, and I hope we might be able to have a debate on the issue.</p> <p>At the same time we could examine capital acquisitions tax.  As a result of current house prices, where parents or grandparents try to assist children or grandchildren by leaving them a house or something else, many of those people may be unable to hold on to the house because of the taxation liability that comes with it.  The thresholds have been reduced very significantly by more than half in recent years since the economic collapse.  Now that we see a move towards recompensing the public service, it is very important that people in the private sector are not left to pick up the bill by continuing to wear the austerity measures imposed on citizenry over the past six or seven years.</p> <p>Will the Leader consider having a debate about the KBB?  When the Leader and I were growing up, it was the KGB and now it is the KBB.  We saw yesterday the choreography that took place between the master of one of our maternity hospitals, Amnesty International and a UN committee.  Two of those organisations would see themselves as being strong advocates for human rights.  Nevertheless, when it comes to the most vulnerable sector of all, they take an anti-human rights approach and go back to medieval practices which they are trying to promote.  We should have a debate on all those who are part of the KBB.  It is interesting that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has not yet come out about it.  It also received money from Atlantic Philanthropies, as has Amnesty International.  I know the conditionality was that it would promote abortion in this country.  This area needs to be exposed and the people need to be fully aware when they make decisions on these issues if that choice is put before them in future.  They need to know the background of those who are promoting these issues, and people should choose in an informed way.</p></speech>

This is something we need to revisit as centralisation has proven to be a disaster over recent years.  What was wrong with the operation of the medical card system under the health boards?  There was nothing wrong with it and it worked very well.  It is now a disaster.  I know a mature student in Dublin with absolutely no income and he has been fighting for 15 months with the primary care reimbursement service to get a medical card to which he is entitled.  He had to send the service a solicitor's letter recently.</p> <p>We can consider SUSI, the education grant system.  There was nothing wrong with the way it was operating when the process was local, and it ran smoothly.  I know a man who has been waiting seven months for a grant to which he is entitled but he cannot get it.  We can see what we did with the HSE when we formed it in favour of the old health boards.  Once we got rid of the old health boards, we took away local power from the people.  A former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, promised to get rid of the HSE.  For the ordinary person, this meant that the decision-makers and fat cats in the HSE would be eliminated.  He only got rid of the board of directors and what has changed since then?  Absolutely nothing.  We are still seeing what used to happen with the board of directors in place.  When the board was in place, the executive closed the accident and emergency department in Roscommon but with a new board in place, the executive is threatening to close the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise.  There is a psychiatric unit in Castlerea that has housed 23 patients for the past 15 to 20 years and they are happy and content in that place but the HSE has decided that these people - some of whom have no advocates to speak for them - are not in the right place.  The HSE believes they might be better off in private nursing homes.</p> <p>All this has proven to be a disaster and centralisation should be included in any debate we have.  I ask the Leader to seriously consider my request.</p></speech>

There are certainly blockages in the system and Irish Water is presenting a serious blockage if it is affecting business.  We have a worrying issue developing in Oranmore, as Irish Water has stated it is to start pipe rehabilitation and water works next Monday, without any consultation with local business.  We are talking about a peak time for businesses.  There was a meeting last evening involving 50 businesses and there was another meeting a few days before that.  These businesses are now considering an injunction as well as protest to prevent the works going ahead next Monday.  This is ridiculous as there is no need for it.  We want reasonable communication and consultation about the timing of works.  That is all that has been asked for.  Irish Water has taken a bullying approach and has sent people with no decision-making power to the site.  I call for a meeting between Mr. John Tierney and a business delegation in Oranmore.  It is pretty bad when I have to stand up in our Seanad to do that because we are not getting direct communication.</p> <p>I also call for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to examine the blockages in the system.  Retaining jobs is just as important as creating a job.  If these works go ahead in the peak season in Oranmore, we will see full-time jobs become part-time jobs, at a minimum.  People with rates bills of &euro;127,000 - as put on the record yesterday - will have to call people who have booked holidays or a few days off to say there could be a rock blaster outside the door at 7 a.m.  That is no way to treat people, and especially the business people or residents of Oranmore.  Everyone should have a say.</p> <p>I call on Mr. Tierney, the chief executive officer of Irish Water, to get real and negotiate rather than have the company take a bullying approach.  That is the approach Irish Water has used and, mark my words, if it does this in Oranmore and get away with it, the company will do it elsewhere.  I am standing with the people on this.</p></speech>

There is a swindle of Irish taxpayers by multi-million euro companies that is going completely under the radar.  This relates to large companies using zero-hour contracts to employ staff who in turn must supplement their incomes through social welfare benefits.  Zero-hour contracts are not just bad for the country's living standards, they are also bad for the Exchequer, as low pay is a drain on public finances.  If we consider the wages of people on zero-hour contracts, they must be routinely topped up by the Government through the payment of in-work benefits.  I am firmly of the view that low pay must be supported but on the flip side, the taxpayer is subsidising the wage bills of large private companies.  Their actions are driving up benefits bills and are making it more difficult for us to reduce the deficit in public finances.</p></speech>

This results in more Government borrowing, which we simply cannot afford.  In effect, it is the taxpayer who is indirectly supplementing the incomes of the low-paid while subsidising the wage bill of employers.  It sickens me to see companies that pimp the green colour on brands doing this.  It is time for them to show some patriotism and give regular contracted hours to staff.  There should be a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</p></speech>

The development of this country is an issue that we have raised here before.  Do we want balanced regional development?  Do we simply want an ever-expanding Dublin at the cost of rural Ireland?

It is an important rural industry which employs thousands of people in all of its facets.  Therefore, we must retain, support and maintain the industry and its integrity.  I would like to hear an update from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or his Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on the many areas of concern within the industry.  Last September or October we debated the matter so it is time to air it again.  There are problems but there is no point in brushing them under the carpet.  The Seanad can have a calm and reflective debate on the subject.  I know the Leader is interested in the industry and, therefore, I call on him to arrange for either the Minister or his Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to come in here to update us on their ongoing inquiries.  Let us hear from them as soon as possible.  I hope they will be in a position to allay our concerns.</p></speech>

Sadly, Amnesty International has lost many of its loyal supporters who previously viewed it as an impartial and reliable voice that acted on behalf of the most vulnerable and forgotten members of society.  Frankly, the organisation has become distracted from its important work of supporting victims and prisoners of conscience to join this very troubling and corrupted version of human rights that it now proposes.  That is a real shame for an organisation which had such great origins and did so much good work in the past.</p> <p>I call for a debate on the manner in which the Government pursues projects that involve compulsory purchase.  I specifically have in mind the Dublin to Galway greenway project.  It is proposed to have a cycle path along disused rail tracks and through open country.  I am concerned about the latter aspect which involves the use of a path through open country.  Earlier this year I became aware that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport officials, involved with the project, had threatened to use compulsory purchase order legislation to acquire land for the initiative.  Much of the land for the part of the project that stretches from Dublin to Ballinasloe was secured through transfers of ground that belonged to Waterways Ireland and the pubic transport authorities.  However, the final stretch of the route is from Loughrea to Galway city which cuts through family farms.  In such cases it is outrageous to use threats of compulsory purchase proceedings.</p> <p>A CPO is a draconian intervention against a private individual's constitutionally protected property rights.  Therefore, it should be used sparingly and only for vital and national infrastructural projects which, to my mind, does not include a cycle path.  A far better way to proceed is through negotiation and consultation.  Where a proposed route dissects a family farm and thereby reduces the value of the land, compensation should be payable.  However, the duty of the State does not end there.  The Department must ensure that other measures are taken to ensure that farmers are confident that their business will not be negatively impacted and that their privacy will be respected.  I am not satisfied that this is the case.  I know from my conversations with landowners affected by the proposal that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has conducted discussions by dictating to farmers to take the "compo" for their land or it will be subject to a CPO.</p> <p>Farmers have concerns about privacy, safety and the impacts on their business.  The land strips on the greenway average 10 m in width and the proposed route cuts right across farms, in many cases.  The route will run close to dwellings, near farmyards and through productive farming land.  One farmer that I spoke to pointed out that the planned route dissects his land.  He said that his dairy herd will have to cross the greenway four times which will add to his workload as he will have to clean it up every time his crows cross the greenway.  There are obviously safety concerns where livestock comes into contact with the public.  Other farmers face having a public right of way running close to their private dwellings.  They are right to insist that they are entitled to more than just monetary compensation.  Safety measures and measures to protect privacy are also vital.</p></speech>

As we speak and posture, services in Donegal have been centralised.  Why have sub-post offices been closed in Donegal and centralised in Letterkenny?  It is because the Department of Social Welfare will not roll out Government transactions through the post office network and, thus, support the network.  It is essential that the Minister comes in here to debate the matter.  The post office network, as we know it, is at a crossroads and continues to face huge financial challenges.</p> <p>I ask the Leader what suggestions have been put forward to handle pre-budget statements, submissions or discussions here in the House.  At the moment all of the interest or sectoral groups are lobbying and holding briefing sessions within the Oireachtas, and outside of the Oireachtas, in regard to what they seek in the forthcoming budget.  When will we have those discussions?  We should have those discussions prior to the summer recess.  I call for time to be made available to debate the matter with each Department with the Cabinet Minister being present for such discussions.</p> <p>I wish to refer to the saga that has spilled over today again and I refer to the Football Association of Ireland and John Delaney.  I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications is due to meet today and may discuss the issue.  The debate is much ado about nothing and is a diversionary tactic.  People just want to focus attention on the chief executive of the Football Association of Ireland who,  through his office, obtained a grant or loan payment or whatever from FIFA.  </p></speech>

If it were, then the taxpayer would not have been exposed, to the extent that we have been, to fund sporting projects up and down the country.  I am chairman of my local soccer club.  Therefore, I can say, without qualification, that the work that John Delaney and the FAI have done to benefit grassroots soccer and under age soccer is undisputed.  The money that was obtained was verified and outlined in the financial statements and annual accounts in the years concerned.  The attention that has been given to the matter is a diversionary tactic and is wrong.  Instead, politicians here, the people of this country and the media should get behind the Irish team who will play an important game against Scotland next Saturday.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is need for the same legislation in Ireland because the vast majority of supermarkets already give unsold food to charities.  It is interesting to see how much unsold food there is and how much food is thrown away when people are hungry in various parts of France.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It may well happen in some cases, but to the best of my knowledge supermarkets here give their surplus food to various charities.  The reason I mention this is that some products have a "best before" date rather than a "use by" date.  I mentioned this issue here previously, but I have not seen anything being done about it.  The "best before" term should not be used.  We should use the term "use by".  I remember an occasion in one of our supermarkets where a customer complained new potatoes she was buying on a Saturday had a "best before" Sunday date.  I went to our supplier and asked about this and he told me they were best before that date and should be used within 24 hours of being picked.  However, that did not mean there was anything wrong with them or that they were damaged.  If a person was to get them at their best for taste, that is what the "best before" date meant.</p><p>I do not believe we need legislation, but I would like to encourage the disuse of the term "best before" and the use of the term "use by".  On that basis we would have less waste of good food and surplus food would be used by people who need it.</p></speech>

We know how harmful lead can be.  The strategy sets out a long-term plan to raise awareness of the legacy issue in this regard, which affects up to 200,000 homes throughout the State, and plans to support the replacement of lead piping in homes and other buildings.  I understand Irish Water has already written to 655 households on this issue.  I came across a case in Tralee recently where a whole estate was affected.  The issue was raised by a Deputy at a hospital meeting I was attending.  This issue is widespread.  It is dynamite.  Lead is particularly harmful to pregnant women, infants and young children.  I welcome the strategy and welcome the commitment of Irish Water to replace lead piping from boundaries to the water main provided householders replace lead piping within their boundaries.</p></speech>

This is one of the most prestigious events on the travel calendar.  The AGM will be hosted in the RDS from 1 to 3 June next year.

I will make available to the leader and the Whip what we have to date.  We used to meet with the Leader and the Whip every week, but that practice has not continued.  I have no problem in regard to providing the information.</p> <p>In regard to the need to reconsider the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Government has taken strong measures and formed an emergency department task force in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum for dealing with challenges presented by overcrowding.  An additional &euro;74 million was provided and ring-fenced for this.  Some &euro;44 million was allocated to the nursing homes support scheme and &euro;30 million to cover the cost of additional transitional care beds.  This additional funding comes on top of measures already taken in budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provide alternatives to relieve the pressure on acute hospitals.  An implementation plan is being reviewed by the leadership of the HSE, completed yesterday, and it is anticipated this will be agreed and that the implementation steering group will be formed by the end of the week, with an initial meeting of the group to take place within the next ten days.  Therefore, a number of actions are being taken to address the waiting list situation and the unacceptable trolley situation.</p> <p>Senators O'Donovan, Hayden, Naughton, Coghlan and Leyden raised the issue of lead piping.  I am glad there have been many good and new schemes in Roscommon to provide a good water supply for the people there.  These are long overdue as Roscommon was neglected over many years</p></speech>

Senator Healy Eames should consider that in regard to the problem she highlighted.  We have a mechanism whereby such issues can be raised by Members on a weekly basis and that forum should be used in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Hayden raised the ESRI report, which certainly shows a robust recovery in domestic demand and also shows a strong export situation.  The Government has been strong on the economy and has tried to ensure we continue the progress made to date.  This has been Government policy, particularly of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Noonan and Howlin.  </p> <p>Senators Heffernan, Mullen and Walsh raised to the Amnesty International report in reference to abortion.  A number of Members raised this matter on yesterday's Order of Business also and I do not propose to deal with it again today.  Senator Leyden raised the question of fluoride in water.  The recent report issued suggested there is no evidence that fluoride creates a health hazard.  I understand people disagree with that and Senator O'Brien raised the matter on a number of occasions.</p> <p>Senator O'Donnell asked about the future of the post office network.

I will, therefore, try to facilitate such a debate.</p> <p>Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the need to look again at capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, which have increased significantly in recent years.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will examine the matter in the budget proposals, but I suggest it be discussed at the finance committee to which pre-budget submissions are made.  Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill also raised the question of pre-budget discussions.  Such submissions are dealt with mainly by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>Senator John Kelly spoke about the need for greater decentralisation of services.  He specifically mentioned post office services and items in the health sector such as medical cards.  This has been Government policy on medical cards and other services, including applications for student grants.  It has taken time for the services to bed down, but the position has improved significantly this year in comparison to the past few years.</p> <p>The matter raised by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames could be raised as a Commencement matter or else she could deal directly with Irish Water staff who are in the Houses of the Oireachtas on a weekly basis.</p> <p>Senator Lorraine Higgins raised the issue of zero hour contracts.  We have dealt with the Low Pay Commission and there was a Bill in the House only last week to try to deal with the matter which is under constant scrutiny by the Government and particularly the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash.</p> <p>I have dealt with the matters raised by Senator Paul Bradford, including the post office network and the greyhound industry.</p> <p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to the provision of greenways throughout the country.  This has been very important in promoting tourism, but I note the Senator's point in questioning the use of compulsory purchase orders which are used sparingly by local authorities.  That is the case in this regard also.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the Football Association of Ireland.  I do not intend to become involved in that matter.  It is something the relevant Oireachtas joint committee might be dealing with.</p> <p>Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about large supermarkets giving unsold food to charities, a point he has raised previously.  I am aware that many Irish supermarkets do this.  The point the Senator makes is a good one, that the emphasis should be on the use by rather than the best before date.  This is something that should be done.</p> <p>Senator Terry Brennan mentioned the American football game to be held in September.  This is of tremendous benefit to tourism and gives great exposure to the country in the United States.  The Senator has also highlighted the fact that the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association will be held in Dublin next year, with over 1,200 delegates attending.  These events are welcome and promote tourism.  Again, this emphasises the significant increase in tourism which we have experienced in the first quarter of the year, during which tourist figures increased by more than 13%.</p></speech>

The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote>I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  We have only submitted a handful of the amendments that we submitted on Committee Stage because we have taken on board the Minister's views on some of the issues.  However, the amendments we have tabled are those on which we have been lobbied and on which we have strong views ourselves.  We believe they would strengthen the Bill and that is why we have resubmitted them on Report Stage.</p><p>I will set out our position on amendment No. 1, as I did on Committee Stage.  We note that section 8 amends section 149 of the Children Act 2001 and provides that where a child is convicted of an offence, the period of detention imposed on a child should not exceed that which the court would have imposed on an adult.  While it is noted that the purpose of the section is to give consideration to the principle of equality of treatment between children in detention schools and adults in the prison system, given the importance of the principle that detention should be a last resort for children we recommend that this provision be amended to more closely reflect the spirit and wording of section 96 of the Children Act 2001.</p><p>I will set out the rationale for amendment No. 3.  Section 8 provides that where a period of detention greater than three years is imposed on a child, a court must give its reasons for doing so in open court.  It is of note that the original Children Act 2001 provision, before it was amended by the 2006 Act, contained an upper limit and did not permit a court to impose a sentence on a child in excess of three years.  Therefore, we suggest that the proposed section 149(2) be amended.  We are making this submission in light of recommendation 33 of the strategic review group on penal policy as published in September 2014, which states:<blockquote>The Review Group recommends that, in all cases where a custodial sentence is imposed by a court, the court should set out its reasons in writing for so doing. The Group further recommends that this requirement be incorporated in statute.</blockquote>As far back as February 2003 the Law Reform Commission recommended that a District Court judge should be required to give concise written reasons for any decision to impose a custodial sentence.  The strategic review group considered whether this requirement would constitute a significant additional burden on the courts and concluded that it would not.  The obligation to provide reasons already exists.  This recommendation simply requires that those reasons are recorded in writing.  In a case where the liberty of a child is at stake it is imperative that there is clarity around the rationale for such a significant decision.  Such a statutory provision would promote consistency in sentencing and bring clarity and transparency not only to the courts but to victims, offenders, legal practitioners and the public as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#Q00400"><p>I second the amendment and support the first amendment put down by Sinn F&eacute;in in principle.  However, as I said on Committee Stage - I maintain my position now - I believe the amendment is incorrectly placed.  I have contacted Sinn F&eacute;in and the Bills Office seeking clarity following Committee Stage.</p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment seeks to insert a new subsection 7A after section 88(7) of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 88 deals with remand in custody and pertains in the most part to the designation of a place as a remand centre.  Section 88(7), as amended, states: "A place may be designated as a remand centre only with the consent of its owners or, as the case may be, its managers."</p> <p>Although subject to amendment by this Bill, section 88(8) currently reads: "Where a remand centre is part of a children detention school, children remanded in custody to the centre shall, as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the child, be kept separate from and not be allowed to associate with children in respect of whom a period of detention has been imposed."</p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment concerns provisions regarding a period of detention imposed on a child by the court.  Upon my reading of section 88, a new subsection (7A) to section 88 of the principal Act simply does not fit.  Rather, I believe, the amendment should belong to section 88(8), which deals with provisions regarding period of detention imposed by court.  Thus my amendment, amendment No. 2, seeks to expand upon the amendment of section 149(1) of the Children Act contained in this Bill by stipulating several criteria.</p> <p>First, not only must the period of detention imposed on a child not exceed what the court could have imposed on an adult convicted of the same offence, it can be less.  This stipulation is made in section 96(4) of the Children Act dealing with principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children, which holds: "The penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of the same kind and may be less, where so provided for in this Part."</p> <p>Second, in determining the period of detention a decision should reflect the spirt and wording of section 96(2) in particular which reminds the court that it "should take the least restrictive form that is appropriate in the circumstances" and that "a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort".</p> <p>The third criteria relates to the best interests of the child principle.  Given the new children's rights article in the Constitution and our obligations to children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child it is vital that this principle appears and flows consistently through legislation impacting on the lives of children.  I have adopted the wording for this amendment from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and I note that those involved also envisaged that the amendment would sit under section 8.</p> <p>As for the rationale behind the amendment, I note the chilling observation of Dr. Andrew McLellan, chief inspector of prisons for Scotland from 2002-09.  He said: "Prison may sometimes do good, but it always does harm."  Ireland is bound to respect and uphold the internationally and domestically recognised principle of detention as a last resort for children.  The rationale underpinning the fundamental principle and international human rights rule that children should be detained only as a measure of last resort is a three-fold recognition.  First, detention is harmful to children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Professor Barry Goldson, senior lecturer at the department of sociology, social policy and criminology at the University of Liverpool, has written extensively on the corrosive impact detention has on a child's life, including straining family relations, the reinforcement of negative behavioural traits, experiences of bullying, intimidation and violence, isolation, institutionalisation and stigmatisation.  Dr. Ursula Kilkelly, with whose expertise in this area we are all familiar, has also enumerated the negative impacts of detention on children, including the deprivation of liberty, separation from their usual social environment, separation from family and exposure to criminal contamination.</p><p>Second, noted in the preamble to the United Nations standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice, known as the Beijing rules, is the appreciation that children, owing to their early stage of human development, are distinctly vulnerable to these negative effects.  This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that many of the children subject to detention are extremely damaged.</p><p>Third, detention should be used as a last resort to militate against the organised hurt inherent in placing damaged children in damaging environments and to uphold the rights and safety and promote the physical and mental well-being of children as stipulated as a fundamental perspective in the United Nations rules for the protection of juveniles deprived of their liberty, known as the Havana rules.  The principle of detention as a last resort for children, the best interests of the child and the articulation of factors to which the court shall have regard in determining the nature of the penalty, if any, imposed are not just window dressing to be articulated in some places and not others.  These go to the very core of our juvenile justice policy and international obligations and we are duty-bound to articulate the principles at every appropriate juncture.</p><p>I support Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 3.  Given the seriousness and gravity of the decision to impose any period of detention on a child, I do not believe it is too much of an imposition on the court to give its reason for doing so in writing.  As Senator Cullinane has said, the Law Reform Commission recommended in 2003 that a District Court should be required to give concise written reasons for any decision to impose a custodial sentence.  I further note recommendation 33 of the 2014 strategic review group report on penal policy which stated that in all cases where a custodial sentence is imposed by a court, the court should set out its reason in writing for doing so.  The group further recommended that this requirement be incorporated into statutory law.  The strategic review group also considered whether a requirement to document a determination in writing would constitute a significant additional burden and found it would not.  I also believe the requirement for a court to give its reasons in writing might go some way towards ensuring remand is not inappropriately resorted to by the court in circumstances where the child requires a child welfare intervention.  I ask the Minister to recall the point I made in this regard on Second Stage.  For these reasons, I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p><p>The amendment I tabled, amendment No. 4, could strike a balance, if required, but I hope amendment No. 3 is accepted and there will be no need for it.  At the least, the Bill should stipulate that in giving its reasons for its decisions in open court, the court shall use language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child.  This would mirror the language of section 88(3) of the Children Act, which holds that where the court decides to remand a child in custody, the court shall explain the reasons for its decision in open court in language that is appropriate to the child's age and level of understanding.  The need to use language that is appropriate to the child's age and level of understanding throughout the juvenile justice process is also clearly set out in the 2010 guidelines for the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on child friendly justice.</p><p>In summary, I suggest an amendment should ensure the period of detention imposed on a child may be less than what the court could impose on an adult convicted of the same offence.  We must ensure the principles of detention as a last resort for children and the best interests of the child are articulated appropriately in this provision and that some of the factors, such as the age and level of maturity that the court shall consider when determining the nature of the penalty, if any, are clearly stated.  As suggested in amendment No. 4, it is important to mirror the language that is already used in section 88(3) of the Children Act.</p></speech>

In fairness, I believe the Minister would concur with the tone and tenor of what the Senator has said and that he will explain that.  However, there are also extreme situations and we cannot anticipate what will happen in the future or the situation then.  Therefore, we must be careful not to tie the hands of the Judiciary in this regard.  We must be conscious of the fact that serious crimes can be committed by juveniles and we cannot turn a blind eye to what might happen in the future.  I will respect the Minister's view on this issue.  If he outlines proposals along the lines of what Senator van Turnhout has said, that will be satisfactory.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-10a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061000002#R00300"><p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert the words "and may be less" and states: "The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed."  This is proposed as a new subsection (7A) in section 88.  I note however that section 88 deals with remands in custody as distinct from detention following conviction.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to insert the words "and may be less" and a statement, "The court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of detention as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed", into section 149(1).</p> <p>In regard to the insertion of the words "and may be less", it is provided in section 149(1) that the period of detention imposed on a child by a court shall not be more than the period of detention or imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult.  This does not mean that a lesser period of detention cannot be imposed on a child.  It is inherent in the provision that the period of detention imposed on a child may be less than that which is imposed on a person of full age and capacity.</p> <p>In addition, as I stated on Committee Stage, section 96(4) of the Act, providing for the powers of the court in regard to child offenders, provides that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, and may be less.  Therefore, section 96(4) already includes the words "and may be less".  A penalty may include any one of a number of sanctions, ranging from community sanctions to detention as a measure of last resort.</p> <p>I do not consider that inserting the words "and may be less" is necessary, as section 149(1) already implicitly provides for a lesser period to be imposed on a child.  In addition, section 96(4) is explicit on this point, clearly providing that the penalty imposed by a court on a child, which may include detention as a measure of last resort, may be less than that which would be imposed on an adult.</p> <p>In regard to adding the words "The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of detention as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed", the principles proposed in the amendment are already explicitly provided for in the Children Act 2001.  Part 9 of the Act provides for the powers of the courts in regard to child offenders.  In particular, section 96 provides for the principles relating to the exercise of criminal proceedings over children.  Section 96(3) provides that a court may take into consideration as mitigating factors a child's age and level of maturity in determining the nature of any penalty imposed, unless the penalty is fixed by law.  Section 96 also provides that when dealing with a child charged with an offence, a court shall have due regard to the child's best interests, the interests of the victim of the offence and the protection of society.  This reflects that where criminal proceedings are an issue, the best interests of the child must be balanced with the interests of society and the victim.  This is critical.</p> <p>Section 96(2) of the principal Act provides that a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort.  As the amendments proposed relating to a lesser period of detention being imposed on a child and a court having regard to the age, maturity and best interests of the child and the principle of detention as a last resort are already clearly provided for in the Act in section 96, which sets out the principles to be applied by a court when exercising criminal jurisdiction over children, I am not accepting amendments Nos. 1 and 2.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 3 proposes to provide in a new subsection (2) at section 149 that the court shall not impose a period of detention in excess of three years and where it imposes any period of detention that it shall give its reasons in writing.  Detention, as already said, is always a measure of last resort and that is set out clearly in section 96(2).  Section 143 of the principal Act also makes it clear that a court should not make an order imposing a period of detention unless it is satisfied that detention is the only suitable way of dealing with the child.  Section 96(4) makes it clear that the penalty imposed on a child should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of the same kind and may be a lesser period.  The Act provides various safeguards in terms of detention always being a measure of last resort and the duration of any period of detention to be imposed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>an adult, where detention is the penalty imposed on a child.  The imposition of a limit on the period of detention of a maximum of three years in all circumstances regardless of the offence that has been committed would not be appropriate.  We can all think of serious crimes that could be committed by a 17 and a half year old.  The idea that three years would be the maximum sentence would not sit well.  <br/><br/>On the proposed amendment to provide that where any period of detention is imposed on a child, the court shall give its reasons for doing so in writing, section 143(2) provides that where an order is made under subsection (1), the court making the order shall give its reasons for doing so in open court.  This provides safeguards in terms of the reasons being stated in an open court in the cases of all children appearing before a court.  It should be noted that these matters fall under Part 9 of the Children Act and are matters within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We continue to have close co-operation on criminal justice matters relating to children.  There are already sufficient safeguards in terms of the duration of any period of detention and a statement in all cases in open court of the reasons for any period of detention being imposed.  I am, therefore, not accepting the amendments proposed.  <br/><br/>Amendment No. 4 proposes to insert the words &quot;in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child&quot; into the substituted section 149(2) as provided for in section 8.  It should be noted that these matters which fall under Part 9 of the Children Act are matters within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  As I said on Committee Stage, we have close co-operation on criminal justice matters relating to children.  I have consulted, as I said I would do, with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the proposed amendment to provide that where a court imposes a period of detention in excess of three years on a child, it shall give its reasons for doing so in open court in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child.  It is important that where a lengthy period of detention is imposed on a child, the child understands fully the reasons for it.  Having consulted with the my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, I am therefore accepting the amendment proposed.  I note that a similar issue arises in regard to section 143(2) of the Children Act 2001 and I intend to bring forward an amendment at a later Stage in this regard.</p></speech>

It reads:<blockquote>In page 24, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:&quot;(2A) Where an inquiry is held under subsection (1) the child shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard and to respond to any allegation of disciplinary breach orally or in writing.&quot;.</blockquote>It is vital to ensure that the procedures that children encounter in detention settings are accessible to them in light of their age, vulnerability and often literacy difficulties.  While sections 17 and 18 make provision for the director of Oberstown Campus to hold an inquiry into an alleged breach of discipline and to inform the child of the breach and the time and date of that inquiry, it makes no express provision for the right of the child to be heard in such a situation but leaves it to ministerial regulations to prescribe the procedure.</p><p>Given that forfeiture of up to 14 days remission, which is an effective loss of liberty, is potentially at stake, we submit that the underpinning of the convention on the rights of the child to participate and to be heard would require that the child must be given an opportunity to be heard and to respond to any such allegations in the first instance.  While section 17 provides that the procedure relating to an inquiry may be prescribed by the Minister, we submit that the opportunity to be heard is of such importance both in terms of the child's rights and due process that it should be included in the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015.  We submit that where the sanction imposed is one of loss of remission, the reasons for the imposition of such a sanction should be recorded in writing and communicated to the child in language which is accessible to them.</p></speech>

The provision allows for the discretion of the director in deciding whether to hold an inquiry or not.  Where the director decides to hold an inquiry into a disciplinary breach, he or she shall inform the child of the alleged breach and the date and time of the inquiry.  Section 201(3), which is being inserted into the principal Act, provides for the procedure relating to an inquiry to be prescribed by the Minister.  The procedure prescribed would include matters providing for fair procedures such as providing the child with an opportunity to be heard and to respond to any allegation of a disciplinary breach.</p> <p>As I indicated on Committee Stage, it is intended that the operational and practical matters relating to such an inquiry will be prescribed and these will include matters relating to fair procedures for a child.  Matters such as giving the opportunity to be heard and to respond orally or in writing are basic principles of fair procedures and natural justice and will be incorporated in the regulations.  It is not proposed to incorporate some of the procedures relating to an inquiry in primary legislation and to incorporate other procedures in secondary legislation.  All matters relating to an inquiry by the director will be prescribed in regulations.  The issue of fair procedures proposed by the amendment will be comprehensively addressed in regulations to be adopted on foot of the enactment of section 17.

The most recent HIQA report, which was published in February 2015, found that the management of challenging behaviour in Oberstown was not consistently in line with best practice and single separation was used frequently and for long periods of time.  The report outlined the example of one child who was locked in a room for 83 hours and 45 minutes over a period of four days, including sleeping hours.  Given the concerns expressed about the management of challenging behaviour and the use of single separation, it is not clear why a prohibition on such treatment has not been retained in the new section 201.  Section 17 of the Bill substitutes alternative wording for Section 201 of the 2001 Act.  While permissible sanctions for breach of discipline should be set out in the new section 201A, it is prudent to also maintain an express prohibition on certain disciplinary sanctions.  Such matters are expressly prohibited under section 13 of the Prisons Act 2007 in respect of adults.  The original section 201 should be retained in any amendment under section 17 of the Bill, but with the addition of the word &quot;proportionate&quot;.</p></speech>

The proposed subsections would in the main replicate the existing section 201 of the 2001 Act.  The Bill proposes a new system of discipline to facilitate the introduction of remission in children's detention schools and to that end proposes a new section 201 to replace the existing section.  That and the following sections 201A to 201D, inclusive, provide for a new disciplinary regime to support the introduction of a system of remission of detention in children's detention schools.  In future the only system of discipline operating in detention schools will be as provided for in the Bill in the aforementioned sections.  Where a child is alleged to have breached discipline, the director will only be able to proceed in accordance with section 201.  He or she will have discretion to decide whether to hold an inquiry under the section but he or she will not have discretion to discipline a child in any other way, as was provided for in the existing section 201.  It would not be appropriate to operate two disciplinary regimes, one permitting a child to be disciplined on the instruction of a director, albeit with safeguards, and another providing for an inquiry by the director, with safeguards and operational procedures to be prescribed in regulations.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>While disciplinary provisions are included in the Bill, policy in this area must have regard to the fact that children's detention schools are not prisons.  It is necessary to preserve the child-focused model of detention.  For this reason, a series of provisions introducing the concept of good order will operate alongside a more codified system of discipline.  Good order relates to all of the steps that may be taken by staff or management to reduce, de-escalate and, where possible, stop instances of inappropriate behaviour by children in detention.  It is preventative in the sense that the ultimate aim is to interrupt a pattern of inappropriate behaviour and prevent it from evolving into an actual breach of discipline, which would result in the initiation of formal disciplinary procedures.  In this sense it is related to the concept of early intervention.  It also includes the concept of children learning appropriate behaviour and the prevention through learning of future inappropriate behaviour.  The consequences of a breach of good order will include verbal prompts by staff, informal warnings, conversations with the child and verbal suggestions or instructions to a child to leave a room or a place, such a sports pitch, or to go to the child's own room.  This may be contrasted with the concept of discipline, which is a more formal regime that will only be initiated at the discretion of a director of a children's detention school.  The system of good order will be outlined in rules to be adopted by the board of management under section 179 of the Children Act 2001 and regulations to be adopted by the Minister under section 221 of that Act.  The director of a children's detention school will have discretion to initiate the proposed system of discipline in the event of a repeated breach of a good order rule by a child which escalates to a disciplinary matter.  The proposed system of good order rules will be closely modelled on the care policies currently in place in children's detention schools.</p> <p>In regard to the proposed amendment, section 201A(1) outlines the sanctions permitted for a breach of discipline, namely, caution, reprimand, prohibition on certain recreational and other activities, forfeiture of pocket money or forfeiture of not more than 14 days of remission.  These are the only sanctions permitted following a finding of breach of discipline.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I intended to consider the matter further and to consult the Attorney General's office on it.  On consulting that office, I have been advised that the old list of prohibited sanctions in the 2001 Act existed in a context where there was no list of permitted sanctions.  Listing all inappropriate punishments is an unnecessarily difficult, bordering on impossible, way to prohibit them and creates the risk that a discipline not included in the list might be perceived as permissible.  The important point is that it is no longer necessary to incorporate a list of prohibited sanctions because the Bill solves the problem from the other direction by listing permitted sanctions only.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The new section 201B sets out a right of petition by a child to the Minister against the finding, the sanction or both.  It is unclear why the petition should be made to the Minister rather than a child friendly independent tribunal, such as the Ombudsman for Children.  While it is in line with the provisions in the Prisons Act 2007 in respect of adults, it does not take into account the vulnerabilities of children and the challenges a formal petition process might pose.  Given the existing remit of the Ombudsman for Children in regard to complaints taken by children in detention, a right of petition to that individual may be more appropriate than a petition to the Minister.  Furthermore, the section allows the Minister to obtain additional material from the director but it does not allow for additional interaction with the child.  While the Minister will be able to affirm, modify, suspend or revoke a sanction, it does not appear possible to affirm, modify or suspend a finding.  We propose that this provision be amended by adding the words &quot;and/or finding&quot;.</p></speech>
