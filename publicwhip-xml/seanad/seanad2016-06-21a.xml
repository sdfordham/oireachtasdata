It is no secret that I do not have a political bone in my body, and perhaps that is a good thing.  However, I take the role of Senator very seriously and for however long the Government exists, I will work tirelessly to help the mental health groups which are trying to bring about change in our mental health system and will support them every step of the way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joan Freeman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have put in motion the setting up of meetings with various interested reform groups, which have been relentless in their quest to bring about change.  I have pledged that I would be their voice on the inside and that I will highlight to all the political parties the need to bring about these recommendations.  However, because of my experience over recent weeks in the House, I am sure of the united consensus among all political parties and of their support and belief that the needs of the most vulnerable people in our society must be addressed.</p><p>Besides highlighting and helping mental health groups, pushing their agenda and resolving their concerns, I also have an agenda.  My heartfelt desire is to address the problems concerning our children.  The Taoiseach once said that Ireland is a great country to grow old in.  I hope, following this term in office, he will be able to say Ireland is a great country for our children to grow up in.  However, to do this, we must begin with the most defenceless, which are children with emotional and mental health problems.  They rely on our existing mental health services and they turn to the State for treatment, support and a brighter future, but I am sorry that we are very much letting them down.</p><p>Before I focus on the issues and difficulties facing us, I would like to emphasise that my concerns do not relate to the hard-working men and women in clinical services such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, because they are equally frustrated by the ever-increasing waiting lists and poor staff levels.  I am outraged about the grinding slowness of promised changes that these children have to endure, which expert groups have recommended but no one has listened to.  It is not only these groups that have demanded these changes.  In 1997, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, found that Ireland was in breach of its commitments in respect of the temporary placement of mentally ill minors in adult institutions due to lack of age-appropriate care places.  Despite these findings, the Mental Health Act 2001 has still not been reformed to provide for these children.</p><p>Let us consider the seriousness of the lack of urgency or commitment to change the existing admission procedures.  The Government may argue that, at the end of 2013, there was a 5% decrease in the admission of children to adult units but the Mental Health Commission reported yesterday that there was an increase at the end of 2015.  Five more children, giving a total of 95 children, were admitted to adult psychiatric units.  There will be reasons to justify their placement in these units - lack of beds, difficulty accessing beds outside office hours and difficulty in conducting assessments outside office hours and at weekends.  However, these are the same excuses that have been expressed for the past seven years since the Mental Health Commission issued an amendment to the code of practice relating to the admission of children.  Meanwhile, 15 years later, the Mental Health Act still ignores the fact that children are placed in adult units and, 19 years later, the Government continues to ignore the ECHR.</p><p>While the Minister of State's advisers may suggest the children are placed in these units for their own safety, many of them are placed in the psychiatric wards of general hospitals in which there are people experiencing significant mental health difficulties ranging from addiction to schizophrenia to dementia and eating disorders.  Everyone will recall the terrible tragedy on a psychiatric ward in a general hospital in Dublin where one patient stabbed another.  However, the Government is saying children are being transferred to a safe place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joan Freeman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many Senators have young children and teenagers and I call on them to imagine if one of their children had an eating disorder, was depressed or had suicidal thoughts.  If they were told that they needed to wait almost two years before they could be seen to, what would they say?</p><p>Many of us have been fortunate to enjoy a healthy childhood without having to experience the inadequacies of the mental health system.  Yet most of the children in our mental health system are waiting for us to help them.  We can help them.  We can help them to grow up and become well-balanced individuals despite their earlier difficulties.  With the right supports and care our children can put these difficult years behind them.  All of us, at some stage in our lives, have had a second chance.  I am asking that these children be given just one chance at leading a life like every other child.</p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State has come here today to listen to these issues and I hope she realises that I do not see my role as criticising her, the Department or, indeed, the Government.  Rather, I see my role as helping her achieve what the Government has promised for years, namely, a loving nurturing society in an environment that is full of dignity and respect and that will allow our children to look forward to the future.</p></speech>

She was allowed four minutes - usually people take two, but she took seven.  When I ring the bell it indicates that her time is up.  The trouble is that if I grant her latitude, someone will come along the next day and say that I gave Senator Freeman seven minutes.</p></speech>

I hope the Cathaoirleach will not take time from me now.</p> <p>I apologise to Senator Freeman; I was not aware that I was to take the first matter.  Hopefully we will be able to resolve that.  I thank the Senator for her contribution.  She has represented the people of Ireland regarding mental health for some time and I know she will continue to do an excellent job representing them in her new position.  I wish her the very best.</p> <p>The area of mental health continues to be a priority for the Government and, as the Senator correctly pointed out, for all people within the Seanad and Leinster House.  This is reinforced by the fact that funding for mental health this year will increase by &euro;41 million, or just over 5%, to approximately &euro;826 million, as indicated in the HSE national service plan.</p> <p>The reduction in the number of children admitted to adult psychiatric units has been a priority in recent years and I assure the Senator that it continues to be a priority.  Progress has been significant.  The Senator mentioned that the number increased by five last year.  However, in 2008 was it 247, and declined to approximately 95 last year.  We are making progress, albeit that last year there was a slight increase.  This is despite increasing demands on child and adolescent mental health services overall.  Such admissions are made for a number of reasons, including distance from particular centres - with families not wanting their children to be sent 40 km, 50 km or 60 km away - the timing of admissions late at night, possible medical issues, substance misuse issues, family concerns and overall safety.</p> <p>It is the policy of the HSE to provide an age-appropriate service, with a significant majority of young people now being treated by child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams.  While figures for 2015 show 95 admissions of children to adult psychiatric units, the number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as a child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  In 2015 there were 356 CAMHS admissions, of which 73% were to age-appropriate units and 27% to adult units.  The HSE works proactively to reduce both the number of and length of stay relating to such admissions.</p> <p>We are certainly not ignoring the issue.  While there was a reduction to 95 in the number of admissions of children to adult units, it is not acceptable for any child to be in that position.  Admissions of this nature should only take place when absolutely necessary.  We need to get to a position where zero children are admitted to adult units.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There has been a significant increase in CAMHS bed numbers in the past 12 months, which is where I think we can see an improvement, with 66 operational beds at present.  This improvement has been further assisted by weekly management of available beds nationally.  An example of progress is where an additional consultant resource has recently provided to the Eist Linn unit in Cork, which will bring the capacity there closer to 20 in the coming months.  I hope the number will increase and surpass 66, which would help to improve the position. </p><p>The HSE continues to roll out protocols for the placement of 16 to 18 year olds in line with the age appropriate placements, as local operational issues allow.  In regard to youth mental health, a continuation of investment in primary care responses to mental health, including the counselling services, Jigsaw projects, of which we have three rolling out this year in Cork, Limerick and Dublin, and early intervention approaches, is being developed.  The question of further enhancing youth mental health services in the forthcoming budget will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates process for 2017.  Currently, I am establishing a youth mental health task force to consider how best to assist our young people in developing resilience and coping skills to support their emotional well being at an early stage.  I hope that task force will be launched in mid July before we break for the recess.  </p><p>I assure the Senator I have taken on board the concerns raised.  I understand where the Senator is coming from and I look forward to working with her to, hopefully, improve the service.</p></speech>

If she wishes to put a brief question.  The problem is that 12 members requested Adjournment debate this morning and I had to refuse eight.  If the system was structured correctly we could take five instead of four.  When a Member raises a matter it is usually a brief question to the Minister who responds and the Member is allowed in again.  I will allow the Senator put a brief question.</p></speech>

On behalf of the nurses, midwives, medics and health care staff, I welcome the Minister of State to her post and hope to work collaboratively with her and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  I am raising the issue of the pending first phase of industrial action next week by the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  I ask the Minister of State to intervene.</p> <p>The dispute concerns the 30% shortage of psychiatric nursing staff, which means there are no community services and a chaotic health care system in our inpatient units.  According to A Vision for Change, the community input has not been implemented but that is for tomorrow's debate. In fact, more than 75% of its recommendations have not been implemented.  The approved centres which are the inpatient centres need to be staffed so there is nobody in the community to carry out modern health care services for our people, taking us from the Victorian age to fit-for-purpose services for the young, the old and new-borns.  There is not one mother and baby bed in the entire country for women.   Post natal depression or post natal psychosis, which has a huge impact on the nurturing and bonding of mother and child is prevalent among women.</p> <p>I am aware the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, is meeting the Psychiatric Nurses Association tomorrow with a view to implementing A Vision for Change.  I hope the Minister of State can intervene and set out a meaningful programme to build up our staff to stop the chaos in our hospitals and the overcrowding where beds are booked 120% of the time.  When somebody is sent on therapeutic leave and is doing well they are telephoned on Sunday and asked not to come back and then somebody else is taking the bed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, they are all registered as using that one bed.

I will touch specifically on the planned industrial action this week.  It is timely, therefore, that the Senator has asked the question.  While it was directed to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, it falls within our collective remit.  The Minister sends his apologies for being unable to be here.</p> <p>As the Senator pointed out, the Minister met representatives of the Psychiatric Nurses Association earlier this month prior to the completion of the ballot on industrial action.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend, but I hope to meet them tomorrow or later this week.  At the meeting representatives of the association outlined the concerns of their members about current and pending staff shortages and the need to focus on recruitment, retention and service development issues.  The Senator has outlined many of these issues.  Since the result of the ballot was announced there has been engagement between the HSE and the Psychiatric Nurses Association with a view to averting the industrial action which is due to commence on 29 June.  Following contacts between the parties, an initial meeting took place last Friday and another is scheduled for tomorrow.  Obviously, representatives of the Department of Health will attend that meeting.  At last week's meeting the representatives of the association again emphasised the significant recruitment and retention challenges mental health services faced, given the age profile of psychiatric nursing staff.  They also expressed concerns about the capacity of the system to implement A Vision for Change.</p> <p>I emphasise that the Government is committed to providing additional resources for mental health services.  As I mentioned in my previous address, this is shown clearly in the increase in funding for mental health services from &euro;785 million to &euro;826 million this year, an increase of 5.2%.  The Government is also committed to reinstating the full 2016 provision of &euro;35 million in new development moneys to enable service priorities in the mental health service to be progressed in line with A Vision for Change.  The additional funding will enable further recruitment to priority posts throughout the mental health sector and the ongoing development of community mental health teams.</p> <p>We face a genuine implementation difficulty in some areas, a point which has been acknowledged.  It does not relate primarily to a lack of funding and is far more a question of sourcing staff and reconfiguring services and structures.  Only this morning I spoke to officials about a particular post in respect of which there had been three recruitment drives, one of which was international.  Despite this, it has been difficult to fill the post.  There are, therefore, major challenges in this area.  Having said that, some 1,550 new posts have been approved, of which 1,150 have been filled since 2012, but there are still have many gaps that we need to fill.  The HSE is experiencing significant challenges in recruiting suitably qualified nurses in this area, with a significant gap between the number of nurses who are graduating and the positions that need to be filled.  In that context, the HSE has made provision for the rehiring of retired mental health nursing staff.  Some nurses have been rehired.  I realise there are a number of issues about the pay scale, something the Department and the HSE are addressing with nurses.  The HSE is focusing on facilitating the retention of these nurses and engaging to ensure this will happen.  It is also focused on streamlining recruitment processes, increasing the number of student places available, recruiting graduating nurses and ensuring permanent contracts can be offered to all eligible psychiatric nursing staff.  It is in the best interests of patients and nursing personnel that the parties engage constructively on the key issues involved in order that industrial action can be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>The Senator and I share the same objective, that is, improving the delivery of services to ensure the health service delivers the services it is supposed to deliver.  I am satisfied that the Psychiatric Nurses Association and the HSE are committed to continuing positive engagement and I will certainly do whatever I can to play my part in that process.</p></speech>

In the 1990s the level of funding for mental health services was 14%.  It is now somewhere in the region of less than 6%.  I become cynical when I hear that it will be increased by 5.2% and when talk year after year of the figures of &euro;41 million and &euro;35 million.  We never actually get our hands on that money, but it is announced as a new input every year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a cynicism in this regard but I hope the Minister of State will be able to write down in black and white where this money is coming from and where it will be allocated and confirm that it will be handed over as opposed to being retained.  There was outrage when the &euro;12 million was diverted from the mental health budget and lost in the other services that are seen as being less in the background than the Cinderella that has always been mental health services.<br/><br/>The Health Service Executive recruitment drive in recent years has been miserable.  At the most we have attracted one or two psychiatric nurses from abroad.  Most of them are too angry to come back.  They were forced to leave, and that is a quote from the HSE, as were other medical staff and doctors.  They were forced out by the yellow pack, degrading contracts.  There is not one of those in the country now, and we are very proud of that.  The then Government realised its <i>faux pas</i>in this regard.<br/><br/>Hiring retired staff is a possibility but I can tell the Minister of State that most of them cannot wait to get out the door due to burnout.  It is a physically, mentally and emotionally demanding job.  We try to do our best but when one is working in chaotic, understaffed conditions and watching the effects of those on patients and their families, it burns one out.  We too are human but it is to be hoped there will be some thinking outside the box that will allow us improve the health service, especially in the area of mental health, to ensure it serves the needs of the people.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the House.  I raise the important issue of Cork Airport and the link with the United States of America.  As the Cathaoirleach is well aware, last year Cork City Council, Cork County Council and the tourism bodies lent support to the publication earlier this year of the Growing Tourism in Cork strategy.  Central to that is the importance of Cork Airport and the need to see it connected with routes to North America.  Last year, 2015, was a good one for Cork Airport which saw the opening of 12 new routes and improved passenger numbers.  With the EU-US Open Skies agreement, now is the opportune time to have a transatlantic link between Cork and North America.  Norwegian Airlines stepped in and offered to provide a service between Cork and Boston, and prior to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and the general election, ongoing efforts were made at Government and EU level to have this link established.  However, there is an impasse on the American side.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The European Commission's Director General for Mobility and Transport was in Washington recently negotiating and pleading with the US authorities regarding the need to have this transatlantic link established.</p><p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Ross, for his earlier comments on this very important issue.  It is economically important for job creation, tourism and increasing footfall into Cork and the wider Munster region, but it also concerns the EU-US Open Skies agreement.  It is meant to stimulate the sector and see passenger numbers and travel eased and more options available to people as passengers.  We have a carrier in Norwegian Air International that is willing to provide this link, and the US cannot be allowed for whatever reason to pick and choose or engage in selectivism in how it allows for airlines or carriers to be involved.</p><p>I am conscious of the time and appreciative of the fact that I am raising this matter as Leader of the House, but it is a very important economic matter.  It concerns the granting of a licence.  It is about ensuring that the people in the area where I live and where the Cathaoirleach lives have that choice and that we can continue to grow the numbers in Cork Airport.  To be fair to the staff in Cork Airport, they have been putting together a submission based on the creation of jobs and new routes.  In a week when the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, visits Ireland, would it not have been opportune for the Vice President perhaps to have been here as part of the new transatlantic route out of Cork?  I hope that we can raise the matter with Vice President Biden during the course of his visit.</p></speech>

It is a good day to raise it, and I hope the message goes out to Vice President Biden that we are not happy with the behaviour of various groups in the United States over this blockage of an airline landing in the United States.  Senator Buttimer will also be aware that the Taoiseach has already raised this with the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and it has been raised at various levels around the world, certainly at EU level.  I met the EU Commissioner early last week and mentioned it to her.  She said that she was sick and tired of making telephone calls about this and that I could make that public and that they were tired of listening to her.  They are making every effort.</p> <p>This delay is totally unacceptable.  It would be opportune if the American Government moved on the issue fairly promptly and it would certainly be opportune if Vice President Biden made a statement on it in the coming days.  In this context I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this matter, which has been raised with me on a number of occasions and which I know is very important to the people of Cork and surrounding counties.  It is not just a Cork issue; it is an issue which affects us nationally and affects the international flying world.</p> <p>Cork Airport is recognised by the national aviation policy as a unique gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way and to Ireland's Ancient East, the two main tourism promotion initiatives currently underway.  Passenger numbers have fallen at Cork Airport each year since 2009 and have been slower to recover than at Dublin and Shannon airports.  A total of 2.07 million passengers travelled through Cork Airport in 2015, a decrease of 3.4% on 2014.  Significantly, however, passenger numbers began to recover in the final quarter of last year, and this positive trend has continued in 2016, with growth of 8% up to the end of May this year.  Cork Airport will launch nine new routes and services in 2016 and believes that passenger growth could be up by 8% for the year as a whole.  I am hopeful that one of these new routes will be the service to Boston by Norwegian Air International.</p> <p>NAI was licensed as an Irish airline in February 2014.  In August 2015 the airline announced plans to operate transatlantic services from Cork Airport, which was very welcome to us.  However, in February 2016 the airline had to postpone the launch of these services because the US Department of Transportation had not yet granted the airline a foreign carrier air permit.  This is a very regrettable situation as the proposed Cork-to-Boston route would be the first such transatlantic service from Cork and would be a very welcome boost to Cork Airport and the wider region.  It is my understanding that this is the first instance since the EU-US Open Skies agreement was introduced in 2008 that an airline has been prevented from launching a new transatlantic service due to a delay in approval being granted by the US authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We say this as a friend of the US and we are puzzled by the fact it cannot reciprocate.  This delay is clearly not in the interest of the many people on both sides of the Atlantic who had intended to avail of the new service.</p><p>When the EU-US open skies agreement was introduced, it set an example to the rest of the world of the benefits of the open skies policy and it had the interests of the customer at its heart.  The agreement was designed to encourage the type of new competition that the Norwegian group offers.  A tentative decision was made by the US Department of Transportation on 15 April last to grant the permit to Norwegian Air International, NAI.  This tentative decision was the subject of a public consultation which concluded in May and there is no clear timetable for a final decision to be made.  However, I look forward to that decision being confirmed as soon as possible so that the airline can start operating the new route from Cork to Boston and other new transatlantic routes.</p><p>This Government and the previous Government have supported NAI and the Cork to Boston route.  My predecessor, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have all made the case for NAI to the US authorities on many occasions.  I delivered the opening address at the recent IATA AGM, my first aviation-related public engagement and I reiterated this support for NAI.  In my address I emphasised my deep regret over the delay in granting the permit to NAI and the need for a continued move towards increased competition and further liberalisation in the aviation sector.  The European Commission has also been supportive of NAI from the outset.  Most recently, as referred to by Senator Buttimer, the EU Director General for Transport made strong public statements in support of NAI.  The Commission has confirmed that it reserves the right to take action under the agreement, including initiating a formal arbitration.  I hope that by confirming the tentative decision and granting NAI its permit there will be no need for this next step to be taken.  In the meantime, I and the Department will continue to liaise closely with the Irish Embassy in Washington, the Irish Aviation Authority and the European Commission, and we will continue to take the appropriate steps to help secure this important new service for Cork.</p></speech>

This latest gun attack in the heart of my constituency, just a short distance from my office, is of concern to me and the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  Less than half way into the year, seven people have lost their lives in the bloody war between two feuding families in this city.  While the circumstances surrounding yesterday's shooting remain unclear, it is clear that the measures introduced by the Government are failing miserably in curtailing gun attacks across Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to set out and explain what actions she intends to take to provide the Garda with resources and manpower it needs to effectively put the people running around the capital city with guns out of business.  It is unacceptable that any community is living in fear and waiting for the next gun shots to ring out.  I firmly believe the Minister and the Government have failed to comprehend the seriousness of the gun attacks in the capital city, the first of which took place in January, and that they have since failed to resource and support the Garda effectively in tackling crime head on.  It is for that reason that I call on the Minister to attend the House.  While I acknowledge arrests were made at the weekend owing to the increase in the level of surveillance, I also note that the armed response unit, for which &euro;5 million was announced in February, has yet to be set up.  I ask the Minister to examine the introduction of stricter sentencing legislation for the possession of firearms and perhaps the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for such offences.</p></speech>

The major mistake made was providing for privatisation.  It was an absolute disaster.  We all know what happened in Italy.  The Mafia controls the collection of rubbish.  What did we see happen here?  A while ago we had bin companies attack the lorries of others and burn them out in car parks.  That is pretty close to the activities of the Mafia.  The companies involved are not even registered in Ireland; they are registered in the Isle of Man and because of this we do not know whether they make a profit.  We pay for the collection of bins through the bin tax; we pay for water through water rates; we pay for roads through road tax, but for what is the revenue from property tax used?  I think it is used to pay off the gambling debts of the German and French banks.  We now have a situation where, as we heard this morning, 86,000 people have had money taken from their pension payments and other sources of income without their consent to pay the property tax.  Some 3,000 people were sent to the sheriff to have their goods distrained.  That is appalling.  This takes us back to the 19th century to rack-renting where if a peasant dared to improve his or her holding, the landlord shoved up the rent, which meant that he or she was punished.  What is now being done is exactly the same.</p> <p>Some 40 years ago I bought a house on North Great George's Street for &pound;25,000.  I have spent hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of euro on it.  I started the North Great George's Street Preservation Society and rescued No. 35.  I was involved in the transfer of ownership of many houses and although we rescued the street, what has been the result?  We have been punished.  The property tax has been increased, which is unspeakable.  People should not be taxed on their homes.  One's home should be inviolate.  I said the same about mortgages, that there should be a Minister with responsibility for home security to make sure Irish citizens would be able to stay in their own homes.  </p> <p>I look forward to the debate tomorrow because there is an awful lot more to this issue; there are some very shady takeover deals between the companies involved.  I do not believe they have been monitored properly by the authorities.  The situation is appalling.  It is part of a mass privatisation programme by the Government and I hope it will stopped in its tracks and that the process of privatisation can be reversed.  If half a dozen companies can make a profit, I do not know why Dublin Corporation could not at least run it on an equal basis.  Until recently in my area there were five or six refuse companies operating and every bloody day of the week we had bin lorries travelling up and down street at all times of the day and night.  As I said, I look forward to tomorrow's debate, but I use the opportunity to call on the Order of Business for something to be done about this matter.</p></speech>

I appeal to Irish people living in Britain and our comrades in the North of Ireland to vote in favour of staying as part of the European project.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I make this appeal because of the consequences of Brexit which have been outlined, not least the reinstatement of the Border and the impact this would have on the Thirty-two Counties.  There is learning in this issue for all of us because it shows how much the all-Ireland economy is dependent on relationships between Ireland and Britain, across all issues, including agriculture, fisheries, rural development, health and the economy.  The House could play a part in setting out a vision for how to integrate an all-Ireland strategy with all of the work we do.  While I welcome the increased co-operation between Ireland and Britain, it must continue and we must further examine developments in the British economy.  The most recent ESRI report indicates that Ireland will not reach the rate of growth forecast for next year.  The interdependence of the two states needs to be at the forefront of everything the Seanad does.  Above all, I encourage people to use their franchise later this week for the betterment of the Thirty-two Counties and the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

The higher education sector is at crisis point.  Students are being charged a steadily increasing fee to attend college under the guise of a contribution charge.  These increases and the corresponding decrease in State funding for higher education have had a noticeably negative impact on the quality of education.  We are seeing poorer graduate outcomes and a diminished global reputation, two crucial factors in attracting a diverse range of students from across the country and around the world.  The outputs of third level institutions provide &euro;10 billion for the economy and international students make a further economic contribution of &euro;1.3 billion.  While increasing investment in higher education has a major social impact, it also has a strong, noticeable and positive economic impact.  The wealth and progress of a country rely heavily on the level of educational attainment of its population.  The benefits of a publicly funded and accessible higher education system clearly outweigh the benefits of education enjoyed by the individual.  However, this is not reflected in State investment.</p> <p>When one moves to commodity education, universities are transformed into training centres influenced by industry which then requires a faster return on investment.  This commodification was exactly what was proposed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in a recent document prepared by departmental officials.  The move towards a &euro;4,000 annual fee, supported by a student loans system, will put higher education further out of reach of those who need it most.  The document in question also refers to the expected drawn out nature of the introduction of a student loans system.  If we intend to expend energy and valuable political capital in solving the higher education funding crisis, we should look towards a strategy that would benefit higher level institutions and students equally and would not bury young people in debt.  In a period of economic recovery it is time the State reinstated third level education funding to pre-crisis levels, possibly in the next three budgets.  Indebting young people limits opportunity and choice and pushes graduates into employment to meet loan repayments rather than pursuing the career they want to follow or changing employments as they wish.  We must continue to treat education as a public good. </p> <p>It is now more crucial than ever that we see publication of the Cassells report, the findings of which will provide the future framework of third level education.  The report has been delayed for eight months and the new academic year will start in a short time.  While some of the report's contents have been leaked, third level students deserve to know its full contents, but they are being left in the dark about the future of the third level sector and their financial commitments for the coming year.  In recent years it has become almost a given that the State can no longer afford to publicly fund third level education, but this is not true as it is becoming increasingly clear that the State cannot afford not to fund third level education.  This issue needs to be debated in the House before the next academic term commences.</p></speech>

A lot of work has been carried out previously on this Bill and I would hate to see it slip off the radar at this stage.  The former Deputy, Anne Ferris, did a huge amount on the legislation and it is a very important Bill.</p> <p>I also request information on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.  There was all-party agreement for the report compiled by the justice committee.  The Bill passed through all Stages in this House following a set of strong contributions made by many Senators and it had commenced Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Can the Leader ascertain the current status of the Bill and when it will be re-introduced?  It is a very important Bill in terms of protecting sex workers and the criminalisation that is taking place in that area.  I would be grateful if the legislation could be brought forward.</p> <p>In terms of the comments made by Senator Norris about bin workers and the waste charges for lifting the bins, I too look forward to the debate tomorrow.  Those who forced the privatisation, and in the process moved the service away from local authorities by a daily protest and encouragement of people not to pay waste management charges to their local authorities, are the very ones who generated the privatisation of the service.  As soon as the private sector moved in I did not see one protest against the private sectors companies.  When local authority workers carried out a very good public service throughout the country those same people were at the forefront of the protests, demonstrations and the locking of bin lorries into their yards, thus not allowing them to collect refuse in this city and in many parts of the country.  Therefore, I very much welcome tomorrow's debate.  It is an opportunity for us to hear the views of Members from different parties, but let us remember the forced privatisation through a non-payment campaign to local authorities.</p></speech>

Costello.  As Senators will know, he was the leader of Fine Gael, a Taoiseach and he also declared Ireland a Republic in 1949.  Up until that time, Ireland was an active member of the Commonwealth.  Relations are now at an all-time high with the new Commonwealth that has a population of 2.2 billion and is comprised of 53 countries, of which 33 are republics.  Since 1971, the Queen has only a titular role in the Commonwealth.  Now there is support for world peace, liberty, human rights, equality and free trade so it would be a good time to have a debate on whether the Republic of Ireland should consider rejoining the Commonwealth.  There are many Irish people and the Irish diaspora who live in the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, so we should not fear rejoining.</p></speech>

There is a need for a review of the workings of the Injuries Board that was established in 2004.  It is a State organisation that initially contributed to the reduction in premiums and the maintenance of cost of cost levels in terms of claims.  At this stage the high level of awards of compensation are soaring.  I refer here for instance to the compensation level here for soft tissue injuries.  For whiplash the average compensation is &euro;15,000 compared with &pound;5,000 or thereabouts in the UK.  There is a big difference in the awarding of costs for claims.</p> <p>There is also a significant number of fraudulent claims.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Government action is needed in this regard.  Fraud is widespread, with accidents being arranged and organised.  The level of damages awarded is soaring and the insurance companies have increased premiums by up to 50%.  This is making it very difficult for young people in particular to obtain or retain motor insurance and to carry out their work.</p><p>We have all come across cases of abuse of the insurance system.  I know of one case where an individual got a scrape on his car and received &euro;4,500.  Six months later he discovered that he had soft tissue injuries.  The doctor said it was fine and no problem at all because the claim had gone in.  The insurance company did not carry out a detailed examination or investigation of this individual, even though he had submitted numerous other claims.  The company settled for &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 because it did not want to incur the cost of medical advice, senior and junior counsel or solicitors.  Companies will just settle claims, but who pays?  The person who pays the premium carries the can at the end of the day.  It is about time action was taken.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss this issue.</p><p>We have people with a wide range of experience in this House.  Many of the professions are represented, including medical doctors, senior counsel, junior counsel, solicitors, lawyers and so forth, and they could give their views on the matter.  We want fair settlements and fair insurance premiums, particularly for young people.  We are paying for the Quinn Insurance collapse, uninsured drivers and so on.  These issues are all connected and who is paying?  Young people who want to drive a car are being victimised and I ask the Leader to consider a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

I heard a victim of cyber harassment on the radio, which colleagues may also have heard.  I was shocked to hear how the young woman endured an outrageous violation of her privacy when explicit pictures and a video were posted online by a disgruntled ex-boyfriend.  She was completely unaware that she was being filmed and that the film was online until somebody pointed it out to her.</p> <p>Currently, the investigation and prosecution of this type of activity is very poorly provided for under Irish law.  This leaves garda&iacute; with limited scope to act in such circumstances.  Irish legislation is very strong, thankfully, for child victims, especially regarding the distribution of child sexual images.  However, protections are far weaker for adults who have been seriously victimised on social media or online, including being depicted in intimate private photographs and videos.  Last year, the United Kingdom passed legislation making it illegal to disclose a private sexual photograph or film without the consent of the person depicted.  In the USA, 34 states currently have revenge porn laws, while Australia and New Zealand have also recently introduced state laws criminalising it.  Recent amendments to the 1951 Post Office (Amendment) Act, which criminalises the use of a phone for harassment purposes, include text messages sent by phone.  However, it is unclear if suspect activity on social media conducted online via a smartphone would be covered by this legislation, and because of the lack of prosecutions, there is no case law.  The fact that there is no legal deterrent in this country for anyone who wishes to violate a person's privacy in the most explicit way is totally unacceptable.  I am now calling for the introduction of legislation in line with that recently introduced in the UK to provide adequate protection for adults from the scourge of cyber harassment and revenge porn.  This affects women, men and teenagers and should be taken more seriously.</p></speech>

There was a lot of discussion in the House when Clerys vanished off the face of the earth leaving hundreds of workers unemployed.  Indeed, my colleague, Senator Nash, introduced some fairly good legislation in this area when he was a Minister of State.  Members of the IMPACT trade union who worked for Childminding Ireland are currently on strike and have been since 7 June because they were served with compulsory redundancy notices without any meaningful talks having taken place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The proposed redundancies are unnecessary.  Childminding Ireland is a State-funded body which is not experiencing financial difficulties.  Management has failed to produce a business case to justify these job losses.  IMPACT believes Childminding Ireland is illegally threatening redundancies to force administrative and specialist staff out of their jobs before replacing them with others.  Childminding Ireland has refused to engage seriously in consultation or conciliation organised by the Workplace Relations Commission, although it has misleadingly told journalists that it has conducted a four-month consultation.  In fact, no consultation has taken place, according to the union.</p><p>Childminding Ireland has had plenty of opportunity to explain why it thinks restructuring and redundancies are necessary, but it has consistently failed to do so.  It is clear that no business case has been put forward because no business case exists.  Although management has said the existing staff members will be able to apply for as yet unspecified new roles in a restructured organisation, the union believes the new roles are being constructed to exclude such people.  IMPACT remains available to resolve these issues through negotiations at the Workplace Relations Commission.  The trade union is trying to protect its workers before some fly-by-night dumps them on the street as happened in the case of Clerys.  I am not saying the State-funded body in this case is wrong in its belief that redundancies are needed, but I believe there should be some way of compelling it to go before the Workplace Relations Commission to justify what it is looking for.  It should be required to enter into meaningful negotiations.  It is outrageous that these people are protesting out on the street today.  I ask the Leader to address this issue with the relevant Minister.</p></speech>

We got rid of the jury system for deciding on the level of damages a number of years ago because we thought such a move would lead to cheaper insurance.  We then set up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board because we thought it would result in cuts in legal fees.  The insurance companies now want further cuts because they are still not satisfied.  Nobody is talking about the profits being made by insurance companies or the need for them to be upfront about why insurance costs so much in this country.  There is a need for an honest debate on the matter.  It is important to recognise that every time we go to pay insurance premiums, it costs us all more because of bad management within an insurance company, Quinn Insurance, where moneys were wrongly used.</p> <p>I understand that a committee has been established to deal with the ten-year health care plan.  There is no reference to any Member of the Seanad being on that committee.  It is important to emphasise that Members of this House can make a contribution to the debate on the plan.  I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Health on the inclusion of Members of the Seanad on the committee when it discusses the ten-year plan.</p> <p>The former Minister of State at the Department of Health, Kathleen Lynch, gave me a commitment in this House eight months ago that a report on the review of the fair deal scheme, particularly as it applies to farmers, would be made available in June 2016.  It is now June 2016 and I ask the current Minister to make that report available.  We need to have a debate on this matter.  It is extremely important that there is a level playing field for everyone under the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

However, when the union wrote to the Minister, effectively, she appeared to sit on her hands, saying it had nothing to do with her.  This Department funds the child care facility in question.  This facility has made these people redundant and, at the same time, told them to reapply for their jobs if they like.  Does this House see that as acceptable behaviour in the 21st century?  None of us should and, I believe, none of us would.  It is an issue of urgency.  These people are in their third week on strike and we need to have a response from the Minister.  Will the Leader urgently ask the Minister to address this issue?</p></speech>

Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills, or a representative on his behalf, to outline these procedures to the House?  The new school building project for Coosan national school in Athlone is a matter close to my heart, as it was for my late sister, Nicky McFadden.  For more than 16 years, we worked to get it on the new school construction list.  It was approved, completed stage 2B and was to go to construction in 2016.  However, we have been informed 66 buildings will go to construction this year but our school is not one of them.  There is a school in my locality which came online only two years ago, after Coosan national school, and whose construction will start next week.</p> <p>While I welcome the development, there is an unfairness in the process.  I would like if there was some transparency in the process to understand how and why some projects get jumped up the list.  Up to 65% of the pupils in Coosan national school are in prefabs.  Vital work is required on the existing school building over the summer which will not be cost effective if it is going to come online in 2017.  Will the Minister for Education and Skills explain to the House how one school, 16 years in the process, can suddenly be dropped while another school, only two years on the go, can suddenly go to construction?</p></speech>

This is rather odd, as it is meant to be Government policy that we allow and empower local authorities to make decisions over their affairs and operate within their budgets.  This is one of the common problems with the property tax because no one quite knows what they are paying it for or quite understands the autonomy of local authorities to manage their affairs in a professional way.</p> <p>I believe in water and waste charges.  The difference is I believe in fair water and waste charges, with the services being given to people explained to them.  There is a massive fiasco about waste with many people jumping for headlines and publicity, stating they are against this or that.  We have to pay for services.  People need to get real about this.  It seems to be the in-thing to say one is against everything.  I am in favour of water and bin charges.  One gives a good service and explains the costs while not ripping people off.</p> <p>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister, when he comes into the Seanad tomorrow for the debate on waste charges, to explain his intention in suggesting or directing that local authorities charge for citizens who take the trouble to manage their waste and take it to a civic bring centre?  These are the people who are proactive in segregating and managing their waste.  I would be against any charge for such a service.</p></speech>

Recently, I was asked to attend the local courthouse to see three businesses being dragged before the court like common criminals because they were in arrears with their local authority rates.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ray Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2303"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2303&amp;amp;pid=RayButler&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is happening all over the country, not just in my area but in everybody's area.  As the economy improves and grows, more local authorities are putting the boot down.  These businesses have survived during the past five or six years through a disastrous economic crash and should be put on pedestals for keeping their doors open.  Instead, they are being crucified.  We politicians have done nothing to address the issue.</p><p>The rates Bill dates back to the 1800s, and its only provision is that people must pay.  We all put on the green jersey two years ago when social clubs and GAA clubs needed help with the rates issue.  We introduced legislation, which was fantastic and right.  I appeal for politicians in this and the other House to do something with our draconian rates legislation.  Business owners who have employed people and paid their tax and VAT are being dragged before judges like paupers.  We need the legislation to change and we must debate it in the House.</p><p>We need to see companies' from the past five years and see whether they have broken even or lost money.  If they have broken even or lost money, we should consider helping them and, in some cases, wiping the debt.  In some cases, debt has been wiped and favouritism has come into play regarding rates in certain local authorities, whereas in other cases they have gone the whole hog to collect the money.  We should help these SMEs by introducing legislation.  The legislation should provide for us to calculate rates based on profits rather than on the square footage of the premises.  A premises in a small rural town, where five people might pass the door in one day, might pay the same rates as the Blanchardstown Centre, where thousands of people pass through the doors.  It is ludicrous.  I call on the Minister to come here to debate the issue and help these people who have kept their doors open and who have helped rural communities, but who are now being slaughtered and dragged down.  What I see is disgraceful.</p></speech>

I support the contribution of my colleague, Senator Rose Conway-Walsh, and ask the Leader to maintain the pressure on his Government colleagues and all Members of the Oireachtas on Thursday's Brexit referendum.  I will leave this institution on Thursday after the conclusion of business to go back up the road to vote in the referendum.  When I was travelling down to the Seanad last week, I sat across from two young American tourists who were heading from Belfast to Dublin.  They asked an elderly gentleman in the carriage whether anybody would stop them at the Border to check their passports and papers.  I interjected by saying, "Not yet."  This is a fear and concern, among many others, not least about the impact on our economy, infrastructure, agriculture sector and the longstanding and important contribution the EU has made to the peace process and the political process in the North through institutions and through the very significant funding streams to build peace and justice initiatives.  I ask the Leader to maintain this pressure.</p> <p>The Government has played a very proactive role.  The Taoiseach and other colleagues have been to the North, which I welcome.  They have also travelled across the water to Britain to encourage the Irish community there to vote.  I ask Members to maintain this pressure and, if they have friends, colleagues or relatives in Britain or the North, to ensure they use their vote on Thursday.  I say this as an individual and as a party member who has many concerns about the EU as it stands, not least regarding the democratic deficit and the erosion of national sovereignty.</p> <p>I am amazed and shocked at Senator Feighan.  He is no longer in the Chamber.  I hope he is outside reflecting on what he proposed.  If I am worried about the democratic deficit in the EU, I would certainly be worried about a democratic deficit in the British Commonwealth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am amazed that in 2016, 100 years after the Easter Rising, when the ideals and visions have not been fulfilled yet, that a member of Fine Gael would come in here-----</p></speech>

I refer on this occasion to insurance companies, not banks.  An elderly woman in my home town was unable to pay her car insurance premium by postal order.  She sent her postal order to the insurance company but it was returned and the company demanded that she pay by credit card.  Ultimately, she had to get a family member to supply a credit card number.  There is a cohort of older people and people from a certain socioeconomic background who have limited options when making payments.  It is scandalous that an insurance company will not accept a postal order, for which a person has presented cash to the post office.</p> <p>This undermines services provided by An Post.  I can give someone a postal order to pay a bill and he or she can lodge it in a bank similar to lodging a cheque.  I am bewildered that this company would not accept a postal order.  This demonstrates haughtiness and the fact that it can get away with it.  I would like the new Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House to discuss issues relating to our post offices, including sustaining the network, which is always topical.</p> <p>I previously raised the issue of us trying to stimulate more commercial business for the post office network to make sure it has a future and that it can engage in activities that provide a service to the community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want that excellent post office network to remain in place.  The Bobby Kerr report was commissioned so that avenues could be explored and developed to make this happen.  I would like the Minister to come before the House to outline the progress made within the working groups and, in particular, to pursue the issue I raised of post offices being allowed to process and handle driving licence applications on account of the new tender procedure being pursued by the Road Safety Authority.  This would bring matters in line with the system for passport applications and create new business.  It is another way to sustain post offices.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come before the House because this is an issue that affects the entire country, throughout which the post office network is spread.</p></speech>

She raised two very important issues, namely, business being taken away from post offices and the fact that postal orders, which are part and parcel of post office business, are not being accepted by insurance companies, which is outrageous.</p> <p>The Senator also referred to driving licences.  As we know, there are only one or two locations in each county for people to get or renew a driving licence.  When the licence process is put up to tender, the post office would be an ideal partner for the centres that issue driving licences.  Post offices could process licence applications and then forward them to the licensing authority or office.  This would eliminate the need for people to travel 40, 50 or even up to 100 miles to get to a centre where they can renew their licences.  For the remote parts of the country, the post office is an ideal place to process driving licences.  People would be able to go there with their photographs and applications and send them on to the licensing authority, and then their licences would be issued them in a couple of days, a week or whatever.  I fully support Senator Mulherin's request for the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources to come to the House to discuss the viability of post offices throughout the country.</p></speech>

Dublin might not need it, as evidenced by the huge increase in the rates for hotel rooms here.  I admit that there are not enough hotel rooms in Dublin and I hope there will be expansion in that regard with another building programme.  I am concerned with Ireland beyond the Pale.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to make representations to the Minister for Finance on this matter.  If it can be afforded, I hope the Minister will be able to ensure, in the context of the forthcoming budget, that the VAT rate to which I refer will remain in place.  It is very important for the future of tourism.</p> <p>I do not want to refer to Brexit; we will wait to see how matters turn out on Thursday.  I would hate to think what would happen to tourism if the British left the EU.  The value of sterling would decrease - they are getting great value here at present.

It is, I suppose, the elephant in the room in terms of people with homes.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the relevant Ministers to come before the House for a wide-ranging debate on whether the current insolvency regime is fit for purpose.  An appeal mechanism was introduced to allow people to appeal decisions to the Circuit Court.  I have heard anecdotal evidence that many home owners are not availing of this appeal mechanism.  Why is that the case?  We should have a debate on that matter in the House.  The family home is very important.  This issue of people not paying their mortgages for more than two years is extremely important.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the relevant Ministers to come before the House for a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom d&aacute; bhf&eacute;adfadh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin a bheith againn roimh bhriseadh an tsamhraidh.  Chomh maith le sin, the summer economic statement published today makes for positive reading.  However, it does not take into account some of the risk factors for Ireland, one of which was mentioned by our Sinn F&eacute;in colleague - Brexit - but there are many others, including the financial regulation of banks and many other institutions, some of which were highlighted in the banking inquiry.  There are financial, economic, demographic and political risks facing the country.  Year on year, we are overspending in the area of health, yet we are unable to meet from the perspective of the public purse the demographic challenges posed by an ageing population whereby up to 4% of the population will need nursing home care by 2025.  I, therefore, call on the Leader to facilitate a debate with the relevant Minister or Ministers across a range of Departments on the plans being put in place to meet the challenges poses and ascertain the level of risk across each Department.  It might mean many Ministers having to come into the House, but we should be looking at the issue in the context of a five or ten year spending plan.  The medium-term objective announced today makes for positive reading, in that it recognises a fiscal space of around &euro;3 billion in 2019.  Some of the money will be put into a savings scheme similar to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but it is not a great deal of money when the challenges mentioned are brought into the equation.  I ask that we look at the challenges facing the country and that the Leader consider the best way to debate the issue.</p></speech>

This city has been ravaged by the recent gangland assassinations.  We all need to be on the alert to and highlight the issue.  The Minister would be welcome to come to the House for a debate on it in the near future and I call on the Leader to facilitate my request.</p> <p>I also call for a debate on tourism.  It is an opportune time to have such a debate, given that the weather has been reasonably good in recent weeks and many more people are visiting the country.  I note the concern expressed by my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, about Brexit and the potential detrimental effect if the United Kingdom was to leave the European Union.  The tourism industry is going well, but we cannot become complacent in any circumstance.  I commend RTE for its programme on the Wild Atlantic Way.  The scenery is phenomenal and the programme showed the authentic Ireland.  The production should be made available to other channels to be shown throughout the world.  The programme broadcast last Sunday night was incredible.  Tourism has the potential to create thousands of jobs in many parts of the country.  We, therefore, need to up our game constantly to ensure the services and facilities provided for those who visit are second to none, that the experience is kept authentic and that we do not destroy it.  I would like in early course, perhaps before the end of term, given that we are in the summer season, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House to hear statements on tourism over a couple of hours and to outline his vision for its potential development, both in rural and urban areas, in the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-21a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062100002#Y00300"><p>I thank the 24 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business with remarks.  Senators Ardagh and Conway raised the issue of crime, in particular in Dublin's inner city.  The success of Operation Thor has shown that crime has fallen throughout the country.  Any loss of life is to be deplored.  I commend the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on their vigilance and surveillance last weekend when they apprehended criminals in and around Senator Ardagh's constituency.</p> <p>The Government is committed to recruiting more garda&iacute;.  We have reopened Templemore.  There are new garda&iacute; at work, with a target of 15,000 garda&iacute; to be recruited by the end of the Government's term of office.  Equally, we have seen additional resources and moneys being put into Garda overtime, vehicles and equipment.  I agree with Senator Ardagh and Senator Conway that we cannot be complacent regarding crime.  We must work consistently on crime with all the stakeholders.  Only yesterday, I attended a policing forum in Cork city, where crime is down 53%.  That is a positive.</p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in motion tomorrow will discuss the issue of refuse charges.  Senators Norris, Humphreys and Boyhan raised the issue.  We need to see this issue redressed and addressed.  There is no way we can allow gouging or the rip-off of customers by any of those involved in the industry.  To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has worked hard since the issue became politicised by some.  All of us on this side as well as those in Fianna F&aacute;il are concerned about protecting the consumer.  We must change our model of waste disposal.  As I said last week in the House, we cannot allow a situation whereby a customer, no matter who he is or where he is from, has his bills increased.  Senator Boyhan is correct.  People must be cognisant that they have to pay something somewhere and that there is nothing for nothing anymore.  That is a fair comment.</p> <p>Senators Conway-Walsh, O'Donnell, Feighan, Coghlan and Conway raised the issue of Brexit.  I join all of them in the call for all of us who are in favour of a Remain vote to ensure it is realised in the coming days.  It is good that all the political parties in the Chamber today are in favour of the Remain side of the argument.  In particular, it is right that we address the North-South issue and the Border.  Those of us who are of an era have no wish to see the Border posts return.  We have changed from that and our country is a better place now.  The issues of trade, connectivity and commerce are important.  The whole issue of North-South relations is relevant, be it the Good Friday Agreement implementation, British-Irish relations or working in the institutions.  Everyone will benefit from the UK remaining within Europe in terms of how the peace process can continue.  I hope that in the coming days all of us in this Chamber will exhort a Yes or Remain vote.  That is critical.  Again, I implore people to use whatever means they can to urge for a Remain or Yes vote.  In particular, the all-Ireland strategy is one that I embrace and wish to see pursued.</p> <p>Senators Ruane and McFadden raised, in different guises, the issue of education.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is prepared to come to the House once he gets the Cassells report.  I understand the Cassells report has not yet been concluded and has not been presented to him.  I agree with Senator Ruane's comments about higher education funding in that the issues of expenditure and funding are linked.  I note that the issue of resources, in the context of universities seeking funding for research and development, has become part of the business plan.</p> <p>The other point Senator Ruane made is important as well.  We cannot recreate barriers to third level education and we must be open to allowing people to continue to become part of the post-primary school education system.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys raised the issue of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  My understanding is that it is in the D&aacute;il at the moment.  It is working its way through the D&aacute;il and awaiting the appointment of select committees in the D&aacute;il.  We can raise the issue of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill with the Minister.</p> <p>Senators Leyden and Burke raised the issue of insurance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Leyden is right, and we will facilitate a debate on that issue.  </p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised a very important point.  He was a member of the body that reported on medical indemnity insurance.  The Government is very much concerned about the issue of the rising cost of car insurance.  The Minister for Finance has engaged with the Central Bank and other stakeholders to examine the issue and report back to Government.</p><p>Senator Noone raised the important issue of cyber harassment and revenge porn.  Listening to "Today With Sean O'Rourke" this morning one could not but have been struck by the powerlessness of the strong victim who was interviewed.  Having initially overcome the distress caused she became empowered and took her battle to the person who was harassing and abusing her.  The Law Reform Commission has submitted a piece of work to the Government but all of us in this House need to see some movement on legislation because this is not just about women; it is about men also.  In the era of social media there are cameras on smartphones throughout the world and the issue highlighted by that victim this morning is one to which many families can testify and on which the Government must have a response.</p><p>Senators Craughwell and Gallagher raised the issue of child care and the workers currently before the Law Reform Commission.  It is important that those who engage in any process on behalf of the State would engage fully and properly.  I will take up the issue with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, on the Senators' behalf because it is important that workers, particularly in this sensitive area, get a hearing and that a resolution can be found.</p></speech>

I raised that issue last week in the House.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I hope the other party leaders might write to the Minister with a view to having representatives from Seanad &Eacute;ireann as part of that committee and having a joint Houses approach to the issue of the ten-year health strategy.  This is an important issue and it is important that there is representation from this House on that committee.</p> <p>Senator McFadden raised the issue of school building projects.  I suggest the Senator might submit a Commencement matter on that issue.  I agree with her that we need to have transparency in school building programmes.</p></speech>

The 9.5% VAT rate was introduced with a view to incentivising the tourism industry.  Our tourism numbers have gone up, but it does not endear the travel or the hotel industry to anybody to see the cost of hotel rooms increasing.  It makes no sense.  I appeal to the tourism industry in this regard and I will bring the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport into the House at the earliest convenient time to have a discussion on the issue of tourism and these costs.</p> <p>Labhair na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &Oacute; Clochartaigh agus &Oacute; Domhnaill mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.

I understand that she won a seat in the May 2015 general election, retaining the seat for the Labour Party and increasing the party's share of the vote.  She was a campaigner on issues relating to the Syrian civil war and worked tirelessly for refugees.  What we should remember about Jo Cox is that, apart from her political career, she was a mother, she has a husband and she has children.  Her political career was cut very short and in a very untimely way by this dreadful act, which unfortunately can happen to any politician in what we call modern, civilised western Europe.  It is an appalling event, so without saying too much on it, I offer my condolences to her family, colleagues and friends at this extremely sad time.  It is a horrific vista, and it is appropriate that the Leader and this House give a brief time to allow for expressions of condolences following this horrific event across the Irish Sea.</p></speech>

She was a wife, a mother and a parliamentarian, and from all we have learnt of her since her tragic death one cannot but be touched by the sincerity of her motivation and her diligent representation on behalf of her constituents.  In the wider context her death must be seen as an attack on democracy, and all of us who cherish democracy resent very much the manner in which she was callously killed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To her husband, children and members of the House of Commons, we send our deepest sympathies.</p></speech>

Like everyone else, I did not know the lady.  From what I have read, however, she was an excellent parliamentarian.  She had previously been head of policy at Oxfam and brought many skills and much experience to her job as an MP.  She was going about her daily duty, holding a clinic like any of us would, and she was gunned down and stabbed.  What happened was an affront to democracy.</p> <p>When I looked through the various accounts in the media, I saw that her husband, Brendan, issued a statement after her malicious stabbing.  He said people would fight against the hatred that killed her.  I want to put this matter in its broader context.  In recent years we have seen a terrible polarisation in politics and life.  People have been forced to take up positions.  The middle ground is now seen as something to be frowned upon.  This has not done justice to the ordinary people.  I ask that we reflect on the type of politics we want.  We can have diversity but it should not come down to the physical.  There would be no more fitting tribute than if Brexit was passed in her honour.</p></speech>

It is difficult to exaggerate the shock felt at the sad news of her murder.  The big question relates to why this happened.  When we hear further details, there does not seem to be an answer to that question.  We have gone so far in the western democratic world, safe in the knowledge that public representatives who are there by the will of the people and by our say are safe and will not endure physical harm, because to do so would be an attack on us, on democracy, on the State and on the will of the people.</p> <p>The murder of Jo Cox makes no sense.  Even after we know more about the killer, it makes no sense because the democratic process requires us to follow a particular path in order to achieve our goals rather than resorting to physical violence.  Such violence is never the answer.  What will it do?  It will give rise to another election, which could mean the election of somebody on the same course and with the same political objectives as Jo Cox.  It inspires us all to dig deep and hold fast to law and order, justice, the safety of the person and freedom of expression.  This is what we believe civilised beings should do.</p> <p>This meaningless act of violence should prompt us to examine what goes on here.  I will briefly mention what happened during the height of the water charges controversies and what was visited upon the then T&aacute;naiste.  My office was petrol bombed.  There did not seem to be boundaries as to what could be done, particularly with regard to threats.  There is a line and if one crosses it, there is a big price to be paid.  We hold fast to this line.  Today we think of Jo Cox and her family.</p></speech>

Our sympathy, thoughts and prayers are with her husband and two beautiful children, who must be so proud of their mother and wife.  We cannot imagine the heartbreak her husband and two children are feeling.  This cold-blooded hateful murder was an attack on democracy and an insult to our core human values.  As public servants, the act has instilled shock, horror and fear in many of us in light of the fact all of us have similar routines in our constituencies doing very valuable clinic work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We join parliamentarians from across all democratic nations in sympathising with her loved ones and will remain united against hate and extremism.

No one who had seen video clips of Jo over the past few days could fail to be impressed by the smiling, bubbly character that she exuded.  She was someone who had already walked the walk in helping people at home and abroad through her work with Oxfam and in her constituency.</p> <p>I am sure that I am not on my own, but I must confess that I had never heard of Jo before last week's tragic events.  While it is important that we hear about her now and appreciate her life, it is sad that she did not get more media attention while she was with us.  Many people have said that she was a breath of fresh air in politics and the type of person that they would like to see in politics - positive, generous, hard working, dedicated and so much more.  What a fantastic ambassador for women in politics she was.  So much potential cut short.  My sympathy to her husband and children, her extended family and friends, her party and all who knew her.

I express my solidarity with the family of Jo Cox and the sympathies of Sinn F&eacute;in's Senators to her husband, Brendan, her two young children, her constituents and the British Labour Party.  She was a mother, sister and daughter whose life was taken in horrific circumstances.</p> <p>Jo showed through her previous career helping terrified and vulnerable people fleeing the most terrible violence in Syria that politics could still attract those with sincere motives and the will to work for social justice.  Above all else, Jo Cox was a public servant and a worker who was murdered in her place of work.  This in itself is a worrying development for those of us whose daily job means meeting the public.  As Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and Teachta&iacute;, we are only representatives of the people.  It is only through meeting and engaging with those whom we are sent here to represent that politics has any meaningful impact on people's lives.  That such a basic function of democracy can come under attack is despicable.</p> <p>Being on the receiving end of violence and abuse is not the preserve of any political party, but public representatives of our party have been shot and, indeed, killed over the years.  What Jo Cox's husband said about sending a message of unity instead of hatred was poignant.  Freedom of speech is needed and diversity of opinion must be protected.  Robust, passionate debates are an integral part of political life, but the aggressive and violent targeting of individuals because of their opinions or stances on particular issues is wrong and will always be so.  This happens at all levels.  I was only a short time in local politics when a man entered my office, banged on the desk and told me that if I did not stop my "nonsense" about domestic violence, I would be very sorry.  I have received the most vile anonymous correspondence and telephone calls and bullying on social media.  I am not alone in that; many other men and women receive the same verbal abuse.</p> <p>The role of some elements of the media in inciting hatred of particular politicians is gutter, inhumane behaviour and reflects more on their negative core beliefs and values.  This must stop.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This hatred for politicians fostered by some journalists is a huge barrier to many young women and men entering politics.  One might ask why any sane person would want to enter the most hated profession in the world.  The profession of politics requires one to stand up for justice and for what one believes in but also makes one a target for abuse.  If we are to genuinely honour the legacy of Jo Cox, we must unite against hatred and against the vilification of people just because of the political party to which they belong or the views they hold.  We must all stand together, across all parties, against that at all times.</p></speech>

She was a mother, wife, idealist, pragmatist, achiever and above all, before she went into representative politics, she was a woman who had proven her worth by rolling up her sleeves and becoming involved in real causes for real people.</p> <p>We are reminded too of the fact that politicians are vulnerable, whether it is the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, the US politician Gabrielle Giffords or the former Member of this House, Senator Billy Fox, who lost his life in 1974.  Politicians are utterly vulnerable and utterly at the hands of those who put their own ideas before the right to life of others.</p> <p>I agree with what has been said in the House today.  We have to set our faces against the coarsening of political discourse.  We have to vindicate high standards in democratic politics.  We must have a society in which no Deputy or Senator going to his or her constituency office or place of work feels a sense of fear and loathing.  We have to have a political system where nobody is subjected, as former Taoiseach Brian Cowen was, to vilification when he attended the Arbour Hill ceremonies and to appalling behaviour as he returned to his car as a private citizen, as seen on YouTube.  As was pointed out by Senator Conway-Walsh, we must have a system where those who go into politics are not frightened out of it by having their tyres slashed, cars scraped and so forth outside meetings they attend in the course of their work.  </p> <p>If anything good comes out of a sickening tragedy such as this it must be that the Members of this and the other House join in solidarity with the members of the House of Commons in England, as fellow parliamentarians who associate with each other through various institutions, to vindicate real democratic values.  </p></speech>

Sadly, neither her five year old son nor her three year old daughter will ever know the great humanitarian who was their mother.  Sadly, her children will not experience the woman who believed that motherhood was the greatest joy and surpassed all political ambition.  We must ask what crime this beautiful woman committed.  Why was it that she should have her young life taken?  Was it because of the Brexit referendum?  That would be an easy answer.  We could all possibly live with the idea that some deranged person, driven by a passion for one side of the Brexit debate saw himself as doing a service to the cause.  While there may be some merit in this hypothesis, it does not provide an answer.  The truth is that we are living in an ever more violent society.  Hate is a growing phenomenon in the modern world.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Social media have become the vehicle for some to vent their hatred.  Politicians, the religious, sportspeople and others are now subjected to some of the most horrendous outbursts of hate.  Since the Brexit debate started, there has been an onslaught of racist commentary.  Has anyone in the United Kingdom been charged with incitement to hatred?  In Ireland we have laws on incitement to hatred, but they are infrequently used.  I would like to refer to one case.  A man who had created an extremely offensive Facebook page was prosecuted under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 for his online activities.  The case which came before the courts in 2011 serves as a useful warning to those who would propagate hatred on social media.  People should know that in Ireland the ordinary libel laws apply to whatever is said or published.  It is time for us to use the laws available to us to stop this scourge.  There can be no room for hate at any level of our society.  It needs to be challenged both at home and internationally.  I refer, for example, to the gun laws in the USA where some 65 Senators have been described as "spineless" for voting yesterday to reject four measures that would have restricted gun sales, including the sale of guns to people on the federal terrorism watchlist.  What does that say about the war on terror which has turned the Middle East into a tinder box of violence?</p><p>In Ireland we can do little for the Cox family.  We cannot return a loving mother to her children.  We cannot turn the tide of hate that led to her death.  However, we can resolve to do our bit to challenge hate.  We can try to subject those who use hate as a weapon of intimidation to the full rigour of the law.  We can try to hold the owners of social media sites which are rapidly becoming platforms for hate responsible for what is published on such sites.  We do not need new legislation; we simply need to use what is already available.  As we extend our sympathy to the Cox family, let us tell her children that Jo made a difference and gave her life to teach us tolerance.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam.</p></speech>

She brought generosity of spirit, compassion and determination to every aspect of her wonderful life, including her personal relationships, her work for her constituency of Batley and Spen and her career in global development.  Her work for Oxfam brought her to some of the most wartorn places in the world.  She campaigned tirelessly for humanitarian relief and peace in these regions.  She worked across party lines to achieve her goals and she never faltered in her determination to improve the lives of the world's most marginalised people.  Every life counted in her eyes.  She recognised the beauty and potential in every human being, from the refugee children of Syria and the members of communities caught in conflict in Darfur to the women who died needlessly in childbirth.  She did her utmost to give a voice to those without one and direct the eyes of the world to issues it would sometimes like to forget.</p> <p>Jo Cox was a passionate champion for gender equality.  She played an active role in the women's movement.  Like many members of the Civil Engagement group, she decided to step out of civil society because she wanted to see what she could achieve in representative politics.  Her family has described how she entered Parliament because she wanted to be in the engine room of change.  She had a respect for the importance of political debate, a determination to translate that respect into meaningful action and a willingness to reach across the aisles to do so.  This stands in sharp contrast to the hostile and authoritarian approach taken by the groups the rhetoric of which seems to have influenced her attacker.  Of course, there has been deep and widespread concern about the racist and politically divisive motivations expressed in her killing.  Surely, therefore, we must heed the message of her husband, Brendan, who has called on us to honour her legacy with a united response against the poison of hatred in all its forms.  Such hatred must not be allowed to corrode the political process or public trust in it.  Democracy must not be intimidated.  Barriers must not be placed between public representatives and the public space in which they represent the people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I agree that there is a question for the media to look to its role and the language it uses.  It should use responsible language in how it engages in these issues.  It is heartening, however, to see how so many have chosen to honour Jo Cox with a counter-flow of love and positivity in recent days, for example, with the raising of funds for groups such as HOPE not hate.  One strong part of Jo's legacy, a powerful legacy which her children must surely be proud of and which all of us can learn from, must be the words of her maiden speech, "we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than the things that divide us".  These words must inspire us to closer and more constructive collaboration as parliamentarians, but they must also inspire us as Irish, European and global citizens in a shared world.  Yesterday was world refugee day.  On the streets of Dublin, United Against Racism marched.  In towns and communities throughout the United Kingdom and the world people came together to send a message of solidarity to the 65 million people who are now displaced, more people than at any time in history.</p><p>Jo Cox was a passionate advocate for these people driven from their homes by the scourges of conflict and climate change.  She said these people have been forced to stay and face starvation and persecution or make a perilous journey in search of sanctuary.  One way those of us in Ireland can honour her is by offering sanctuary to the men, women and children forced to risk their lives.  Europe cannot be allowed to step away from its human rights principles.  Let us commit to honour Jo Cox by working together across all barriers to bring about a more inclusive and equal Ireland and world.</p></speech>

I stand to pay tribute to Jo Cox, MP, and join the tributes being paid by others as leader of the Labour Party group in the House, as a woman Labour Party public representative and as a mother of two young children, as Jo Cox was.</p> <p>The shocking and horrific murder of a young talented MP with a bright future in the British Labour Party was an attack on democracy.  She was a devoted mother and wife, a keen activist on humanitarian issues and a former aid worker who spent more than a decade of her life on the front-line of aid provision in the developing world.  Her death has shocked and moved people throughout the world and in Ireland.  Tomorrow would have been her 42nd birthday.  I and my Labour Party colleagues are proud to wear a white rose for Yorkshire in Jo Cox's honour.  She was a feminist; she fought hard for women's rights internationally and nationally.  She had an incredible record of activism on a range of issues in her short life.  She was director of the maternal mortality campaign to stop women and babies dying needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth.  She had chaired the Labour Party women's network in Britain and was a tireless campaigner for gender equality as well as development issues.  Others have mentioned her work with Oxfam.  She was Oxfam's head of global policy, having been an aid worker previously.  Since being elected for the first time a short time ago for the constituency of Batley and Spen in Yorkshire she had made some articulate and passionate speeches.  Others have quoted from those speeches.  I believe those speeches will continue to inspire young people, especially women, to enter politics in future.  I have in mind in particular her speech in April in support of the Alf Dubs amendment on the need to bring unaccompanied refugee children to Britain.</p> <p>While the upcoming referendum on British membership of the European Union should not cloud over the horrific attack on democracy represented by the murder of Jo Cox, it does have important lessons for us.  First, the need for respect in debate and respect for the views of others.  Probably all of us in this House and people elsewhere have been subject to hate mail, as people in public life tend to be.  However, I believe her death showed the need to tone down debate.  We have seen recognition in Britain this week that the debate had to become less heated, nasty and violent in tone.  As many commented, the day of her death was also the day the infamous UKIP poster headed "Breaking Point" was released, reaching a new low in the already ugly campaign being run by the Leave side in support of Brexit, a campaign already tainted by racism but which, with that poster, showed a really horrible depth.</p> <p>Second, Jo Cox's death reminds us that her career and outlook on politics was eminently international.  She was a woman who was simultaneously proud of her Yorkshire roots and her constituency of Batley and Spen but also seriously involved in international issues and the need to welcome refugees.  This was particularly important at a time when we are seeing the greatest displacement of refugees of any time in history as well as the impact of climate change and grave issues around international conflict.</p> <p>She had worked on an all-party parliamentary group on Syria with Tory MP, Andrew Mitchell, who was among the many MPs who paid moving tributes to her in the House of Commons yesterday.  Our thoughts now are with her husband, Brendan Cox, her two young children, Leila and Cuillin, her grieving parents, her sister and family.  We should recall, as her husband said, that her death must show us that love is stronger than hate and that what unites us is stronger than what divides us.</p></speech>

I am keen to place emphasis on what she believed in, which is far more important than what the person who murdered her believed in.  Jo Cox was a person who believed in the human dignity of all individuals, regardless of who they were or where they came from.  This is something we should reflect upon because often in Irish society and public discourse we tend to label people and undermine their humanity.  This leads to inequality, prejudice and fear.</p> <p>It is important that anyone thinking of entering politics, especially young women, would be inspired by Jo Cox and not fearful of what happened to her.  We live in an era of harsh public discourse.  Sometimes it is difficult to get across a nuanced point of view.  Some political campaigns can be quite nasty and personalised.  Elements of the media are intent on degrading politics and the public discourse we engage in.  It is important for anyone listening to those of us in this House, the other House or those in any parliament throughout the world to agree that politics can be the noblest of causes.  For a person to take up a campaign and believe in something so vehemently that the person is willing to spend his or her life or career in pursuit of that aim is a good and decent thing.  We must protect the public discourse and those who wish to engage in that discourse with everything we can.  Again, I join my colleagues in expressing sympathy.  I am keen to reassure young men and women who look at and believe in politics that the beliefs and values of Jo Cox will win out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-21a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062100002#GG00300"><p>I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his elevation to even higher office.</p> <p>I am delighted to speak in the Seanad about my priorities for health and advancing the programme for partnership Government commitments in the first 100 days.  I will be here for most of this debate which will allow me hear the priorities of Senators.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, who is leading the public health promotion section of the Department, will join the debate later and will also be interested in the views expressed by Members.</p> <p>Establishing the committee on the future of health care was one of the first commitments of the programme for Government.  I am grateful for the cross-party and grouping co-operation which allowed it to be established without delay.  The Leader of the House has already raised with me the eagerness of Seanad Members to make a contribution to the formulation of this ten-year vision.  This is a contribution I would welcome.  While it is out of my hands in the sense that it is a matter for the Oireachtas, I hope and trust a mechanism can be found to facilitate the involvement and engagement of Senators in creating a ten-year vision for health care.</p> <p>This presents us with an historic opportunity to achieve something which has never happened before in health policy, namely a long-term consensus on its fundamental principles.  When one talks about ten-year strategies and committees, one can see people rolling their eyes, saying, &ldquo;Another committee, another strategy&rdquo;.  However, this has never been done before.  We have never before set ourselves the challenge of getting every political party and Independent grouping to sign up to a programme setting out where we want the public health service to be in the next ten years, regardless of what happens in elections and politics.  If we can reach this consensus together, it will give the public, health service staff and management the certainty that the direction of travel will not change, even if the Government does.  When I speak to people on the front line of the health service, they tell me they are not fed up of reform but, instead, fed up of a little bit of reform here and there while never finishing the process.  Part of the reason for this is because there has not been consensus.  Health Ministers come and go, tweak the system but we never allow enough time for a certain direction of travel to be undertaken.</p> <p>I recognise some concerns already expressed since the committee was established.  First, people have pointed out the six-month timeframe is ambitious, which I accept.  However, it is up to the committee members to make it work.  Second, a key requirement to make the committee succeed is to achieve political, and indeed, societal consensus on the future of health care.  I could not agree more with this objective.  It will be a significant first if we can achieve it.  Finally, when talking about committees and reports, it is important the process just does not create another report to go on a shelf but actually leads to something tangible which we can all get behind, regardless of future governments or elections.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, I am fully in agreement with that view, and the Department will provide every support to the committee in its important work.  I intend to second somebody from the Department of Health to provide support to the committee in carrying out its work.</p><p>The central objective of the new Government, as reflected in the programme for partnership Government, is to use our now strengthening economy to make life better for people.  During the general election I very clearly heard people stating it is grand the economy is back on track and that it might be improving in some ways but asking what we will do about a range of public services.  One of those which all of us involved in various electoral contests heard very clearly was the importance of reinvesting in the health service.  The Government's objective, and my objective as Minister for Health, must be about improving the public health service on which people depend.  It is a health service which really matters to families and communities and on which we and our families will depend at some stage in our lives.</p><p>We all know the health service faces many challenges.  However, I am pleased to state as Minister for Health that I am in the fortunate position, because of the work of the people, to preside over a period of reinvestment in the health service.  We saw this last week with the revised Estimate of &euro;500 million for the health service.  This will help stabilise health service finances in 2016, and the HSE has already stated it will put the health service on a sustainable footing.  It also gives me an opportunity to address some immediate pressures facing patients as well as meeting programme for Government commitments in the first 100 days.</p><p>These commitments include enabling me to put in place a winter initiative to manage emergency department overcrowding.  Work is under way on this initiative and I met the emergency department task force, which is jointly chaired by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the head of the HSE.  At the meeting I asked for input and ideas.  I asked what worked and did not work last year in hospitals and what new measures we can try.  I am very pleased that the funding I have secured for the winter initiative is more than the budget for the winter initiative last year.  This year we have &euro;40 million for a winter initiative compared with &euro;33 million last year.  I extend the invitation to Senators for ideas, input and any suggestions they think will help make our emergency departments more manageable, particularly during the winter period when we see a spike in attendances.  I would very much like to hear them.</p><p>It is very important to me that the initiative focuses not just on acute hospitals but also on effective integration between primary care, social care and acute hospital services.  We must stop talking about the issues and challenges facing our hospitals as though they are just problems in our hospitals.  I note Senator Dolan's commitment with regard to disability work.  Part of the issue is when people who do not necessarily need to be in hospital, or would not have needed to be in hospital, find themselves in an emergency department because they could not access a service in primary care or social care.  Had they been able to access this, they may not have needed to turn up in an emergency department at the weekend, or had the support been in place in primary care or social care, they could have left the acute hospital when they were ready to do so, rather than finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of occupying a hospital bed when they would much rather be at home in their community with their family.  We cannot just talk about acute hospitals on their own.  This is why we do not have a Minister of State for primary care, because the Minister for Health is not just the Minister for acute hospitals but also the Minister for all the health service, which very much involves primary care and social care.</p><p>Another integral part of the initiative I am able to announce as a result of the extra funding is increasing resources for home care services.  As a result of an extra &euro;40 million for home care above and beyond what was planned in the budget, we are not only able to maintain home care and transitional care services at 2015 levels, but also, for the first time in quite a period, we are able to increase them.  The programme for Government acknowledges the need to improve our services to older citizens, and the provision of additional home care services and transitional care services will assist more older people to leave acute hospitals when they are clinically ready to do so.  This will allow patients awaiting admission in emergency departments to be admitted in a more efficient manner.  This initiative will also help older people and people with disabilities to remain independent at home and to continue to have active lives in their communities for as long as possible.</p><p>I hope the Seanad notes that in terms of the future direction of health care in the ten-year strategy, one of the specific terms of references is how to ensure the effective delivery of primary care.  Deputy Kelleher in the other House likes to remind me of the very valid point that when Dr. Rory O'Hanlon was Minister for Health in 1987, when I was one, he used to talk about the delivery of primary care.  We are still talking about it.  My colleague, Senator Reilly, started this process.  We must realise the primary care is not just about buildings in the community; it is about being able to avail of more services in the community.  This is why I think it is an important body of work to do.</p><p>To do this, we must recognise that we need to build up general practitioner, GP, capacity to respond to patients' needs and to respond to the expansion of chronic disease management in general practice.  Recently, I met the NAGP and the IMO to discuss this.  Our GPs deserve and need a new contract.  We have not had a brand new contract in 44 years.  Patients in Ireland value their relationship with their GP and the State also needs to value this relationship.  As with any contract negotiation, the State needs to decide what it needs and what extra, additional or changed services it requires as part of a new contract.</p><p>I am very pleased that as part of the additional funding I have secured, I will be able to restore all the funding to the mental health budget.  As Senators know, due to time related savings, which is a very bureaucratic phrase, some of the money meant to be spent in the mental health area this year was not going to be spent and would go into the base for next year.  The additional funding I have secured for our health service means I am in a position to restore the &euro;12 million that had been diverted from mental health services.  We will, under the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, be in a position to spend on mental health services the full &euro;35 million which was ring-fenced for them.  The Minister of State will develop a plan this year.</p><p>We will also be able to invest further in disability services.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is working on this area.  We have an additional &euro;3 million for school leavers.  An important area is where people with a disability, who are turning 17 or 18 and are leaving school will go next.  As a country, we have not dealt with this well and we need to do it much better.  The extra &euro;3 million will provide assistance.  As part of the additional funding for disability, there will be more money for emergency placements and for bringing disability facilities and residential services up to HIQA and national standards, which is important.</p><p>I wish to speak briefly about the need to improve waiting lists and waiting times, with a particular focus on those waiting the longest.  It is fair to say that as a direct result of the years of economic recession, we are seeing unacceptably high waiting lists in this country.  We will be reactivating or revving up the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The programme for Government commits to providing &euro;15 million funding to the NTPF for an initiative targeted at those waiting the longest.  That funding will come from a continuing investment of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting lists.  I met representatives of the NTPF yesterday and asked them what they can do with &euro;15 million, how many patients it will take off a list, how the organisation will decide who to take off lists and what it could do with more than &euro;15 million.  We are having a discussion about how best the Department of Health can spend the &euro;50 million that has been pledged in the programme for Government in terms of waiting list initiatives.  This year, we are planning a specific dedicated waiting list initiative through the NTPF, focused on endoscopy.  I expect this to mean the service will be in a position to carry out at least 1,200 endoscopy procedures and to clear the lists of those waiting 12 months or longer.  This is an important issue and it needs to be addressed.  I expect to be in a position formally to bring the Seanad details of this quite soon.</p><p>I acknowledge the health service has been changing, and it would be wrong not to acknowledge where success has happened.  We must challenge ourselves.  At what point did we decide it was acceptable for the political and media norm to be that we only ever talk about the health service in the negative?  This does a huge disservice not just to the Government of the day but to the 105,000 people who work in the health service.  Every day good things happen in the health service.  It is rightly our job to challenge things that do not go well and to highlight problems - absolutely - but I want to acknowledge the good work carried out in difficult circumstances by front-line staff in recent years.  Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by two and a half years since 2004 and is now above the EU average.  We have seen a decrease in the average length of stay in hospitals and significant progress in reducing tobacco consumption.  It is fair to say that Senator Reilly in his time as Minister for Health continued the good work of previous Governments in driving this agenda, which has Ireland leading Europe in terms of tackling tobacco consumption.  Progress has been made in many health areas, including how we deal with cancer patients and cardiac situations, and it is important to recognise this progress, along with recognising those who work so hard on the front line.</p><p>There is clearly much more to do, but I believe there exists an opportunity to make realistic and achievable improvements in patient care and therefore make a difference to people's lives.  As well as the shorter-term initiatives I have outlined, I am determined that we progress major investment projects, such as the national children's hospital and a new national maternity hospital.  I was in the House last week speaking about this.  We must look at how we keep our population healthier through the national obesity strategy and the new national cancer strategy.</p><p>I want to be very clear.  I stand here as Minister for Health knowing that I alone will not fix the health service and that while the Oireachtas is very diverse, it need not be divided on every issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are honest with each other, there is a great deal we agree on across the Oireachtas in terms of the direction of travel for the public health service, although I acknowledge that we sometimes like to extenuate our differences for political reasons.  However, there will always be issues on which we do not agree.  If ever there was a unique opportunity to put in place a ten-year vision, it is now because we have a minority Government and we have no monopoly on wisdom or mandate.  I am very much in the hands of both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il in terms of how we can work collectively together and I look forward to working with Senators on all sides of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-21a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1373" speakername="Keith Swanick" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062100002#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss important issues regarding the health system.  As a GP based in rural Ireland, I would like to outline some of the issues in primary care, which is a crucial aspect of our health sector.  I commend the Minister for his support of the ten-year consensus on health care.  It is a hugely promising step for the Government, which will refocus discussions on health reform in this House and the Lower House on patient care rather than political gains.As a GP, I also commend the Minister for his recognition of the role of general practice.  International studies demonstrate that the strength of a country's primary care system is associated with improved population health outcomes, regardless of <i>per capita</i>health spend and percentage of elderly patients.  Furthermore, the World Health Organization, WHO, has reported that increased availability of primary health care is associated with higher patient satisfaction and reduced aggregate health care spending, and orientation towards a specialist-based system enforces inequality in access.</p><p>The time has come for all stakeholders to work together in a pragmatic and solution-driven approach to develop a ten-year plan to reform health care.  I welcome Senator Colm Burke's comment regarding Senators being members of the ten-year committee.  There is a need for better integration between primary and secondary care.  This approach is supported by international evidence that it will deliver efficiency and better patient outcomes.  Every &euro;1 spent on primary care saves &euro;5 elsewhere.  This model works in Kilkenny, with the success of the local area integrated care committee and acute medical assessment unit.  Kilkenny provides an example of what is possible for integration between primary and secondary care resulting in shorter patient waiting times, and giving GPs greater access to diagnostics.  That will prevent the patient ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Patients often self-refer to accident and emergency departments, for example.</p><p>We have a current manpower crisis in general practice.  A total of 157 GPs are trained per year, but we are currently exporting half of these highly-trained professionals.  An Irish College of General Practitioners survey of trainees and newly qualified GPs in 2014 found that only 37.5% of GP trainees were definitely planning to stay and work in Ireland and only 43% saw themselves as a principal in a GP practice or partner in a group practice.  An option for the remainder would be as employees in salaried posts.  In the current climate, however, few existing practices have the finances to do this.  While training more GPs is necessary, until an environment that will encourage those who are trained to stay is created, we cannot begin to solve this looming manpower crisis.  A further concern is the ageing demographic of the current GP workforce.  A report commissioned by the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, in 2015, by LHM Casey McGrath, found that more than 900 GPs - close to one third of the current workforce - expressed an intention to retire or emigrate in the following three to five years.</p><p>General practice currently carries out 22 million consultations per year with a greater than 95% satisfaction rating.  This is expected to increase to 35 million annually in the next three to five years.  The projected number of GPs needed to meet this demand is approximately 4,000.  Currently, approximately 2,400 GPs have GMS contracts but with the projected retirements in the next few years, we stand to have only half the required numbers.  However, we regularly hear from GPs who have emigrated to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  They consistently highlight that the major difference between our health care system and theirs is their timely access to diagnostics such as X-rays, scans, physiotherapy, counselling and expert opinion, the difference it makes to their working day and the benefit to their patients, which cannot be overestimated.  In recent years, the State has rightly built primary care centres.  However, this is not all about bricks and mortar.  It is important that activity takes place within these centres to keep patients out of the secondary care system.</p><p>Ultimately, many of the challenges faced by GPs boil down to the terms and conditions of our working lives, which are dictated, as the Minister said, by an ancient contract between the State and the HSE.  I hope he will confirm in due course that the NAGP will be invited to negotiate a new contract on behalf of its members.  I believe he had constructive meeting with the association's representatives last week and I welcome his commitment to further engage with them in the coming weeks.  The organisation has made significant gains in progressing key issues for GPs since its relaunch in 2013.</p><p>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate for health, Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the allocation of an additional &euro;500 million with &euro;40 million for home care services, &euro;31 million for disabilities, &euro;20 million ring-fenced for mental health services and &euro;40 million for the new winter initiative.  Should the Oireachtas health committee have extensive hearings with the Department and the HSE as to what is required to meet both the demographic demand and unmet need in order that all areas of proposed expenditure can be fully examined and scrutinised?  In particular, the HSE should be invited to make a submission to the committee similar to that which was sent to the Department last August in order that health expenditure requirements can be extensively debated and analysed in advance of the budget in October.</p></speech>

I also congratulate, Senator Buttimer, the new Leader of the House and, indeed, all new Senators.</p> <p>There is much I would like to say but I agree with everything that Senator Swanick said, much of which I have said in the past.  I also am delighted to have heard the Minister speak in the manner he did.  It is important that as we celebrate the centenary of 1916, which started a process that led to our independence, we remember what the Proclamation said about equality and treating all our citizens equally.  One of the most pressing needs around equality is the right to health care and access to health care when one needs it, not when one can afford it.  That has been at the core of what we have sought to do.  The ten-year plan and the cross-party committee will decide what we want.  Many of agree on the what but the how and the when cause divisions.  We want a fair health service that treats everybody equally and is there for them when they need it.</p> <p>The points I wish to make I have made in the past.  I always had a mantra that the patient should be seen at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.  The nearest place to home is usually the GP's surgery.  We need primary care centres to deliver the excellence of care that GPs can provide  in excellent surroundings and that sends a message.  I agree more access is needed to diagnostics but it also needs to be ensured people are working to their level of competence and that GPs are not seeing patients that nurses could see, nurses are not seeing patients other paramedics should see and consultants should not be examining patients who could be dealt with within the primary care system.  There is a huge opportunity with a new cadre of nurses coming through who are interested and energised and want to provide different services and who are well capable of learning those skillsets.</p> <p>No part of the health service is isolated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Swanick addressed this in his comments.  One cannot fix what is happening in accident and emergency units unless one fixes what is happening in primary care, which equally is dependent on what is available in the community, and the full circle is completed by rehabilitation.</p><p>Senator Swanick talked about elderly patients.  I am very concerned about the fact that there has been a movement towards a medical model in nursing homes which was arrived at by the need to address burdens on families and society and concerns surrounding the safety of elderly people living on their own, as opposed to a service and a place where we address their needs and help them to get the best out of life as they inevitably grow more frail.  That is something that we must continually keep readdressing.</p><p>I was struck also by the Minister's comments regarding disability.  Senator John Dolan would be the first to say that people with a disability often ask, "Why am I here?  I am not sick; I have a disability."  It is an entirely different problem.  We must address this big issue, which has always been a huge tension between the excitement of investing more in cardiac bypass and stenting versus longer-term investment in education on exercise, obesity, alcohol and tobacco.  That dynamic is always there and is one that is very difficult for politicians to address.  I have been critical of politicians on this island, in Europe and at the UN for being more likely to go for the big bang of the new cardiac unit rather than the slightly softer matter of more PE in schools, exercise and education so that people realise one can prevent many illnesses.  It is no longer a threat in the western world to die from infections; the big threat is from chronic illness and non-communicable diseases.  The broader issues surrounding that are influenced by child care, and we must have a vision in that regard too.  I believe the Government has started on that route in making child care more affordable, giving every child an equal chance in life.  Again, this is the big problem for us.  We all know the things we want, we all speak to them, but we must acknowledge that funding is finite and that if we invest over here, we cannot invest as much over there.

I encourage him to pursue the issue of a patient safety authority urgently.  It was to be advertised before I left office and then, suddenly, it all changed into something else.  We still have no patient advocacy agency in this country, and we need one.  I often said that I often felt when I was Minister for Health that I was actually the Minister for ill-health because it was all about disease, illness and sickness and there was no emphasis on keeping people well and encouraging men and others to go to see their doctors early when there is something wrong.</p> <p>I will finish by wishing the Minister and the committee well but echoing very strongly the request of my colleague, Senator Burke, that there be Seanad involvement.  We miss out hugely if we do not have that.</p></speech>

I will not even be one minute.  Firstly, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and thank him for yet again coming into the Seanad.</p> <p>There is clearly not much mention of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in the programme for Government.  In the past it has demonstrated itself as being a very able, efficient and very focused group.  Under this new Government arrangement it was somewhat tapered and called the special delivery unit within the Department of Health.  It was a sort of stand-alone operation in Tara House on Tara Street.  I do not know whether it has now been subsumed altogether into the Department itself, but there is room to explore and consider the capacity of the National Treatment Purchase Fund to access blocks of really good competitive deals in both the private and public sectors.  Let us not fear the private sector and the synergies between the private and the public sectors.  What people want is fast treatment, and the person who has been waiting the longest needs to come first.  That is the issue.  I would therefore like the Minister at some stage or other, not necessarily today, during one of his trips to this Chamber, to elaborate on where he sees the role and the potential for expansion of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-21a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062100002#KK00500"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted that he is here with us dealing with the health programme, in particular the need for a ten-year development plan for health.  It is extremely important.</p> <p>One of the things that concerns me regarding the whole health care area is why every issue that comes up in the media seems to be very negative in its content, whereas there are a lot of positive things, to which the Minister referred earlier.  It is interesting how the HSE report was made available and laid before this House in the last two weeks, yet very little coverage was given to it.  I remember being at a meeting not so long ago at which people were saying the health system was crumbling.  I asked them what particular aspect was crumbling but the debate went on.</p> <p>I started looking at the figures regarding what exactly the health service is doing.  I raised the attendance at outpatient clinics in Irish hospitals last week.  There were 3.3 million attendances which, over a five-day week - most of these outpatient clinics operate five days a week - works out at 63,000 people per week attending outpatient clinics in Irish hospitals, or 12,500 per day, which is a huge number.  If one then considers accident and emergency units, it works out at approximately 23,000 people a week attending accident and emergency units.  The question is how we work towards first of all making the services that are being provided more efficient, but also, particularly regarding accident and emergency units, how we work towards reducing those numbers so that services are available outside the hospital system.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Swanick, raised very important points regarding the issue of GPs and the support for them, and it is also important to realise that GPs over the last number of years have suffered unfairly under the cuts.  I remember meeting a number of GPs over the last 12 months who identified that they had suffered cuts of up to 40%, and I am not exaggerating.  As a result they find that they cannot provide the same level of service that they want to provide to their patients.  One very simple example was given to me.  If someone comes into a surgery and needs three stitches in his or her arm, the pack for doing that costs &euro;30.  The GP is only entitled to claim &euro;26 outside of the time that he or she puts into providing the care, so the easiest option is to refer the person to an accident and emergency unit.  That is just one example of what I am talking about, namely, the inadequate support given to our general practitioners.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Swanick about the National Association of General Practitioners.  All of the medical unions should be involved in negotiations regarding the contract for GPs because this is not a contract for 12 months or two years but a contract that would hopefully be in place for a long time, probably five, ten or 15 years.  Therefore, it is important that all of the people involved in this area of providing medical care are involved as regards what that contract should contain.</p> <p>We face a number of major challenges, and I think the Minister is aware of them, and he has highlighted them already.  A simple example given at a presentation by GPs that I attended is that there are approximately 600,000 people over 65 years of age in Ireland.  Within 14 years that will be 1 million.  A very interesting figure that the GPs brought up, however, is that 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by over 65s.  If one works out that ratio, the number of additional beds we would technically require over the next 14 years is quite substantial unless we can improve a number of other areas to make sure we have fewer people having to go into hospital and that a lot of the care that they require can be dealt with outside of the hospital setting.  The budget for the HSE last year was &euro;13.895 billion, &euro;3.621 billion of which went to non-statutory agencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition to that &euro;13.895 billion, a huge amount is spent on private health care such that Ireland is now the second highest spender on health care per head of population in the OECD.  Are we getting value in real terms?  Could we deliver a better service with the money being spent?  I believe we could.</p><p>Another issue we need to consider and which should be part of the health plan - though many may say it should not - is medical education.  We are spending about &euro;90 million per year on medical education.  Within 12 months, 60% of that investment has gone out of the country.  We need to look at how we can keep our own people within the health service in Ireland and if they want to go abroad for a period, we should at least be able to get them back.  This is affecting smaller hospitals in particular.  In such hospitals outside Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, the major centres of population, up to 70% of the medical practitioners are non-Irish.  They are providing a good service but we should have a system in place that encourages Irish people to stay in Irish hospitals.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for attending.  I will be really positive.  I thank the Government for its investment in &Aacute;ras Deirbhle nursing home in Belmullet because for many years there was no investment in that nursing home.  This is hugely important in the context of what I am going to say.</p> <p>In light of the negative impact on rural areas of centralising and privatising health care in Ireland, Britain and many other countries, will the Minister consider a proposal to provide as many health services as possible in rural and urban settings where the larger hospitals are situated many miles from acute specialist hospitals?  Sinn F&eacute;in and I have long believed that a new approach is necessary to overcome the challenges met by people living away from these centres in accessing health care.  This growing problem is not confined to remote rural areas, although the lack of transport, the absence of a good road network and the cost involved in accessing the most basic services is greater in these areas, including the place where I live in Erris, County Mayo.</p> <p>There is a really good strategy, Developing Community Hospitals, is use in Scotland, so there is no need for us to reinvent the wheel.  The Minister may be familiar with Belmullet hospital and the fact that, under the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government, half of the beds there were closed in 2010.  We led a very active campaign, Senator Mulherin with testify to this, to try to keep those beds open.  However, the then Government insisted on closing them.  We are left with an infrastructure of quite a large hospital that could be used as a centre for the delivery of the services we need.  Will the Minister consider a pilot project to develop a multidisciplinary health service facility at the hospital in Belmullet and have a cost-benefit analysis carried out in order to deliver this?  We could lead the way in terms of examining whether this might be a method of tackling the shortfall in the provision of services between the centres of excellence and the acute centres.  We could look at the possibility of a community casualty unit to prevent people having to travel elsewhere to have minor injuries treated.  We could examine the development of electronic health records in order that people's patient information could be available, provided proper broadband services were available.  We could also revisit the whole development in technology which never happened but which was promised under the Primary Care strategy.  The Minister will recall the pilot projects established in the context of Primary Care.  The major problem with those projects was that proper resources were never provided in respect of them.  Putting a sign saying "Primary Care" above a door does not make a facility a primary care centre.  Investment is needed.  The electronic potential identified within those centres could now be used not only for primary care but also in the development of these multidisciplinary health service facilities.  We could test this model in Belmullet in order to discover if it will work.  Many safe and effective services could be delivered at local level using this model.  We could have an integrated patient transport policy included in these hospitals.  My direct question to the Minister is whether he would be willing to look at it and whether he would be willing to work with us in the community of Erris in Belmullet to test this model in order to establish whether it would work in other areas of the country also.</p> <p>Mr. Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, realises there are many shortcomings in the centralisation and privatisation of health services.  The way in which our health system has developed has left us in a situation with which none of us agree whereby one's treatment is based on where one lives.  Whether a person lives or dies can come down to where he or she lives.  People in areas such as that in which I live are at a major disadvantage in trying to access services.  I remind the Minister that patients from Belmullet seeking to access the most basic services currently being delivered in Galway are obliged to make a six-hour round trip.  Some people may have two, three or four appointments in one week.  That is not the way to treat some of our most vulnerable people, namely, those who are ill and who require to access health services.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to examine the Cuban model of delivery, which is very interesting.  Even in terms of cost, it delivers an excellent health care service to a population of 11 million for less than it costs to deliver the services at Beaumont Hospital.</p> <p>Will the Minister to comment on the ESRI report on the possibility of the delivery of universal health care, particularly as that has long been our policy?  Universal health care has often been ridiculed on the basis of the argument to the effect that we cannot afford it.  We have always said we could afford it and it is interesting to have the evidence to back that up.</p> <p>I look forward to working with the Minister and I hope he will have an open-door policy in terms of addressing all of the issues to which I refer.  I ask him to consider the impact on the health service of the policies of previous Governments and how that has militated against people living in rural Ireland in particular.</p></speech>

I also welcome his statement on the future of health care.  While ten years seems a long time, what is significant is that he referred to bringing all sides on board and to obtaining different views on how we might achieve a more desirable health care system for everybody.  This will require dialogue and that dialogue will take place in the context of an increasing demand on our health services.  People are living longer and are coping with chronic health conditions.  With advances in medicines, there are new drugs, new treatments for cancer and other life-threatening illnesses and diseases and, periodically, the whole debate to the effect that the State is required to fund new drugs is played out in public.  The pharmaceutical companies are trying to get the top dollar while the State has to watch its budget.  These are all realities and all the time we are talking about human beings.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that, even as we try to deliver it, health care must be for everybody, regardless of a person's finances or what he or she can afford.  If one is sick or dying, one does not have any options.  It is at this time one is really vulnerable.  If our State is worth anything, it must continue to strive to find ways to make that health care a reality for all citizens.  I know the Minister is committed to that.  I welcome the convening of the new health care committee.  I support Senator Colm Burke's suggestion that Senators be included among the membership of that committee in order that both the Upper and Lower Houses - across the board in terms of parties - will be represented on it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome this opportunity to get down to the nuts and bolts of the debate and tease out the issues. </p><p>I ask the Minister to intervene in a pressing issue that has arisen in Ballina district hospital, County Mayo, namely, the escalation of an ongoing dispute between WestDoc, which provides the hospital with an out-of-hours general practitioner service, and general practitioners who provide the service during normal hours.  These services provide 24-hour cover and allow the hospital to function.  I have been informed by staff of a threat to withdraw general practitioner services from the hospital in the coming days.  This would result in the closure of the hospital, which is difficult to believe.  The staff who contacted me are very concerned about patient care.  </p><p>Ballina district hospital is a step-down facility with a large number of elderly, frail patients.  It provides a top-class service, as everyone who uses its services will attest.  People are delighted with the care and attention they receive.  The hospital's closure would lead to 59 patients being transported by ambulance to Castlebar general hospital.  Staff are also fearful for their jobs.  While discussions are ongoing, the dispute appears to be escalating and a threat of withdrawal of service has issued to the Health Service Executive.  I ask the Minister to ensure all obstacles are overcome and the parties move towards finding an immediate solution to the dispute.</p><p>I commend the general practitioners who provide a very good service to the hospital.  I also commend hospital management with whom I worked closely to have all the beds in the facility re-opened.  In 2011, when the previous Government was elected, the number of beds in the hospital had declined to 40 and it was feared that there would be further bed closures.  Working with the Minister and Health Service Executive, I and managers at the hospital fought long and hard to secure the re-opening of beds and the expansion and renovation of the hospital.  In conjunction with the Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation, Ballina district hospital provides hospice suites for the first time.</p><p>A great deal of good work has been done at the hospital and it is a matter of grave concern that it may close.  Such a scenario would be unacceptable and would have knock-on effects.  Mayo general hospital, like all hospitals with an emergency department, suffers from the problem of requiring patients to wait on trolleys.  Ballina district hospital and hospitals in Swinford and Belmullet, which also provide step-down beds, provide a lifeline to Castlebar general hospital by relieving pressure on its emergency department.  I would appreciate if the Minister would revert to me on this extremely urgent matter.  The parties must sit around a table and knock out a solution in the interests of health care in the region.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-06-21a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016062100002#MM00200"><p>The Government must adhere to the timeline for ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end of this year.  Work is being done on the legal and legislative changes required for ratification.  In parallel, implementation planning is needed for the urgent restoration of practical measures such as home supports, personal assistance, neurorehabilitation services and therapies, and so forth.  Previous speakers referred to other measures and many more come to mind.  The mobility allowance is dangling by a thread and the motorised transport grant was abolished.  Budget 2017, which will be introduced in four months, will indicate whether there is a willingness and an ambition to move beyond words in terms of the importance of the inclusion of people with disabilities.</p> <p>Not to put a tooth in it, the question people are asking is whether the long-running crisis in disability and mental health will continue to be viewed as acceptable.  These areas of health have not been adequately addressed for decades.  Austerity measures have brought a vicious and continuing harvest of poverty, exclusion and loss of hope to people with disabilities and their families.  The restoration of services that have been lost is the immediate priority and we must proceed on a programmatic basis thereafter.</p> <p>The ten-year plan announced by the Minister is very welcome and I will make a couple of points on some of the relevant issues and tensions.  Every year, we have what are described as the "new disabled".  At least 50,000 people will become disabled or require disability or mental health services this year.  Disability is, therefore, a societal issue.  We do not have disabled people and the rest of us because disability can and will come to everyone's door.  Reference was made to an increase of 2.5 years in longevity in the past 12 years, which is a significant improvement.  While mortality rates have declined significantly in the past 20 years, morbidity rates have increased.  The ten-year plan is extremely important because we should have been planning decades ago.  Let us start to address demographic changes, such as longer lifespans and an increase in the number of people living with disabilities and other conditions that reduce their capacity.  People with disabilities and their families have been paying the price for the failure to plan.  </p> <p>As people move out of institutions, others, often young men and women, are moving into nursing homes and other institutions.  Some health programmes receive statutory support, while others are provided on an administrative basis, for example, personal assistance, home help services and so forth.  This has allowed these services to be filed away for the past decade. </p> <p>Health has always been the default service provider for people with disabilities.  When people require education, employment activation, accessible transport, housing and so on, the matter is regarded as a health issue because disability is involved.  However, they are issues for the relevant Department, whether education, housing or transport.  I ask all Senators to think about this matter because the Department of Health has always been at the short end of the problem.  Other Departments have primary responsibility within their remits for the lives of people with disabilities and their families.  It is long past time that they faced up to that. </p> <p>The nature of disability is changing.  At one time, the narrative was that there were people with disabilities and able people.  That is no longer the case.  We are all on the slippery slope.  As a result of improvements in health and social provision, many people have what I describe as disabling conditions such as those of an episodic nature.  We must reconsider our approach to these issues, which will mean ensuring that Departments other than the Department of Health share the burden.  Enabling measures are required to keep people at work and ensure young people move from education into training and employment.  Budget 2017 is the first critical step to be worked on.</p> <p>How did the 50,000 people who will become disabled this year view last year's budget?  Most will have asked whether their income had improved or they or their families were better off as a result.  This year, however, these same people will view the budget from the perspective of having a disability and will ask whether they will be able to remain in employment, secure a job or continue to function as a parent, look after elderly parents or engage in the community. </p> <p>I have three requests.  First, the ten-year plan must strongly factor in the areas of disability and mental health and find ways to draw in community organisations and groups working in these areas.  Second, budget 2017 must restore services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Third, we must focus on community living and participation.</p><p>Other Departments and public bodies must get their act together and not leave everything to do with disabled people to the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, to the House for the debate.</p> <p>Like my colleagues, I support the setting up of a cross-party health committee which will have a longer-term focus with regard to health policy over the next ten years.  That is welcome.  During the recession health budgets were hit but now that we are in a better economic position it is important that we direct our resources appropriately towards the fairer delivery of services for our people.</p> <p>I would like to refer to many issues within the health service but I will focus on the area of stroke care.  The suddenness of a stroke can be very difficult for patients, families and carers.  The effects of a stroke range from very mild difficulties such as hand weakness to more complex challenges such as speech difficulties, sight loss or paralysis on one side of the body.  As an occupational therapist who has specifically worked with stroke patients for the past eight years I have become deeply frustrated when, following a stroke, many of our patients are unable to gain access to specialist rehabilitation in a timely manner. There is such potential for these individuals to improve given the right access to services.</p> <p>An audit report on stroke services carried out by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Irish Heart Foundation published in January this year found that the death rate from stroke has dropped from 19% to 14% since the last audit was carried out in 2008.  Some 8% of stroke patients are being discharged to nursing homes compared with 15% in 2008.  That marks a substantial reduction, which is most welcome.  </p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, rightly said there are good developments every day within our health service and those changes are very much driven by the HSE national stroke programme currently led by Professor Joe Harbison, who has shown great leadership in terms of the reorganisation of acute stroke services.  We have improved the position from one stroke unit to 21.  We have ensured that we have approximately 250 medical doctors trained in thrombolysis or clot-busting treatment.  That means real improvements are being made in the initial stages following a stroke.  </p> <p>However, stroke remains Ireland's biggest killer after cancer and heart disease.  Our stroke patients must be treated with the same level of urgency as that of cancer and heart disease.  The key finding of the audit was that a very high proportion of survivors suffer needless disability, and I listened attentively to Senator Dolan's contribution, because of a lack of rehabilitation services once they have been treated in hospital for a stroke.  With medical advances we must have better and more timely access to rehabilitation services.  It is important to consider rehabilitation services within the context of community services and hospital services for those over and under 65 years of age.  </p> <p>The audit also shows that only about half of patients are admitted to a stroke unit at any one time during their hospital stay.  In 2016, treatment in a stroke unit is the most basic requirement.  All of the clinical evidence supports the benefit to stroke patients and improves their outcomes and their recovery.</p> <p>For patients under the age of 65, the position is of even more concern.  Those patients find it extremely difficult to get access to inpatient rehabilitation services because the only one we have is the national rehabilitation service in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Many of our patients are waiting months.  We need to make sure that our multidisciplinary teams are properly resourced.</p> <p>One of our major challenges in terms of rehabilitation is the delivery of more units.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the specialist rehabilitation unit planned for Roscommon hospital is progressed as quickly as possible.  It is essential that the project team comprising hospital, clinical and estates personnel is assembled as quickly as possible, and I ask the Minister of State to ensure that happens without delay.  We must ensure that we are providing proper services for the people of the west, who find themselves in a very difficult position where they require rehabilitation.</p> <p>In terms of the early supported discharge services, I ask that there would be a greater focus on community care and properly resourcing our early supported discharge teams.</p></speech>

It is not overstating the case to say that we as a society very much depend on their success as respective Ministers in their portfolios, so there is no extra pressure.</p> <p>For some time I have stated privately and publicly that the future direction of our national health service requires that we have a long-term, consensus-driven strategy and approach to our service that has a genuine role for all stakeholders in the process.  That means everybody across society, not just those of us who are privileged to sit in this House and the Lower House.  The success of this proposition and the proposed ten-year programme in regard to health services requires all of us to be honest with one another.  It requires an honest Government but it also requires an honest Opposition.  We need to start with a vision of the kind of health service we want.  It flows from that that we must be absolutely clear about how we plan for that and how we resource it.  We need to have an honest discussion.</p> <p>The provision of first-class health care comes at a cost.  It is very costly but it is something that is worth paying for.  Treatment in acute medical settings is particularly expensive and the operation of our emergency departments is, by definition, very costly.  Those of us who do have and will have the need to use our acute hospital services deserve to be treated in a timely and effective manner and provided with the best possible treatment by staff who are supported and valued in hospitals that are accountable and managed by people with the right skillsets and who understand that it is the patient, the citizen, who should be at the heart of health care service provision.  They should also accept that their jobs, and the way in which they manage their jobs in hospitals, should be open to the closest of scrutiny.</p> <p>We are also familiar with the problems experienced in our overcrowded emergency departments across the country.  I am acutely aware of the long-standing problems experienced in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, my home town, in my constituency.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been party to many efforts, particularly in recent years, to address that hospital's multifaceted overcrowding problems.</p><p>We need to step back and take a clear-headed look at this situation.  Many of the problems experienced by emergency departments, and the reason for the bottlenecks in appointments, outpatient services, surgeries and so on in acute hospitals, can be traced back to the lack of prioritisation of the provision of integrated primary care services and of the notion of prevention being at the heart of the life of a healthy society.  Remarkably, Ireland has the only EU health service that does not offer universal coverage for primary care.  We have a public hospital system that is largely fed by a private primary care system.  This is the perverse way in which the health system has evolved organically since the foundation of the State.</p><p>Many sneered at the idea that we would provide free GP care to young children and those aged over 70 years.  It was dismissed by some as a political stunt, but it was the start of an ambition to provide such a service to all of our citizens in a move towards a new national community health service.  My party's vision for a new integrated primary care service involves the proper integration of GP services, advanced nursing practitioners and allied health professionals and staff being active in community settings treating and managing patients away from expensive hospitals.</p><p>If we believe that the pressure on hospitals is enormous now, what will it be like in the years to 2020 and 2030, when it is anticipated that there will be a 40% increase in the incidence of chronic disease in Ireland?  To avoid this apocalyptic scenario, we must develop dozens of new community-based clinical programmes that target the most prevalent and complex chronic diseases so that people can get consistent access to treatment and prevention strategies without needing to visit hospitals.  This approach would have an empowering effect on patients, liberating them from an excessive reliance on the acute hospital setting.</p><p>We cannot afford not to make these step changes in the delivery of services.  It is important that we put the primary care vision and the integration of services at the heart of everything that we do in our vision for a health service over the coming years.  We can build a consensus on this approach.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present for the earlier part of the debate.  Unfortunately, I had to honour a commitment.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, to the House.  I have known her for a long time and know of her passion and commitment to public service.  She has hit the ground running in what is an interesting, challenging, fruitful and rewarding portfolio.  There will be tangible successes as a result of the personal commitment that she brings to everything she does.  She worked on the justice committee in the previous Oireachtas, so I saw that at first hand.  This is an exciting prospect.</p><p>It is appropriate that we debate health in the Seanad's first weeks.  I welcome that a new conversation is developing.  I have always adopted a positive approach in politics, even in the most difficult of circumstances.  If we engage, be positive and seek consensus, we can achieve much.  If we divide, we will be conquered by forces outside.  If we unite, we can conquer.</p><p>I was heartened by the commitment in the programme for Government to an agreed ten-year plan for health.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris's first public comments after his appointment were in that vein.  He wanted agreement and to set up an all-party Oireachtas committee that would devise the strategy for the next decade.  This is appropriate, as health is not a political football, but a political issue.  For too long, it has been a political football.  All sides in the Oireachtas are to blame.  People have seen the vulnerability of the health services and used it as a political football to gain traction in opinion polls, notoriety and votes.  That is not an appropriate approach to health and the millions of people who depend on the health service.</p><p>We spend <i>per capita</i>much less on health than many other countries, for example, the Netherlands, Germany, etc.  People claim that it is not a question of finances, only of how the resources are spent within the service, but I contend that it will remain a financial matter until such time as we realise that we cannot have first-class health services if we continue giving tax cuts in budgets.  That is a difficult political decision to make.  It is easy to knock 0.5% or 1% off various tax rates and doing so puts more money in people's pockets, which everyone likes and aspires to, but it means that there must be some give elsewhere.  I would prefer no tax cuts and instead to see that money going into the health service in order to restore much of what has been removed in recent years.</p><p>We in this House have a role to play in the formulation of the ten-year policy strategy.  I am unsure as to whether the select committee is being set up by the Minister to formulate that strategy, but I hope not.  Rather, I hope that it is a joint Oireachtas committee.  Some Senators have vast experience in this area.  Senators Swanick and Reilly are GPs and Senators Freeman and Dolan have experience implementing health services and dealing with related issues, for example, mental health, persons with disabilities, etc.  These people are in the House.  They want to serve, make a contribution, engage and be part of the formulation of a ten-year strategy.  No one expects everything to happen instantly - it happens incrementally - but the best way of ensuring that we have a health service that we can stand over and be proud of some day in the future is by agreement, consensus and pulling the various strands and expertise together.</p><p>The situation with accident and emergency services in the mid-west where I am from can only be described as diabolical.  Reconfiguration happened even though the facilities were not in place to handle it.  The 24-hour accident and emergency units in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals were closed and their services consolidated in Limerick, but there were no facilities in Limerick.  The service is collapsing.  Consolidation and reconfiguration should not have happened until such time as the new emergency department unit had been built and opened.  I am glad that we will have a state-of-the-art emergency department in University Hospital Limerick in 2017, but the reconfiguration put the cart before the horse.  It was bizarre.</p><p>The medical profession-----</p></speech>

It is an important brief, which can play a part in reducing the spend on health, depending on what policy is articulated.  We have had a good discussion.  The spend on health is approaching &euro;14 billion from the public purse with an additional &euro;5 billion provided by the VHI and other private sources, giving a total of almost &euro;20 billion.  The health sector has been debated in both Houses and by commentators over the past ten years, in particular, as people live longer and our demographics change.  There is more disease and there is a need for prevention, treatment and cure.  As a result, there is a cost to the Exchequer and private health insurance companies, which must be met.  The sector faces major challenges but a ten-year vision is the correct way to approach them.  I believe we need a 20-year vision in this country and across Europe.  We should not stop at ten years but look much further ahead than that, taking on board new treatments and so on.</p> <p>A number of areas need to be targeted.  One is the cost of drugs and the patenting arrangements and how that can be reduced.  Elderly care and home help hours, in particular, must be addressed.  Demand exceeded supply by 10% at the end of 2015 and that will not improve this year given home help hours have been cut again.  The average cost of home help is &euro;75 per week.  The alternative is for the elderly to participate in the fair deal scheme and obtain long-term private or public residential care.  The public cost averages &euro;1,390 per week while the private cost averages &euro;893 per week.  When that is compared to the cost of home help, it does not make sense.  The Department's strategy seems to support increased spending on the fair deal scheme.  More money has been allocated to the scheme this year and for the home help service.  That is only one example of how resources are not being targeted efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>The Department and the HSE have spoken a great deal about targeting efficiencies across the sector but that is not happening.  There are no financial oversight or performance-related auditing and accounting practices to provide value for money and more effective outcomes for the patient.  The approach is, therefore, not patient-centred.  It is about going into hospitals and cutting costs.  Until the system changes from a block grant to hospitals to money following the patient, patient care will not be at the centre.  For example, Letterkenny General Hospital should get a block grant based on last year's performance not on this year's.  That does not make economic sense.  I am examining this from a financial point of view in respect of allocating resources more efficiently and effectively.  Reference was made to the OECD report on spending on the health sector in this country.  It found that our spend is higher than the average but our outcomes are lower than the average.  We must consider our ten-year vision in that context.</p> <p>That are many other issues but other Members are offering.  I would very much like the opportunity to have an open-ended debate on health with contributors speaking for an extended time because every Member has something to offer.  Our spokesperson, Senator Swanick, made the case for primary care and I agree wholeheartedly with him.</p></speech>

We could form a multidisciplinary team in the House.  We have GPs, mental health advocates, registered nurses, addiction and disability advocates among us.  I ask the Minster to please include us on the health committee.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Some would commiserate with her on what is perceived as a poisoned chalice but, unfortunately, the health system has been fatal for patients I have been involved with, given the savage cuts that took place during the years of austerity.  Hopefully, we will turn that around and make a great plan for the next generation and the generation after that, which will most need it.</p><p>I would like to address inequality.  Inequality in health is the most shocking form of inequality.  The health committee will convene and make a blueprint for the sector.  I hope there will be a frank and open discussion in order that we try to come to a consensus on what is best for people and the next generations.  We must realise that we will have to pay for it and it will cost more.  The population is increasing and we are living longer and, therefore, our needs will increase.  Health is the basis of every single facet of our lifetimes.</p><p>I will push for universal health care.  We need to look into this but many countries have it as a right where health care is free at the point of delivery and is based on need alone.  I work in the health service and we are hanging by a thread, which is in danger of wearing away.  We are over-burdened and it is chaotic.  I will, hopefully, bring forward Sinn F&eacute;in's vision from our health policy document, which has been costed and analysed.  It will take an additional &euro;3.6 billion to get where we need to have universal health care for all.</p><p>Is the Minister of State aware of the second annual report of the national health care quality reporting system, which was published recently?  It was reported on in <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i>There are significant variations in patient survival following a heart attack or stroke across the State while the mortality rate in small hospitals is almost 17%, well above the average of 6%.  This rate is across all seven hospitals in the report.  Perhaps the Minister of State could comment on that.</p></speech>

I was wondering, given all the health care professionals in the Chamber, if one of them could prescribe me with some antihistamines because it is hay fever season and I am struggling.  Hopefully, I will get through this.  One of the main issues of concern I have regarding the Minister's plan is the lack of reference to cross-Border health care and implementation plans going forward.  Border communities suffer disproportionately and they face unique and demanding issues as a result of partition but it is not all doom and gloom and that is why I am surprised there is no reference to that in the plan at this stage.  There have been outstanding cross-Border initiatives, for example, the cancer treatment ward in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry.  Gone are the days when people from Donegal had to travel to Dublin to receive treatment.  They now only have to travel a short distance to Derry.  The all-Ireland network of heart services deals with cardiac issues, particularly for children, and it has been a positive development.  Perhaps, as part of the broader discussion on health, we can examine the needs of Border communities and how we work with colleagues in the North.</p> <p>I am sure we will have a willing partner in the Northern Ireland Executive Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, to work with us to address and develop some of those critical issues.  She recently moved, based on scientific evidence, to lift the MSM ban on blood donations from gay men.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is currently appealing for donations, as they tend to drop in the summer months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously, one of the core issues at the heart of our health service and looking after people in need is critical blood donations.

As this is my first time in the Twenty-fifth Seanad, I extend my sincere congratulations to every Member.  I am looking forward to working positively and constructively with them in the years to come.  Members will note the optimism in the term, &ldquo;years to come&rdquo;.  In politics, one needs to be positive and optimistic.</p> <p>I am pleased to have heard most of the excellent contributions from across the Seanad and the D&aacute;il regarding the committee on the future of health care and the health service.  The committee will look carefully at the future of our health care service.  I welcome the establishment of the committee, a key commitment in the programme for the partnership Government.  Universal health care is not just a policy to implement or change for the sake of change.  It is a direction and a journey towards a better and fairer health service for all of our citizens.  Given the year that is in it, it behoves us to follow through on the ideal of cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and to create a vision for a universal single-tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay.  While this task is challenging, this committee is a great opportunity to bring us further on the road to universal health care.</p> <p>I have taken note of the questions from the last two speakers and will refer them to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for a direct response.  I also noted the comments about the committee being a joint committee in which Senators would have an opportunity to participate.  I will ensure the Minister is directly advised of that.  The Department will be happy to assist and advise the Houses of the Oireachtas as appropriate.  I look forward to the outcomes of the committee&rsquo;s work and wish it well in its deliberations.</p></speech>
