It is not sensible to guillotine the Bill.  The Leader is proposing to shut down a debate on the Finance Bill.  Yesterday, we highlighted that the Bill contains some serious measures.  For example, an increase in the pension levy, a reduction in tax relief on health insurance and a massive change in the one-parent tax credit that will affect about 15,000 families.</p> <p>Effectively, Committee and Remaining Stages, will be bundled together and, if so, we will have to oppose that.  It should be open to us on Report Stage of a Bill, such as this, to resubmit recommendations and to have a proper and reasoned debate.  I will raise the issue directly with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p><p>Will the Leader confirm whether the Minister, Deputy Noonan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will take the remainder of the Bill?  We had the Minister here yesterday for the Credit Reporting Bill 2012 which was not contentious in any shape or form and was agreed by all parties and the Minister of State came in to take the Finance Bill.  I am aware the Minister is busy but I would like to know if the Minister will be here today.  We will oppose the Order of Business on the basis that Committee and Remaining Stages are being put through in one sitting.  </p><p>Has the Leader made any progress with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of the scheduling of the pyrite  Bill?  Does he still intend to take all Stages of that Bill on Monday evening?  I think it is a Bill on which we can agree.  We have done much work on it and I have sought feedback from residents who are affected.  I am not trying to be difficult next week.  We have not yet seen the Bill but would like to see it.  I am sure it is fine but we should be able to debate it properly rather than it being dealt with in an all Stages format.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, that it is important it is passed before Christmas and we will facilitate that.  However, I do not want all Stages taken on Monday.</p></speech>

It is important that we do not simply rush through all Stages of the Bill in one sitting, just because it is welcomed.  Indeed, it is welcomed by both sides of the House and, in principle, it is a good idea.  I know the Leader has made every effort, particularly with the Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013, to ensure we have adequate time for debate, particularly on Committee and Report Stages.</p><p>  I agree with the Senator that we had a very good Second Stage debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill last night.  I was in the Chamber for most of it.  It was very fair.  I felt those on both sides of the House welcomed the job activation measures and the measures in it that will have the effect of boosting consumer confidence.  We did also have a robust debate on section 7, on which amendments have been tabled.  With the Finance (No. 2) Bill there are different reasons for urgency which the Leader with address.  Where possible, we should seek to allow adequate time for debate on amendments.  Of course, on the Finance (No. 2) Bill there are only recommendations.  It is a very different type of Bill.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that this weekend sees the exit from the bailout.  That issue was discussed last night during the debate on the Finance Bill.  It is an historic moment when we will finally see the restoration of our economic sovereignty.  The good news of that should boost consumer confidence in the run up to and during the Christmas season.  While we will have the opportunity for more debates on the economy in the new year, I thought it was worth mentioning that at this stage, and I know others will.</p><p>  I call for a debate in the new year on the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on prostitution.  Yesterday, further correspondence was published by the Minister and the committee, following on from the report, in which the committee recommended that the Irish law on prostitution be changed to reflect the Swedish approach, whereby only the purchase of prostitution is criminalised and not the sale.  Recently, the French legislature moved to make the same change.  A number of countries are looking at this model.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, raised some questions with the committee and the committee has responded.  Those communications are now published and form a very useful addendum to the report.  Colleagues will be interested in this, given that the report was initiated in this House in Private Members' business by the Independent Senators.  It would be great if we could have that debate in the new year, perhaps after the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has met the Minister to discuss his correspondence.  </p><p>  I call for a debate in the new year on school patronage.  We had that debate previously.  However, there is a passionate article by Kitty Holland in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which she describes the serious difficulties parents whose children are not baptised still face where schools run by religious orders or different religions have the right, in law, to refuse those children or to give priority to children of particular religions.  That has not changed, despite the strenuous attempts by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to move forward a model where there is greater diversity and patronage and where parental choice is respected more adequately.  I call for a debate in the new year to hear what progress has been made on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200003#B00500"><p>I welcome the establishment of the National Data Analytic Centre which will be announced later today by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It is the combined effort of four universities, namely, Dublin City University, National University of Ireland, Galway, University College Cork and University College Dublin - to carry out statistical research in a commercial sense.  We have a superb tradition in this field.  Dr. Roy Geary, the first chief executive of the Central Statistics Office, an international figure, and his successor, Professor Michael McCarthy, became the president of University College Cork.  This is a very welcome development.</p><p>I welcome the former British Prime Minister, John Major, to Ireland.  I gather he gave an inspiring lecture in Iveagh House last night.  I acknowledge his role in the peace process and express my best wishes to Albert Reynolds, who was indisposed and could not be present, who also played a major role.  During the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and well into the 1960s the two jurisdictions in Ireland rarely spoke to each other.  That was the backdrop that Albert Reynolds and John Major had to overcome.  Some remarkable secretaries of state for Northern Ireland, such as Willie Whitelaw, Peter Brooke and Patrick Mayhew had to overcome that.  We must keep that Northern Ireland connection alive.  I note that the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is meeting today.  Perhaps the Leader might consider a debate on Northern Ireland with Northern Ireland participation in the new year.  The special request from the former British Prime Minister, John Major, was that we remember also, for their centenary, the 500,000 Irish people who fought in the First World War, including 50,000 who were killed.  I think we should keep that request in mind.</p><p>At the initiative of the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, the focus of the G8 summit currently being held in London, was on dementia, which is a major problem in ageing societies.  Professor Des O'Neill, Trinity College, Dublin, speaking on the radio this morning referred to physiotherapy of the mind.  This condition can be treated.  I have heard cases of music getting people out of being locked in dementia.  I have also heard of an Irish speaker who does not participate in the world but if he hears another Irish speaker he will come back.  That is an issue we might also debate in the new year - the new ways of treating dementia and mental illness.  One thing about growing old is that we get plenty of notice.  This is an area in which it appears there are exciting and interesting policy initiatives which could make a difference.  I ask the Leader if we might discuss those improvements resulting from the G8 summit and from research being done in Ireland on the ways in which dementia can be treated.  Left untreated, with a growing number of old people, it would become a serious problem.</p></speech>

Barrett in welcoming former British Prime Minister, John Major, to Ireland.  I agree thoroughly with him that it was a worthwhile account which he gave at Iveagh House last night of his role leading up to the Downing Street Declaration and his work with Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring and others.  As he said, there were many players, all of whom played a vital role in knitting the whole together. </p><p>May I say to my very good friend, Senator Darragh O'Brien, that we would not want to overstate our role on recommendations in regard to money Bills which are provided for constitutionally as a preserve of the other House in decision making.  I say that gently, if I may.  Of course, the Deputy had a worthwhile debate yesterday and he will have ample time again today to go through the other Stages.</p></speech>

This project was mooted in 2004 when I was Mayor of Kerry and director of Shannon-Foynes Port Company on the same occasion.</p> <p>Every support, goodwill and co-operation have been in evidence on the part of the both the council and the harbour authority.  Land was provided for the project courtesy of the State land bank in Ballylongford.  It is extraordinary to note that, ten years later, no work has been done and not one job has been created.  Up to 650 jobs are at risk.  The most recent delay occurred when the Commission for Energy Regulation was insisting on Shannon LNG paying a tariff for the provision of the gas interconnector, even though it had stated it would not be using it.  This case was languishing in the courts for two years until yesterday afternoon when a judgment was given in favour of the commission, effectively stopping the project in its tracks.  That is appalling.  We are not critical of the courts as they have a job to do and will always be right, but it is amazing that in a country that prides itself on being industry-friendly and in an age of buzzwords such as "fast-tracking" and "planning" a very significant project for the region and country in terms of energy security has still not budged.</p><p>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, was good enough to come to the House to answer questions on an Adjournment matter raised by me some time ago.  He was reasonably sanguine at the time in the belief the project would flourish.  The matter must now be elevated to a level requiring the consideration of the Cabinet.  I call on the Taoiseach to appoint a Cabinet subcommittee, involving himself; the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte; the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, the Minister in the constituency; and, perhaps, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the legal side.  I want the subcommittee to meet immediately for the sake of the project.  The Taoiseach did fantastic work last week in Japan and did great work for the agriculture sector in creating jobs.  Meanwhile, however, 1,000 jobs are falling off the scale between Ballybunion and Listowel.  The Mayor of Listowel, my colleague, Councillor Jimmy Moloney, asked for this before and I join him in making his call.  What he desires is urgently required.  I ask the Leader to raise this issue as a matter of urgency immediately after the Order of Business; otherwise we will be facing the loss of 1,000 badly wanted jobs.</p></speech>

Eight months ago, as a result of the legislation, the Department decided, with the help of the Minister, to review the wind energy guidelines.  Hundreds of submissions were made to it, mostly about the setback distance of wind turbines from family homes.  The Department addressed the flicker issue in that it was stated the monstrosity would be turned off when there was a flicker.  The noise levels were dealt with, but this will still prove contentious in that it will be a case of one man's word against another's.  However, the Department did not deal with the setback distance.  In 2006 the setback distance was decided based on the height of the turbine multiplied by ten.  At the time the height of a turbine was 50 m.  Turbines are now being developed that are 200 m high.  Logic would dictate that these turbines should be 2 km from people's homes.  Despite this, they are still set at 500 m.  Not one metre was added to the setback distance after the making of hundreds of submissions.  Everyone was listening to the departmental drivel that we would not reach our targets if the setback distance was 1 m farther than 500 m.  I am sick and tired of listening to this.  That information is being fed to the Department and the Minister by the big wind energy developers, nobody else.</p><p>It is said this is a local issue.  However, between wind turbines and pylons, it is a local issue everywhere right now.  We need to engage in cross-referencing with regard to the members of each relevant board.  We need to ask who has been on the boards of SEAI, Mainstream, Coillte, EirGrid and An Bord Plean&aacute;la and determine where they have come from, where they have ended up and who is driving this project.  The simple people are asking simple questions, but they are not receiving the required answers.  That is not acceptable.</p><p>Yesterday I said in this House that we were creating another bubble.  It is ready to burst.  There is only one way to deal with it, namely, by way of a political decision.  There is no point in waiting any longer for civil servants to solve this problem.  A political decision must be made.  The politicians who need to make the decision had better be aware that this House could be a very volatile place in which to be in the next couple of years.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an ceart ar fad aige.  He is absolutely right in what he is saying about wind turbines and I agree with much of what he has said in the past two and a half years.  We need a serious review of policy in this area and a very serious debate on what is taking place, particularly on the membership of the boards of the various organisations he mentioned and the role the boards have played in the development of policy.  This issue certainly needs to be scrutinised.</p><p>I commend all those who stayed outside the gates of Leinster House from 9 a.m. yesterday until 9 p.m. this morning to highlight the campaign for justice for the undocumented, supported by the MRCI.  Many of us went out and spoke to the campaigners who were fantastic people.  Considering they were willing to spend 24 hours in the cold outside the gates of Leinster House, it would be a great gesture and only fitting to have a debate on their plight at some stage.</p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing our Adjournment matter on the issue of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga to be raised this evening.  I am still very disappointed that we have not had a comprehensive debate on it.  My asking one question on the Adjournment does not constitute a sufficiently comprehensive debate, given the seriousness of the resignation of the language commissioner.  I will not ask the Minister to be called in because the Leader will state he has told me a number of times that this will not happen.  However, we have a facility-----</p></speech>

At the earliest juncture, the relevant Minister, be it the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, should be invited to the House to discuss, as a matter of urgency, the so-called new planning guidelines for wind turbines.  I do not know how we can call them new draft regulations because the setback distance began at 500 m and is still 500 m.  It was not that we did not gain a metre but that we did not gain an inch.  It is no wonder communities around the country are questioning the point of engaging in the consultation process when there seems to be a loaded dice and a stacked deck before it starts.  It is clear to me now that the wind energy lobby, the wind energy project developers, have won round one.  However, I have a message for them and anyone else who is going to push the case: this is going to go 15 rounds and the people will not be defied in this matter.  Putting a 200 m turbine 500 m from someone's house is just not tolerable and will not be accepted.  As Senator John Kelly said, this is not a local or midlands issue but a national one.  The consequences of the proposed travesty, that is, the erection of 2,500 giant turbines, 4,000 pylons and 800 km of power lines to facilitate the exportation of wind energy, are considerable.  Those responsible are going to turn the country into a pincushion for pylons and turbines.  They are going to turn it into an offshore wind farm for the United Kingdom.  Of course, we must have wind farms and renewable energy sources, but we must look past tomorrow.  This is not just about a few loads of readymix and saying this amounts to real jobs.  We went down that road once before and saw what happened to the country.  This is not an economic or environmental proposition and it is not socially acceptable.  We must have a plan that works for the economy and communities.  We need an urgent debate on this issue.  As Senator John Kelly said, we require political intervention at the highest level to change course, strategy and policy.  The people will rebel against what is happening and it will not be accepted.</p></speech>

Approximately, &euro;10 billion of valuable fish has been take from Irish waters in that 40 years.  I note the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will go to Europe, next week or in the early days of the following week, to renegotiate our quotas which is where one takes with one hand and gives away with the other.  The simple fact is that of all sectors of Ireland, the fishermen were the forgotten sector when negotiation took place in 1973.  They were not properly represented.  Successive Governments - I say this against my party's Governments in the past - neglected to seek proper quotas for Irish fishermen.</p></speech>

Until such time as that is done, whatever Deputy Coveney will do next week or the following week about getting 20 tonnes extra, and losing a few tonnes of monkfish or gaining it in sole, megs or whatever, is only the stuff of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  We are always praising him.  In the past I have said, against Ministers of my own party, that it will be so until such time as we properly renegotiate the quota allocated to Ireland.</p><p>We in this House must remember what many do not know, that Ireland has almost 25% of EU waters and only 4% of the quota.  That is one of the greatest injustices to befall this country.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader whether it is at all possible that at some stage a Minister, Taoiseach or Government would have the capacity to take on Europe on these issues because previous Governments have failed.  Somebody at some time must grasp it.  After 40 years, we can still rectify the injustice created and give us at least 10% as the fish quota for Ireland.  Recently, we gave away thousands of tonnes to the Faroe Islands and Iceland, neither of which is even in the European Union.  Those countries get a far greater proportion of the quotas, particularly for mackerel, than Irish fishermen do and we are left holding the can.  It is a brave challenge.  If the Minister, the Taoiseach or the current Government can do something on that issue, fundamental change to the fishing quotas must be tackled sooner rather than later.  It has been far too long.  Previous Governments and previous Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers neglected the issue and kicked it to touch.  The fishermen and fishing sector is a forgotten sector of Irish society.</p></speech>

Of the Health budget of &euro;13.3 billion, &euro;3.27 billion is paid out to 2,680 non-HSE or non-Department of Health organisations.  Such a budget, 25% of the total Health budget, warrants a debate in this House.  I would ask that the Leader consider including that in as one of the items for debate in the new year.</p><p>It is a great deal of money that taxpayers are paying where we seem to have no control.  For instance, according to the Department of Health or HSE, the top eight organisations get over &euro;100 million.  They get &euro;1.69 billion between them and the HSE or the Department of Health have no power to appoint to those boards of management, and that warrants a debate.  It also warrants a debate when more than 131 organisations are getting between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million per annum.  Those are section 39 organisations on which we do not have the same level of scrutiny or the right to go in to cross-check how those moneys are being used.  It is important that we debate these issues and highlight where there are inadequacies in the system of issuing this money and where there is a lack of systems for scrutinising how it is spent.  While we should not interfere in any way with the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, this warrants a full debate in this House.  We should have the Minister in, and even the Department of Finance, as regards the scrutiny systems that are in place for all organisations that get funding from any Department because serious questions need to be answered.</p></speech>

There is a good news story being announced at 11 o'clock today.  We passed Second Stage of the Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill 2013 earlier this year and it has been announced today at 11 o'clock that HIQA has been asked to form an advisory board to look at best practice on defibrillators and what should be done, how often they should be checked and how the training should take place.  They must report back by September.  That is something that was initiated in this House and I am delighted to say it is now taking place.</p><p>Another Bill that was introduced in this House, which was taken over by the Minister some years later, provided for a ban on passports for sale.  Twenty years ago there were scandals about passports being sold by Government.  We initiated a Bill in this House, which later became law through a different Bill, to ban passports for sale.  However, Malta has just announced that it plans to sell passports for a figure of &euro;650,000.  These passports will be not only Maltese but European, entitling the bearer to have a passport for all of the 28 countries in the European Union.  That is a dangerous development.  Three other countries, Greece, Cyprus and Portugal, sell a residency permit if one invests in a property in those countries.  That is not quite a passport, but the Maltese one is a passport and creates a competitive situation for the future.  We should voice an opinion in that regard.  It is not a correct way to proceed.</p><p>I will add a word of thanks for the debate on the Critical Utilities (Security of Supply) Bill 2013 last night.  I found it an interesting debate.  While we adjourned it at the end rather than pushing it to a vote, it means that we will be able to discuss the matter in the future.  I appreciate all those who got involved in the debate.

There is clear evidence that some progress has been made and some of the orders concerned have made progress in terms of listening to persons' allegations.  Of course, the concerns are two fold.  The first is the low rate of conviction for those who may have been involved in abuse.  Second, we now have put figures on the number abused.  My worry is that in so doing, we forget the numbers of people who were never able to come forward whose lives were blighted by being abused as children and who never had anyone to turn to.  By quantifying it in this way, while it is welcome, on the one hand, as a sort of audit, I trust that it will not fix in people's heads that such was the only level of abuse.  There were many others.  Part of our history and part of who we are relates to the number of people who could not come forward.</p><p>While I pay tribute to the board for the work that it has done, there is still a significant amount of work to be done in order to keep those measures going, to keep that control going and to find ways - that is the big question - of having a higher rate of convictions for this crime.  I thank the board for its work.  I hope that much work will continue to be done and that this is not seen as an opportunity to draw a line under what has been a sad, long-term and horrific part of our history.</p></speech>

As Members would be aware, the remuneration and expenses paid to Members of the Houses are now fully vouched, which, of course, we all welcome as a much more transparent system and one that was needed for a long time.  There is, however, a situation that remains with regard to the representation allowance that will be paid to Senators next year.</p> <p>The audit criteria for the allowance have been approved for the coming year, with the agreement of the Minister.  The criteria are prohibitively narrow in the view of most Members and need to be altered and adjusted to ensure they can do their work fully and claim the appropriate expenses in line with the legislation and existing statutory instrument.  It seems the Minister is not prepared to issue a statutory instrument to take cognisance of and give effect to the necessary parameters pertaining to eligible expenses.  For the past year and a half many of us have pursued this matter privately with the Minister, the Oireachtas commission and administration committee.  I ask the Leader to arrange with the Cathaoirleach and relevant authorities an immediate meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  A delegation should meet the Minister to seek the introduction of the necessary statutory instrument before the recess.  Failure to do so will have unintended consequences for all Senators, which will impinge on their ability to successfully perform their duties. </p></speech>

A statutory instrument is required and I hope the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, following its meeting, will impress on the Minister the need to introduce a statutory instrument as a matter of the utmost urgency.  I reiterate that primary legislation is not required.  What is required is the political and ministerial will to give effect to something that is necessary for Members to do their job effectively.</p></speech>

Complete transparency is required from all organisations in receipt of State aid.  I am seriously concerned about the impact these developments are having on charitable organisations which provide vital services for vulnerable people and aid for people in the most deprived and underprivileged parts of the world.  I ask the Leader to arrange a major debate early in the new year to identify what the Oireachtas can do to get the public back on track with various charitable organisations.  If some of these organisations continue to experience the decline in income they are reporting, many vulnerable people will not receive a service next year.  It is vital that the Seanad take a proactive role in trying to undo the significant damage being done by a handful of greedy people who have abused their positions, aided and abetted by boards of management which have not do their job.</p></speech>

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, will attend the Fisheries Council which will be held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next at which he will represent the country and fight for a more equitable quota.  In monetary terms, the reductions proposed to the mackerel quota on the pelagic side and the prawn and whitefish quotas would cost the fishing and processing sector approximately &euro;70 million.  If implemented, these outrageous proposals will result in the direct loss of between 400 and 500 jobs, according to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I wish the Minister well next week and do not propose to call for a debate on the issue as he is busy.  However, the Seanad must send a clear message that we are not happy with the European Commission.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine sent a similar message yesterday.  The Commission has bowed before the Faroe Islands and Iceland by allowing them to illegally fish in waters off the north-west coast of Europe at the expense of the Irish fleet.  I ask that the Seanad agree to send such a message today. </p><p>The issue of wind energy has been raised again this morning.  Outrageous developments in the wind energy sector are the scandal of our time, one which is costing taxpayers colossal amounts of money.  In England, for example, wind turbines are being erected that can only generate energy valued at &pound;5 per month.  These turbines are being grant funded through electricity bills.  Similarly, the sector is being funded in Ireland through various schemes run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and two major funding schemes operated by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, namely, the alternative energy requirement programme and REFIT scheme.  Capital allowances and tax write-offs are also available.  The system is a farce and does not make sense.  We must also take account of local concerns about wind energy.  The renowned economist, Professor Gordon Hughes, has been writing on the issue.</p></speech>

An open-ended debate on wind energy is required.  Let us bring facts to the table.  International evidence shows that wind energy is a farce that does not make sense.  Consumers will face colossal electricity bills in five or ten years if we allow wind energy projects to proceed.  It is unacceptable that ordinary taxpayers will be required to fund multi-million euro developers.</p></speech>

I agree with Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, John Kelly and John Whelan on the issue of wind energy.  It is not often that Senators are all on the same page on an issue.  I have a problem with the wind energy industry and its value to the economy.  I have raised this issue repeatedly.  What will Ireland and taxpayers get from the sector?  Rather than a return, all I see are many blots on the landscape where turbines have been erected.  These turbines are not built or serviced by an Irish company and the energy is sold on at a profit for the wind energy company.  If someone can convince me that Ireland will make money out of wind energy projects, I will run with the current proposal.  Senator Sean D. Barrett and I have debated the issue.  I want a Minister to state - it is of no concern to me which one comes to the House - what value wind energy projects will deliver for Ireland and indicate the return to the taxpayer for the next 50 years.  </p><p>On a much lighter note, I compliment Michael O'Leary and Ryanair on the Santa project they are running out of Shannon Airport.  When 300,000 passengers were announced for Shannon Airport, Mr. O'Leary was asked by a journalist how he would promote the airport.  He has literally pulled the answer out of the skies.  Some 4,000 children will fly for 40 minutes above the clouds on 24 flights out of Shannon Airport in the next two weeks.  This is a fantastic promotion for children in the region and the airport.  Well done to Michael O'Leary and Neil Pakey, chief executive of the Shannon Group.</p></speech>

Yesterday was a particularly dark day in this saga, as we learned that &euro;660,000 was paid last year and in each of the past ten years towards maintaining a pension fund that was or was not in place.</p> <p>This money for old rope, or in this case, money for the maintenance of a rope that does not exist is incredible.  However, the bigger issue is how we regulate the charity sector generally.  In the new year we should make it our priority to debate how charities are regulated.  While I believe the board should resign, in the shorter term it should make itself available to the Committee of Public Accounts to answer its questions.  The board should remain in place until the investigations have been completed but it should resigned immediately afterwards.  Things are bad enough without eroding public confidence in charities.  I only hope people realise that the vast majority of charities are not engaged in this unscrupulous behaviour and are using their funds properly and wisely.  It is most regrettable that the front-line users of services, particularly in the case of an institution like the CRC, will be the ones who ultimately suffer.</p></speech>

However, none of us should be surprised about this debacle because, tragically, what is being unearthed is symptomatic of a culture which existed in this country for decades.  This culture exhibits an unwillingness to organise business in a proper and transparent fashion.  We have had tribunals with no outcomes, quangos which were to be abolished and top-ups of all kinds.  I trust my colleagues will agree this culture has been a cancer on our society and needs to be tackled.  However, as we will not miraculously find a solution to this problem overnight, I appeal to the public to continue giving to the charitable organisations which have done such good work in this country.  Every &euro;1 euro that the public does not give to these charities will have to be replaced by the taxpayer if services to very needy people are not to be affected.  We need to have a debate on how we conduct public business at all levels.</p><p>Several weeks ago we passed legislation dealing with the funding of political parties.  Let us be honest in asking what checks and balances exist in the legislation to prevent taxpayers' money from being used to add to politicians' salaries.  There is absolutely nothing.  What is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander; a root and branch review is urgently required of how we conduct our political and private business.</p></speech>

All I will say is that the board should resign immediately.  Yesterday's committee hearing lasted five hours.  What went on was despicable.</p><p>  I hope there will be a debate on wind energy in the near future.  An article written by Colm McCarthy for the <i>Irish Independent</i> was quoted at length in the Chamber yesterday.  I read the article.  Everybody, whether supporting or opposing wind energy projects, should make a submission to the consultation process.  The process should be advertised in the newspapers.  I have a problem in that it deals with noise, flicker and distance.  A report on the economic factors has been commissioned but it has not yet been published.  The question arises of whether it makes economic sense.  All of those who spoke today expressed negative opinions about wind.  One could say I am fine because I live in Dublin but the community has a major role to play in this matter.  A person who was asked if he would like to live beside a wind turbine said &quot;No&quot; but he went on to say that he would not mind if it was located a certain distance away.  The environment, the economy and communities should be our first priorities.  Communities have to be given the facts.  A new type of turbine has been developed that when hooded can increase wind capacity by 15% and reduce height by 50%.  All of those factors should be in the open.  Half-baked submissions will be made if the consultation is not publicised.  The subsidies that wind energy companies receive should also be published.  I will read the submissions but I call for the economic report to be published.  I will quote what Colm McCarthy wrote in his article.</p></speech>

That is to be welcomed by all and the people will recognise it as a milestone.</p><p>In regard to the report on prostitution by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I will arrange for a debate when the report issues.  We have had a number of debates on school patronage but if there is a need for further debate in the new year we will facilitate it.  Senator Barrett welcomed the establishment of the data analytics centre, which was announced this morning, and outlined the benefits that will accrue from it.  He also mentioned John Major's speech in Iveagh House last night to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Downing Street Declaration.  I had the pleasure of attending that event and I thought his address was excellent.  The event was also attended by George Mitchell and many other dignitaries.</p> <p>The efforts of John Major and Albert Reynolds were highlighted.  Everybody involved should be complimented on their efforts that dated, as George Mitchell stated, from the Anglo Irish Agreement and all of the way up.  They were all stepping stones to the restoration of peace on the island.</p><p>I accept Senator Paul Coghlan's amendment to the Order of Business, to debate No. 15 before No. 1 in order to allow the Bill to be printed.  </p><p>Senators O'Sullivan and Mulcahy mentioned the Shannon LNG project.  I shall bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Minister.

We have had several debates on the issue with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in attendance.  I suggest that the relevant Oireachtas joint committee is best placed to have a detailed debate.  We can debate the issue again when the committee has produced a report, or a further report.  I note the genuine concerns of many Members but we have debated the matter and changes.  I suggest that the Oireachtas joint committee is the correct fora to tease out the details and then we can debate the matter in the House.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned the issue of justice for the undocumented in Ireland and referred to the matter yesterday.

I am sure that the Government will act, as a matter of urgency.</p><p>Senators O'Donovan and &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned fishing quotas.  The Minister has said here that very difficult negotiations will take place in the next week or so.  It is a bit much to request that the goalposts be changed after 40 years.  It is asking a lot from a Minister when, as he said, successive governments did not act on the matter.  I am sure that the Minister will, as he did last year, negotiate the best possible deal for Irish fishermen.  He was complimented on last year's quota negotiations.  He emphasised here that this year's negotiations will be a lot more challenging. </p><p>Senator Colm Burke sought a debate on the HSE budget and the fact that 25% goes to agencies outside of the HSE.

He also mentioned the decision by Malta to sell passports which a worrying.  I am sure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the matter but I shall bring it to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p>Senator O'Keeffe mentioned the report on safeguarding children.  The matter was dealt with yesterday.  A number of Senators have raised the matter and we will continue to debate it, as we have done so over the past 12 months. </p><p>Senator MacSharry mentioned the qualifying criteria for parliamentary allowances and the audit system.  Many of the matters were raised with the Minister during the passage of legislation but I shall continue to make representations to him.  </p><p>Senator Michael Mullins and other Senators referred to the meeting between the Committee of Public Accounts and the CRC.  Without doubt, the revelations have done untold damage to the charity sector.  There is a need to restore confidence in the sector, particularly in the many worthy charities that have been badly hit by the revelations.  We should wait for the committee to compile its report.  Yesterday we heard that &euro;660,000 was paid to the Mater to maintain a pension fund that did not exist.  It is mind-boggling to think that can happen.  Let us wait for the committee's report.  I understand the concerns about the impact the revelations have on other charities.  It is important that people continue to give to the many worthy charities.  Senators Bradford and Noone also mentioned the CRC.</p><p>Senator Mulcahy complimented Ryanair on its Santa project that will bring 4,000 children on flights.

As the explanatory memorandum states, the changes will not apply to a loan where a farming partnership is involved.  Tax concessions in the agriculture sector manifest in higher land prices.  My recommendation was ruled out because it would cost the Exchequer money.  I reassure the Minister that I would never propose anything that would cost the Department of Finance money; I was actually trying to save money.  The recommendation was ruled out of order on a ground I did not intend and I will certainly not be pushing it.  There is a danger that we create tax breaks for special sectors - they are what are called fiscal privileges - and they result in higher land prices.  As the Minister is preparing his medium-term strategy, the aim should be to have a low single across the board tax rate for corporates and people, if possible, with fewer deductions and allowances and fewer career options for tax lawyers and accountants.  That should be a principle in the Department.  Having more complications, providing exemptions for some, leads to the creation of a huge tax lawyer and tax accountant sector which does not produce anything we need.  That is the problem with fiscal privileges.  We are making recommendations and, as Senator Paul Coghlan has reminded us of the role of this House in financial matters, I will not push recommendation No. 1, but there is a danger when people receive such concessions, that the economy will be distorted.  That is not the development we require.  I make this point for consideration by the Minister and his officials in future budgets.</p></speech>

There are challenges in the farm structure in terms of age profile, farm size and skill set.  Increasing the number of farmers working in partnership can help to overcome these challenges.  The agrifood and fisheries sector is Ireland's largest indigenous industry which collectively employs more than 160,000 people.  Bord Bia estimates that in 2011 the sector accounted for more than &euro;9 billion in exports to over 160 export destinations.  The stated Food Harvest 2020 goal is to increase this export value to &euro;12 billion by 2020.  Despite the size and importance of the sector, there is an information gap in relation to the amount of the tax relief being received by the sector versus the return in terms of taxes paid.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and the Revenue Commissioners all have large amounts of data relating to the industry, but it has proved difficult to match it all up in a way that enables informed policy evaluation and consideration of proposed measures.</p><p>In line with the Department of Finance's policy to review all tax expenditures on a regular basis, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I announced in the Budget Statement that I would be commissioning a review of the tax reliefs available to the farming sector.  The purpose of the review will be to assess the costs and benefits of various agriculture tax expenditures with a view to ensuring the maximum benefit to the sector and the wider economy is obtained.  The overall objective is not to change the level of Exchequer support to the sector through the tax system but rather to maximise the benefit to the economy from the existing level of State support.  Any recommendation will be considered in the context of budget 2015.  There will be an opportunity for farmers and all those involved in the sector to give their views once the review process is launched in 2014.  In the context of the overall review, the provision of this relief for farming partnerships will be examined.  I would welcome a submission from the Senator on this matter or on any other tax expenditure applicable to the agrifood industry.</p></speech>

However, some improvements could be made to it.  Our recommendation would allow the benefit of the tax credit to be gained in the year in which the work was carried out and not to be spread over the two subsequent years.  Under the Minister's proposals, the credit will be obtained in the two years after the work is carried out, with the first relief payment in 2015.  There would be a greater take up of the scheme if the Minister allowed the tax relief to be obtained in one year as opposed to being spread over two years and in the year or, at the very least, the year following the one in which the works are carried out.</p> <p>I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.  I am just trying to be helpful in this regard.  The scheme is good and we have welcomed it.  I hope it will have the effect of reducing the amount of work being done in the black market in this area.  There are registered contractors who are tax compliant competing against people who are doing work for cash.  The Minister's proposals should assist in this regard because applicants have to use a tax-compliant and properly registered and qualified contractor.  There is a double effect in that people will get tax relief for improving their houses and smaller contractors should be supported.  However, the scheme could be improved somewhat by allowing the tax relief to be paid in the year in which the work is done, or, if it is late in the year, the subsequent year.  That is our recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200010#K00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This idea is very good and it has been promoted by Fianna F&aacute;il and many others in the House.  Having read through pages 1 to 7, I believe there is more red tape associated with the relief than any other.  God be with the days when there was a simplified form to apply for a relief of this nature.</p><p>There is an impression that there is a grant available.  It is not a grant and it does not apply to those who are not in the tax net although their houses may need renovation by a C2 contractor.  The relief is wrapped in red tape.  Deputy Noonan, who has had experience at local level all his life in addition to experience as a Minister, should consider the implementation of the system and the presentation of the form.  I have been speaking to many contractors who are anxious to get involved in the scheme.  The scheme is good but, from having read the Bill, I believe a simplified form, approach and application process should be designed by the Minister and his officials.</p><p>I concur with my colleague Senator Darragh O'Brien that the relief should be made available in the year of the work or the subsequent year, not further down the line, in order to make it more attractive.</p><p>The idea is good and the scheme will be self-financing, as the Minister knows.  Can the Minister envisage any way in which the scheme could be turned into a grant scheme for those who want work carried out but who are not in the tax system, or those earning an income below the specified level?  Could he simplify the process to make the scheme more accessible to small contractors?</p><p>I am confident that contractors will be inundated with requests to have reconstruction work carried out on the primary residence.  The scheme applies to the primary residence only but it is broad in the sense that it can apply to the garden, surrounding walls and front lawn, provided there is C2 certification.  A number of different jobs could be done throughout the year and be packaged as part of one bundle, provided one does not exceed the threshold pertaining to the relief.</p></speech>

My comments are not just on the amendment under discussion but also on a number of others tabled related to provisions in this section.  I agree with colleagues who have said the measure  is very good and beneficial.  I do not believe some of the comments to the effect that is has been put in place just to bring people out of the black economy.  Many people want to work with a proper contractor so they will have a guarantee if there is a difficulty with the work.  Therefore, the measure is very good and necessary.  It will be of great support to the construction sector.</p><p>I have concerns, which I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, yesterday.  I ask that the incentive be kept under review to ensure it achieves its objective, which is to improve the overall housing stock.  This is necessary, particularly to achieve thermal efficiency and also to provide much-needed jobs within the construction sector.  In this sector, a significant number of former employees are on the live register.  We know from studies that they are not amenable, as a group, to retraining so as to enter the IT sector, for example.  We are losing capacity in the construction sector at an unacceptable level for an economy of our size.</p><p>My concern is to ensure that the measure is efficient.  The scheme needs to be reviewed after a period to ensure it achieves its objective.  I ask the Minister to consider extending it, however.  As currently drafted, it applies only to the main residence of the applicant.  One in five families is living in private rented accommodation.  The standard of much rental accommodation is far from desirable.  The figures for 2011, the most recent year for which we have figures, show that one third of all properties inspected were found to fall below the minimum standards set down by law.  I ask that the measure be extended to dwellings other than owner-occupied ones, including dwellings in the private rental sector.</p><p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has raised serious concerns, as has Threshold, particularly on fuel poverty.  There are renovations in addition to those in question that can be written off against tax.  However, this relief is different and would encourage certain individuals who cannot avail of other tax measures to renovate their dwellings.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</p></speech>

The primary purpose of the scheme is to stimulate increased activity in the building and development sector and to boost employment.  One consequence of the bad results over recent years is that the skills of approximately 80,000 people on the live register are primarily those required for the construction industry, including those of carpenters, electricians, plumbers, block layers and plasterers.</p><p>Irrespective of what labour activation measures are introduced, especially for those of middle age, I do not believe all workers will be turned into electronic engineers or become suited to working in Facebook, Google or whatever the new industries are.  We are obliged, therefore, to ensure that jobs are made available for persons with the skills in question in a socially useful way.</p><p>The secondary purpose of the measure is to improve people's living standards so those who need extra space can provide it and obtain a tax credit for doing so.  They can improve the family home, which has the social benefit of increasing living standards.</p><p>The relief costs money. I have often heard of self-financing tax breaks but I have yet to come across one.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200010#K00800"><p>It will certainly cost money.  Since there is a cost, we have confined the scheme to two years.  It is not open-ended.  One must impose a time limit on tax breaks designed to stimulate activity in a given sector.  If there is no limit, the stimulation will not happen.  There is the potential tax and we have decided to spread the cost over two years.  It is for financial reasons that one cannot claim in the year in which the work is carried out.  It is also for financial reasons that the tax relief is spread over the two subsequent years.  This, of course, helps many low-paid taxpayers.  The maximum tax credit is &euro;4,050.  Many primary earners would not have a tax liability amounting to that so, by making provision for a two-year period, there is an ease for the taxpayer.  If somebody does not have a tax liability sufficient to allow him to claim the credits over the two years, the following year or fourth year may be taken into account.  If it takes three or four years before one has a tax liability equal to the maximum relief of &euro;4,050, the reclaims can be spread beyond the second year into the third or fourth year.  There is not a big problem with that.</p> <p> On the issue of extending it to the rental sector, buying houses or apartments for rent is a business.  It is not the tenant who would normally upgrade rental accommodation because often he or she would not get the permission of the landlord to upgrade or build onto rental accommodation anyway.</p><p>Landlords are already eligible for relief on works carried out to their properties.  Where a landlord who builds on another room, turns the garage into an additional bedroom or enhances the property, there is a business relief where that would be written off against the landlord's income.  There is a different scheme in place already which benefits landlords.</p><p>As for those who do not pay tax, the scheme is designed for taxpayers.  It is not designed for persons outside of the tax net.  However, there are grants available which can be used by those who do not have a tax liability, particularly from the SEAI, for energy efficiency works.  For those undertaking such work as insulating their walls, putting extra insulation in the attic or upgrading the central heating boiler, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources pays grants rather than allowing a tax credit.  That brings in another tranche of persons who are outside the tax net.  These grants and the scheme we are discussing can be combined so that a taxpayer can avail, not only of a grant, but a tax credit on a calculation for a residual part of the cost.</p><p>The other misunderstanding about it is that the work is confined to work which costs a maximum of &euro;30,000 plus VAT.  One can spend as much as one likes on upgrading one's home.  It is the tax break that is limited.  If one wants to spend &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000, one should go ahead and do so, but one gets the tax credit only for expenditure up to &euro;30,000 plus VAT.</p><p>On the lower end, to qualify the work must be &euro;5,000, inclusive of VAT, which is approximately &euro;4,600 plus VAT, but one can accumulate that over a number of jobs.  If one paints the house in February and decides one needs to put in a new kitchen in September, one can combine a number of jobs.  The Revenue has not made this complex; it has made it simple.  Both the contractor who will be registered for tax and the householder would both register electronically.  Because it is registered electronically, one can accumulate jobs with separate contractors and once it passes the value of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT, then it qualifies for the tax break in the following year and in the year after.  That is the full explanation of it.</p><p>There are many amendments that could be made to make this a better scheme.  It is just that I cannot afford to do that.  It is a cost-control question not to accept some amendments which logically would enhance the scheme further.  This will cost a great deal because already there have been many inquiries.  It is a scheme that will work.</p><p>They introduced a scheme such as this in Sweden in the mid-1990s.  It was the first drive to get the economy back and stimulate the building sector.  It worked well but it was extremely costly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200011#L00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response and for his useful explanation.  I accept the Minister's answer on the spreading of the tax credit over a couple of years.  It is sensible.  I will not push that recommendation.</p><p>I have a further question for him on a matter not specific in the Bill.  The local authorities operate disabled persons' grant schemes and accessibility schemes for upgrades to houses, in particular, for the elderly.  In many of those grant schemes, an individual can get up to 80% in some instances or, depending on earnings, 70%.  Is there anything that precludes them?  For instance, if someone gets work done on his or her house for &euro;10,000 and from the local authority, through the disabled persons' grant or the accessibility grant, gets half of it, perhaps the Minister would clarify whether the person would be able to get the tax credit on the other work done by way of a payment of &euro;5,000 or would the person be precluded because he or she applied for one of those type of grants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200011#L00300"><p>I thank the Minister for the good clarification on the position.  In fact, I was going to make the point that if one carries out a certain amount of work, for instance, putting in a new floor and a wall built outside by separate contractors, and accumulates it, that is a good approach.  There are 80,000 small contractors or small builders on the live register and they will avail of this scheme.  If the Minister had confined it to a single contractor, that would not open the scheme up as it is.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the question of whether it will get a return.  I am convinced it will and I will tell the Minister why.  It will stimulate so much employment in the economy.  One is bringing the unemployed into a job where they will be taxed.  One is bringing a supply of materials which are mostly produced in Ireland - concrete blocks and timber.  The Minister is creating stimulus.  It is one of the best schemes I have seen for quite a while.</p><p>When the Bill is passed into law, I would ask the Minister to communicate, particularly with the TDs, Senators and councillors, the simplified form in which this will apply.  There are contractors in contact with me wanting to advertise this scheme and when I read the Bill, all the detail seemed daunting to say the least.  In his comments today, the Minister clarified it well.  He provided a simplified version, making it really worthwhile to apply and get the work under way as quickly as possible.  Then he has that deadline as well which, of course, stimulates a quick movement in this regard.</p><p>I commend the Minister on this scheme.  His comments and clarifications show his experience as a public representative.  He knows how the system works.  He will be aware that those tradesmen are available to work and that if one is below the limit, by spreading the work throughout the year one may reach the maximum of the limit through a combination of works, for example, a roof, new windows and new doors.  It is a tremendous scheme from that point of view.  It is not a tight ship on which one would have to employ a main contractor and one job only.  The scheme will work.  Every one of us will get behind this scheme and push it in our localities because it will stimulate much employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200011#L00400"><p>The Minister put his finger on it when he stated that tenants are not in a position to make improvements to the properties in which they live.  Unfortunately, 90% of landlords in this country own one or two properties.  This is an ongoing issue.  Perhaps the officials could clear this up between now and Report Stage.  Unfortunately, most landlords who provide accommodation in this country might be in a position, for the sake of argument, to put in new windows in their own family home or put in insulation in their own attics, but do not take the same approach to their rented properties.  My understanding of the tax code is that such persons are not categorised as a business.  Unfortunately, somebody who farms part time can be categorised as being in the business of farming but somebody who provides accommodation part time is not categorised as being in the business of renting properties.  My understanding of the tax code - I hope to be proven wrong on this - is that the kind of business costs that can be written off by persons who are categorised as being in business cannot be written off by landlords in the private rented sector.  However, my concern is not for landlords.  It is for the tenants who are living in these properties.  There needs to be incentives for persons to provide better quality rented properties and the tax code should be examined to ensure that such is the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200011#L00500"><p>Senator Hayden is not quite correct.  There is a tax relief for a landlord who applies under PAYE.  I see no difficulty.  The Minister can clarify the position.  If a landlord spends &euro;5,000 on his or her property, that is a cost against the rent.  There is no doubt about that.</p><p>By the way, how can a tenant, who might live in the property for two months, three months or ten months more, spend &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000.</p> <p>I know many landlords who carry out the work and receive the tax relief.  They have an incentive to upgrade their properties and provide better accommodation.  While I do not know the precise numbers, it is a broad church and a relief is already available.  It should not be extended, as to do so would result in the provision of a double relief.  I do not see the point in a tenant carrying out renovation work when he or she may move out of the dwelling three months later.  I ask the Minister to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200012#M00200"><p>While the Minister may comment, he has already clarified the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200012#M00300"><p>To respond to the issue raised by Senator Aideen Hayden, we are all aware that there is some inferior rental accommodation which we would like to be upgraded.  This provision is not geared to that objective but helping people who are unemployed and possess building skills to return to work.  The second target of the measure is to improve homeowners' living accommodation by doing whatever work they believe is necessary.  A tax relief is available for works carried out by landlords.  If a schoolteacher, garda, nurse or factory worker has windows fitted in a second property that is rented, he or she can claim the cost against the income derived from the rental property.  There is a business expense which is applicable to those whose tax is primarily paid under the PAYE system.  If they fit windows in their home, however, they will not receive a tax break because they will be acting as a private citizen with his or her own accommodation.</p><p>On the issue of grants which was raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien, I propose to read the note provided on the matter.  Any grant, compensation or insurance settlement will not affect eligibility for the scheme.  If a claimant has received or will receive any grant, compensation or insurance settlement, the amount of any payment or payments which are taken into account for the purposes of calculating the relief shall be reduced.  Depending on the nature of the receipt, the following reductions apply.  In the case of amounts received from the State or any public body or local authority, the reduction will be three times the amount received or receivable.  In the case of payments received under any contract of insurance or by way of compensation or otherwise, the reduction shall be the amount received or receivable.  The point in principle is that if a person receives a grant from a State agency or local authority such as those to which the Senator referred to improve accommodation for the elderly, he or she will not be disqualified from benefiting from the scheme.  However, a mathematical calculation will be made to ensure the person is not paid twice for the same work and does not receive a tax break on the grant element or a multiple thereof.  That is a satisfactory position. </p><p>The previous question was on the effect on the retail sector.  Since this measure was announced, it has been broadly welcomed by the construction sector and homeowners.  If the inquiries the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have received are indicative of the position, we expect a significant take-up of the scheme which should provide a welcome boost for the construction sector.  This additional activity will undoubtedly contribute positively to the broader economy, not least retailers and suppliers to the construction industry.  </p><p>On the issue of communicating the scheme to homeowners, I am keeping the scheme as simple as possible.  When all Stages pass the Seanad and the President signs the Finance Bill into law, Revenue and the Department of Finance will publish guidelines on the scheme which will be posted on their websites in the normal manner.  </p><p>I have addressed all queries thus far.  I again thank Senators for their strong support for the scheme.</p></speech>

I would like to get my head around the detail of the scheme.  Is the figure three times the grant amount?  If, as in the case to which I referred, someone had work done for &euro;10,000 and received a &euro;5,000 grant from the local authority, is it the case that he or she could not claim any sum under &euro;15,000?</p></speech>

As such, it is available for work carried out on the principal private residence of a homeowner.  If someone has rented accommodation, he or she qualifies for write-offs against the income from the rental accommodation.  This comes under a different part of the tax code and is not being interfered with in any way by this provision.</p><p>If Senators are speaking to people who are out of work and have construction skills, they may wish to point out that, under another section of the Bill, people may return to business without incorporating.  If, for example, a carpenter is on the dole, he or she can set up in business and be eligible as a contractor once he or she is tax compliant.  The incentive being given is that for years one and two, he or she will receive tax relief against income tax on the first &euro;40,000 of income in each year.  As well as encouraging people to spend on the improvement works we have described, another section provides an incentive for unemployed persons to set up in business as self-employed business people without incorporation.  The incentive is that they will receive relief up to &euro;40,000 in the first and second years that they are carrying on the business.  This measure would suit building workers who wish to establish a business and return to the construction sector as small contractors.   People must be local property tax compliant, even though the NPPR attaches to the credit.  The tax compliant clarification is provided.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated that one could combine a number of jobs with contractors, but what about those who can only do one job that might not reach the &euro;5,000 threshold or cannot afford any further job for several years?  They might, for example, have to repay a bank or credit union loan that they took out to cover the cost of the work.</p><p>The Minister has stated one of the reasons for the measure is to generate employment.  In broadening the attraction of the scheme it is important that we also reduce the threshold because people who are under considerable financial pressure will question whether they can afford to pay for this work.  The scheme could be a deciding factor in whether they commission the work.  By reducing the threshold, we could increase demand and give contractors on the live register the opportunity to obtain work.  All of us know young unemployed electricians, builders and plumbers who are unable to find work and if there was more confidence in terms of being able to claim this relief, they would have more opportunities to tender for smaller refurbishment projects.</p></speech>

If somebody needs to paint his or her house and will do so anyway, there is no additionality.  The reason we are not going for small, low cost jobs is many of them would not involve additional work that could be incentivised under the scheme.  It would be work homeowners would carry out anyway and, as the focus is on the sector, we need to incentivise additional work by offering tax credits.</p><p>I listened to the arguments in the other House about the level at which the threshold should be set.  I moved it down by changing the way VAT would apply.  On budget day we were proposing a minimum threshold of &euro;5,675, inclusive of VAT, but that has since been reduced to &euro;5,000, inclusive of VAT.  I listened to the arguments and made an adjustment to the threshold.  I also clarified that jobs could be accumulated to reach the new threshold of &euro;5,000.  Taking everything into account, we have pitched it at the right level.</p></speech>

There is a cost and it could be substantial.  He is taking steps to control costs.</p> <p>The scheme will end in two years, which I welcome.  It could be expensive and the problem with such tax expenditures is one does not know how much they will cost.  If it was more explicit, we would know the cost in advance and could try to estimate its benefits.  There is a problem with schemes such as this and stimuli in general because, as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, pointed out, multiplier effects in the economy are almost zilch because it is so open and there is no way to commence such a scheme without reducing the multiplier effect dramatically because it will leak away in imports.  People will buy cars to go to work in and buy holidays out of the proceeds and so forth</p><p>There must be a caveat to such proposals.  I am glad it will end.  It could be expensive and the multiplier effects will be low.  Such measures should not be included in the medium-term strategy the Minister will announce soon.  They have lobby groups.  When robbing Peter to pay Paul, one usually gets Paul's support and, therefore, I am not surprised at all at people supporting it but whether it is worthwhile from the point of view of society as a whole is a question for future deliberations when schemes such as this are proposed in the Department.  In this case, the Government is returning to the construction sector, which, goodness knows, got us into enough trouble previously.  The benefits will accrue to the householder by either reduced expenses or increased property values.  If the money was put into a schools building programme, for instance, the assets would be available to wider society.</p><p>There are downsides to this scheme.  I acknowledge it has been welcomed and I will not press this recommendation but short-term schemes such as this may not have the beneficial effects the beneficiaries usually claim.  I hope this is temporary.  Twenty or 30 years ago, the State provided grants to people to put in windows.  These schemes seem to exist in departmental files and they keep returning.  I hope this has a two-year life because it would be easy for us to overstate its benefits.  If there is a black economy, let us tackle it directly rather than trying to induce people to enter the proper economy.  I stress the IFAC advice that there is not much of a multiplier effect from these schemes because we long ago declared ourselves in favour of free trade and economic openness.  Keynesianism was designed for a large closed economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200015#P00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments and I do not disagree with anything he said.  One of the problems with the arguments in favour of demand side stimulus of the economy is the multiplier is probably less than one whereas all the Keynesian theories that seem to be imbued in the mentality of Irish people of a certain age are based on a strong multiplier effect but the economy is so open now that the multiplier effect is not achievable anymore.</p><p>As a general approach, we were in a frightful crisis after the catastrophe that occurred.  Doing nothing is not an option for the Minister for Finance or the Government in these circumstances.  I freely admit that if I try ten things and seven work, I am well ahead and I regard that as success.  Not everything that we try works but that should not stop one from trying.  Some of them have worked spectacularly, such as the reduction in the VAT rate for the hospitality industry from 13.5% to 9%.  That has worked spectacularly as a job creator.  We have also had an immediate return from abolishing the travel tax.  In return for reducing the tax yield by approximately &euro;36 million per year, many more tourists will visit the country next year.  In so far as there is such a thing as a self-financing tax break, that would come close.</p><p>The calculation regarding the home renovation scheme is if the VAT rate of 13.5%, which generally applies to building products, is applied to the upper threshold of the scheme, &euro;30,000, that would almost equate to the tax credit being provided to householder, which comes in at &euro;4,500.  This is, therefore, not a random set of figures.  We think we will get quite a bit of the tax break back through the increased activity relating to materials and the VAT that will be paid.  When people leave the live register, there will also be a significant saving in social welfare payments.  Then if they come into the tax net, there will be additional USC and income tax payments.  Over a period, if additional activity is generated, this will be successful and may not be that expensive.  However, the volume of inquiries so far suggests more people may improve their homes and claim tax credits than we expected.  We will see how it works out and we will monitor it.  The scheme is limited to two years in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  If I or a subsequent Minister for Finance wants to extend the scheme, it will be necessary to return to both Houses to secure a mandate for that.  It will not be automatically extended.  I am prepared to such schemes to focus a sector for particular purposes but if they remain in place forever, they do not work.  They must, therefore, be time limited.  I am in favour of making sure this closes after two years.</p><p>The Senator is correct about the grants that were introduced in the 1980s to replace doors and windows during the aluminium revolution, which destroyed many a decent house.  If one person got aluminium windows, the entire road had to get them.  It got completely out of hand and it cost a fortune with limited benefits aesthetically, socially or economically.</p></speech>

The explanatory memorandum states: "To qualify for this credit, the relevant child must reside with the claimant for the whole or greater part of the year of assessment".

We oppose the 100-day rule.  I will refer more broadly to the single parent tax credit when we discuss our later recommendations and why we feel it is unbelievably regressive and will have a huge impact on parents' ability to co-parent and to have as much contact with their children as possible, particularly where relationships break down or where parents are separated or divorced.  The 100-day rule is unwarranted and unworkable, particularly in cases where a child is young,  as Treoir has pointed out.  The organisation argues that it is unreasonable and shocking to expect the mother of a young baby to share parenting of a newborn child for 100 days, which is at least two days every week, when for the first few months he or she needs to spend as much time as possible with his or her mother, especially if the mother is breast feeding.  The provision does not make sense.</p><p>  It will also be problematic when a child is ill and perhaps in hospital for a long period.  He or she will be unable to stay with the &quot;non-primary carer&quot;.  I take issue with the emphasis put on this description because we are trying to move away from the old language used in family law which refers to primary carers and so on.  It is contradictory in many ways that just as the Minister for Justice and Equality is about to introduce the family relationships and children Bill to reflect modern family and relationship breakdowns, changed guardianship arrangements and so on, a measure is being introduced in this legislation which is from the Dark Ages in terms of its impact on separated and divorced parents and their children.</p> <p>Its impact on separated and divorced parents, as well as their children, means it is really something from the Dark Ages.  The 100 days provision may also be unworkable where parents live a considerable distance from each other and one of the parents is unable to take the child or children every weekend.</p><p>As we proposed, we would prefer to see the tax credit applied to the family where there is a written parenting agreement for maintenance between parents.  With most cases arising under the Bill, the fathers will be disproportionately affected by the changes in the tax credit.  As I noted yesterday, Trinity College research indicates that even when courts grant equal access to both parents, in 97% of cases the mother is deemed to be the primary carer.  There is no doubt that the changes discriminate against fathers in particular and will make it very difficult for them to have a positive and sustainable relationship with children.  Where there is a proper written agreement in place, it should be respected.  This would occur where a father, for example, provides maintenance for children and may be spending substantial time with them.  The issue must be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account individual family circumstances, rather than just having a crude 100-day rule.  For that reason, we oppose the measure.</p></speech>

The Minister has listened and proposed an amendment that a secondary claimant, in certain circumstances, can avail of this very important tax credit for separated people.  How can it be proven that a secondary claimant has spent 100 days with the children?  The Bill indicates that the claimant must prove this.  I am reminded of what King Lear said to his daughters, Cordelia, Regan and Goneril, "Which of you shall we say doth love us most?"  That question had tragic consequences for the children, father and the state.  I do not see how to measure love or care with a blunt instrument like a number of days.  Would a child say that his or her father or mother only spent 99 days with him or her this year and should not qualify for the credit?  The measure should be reflected on again and dealt with through a less blunt assessment.  I would like to see provision for the credit to be shared but that is another matter.  I know the Minister has taken cognisance of what people have said on the matter.  Will he reconsider the 100-day period, as it could even be seen as accusatory in tone?  I would like to see something done about this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200016#Q00300"><p>I spoke on Second Stage to advise that I have great difficulty with section 7 and the principles underlying it.  Considering the recommendation before us and speaking to the 100-day provision, it seems to be an arbitrary figure that is unworkable.  To preface what I say, the majority of primary carers are mothers and all the organisations working with lone parents, including Treoir, Barnardos, One Family or OPEN, have argued that this will disproportionately have an impact on fathers.  The measure is excessive, unnecessary and unworkable.  The 100-day requirement will reinforce a negative stereotype about single fathers, implying that they must be cajoled into participating in a child's life in order to avail of a tax credit.  We can imagine how that could play out.  In the early days of breaking up or even later, this could be used destructively by either party; one may argue to children that the other party only wants to see them in order to get to the 100 days and be eligible for the tax credit.</p><p>Senator Power mentioned the issue of newly born babies who are breast-feeding and how the 100-day rule can be met in that regard.  Even as children get to teenage years their attitudes can be quite fluid.  At one point they want to be with one parent but they may want to go to another parent at other times.  This happens in settled families and with separations.  It is down to interests or where the children are in their life.  This is an idea that the State must interfere in this way and stipulate that children must stay with a parent in order for a tax credit to be availed of.  Children may be staying with a father not because he really wants to see them or be part of their life but because he must get the tax credit.  The issue is boiled down to a tax credit.</p><p>I know the amendment has good intentions but there must be a better way to consider requirements.  We know life can change and there may be court orders or custody arrangements with particular families.  Is the State interfering and stipulating 100 days as a minimum?  The life of families changes all the time, as one parent may get a job that involves long-distance travelling, so it may not be financially viable for a parent to have the children every weekend.  Nevertheless, people may want to play a significant role in a child's life.</p><p>I would prefer if we did not have to proceed with the measure but I accept it is going ahead.  There must be a much better way of doing it.  It is inappropriate for the State to interfere in this way in a family's life.  Although such action may be appropriate in speaking about child welfare and protection, how would we monitor or police an issue like this?  What is the basis of proof?  Does somebody have to disprove that a person spent 100 days with children or is the opposite true?  What calculation will be accepted?  Will the mother have to sign a form every time the father takes the children, as with a delivery note?  How will the provision be monitored?  This is sending a particular message and I do not see how this can be worked in a pragmatic fashion.</p><p>Will the Minister include a commencement order that would allow time to fully study the impact of the measure and redraft it if necessary?  I have a difficulty with the idea, from a child's perspective, that access to either parent would be based on a taxation measure.  We could consider a system where the primary carer could agree to share or pass over the credit.  The 100-day requirement is unworkable but if we try to work it, I wonder how many administrative hours will be wasted in trying to police it, especially if one parent claims they have met the 100-day provision but the other argues that it has not been met.  If there is proof for 90 days, is there a margin of error?  I have a major difficulty in how we could achieve this but the biggest difficulty is that seen from a child's perspective of when he or she sees a parent.  It can be played upon by either party.</p> <p>Any of us with friends who have gone through a separation knows that it is not a logical stage in one's life.  Going through a separation is not a time when one can sit down matter of factly and calmly discuss issues.  Often children are used as pawns in these processes and we should do nothing that adds to that.</p></speech>

The overall change in the one-parent family tax credit is undesirable.  This change follows a trend that has happened over the past number of years.  For example, under the rent supplement scheme, it is now impossible for somebody who is not the primary carer to get appropriate accommodation that will allow visitation rights with his or her child.  Day in and out I see cases of fathers - in 90% of cases it is fathers who are affected - who are living in one person accommodation who are not in a position to have their children spend time with them.  This goes against the right of the child to have a relationship with both parents.  It also goes against the child's right to a home.</p><p>Generally it is accepted that when people live separately, they incur greater costs than when living together.  This is recognised in social protection legislation and in tax legislation and needs to be recognised in the context of the capacity of families to live together as families.  I agree completely with all of those who have spoken about the 100-day rule.  This is unenforceable.  I am a solicitor by profession and have worked on cases of family breakdown.  There is nothing more destructive in a family breakdown scenario than people arguing over their children.  I see this measure as adding to that torture.  I urge the Minister to give serious condition to this.</p><p>I am not an expert in regard to how this issue can be worked out and I accept the points made by the Minister in the D&aacute;il and by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, here regarding the necessity for this measure, but I would like to see it reversed at the first available opportunity as the country exits recession.  However, I believe the 100-day rule is unenforceable.  I am reminded of a prominent businessman who was at a board meeting and at ten minutes to midnight somebody knocked at the door and said: &quot;I am afraid you have to leave now, Cinderella.&quot;  Let us get real about what we are asking people to do.  This is not appropriate.</p></speech>

It is okay for Deputies and Senators to fob in for 120 days of the year to get our travel and accommodation allowances.  Many of us will have received a letter congratulating us on our full attendance and telling us what days we have attended.  However, this formula of 100 days is completely unworkable and should not even be on the table.  The Minister has shown flexibility since the original announcement in the budget, but this amendment is unworkable.  We suggested an amendment on this matter and Senator van Turnhout suggested a ministerial commencement matter should not be made until a report examining the effect of this measure is completed and laid before the Houses.  This provision should not take effect until then.</p><p>I do not wish to repeat what other Senators have said.  All of us have serious problems with this and I intend to oppose the section.  Senator Power mentioned something that was raised at the constitutional convention earlier this year, namely the new and modern forms of family.  This section is regressive and seems to be going backwards in this regard and for that reason I intend to oppose it.  The issue of the 100 days is not like us fobbing in to record our attendance.  It is not workable and needs to be re-examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200017#R00400"><p>Senators are correct in saying there are many different types of families now.  The traditional family, which was practically the only model in the Ireland of 50 years ago, has been changed.  We now have many types of families and should not be judgmental about these.</p><p>We are not being judgmental.  This is purely about tax.  The weakness in the case being made in the public debate is the assumption that there is tax credit for children in the tax code.  There is no tax credit for children in the tax code.  The children of cohabiting couples, partners living together or married couples living together do not get any tax credit and are not eligible for any.  One of the exceptions to this relates to the children of separated couples.  These children get a tax credit to acknowledge to fact that separated couples living apart can have additional expenses.  This is the general background to this issue.</p><p>When the Commission on Taxation recommended in 2009 that we should change the situation, it pointed out there was no specific tax credit for children in the tax code.  Whether married or cohabiting as a couple, these couples are unable to avail of any additional credit in respect of their children.  This is the case despite the fact that some such couples also have to maintain two households due to the location of employment.  For example, a father from Donegal may need to have a residence in Dublin if he is working in Dublin and lives there during the working week and his wife remains in Donegal with the children.  There is no tax credit for the children in those circumstances.  The distinction is not between couples living apart.  Married couples frequently have to live apart because of economic or other circumstances.  Therefore, there is a wider context to this debate.</p><p>In 2009, the taxation commission advocated this position should be changed and advised that one tax credit per family would be the way to go, because what was happening was there were two claimants in most cases for the care of the same child and in a number of cases there were three or more claimants.  The Revenue decided and advised me that the credit should be confined to one credit paid to the principal carer and suggested that an indication of who that would be would be which parent was getting child benefit.  However, that would not be the absolute proof.  This is the background to the change.</p><p>In the course of the public debate and the debate in the other House, it was pointed out to me that if the principal carer who would be eligible for this child tax credit did not have a taxable income, no tax credit would be paid.  Therefore, I agreed to amend the proposal so that in those circumstances the other parent could claim the tax credit.  However, the overriding consideration is that there will be one child tax credit paid per child, not two or three.</p><p>In regard to qualifying for the credit, there is no problem if the principal carer has a taxable income and claims the credit.  It is only where the principal carer yields up the credit to the other partner that the issues arise.  Then it is a question of the Revenue Commissioners adjudicating on a claim.  The 100 days is only relevant if the primary claimant with whom the child lives for most of the year relinquishes the credit.  In regard to the 100 days, it is a self-assessment process.  The individual makes a claim, and depending on the facts and circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners grant the credit or query the claim.  The practice has not been for the Revenue Commissioners to chase after individuals in these circumstances.  Its code of customer practice is operated on the basis of an acceptance of the honesty of the applicant and that is stated in the code.  The Revenue does not treat people who make claims with suspicion.  Its opening position is that a claim has been submitted and it accepts that taxpayers are honest people and will honour the claim, unless other evidence comes to them that the claim is fraudulent.</p><p>There have been a lot of fraudulent claims in the tax area and the Revenue has reviewed these matters on several occasions.</p> <p>In the west Revenue undertook a review of the one-parent tax credit some years ago and collected &euro;4 million on the basis of fraudulent claims.  This is not as simple as it looks and the compromises we have made are reasonable.  </p><p>In respect of a child of separated parents, one tax credit is payable.  In the first instance, it is paid to the primary carer, but if the primary carer cannot avail of it through not having a taxable income, it may be relinquished and transferred to the other partner who must claim it from the Revenue Commissioners.  The qualification period of 100 days was included because the legal position up to now was that if a child stayed with his or her grandmother for one night in the year, she could make a legitimate claim to Revenue for the full credit.  While in practice that only happened infrequently, the legal position was that a person could qualify for the credit.  There was the potential to abuse the system and that potential had to be removed.  </p><p>It is not our business or that of the Revenue Commissioners to be judgmental about anybody or to interfere in family arrangements in any way.  The position we have taken is reasonable in principle.  Where there is no general tax credit for children in the tax code, it is reasonable to apply one tax credit to the child of a separated couple.  That credit will, in the first instance, be payable to the primary carer and in the event that the primary carer is not in a position to avail of it, a mechanism will be provided in law whereby it can be transferred to another person, usually the other partner, who can then legitimately claim it.  That is my position, but it is not as simple as it has been presented in public debate so far.  There is no tax credit for the vast majority of children in the country.</p></speech>

At the time I prepared a paper on behalf of the Children's Rights Alliance to show how unworkable that would be.  It took the State four years to arrive at the same position.  The Minister gave the example of a couple living in County Donegal, one of whom was working in Dublin, but what we are talking about is a situation where parents are trying to have a home in order that their children can come and visit.  In the example the Minister gave the partner had moved away purely for work reasons and was not trying to create a home base.  As Senator Hayden pointed out, there are costs involved in setting up a home for one's children to come and visit.  I understand the Minister's position and appreciate the fact that there is a tax credit available for the child or children of a separated couple.  The Minister said the Revenue Commissioners had a self-assessment process in place that worked on the basis of trust.  If the primary carer agrees to sign over the credit to the secondary claimant - to use the terminology in the Bill - why can that not also be done on the basis of trust?  Why does the Minister insist on including the 100 day rule?  If he is trying to arrive at a situation where one person is claiming the credit for a child or children, why is the 100 day rule necessary?  That sends a wrong message.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200018#S00300"><p>The Minister has made reference to principles on a number of occasions, but perhaps there are other principles we need to consider.  The Minister is talking, in the main, about the tax code and that is his job as Minister for Finance.  However, by including this provision in the Bill, he is creating a hierarchy in parenting.  He is creating a so-called primary carer or primary parent, which implies the existence of a lesser parent.  That is what is happening with this measure and that is how many people I have met view it.  This is not just about a financial arrangement.  There are certain principles that should underpin this measure.  The first is the principle and practice of shared parenting as a feature of modern life.  The second is the principle that the tax credit can be transferred to the non-principal carer and, if appropriate, crystallised through a shared parenting agreement.  I am not saying this should be done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and agree that reform is needed in this area.  However, what the Minister is doing is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  He mentioned fraud.  This provision was presented in the Budget statement as an anti-fraud measure and the Minister has repeated that assertion by referring to Revenue investigations in the west.  I have no doubt that there was fraud because there is fraud in every area of the social welfare and taxation systems.  However, just because there are people who will try to defraud the system does not mean that we should shut down the system.</p><p>  The tax credit is awarded to reflect the additional costs involved in caring for a child or children in a shared parenting arrangement; therefore, the credit should follow the child or children.  I am most uncomfortable with the provision and, in particular, the 100 day rule.  I take the point the Minister made about the Revenue Commissioners and agree that they do an exceptional job.  The honesty of the citizen in the self-assessment system is a given, but in an instance where Revenue decides to audit individuals or carry out an investigation, is it the case that parents will submit a calendar to prove when their child was with them?  Will they be expected to have a record in the event that there is an audit?  </p><p>  During the debate on Second Stage yesterday I suggested we would see a raft of maintenance orders and agreements being renegotiated.  Fathers who are paying maintenance will argue that they are no longer receiving the tax credit and cannot afford the agreed maintenance payments.  Who will suffer at the end of the day?  To use the Government's term, the primary parent who, in many instances, is the mother will suffer because she will end up receiving a lower maintenance payment.  There are additional costs involved in separations, which was why the tax credit was introduced in the first place.  I agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout that the analogy of a person working in County Donegal and returning to Dublin at weekends is not relevant.  Separated parents are trying to create two homes for their children.  They are trying to create a home environment for their children and all responsible parents, married or separated, try to do this.  </p><p>  I was struck by what Senator Aideen Hayden said and know that many Government representatives are opposed to this measure.  All the Seanad is trying to do in opposing the section is send a clear message on the issue.  We are only making a recommendation because we cannot change a Finance Bill.  We are recommending that the Government rethink this measure.  I accept that the Minister relented somewhat by allowing the credit to be transferred between parents if one parent could not avail of it, but why not allow it to be shared?  Why not operate on the basis of trust and the assumption that the citizen is honest?  By all means, review cases, but this change to the tax code will result in many unintended consequences.  The Minister has been very clear in his statement that this is a tax measure, but the social consequences of any new tax measure must be taken into account.  It is not simply about balancing the books but also about the effect of a measure on those to whom it applies.  </p><p>  I ask the Minister, even at this very late stage, to examine the submissions he received from one-parent family groups and others, some of which have not received a response from the Department.  We will trenchantly oppose this change and I ask those Senators opposite who are concerned to stand up on this issue.  I urge them to make the recommendation that the change being proposed is not acceptable and must be reconsidered.  Perhaps the Minister might meet us halfway and commit to not initiating the change until it has been fully reviewed and any possible alternative to it examined.  I urge him not to make this change on 1 January when the Revenue Commissioners are probably going to write to all of those parents in receipt of child benefit, having taken this as proof that they are the primary parent.</p> <p>In 99% of cases, it will be the mother.  It does not recognise shared-parenting responsibilities, however.  In many instances, unfortunately, separations are not amicable.  Senator van Turnhout pointed out rightly that children can be used as pawns in separation cases.  This is going to exacerbate the existing problems in this area.  At this late stage, the Minister should hold off on making this change and consult further on it.</p></speech>

The 100-days requirement is an encroachment a little too far in my opinion.  If the tax credit is ceded to the other partner, in all likelihood they will achieve residency of 100 days or more.  Then, we will have Revenue checking how this is done.  That is not prudent.</p><p>Is there a calculation of the cost to the Exchequer of the second and subsequent credits in question?  Some choose to ignore the fact that tax credits or breaks are moneys foregone to the Exchequer.  There are occasions when the actual cost of a tax credit is not sufficient in terms of its social cost.</p><p>I agree with the Minister on the point that non-separated families do not have any child tax credit.  This credit has been established and some people have become accustomed to it, people who are using it to stay treading water.  When people separate, financially they go into a different space.  What is the cost of this tax credit?  If it is not significant, maybe there are grounds to question the advancing of this measure.  Will the Minister conduct a significant analysis of this measure over the next several months for next year&rsquo;s finance Bill?</p></speech>

The Minister has explained the logic from the financial point of view.  From a social point of view, it is an absolute disaster and a kick in the teeth for separated fathers.  Let us call a spade a spade.</p><p>When I separated, that &euro;1,650 single-person child carer credit kept food on the table for my children.  Separated fathers cannot get social housing.  I have met fathers whose children have had to smuggle them Christmas dinner from the family house as they sit in a cold flat at Christmas.</p><p>We discussed the role of women in politics and in the home one weekend recently at the Constitutional Convention.  It is time for change but we must recalibrate the role of fathers in the family, particularly separated families.  They are treated like dirt now.  I accept the removal of this credit is a financial measure.  Those officials working on the finances of the budget must not consider social issues as such.  That does not mean they are callous but the measure is.</p><p>The Minister recognises there is a role for fathers, as he was amenable to an earlier amendment on this measure which went as far as he could go.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien is correct that this area is complex and, accordingly, needs to be considered more deeply from a societal point of view.  Will the Minister consider, just as a concession, reducing the 100-days requirement?  Will he look at it on Report Stage and see what can be done with it?  I do not want conflict on this and I understand the Minister is trying to square a circle here.</p></speech>

We all understand the valid policy reasons given for the change to this credit and I thank the Minister for clarifying the 100-days issues.  Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy first asked if this measure would be looked at again and I raised it with the Minister in October.  We all welcome the amendment to allow the relinquishing of the credit by the primary carer in cases, which greatly improves the measure.  However, as others have said, the 100-days requirement comes across as a clumsy compromise.  I agree with Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy that the underlying theme of this provision is based on an outdated model of parenting, that the primary carer and the breadwinner are still divided along gender lines, namely the former is a woman, the latter, a man.  As the Constitutional Convention found in its debates on the provisions on women in the home in the Constitution, it is a flawed model when so many couples are share-parenting, even in separation and divorce, and that both partners often work outside the home.</p><p>Yesterday on the conclusion of Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, spoke about perhaps reviewing how this provision works.  We may find it is hard to work it.  The Minister&rsquo;s earlier amendment will resolve matters for many separated couples, allowing them to work it out between themselves.  There may still be some issues around the 100 days, however.</p> <p>I have concerns about that, which are shared by others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200020#U00200"><p>I thank the Senators for continuing with this debate and the very good points that have been made.  Senator Michael D'Arcy would like to know the costs.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that in 2013 the one-parent family tax credit will cost approximately &euro;127 million.  The Revenue Commissioners also estimate that the yield from replacing the one-parent family tax credit with the single person child carer tax credit from 1 January 2014 will be &euro;18 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in a full year.  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the expected yield will be reduced to &euro;16 million in 2014 and &euro;22.5 million in a full year as a result of the amendment to this section which I brought forward to the committee.</p><p>One person's tax credit is another person's tax liability.  There are no free tax credits.  Do the Senators think it is fair that all those couples with children who get no tax credit should pay extra tax to give two tax credits to the children of the people in the circumstances we have been discussing or would they agree with the advice of the Commission on Taxation that one tax credit would be more appropriate than two?  I am of the view that one tax credit is more appropriate than two, but Senator Jim D'Arcy in particular - but also the public debate - made a reasonable case that if the primary carer could not avail of the tax credit it should be transferable to the other parent by arrangement or by law so the principle of one tax credit in each case would be applicable and that no family would be completely deprived of the tax credit.  Senator Jim D'Arcy privately made that point very strongly to me and he was right.  It improved the situation very much.</p><p>The question of the 100 days is obviously providing a difficulty to some Senators.  The primary carer has the first right to the tax credit and if he or she claims it there is no transfer.  In circumstances where the primary carer is not claiming it, it is transferred.  To be the primary carer that person would need to have care of the child for half the year, six months.  The 100 days to be the other carer is approximately half of the other six months.  The reason for it, as advised by the Revenue, is to prevent multiple claims because if one had a shorter period of time one could end up with two or three further claimants, depending on how one pitches it.  The Revenue Commissioners will apply their customer code to this, as they do to everything else, and will presume the honesty of the applicant.  If one applicant applies for this and no other credit is being paid in respect of that situation, he or she will receive it.  If there is a second claimant, they will need some test of who should get the credit.  If there is a second or third claimant, somebody will have to bring forward proof of the 100 days.  It is a very exceptional circumstance and I would not see it arising except in very limited cases.</p><p>This does not apply just to fathers.  Fathers or mothers are not mentioned in law.  This could apply equally to a grandparent or a sister's or brother's family.  As originally constructed, the test was caring for the child for at least one night of the year.  This is why three tax credits were frequently awarded and more than that in exceptional circumstances.  The Revenue has records of this.  We are making a change that has consequences for people but now that we have amended it, it is a fair change.  If the 100 days causes difficulty in practice I will go back to the Houses of the Oireachtas and change it because I have been impressed by the Senators' arguments.</p></speech>

We are only tabling these recommendations on the basis that it is a given that he is proceeding with these changes anyway.</p> <p>The basis of the recommendation is to soften the blow somewhat and I want to be very clear that it does not in any way provide support for the change being made by the Minister.  This is a backstop whereby changes are being made and we want to soften the blow.  The recommendation states that where a primary carer has insufficient income to avail in full of the single person child carer credit the other parent may avail of the full or unused amount of the credit on condition the other parent has met any court order maintenance payments.  The Minister has stated clearly with the change that if a person is working from home and cannot claim the tax credit it can be transferred in full.  Will a balance transfer be allowed if it cannot be claimed in full?  We are asking that if someone cannot claim the full credit the residual amount should go to the other parent.</p></speech>

The intent of the legislation is to provide a support for those single persons who have the additional responsibility of caring for a child while in employment.  The credit is not granted simply on the basis a claimant is obliged to provide financial maintenance for a child but rather where the adult is involved in the care of the child.</p><p>Existing tax legislation does not provide tax relief for the element of a maintenance agreement on divorce or separation of parents which specifically refers to support for children.  All parents have an equal responsibility to provide financial support for these children.  Parents in families are not granted a tax credit where they must bear a similar cost.  The Senators further propose partial relief should be possible in circumstances where the primary carer does not fully utilise the credit.  There are clear administrative difficulties in circumstances where the credit being granted to one person is determined by reference to the tax situation of another independent person.  To provide such a division of a credit would probably expose the Revenue to have to indicate in some fashion the confidential detail of another person's financial circumstances.  I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il which provides for the circumstances whereby the secondary carer can claim the single person child carer credit and for this reason I must oppose the Senator's recommendation.</p></speech>

This is a reasonable recommendation.  I do not take the point about disclosure of private information.  I intend to push the recommendation.  In fairness, the Minister has gone some way to allowing the credit to be transferred should someone not be able to avail of it.  We state there will be instances where the credit cannot be used in full and the recommendation asks for the residual amount to be transferred.  The Minister is rejecting it so I will push it.</p></speech>

Where there has been a separation and someone remarries, the other parent then becomes what the Minister terms the primary parent, but will get the child carer credit in full, as the other couple are now married.</p> <p>There are such situations where people separate and enter a new partnership or marriage.  This recommendation would allow the other parent to claim the single person child carer credit in full.  All of the recommendations we have tabled to section 7 do not support in any way the changes the Minister is making; they are trying to improve a bad situation.</p></speech>

It is intended that the restructured credit will be an activation measure and it is designed to be an in-work benefit to support single individuals who are the primary carers to take up or remain in employment.  It will assist single parents or carers with the cost of child care.</p><p>Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives to ensure they are properly targeted and, if necessary, refocused to achieve the social economic objectives set for them.  A system which allows multiple claims in respect of the same child is unsustainable and not in keeping with the original and current intention of the credit.  For this reason, I have refocused the tax credit for the benefit of those single individuals who care for a qualifying child for the whole or a greater part of the year.  However, where the child is part of the family unit and care is provided by two adults together, whether married, civil partners or cohabiting, clearly since the primary claimant will no longer satisfy the basic qualifying criterion of being a single person caring for a child, there is no entitlement to a tax credit.  Therefore, the issue of granting the credit to a secondary claimant for whom the basic requirement is that a qualifying child reside with him or her for a minimum of 100 days in the year does not arise.  The credit is only available to a secondary claimant by virtue of relinquishment by the primary claimant who has established his or her entitlement to the credit in the first instance.  I must, therefore, reject the Senators' recommendation.</p></speech>

It will remove the father further in most instances.  By way of example, if the mother remarries, enters a civil partnership or cohabits, the child will be seen as being cared for by two adults.  The inference is that the father has nothing to do with the upbringing of the child.  He is still separated and all of the matters we have brought to the attention of the Minister are still valid.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200024#Z00300"><p>Senator O'Brien mentioned earlier that many recommendations put forward today on the section would show that while we were in no way in agreement with the section, they attempted to make it better.  Recommendations are not being accepted; recommendation No. 9 has been ruled out of order because it is apparently in conflict with the principle of the Bill but it would have put the provisions of the section subject to a ministerial commencement order.  If accepted, the provisions of the section would not have come into effect until a report on the effect of the section was prepared and laid before the Oireachtas.  Only a few minutes ago the Minister indicated that if there was any difficulty in the practical application of the tax credit he would change the process.  Would it not be better to pre-empt any difficulties and include a commencement order?  A report could be done on the effects.  We fully agree with the Minister's statement that there were flaws in the tax credit system but making the changes in the section is akin to throwing out the baby with the bath water.  That is why we will oppose the section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200024#Z00400"><p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to consider the impact of the 100-day requirement if there are negative consequences.  I stand in support of Senator Reilly in opposing the section.  She has made a very good case about having a commencement order in order to allow a report on the impact of the section to be prepared, and if that happened I would not necessarily oppose the section.  Perhaps we could look to other countries and consider how they handle this type of issue.</p><p>  I will speak very briefly to the Dutch system of benefits related to children.  It has two payments, one of which is child benefit and one of which is <i>kindgebonden</i>, an extra benefit for low-income families.  Their model involves co-parenting.  As an aside, we should examine our use of language, as we speak of &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; carers, which gives the impression of a hierarchy.  The Dutch social insurance system, SVB, considers court rulings, parenting plans and written agreements between parents that states how child benefit is to be divided.  If it is not clear where a child lives, the SVB divides the amount in half.  The <i>kindgebonden</i> is referred to as a child budget, and it is similar to what we are considering now.  The Dutch ask the parents to consider how they are dividing the sum involved, keeping in mind that the person with the lower income would usually get higher child benefit.</p><p>  There are other models for us to consider.  I understand what the Minister is trying to achieve and I take him at his word about the 100-day ruling.  My difficulty is in how we could put a system in place with such a provision without consideration of the potential impact.  Amendment No. 9 has been ruled out of order but it sought a ministerial commencement order, and it would have been a compromise that I could support.  That is why I stand in support of the Senator opposing the section.</p></speech>

As I indicated at the outset, we consider this change to be incredibly regressive and we are very disappointed that none of the recommendations tabled by Members on different sides of the House has been accepted this afternoon.  The Minister indicated at the start of his contribution that he accepts the principle that it is more expensive for people to maintain two separate homes when separated or divorced on the same income as they had when they maintained one home.  Nevertheless, the Minister is pushing ahead with provisions that will make it next to impossible for some families to provide their children with proper quality of life.  As my colleague, Senator O'Brien, mentioned earlier, people will have to go through unnecessary court cases to unpick maintenance agreements that were very carefully calculated in the first place.  Families may have hoped to move on in making those provisions and looked to focus on doing what was right for their children but now they will end up back in court, with all the costs coming from that.  Parents will be unnecessarily forced to social welfare and overall family income will be pushed down.  It is a completely misguided and unjust effort so we will be opposing the section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200024#Z00600"><p>My colleague, Senator Power, and I have tried to outline why we oppose the section.  We have supported other sections of the Bill so it is not a case of us opposing this for the sake of it.  I am disappointed that none of the recommendations, from all sides and parties, including the Independents, has been accepted.  They were well thought out.  I give a guarded welcome to the Minister's commitment that if there is a difficulty in this process, he will seek a review.  Who will flag those difficulties?  If the Bill is passed today, there will be no further change to the legislation.  Once it is done, it will not be undone.</p><p>Senator van Turnhout mentioned the Dutch model for co-parenting in the Netherlands, and there is no reason that cannot be done here.  In a response to a question earlier, the Minister indicated that he saw difficulties with the sharing of other people's financial and personal information.  The process works very well in the Netherlands so I wonder if the Minister is using an excuse.  He was clear in his contribution earlier that he sees this as a tax measure.  The social impact of the measure he is introducing is something that the Government and Minister for Finance should consider.</p><p>The Minister directly asked Members earlier if they believed it fair that parents - be they married, co-habiting couples or those in civil partnerships - should pay extra tax to allow for this tax credit.  I am married and I have a child and I would see it as fair to have to pay additional tax to support families that have broken up.  There would be additional cost and we must ensure that children not being brought up in an ideal environment - the family environment where most of us hope to be brought up, whatever the construction of the family - do not find it more difficult.  The onus is on me as a citizen and taxpayer in this respect, as the purpose of tax is to pay for services for others who need them.  Those of us who can afford to pay for that should do so.  To answer the Minister's question directly, it is fair for some to pay extra tax to allow for this credit.</p><p>The measures being brought through in section 7 are unfair and will have a social consequence.  I was very struck by Senator Jim D'Arcy's contribution earlier on what many of us believe is the position of single fathers in particular in Irish society.  There is no question that most single fathers in relationships that have broken up feel like a second class parent.  I have friends who are separated and divorced but I also know this from representations I have received.</p> <p>In what he is doing the Minister is copperfastening that parent as a second-class parent.  He continues to emphasise the primary parent and the primary carer.  He is creating a hierarchy of parents and parenting, whereby one parent is more important than the other.  That is the implication of these changes.  I am sure that is not what he wants to do and know it is not what my colleagues who will shortly vote on these changes want to do.  I again put it to my colleagues on the Government side that this is an opportunity for the Seanad to make a recommendation.  It would send a clear signal that it has listened.</p><p>Members will agree that Barnardos, Treoir and One Family are three agencies that are the experts in this area.  All three are completely opposed to these changes.  They, like me and my party, agree that changes and reform are required.  However, is it a question of the Government being right and all the experts such as the agencies I mentioned being wrong and their concerns about the changes brought forward by the Minister being irrelevant?  The Government is all-powerful and all-knowing; therefore, any independent advice and opinion given to it by the expert agencies is simply to be set aside and ignored.</p><p>We have had a good debate on this section and I thank the Minister for his open contribution to it and responding to the questions we have asked, but that does not get around the fundamental fact of what Members are doing in voting to support section 7.  All of the negative impacts that others and I have mentioned will come to pass.  Maintenance orders will be unpicked; maintenance agreements reached in the family courts will not be met and people who depend on this tax credit to look after their children and travel to see them will not be able to do so.  It is an anti-family and certainly an anti-child measure.  For that reason, it should be trenchantly opposed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200025#AA00700"><p>The purpose of Senator Kathryn Reilly's recommendation is to suspend the application of this measure until the Minister signs a commencement order and that the Minister would not be enabled to sign such a commencement order until a report examining the effects of the proposed arrangement was prepared and laid before the D&aacute;il .  If I were to accept that recommendation, the proposal would not take effect in the next calendar year and the budgetary arithmetic would be out by the amount of the yield from the measure - &euro;18 million 2014.</p><p>  We have a report on this issue which was prepared by the Commission on Taxation.  The commission consulted widely and received thousands of representations from all interest groups and individuals about all aspects of the tax code and the recommendations it had made.  We are not operating at random but as a result of a recommendation from the commission in its report in 2009.  With one exception, its recommendation was to have a single tax credit <i>simpliciter</i> paid to the primary carer, as the commission called it.  I accepted Senator Jim D'Arcy's advice and amended the section in the D&aacute;il in order that in circumstances where the primary carer would not have an income to enable him or her to avail of the tax credit, it could be yielded to the other parent.  That goes beyond the recommendation made by the Commission on Taxation and it was a very good proposa madel by Senator Jim D'Arcy.</p><p>  Because of the very strong advocacy by Senator Darragh O'Brien, it is similar to previous inputs to the debate.  It would be a very compelling set of arguments if there were tax credits applied across all families and if all children had tax credits, but they do not.  Couples living together, either cohabiting or married, who have children do not receive tax credits under the tax code.  The Senator is asking me to provide two tax credits in respect of certain children.  I understand the argument and I am prepared to provide one in the circumstances I have outlined, but I am not prepared to provide two.  That is the adjustment being made.  It is fair when one takes account of the fact, which I repeat, that there is no tax credit for children in families where the parents are living together.  That is the reason I am not accepting the argument.</p><p>   We can draw on the experiences of other countries.  The details of the Dutch example are quite revealing because it has a good record on social policy issues.  In Canada there is only one tax credit along the lines I am proposing and if there is a dispute about who should receive it, nobody receives it under the law.  It is to incentivise couples to come to amicable agreements rather than being compelled to do so by the law.  There are different ways of doing things and different countries have different approaches.  Canada also has a good record on social policy and child care issues.</p><p>  The making of the commencement order simply stops the thing from happening for at least 12 months.  The time to receive a report is when the provision is implemented in order that we can see how it is working.  Without the measure being implemented, there is nothing a report can tell us that we do not know already and which has not been the subject of this debate.  It will be a matter of opinion.  If the 100 day issue creates practical difficulties, I give a commitment that I will return to the Houses of the Oireachtas and remediate whatever difficulty emerges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200025#AA00800"><p>To clarify, I have not argued for the <i>status quo</i>; none of us has.  We all recognise that changes and reform are required in this area.  I am not asking the Minister to continue the double credit but simply to allow the credit to be shared in some cases, as happens in Holland and which could be done here.  The Minister is partially allowing it where somebody cannot claim the full credit.  If he or she is not working, he or she cannot claim the tax credit.  However, in other instances there are residual amounts or there is an agreement that it is split 50:50.  Many parenting agreements are now 50:50 and, thankfully, in recent times parents have stepped up to the mark to share the responsibility.  Therefore, they should be able to share the credit.  That is our view.</p><p>  I am not arguing to retain the <i>status quo</i>.  However, given the budgetary pressures on the Minister, the difficult Department he must deal with and the difficult juggling act in which he must engage with the figures every year to try to balance and present his budget, this is purely a financial measure which the Department has not thought through in terms of the social consequences.  The Minister could save money by reforming it, on which I would support him.  That is the point.  I am not asking him to retain the system as it is; neither I nor my colleagues have argued for this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200026#BB00100"><p>If a couple are in the situation where sharing gives a better result for both of them, there is nothing in law to stop them from making an arrangement where they both benefit.  Obviously whoever has the higher taxable income takes the credit and pays additional moneys to the person who does not.  There is nothing to stop that happening and people can amicably make the arrangement.  On the other hand, anybody losing their credit and, therefore, having adjusted income down, is entitled to get a maintenance order adjusted to reflect the new circumstances if one wants to go the legal route.</p><p>It is the responsibility of parents to provide for their children.  The origins of this particular tax credit was to enable persons, who were inhibited from returning to work by the costs of maintaining children to do so, in circumstances where the burden of caring for a child rested on the shoulders of one person rather than two parents.  A lot of the time it was used for child care rather than anything else.</p><p>That is the best we can do in these circumstances.  I am not going to defer it for a theoretic debate.  I am, of course, prepared to review it because we review everything we do in tax.  If there is a difficulty and it is not working as we intended, in respect of the 100 day issue, then I shall come back in. </p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, stood up for the Minister for Finance so he is watching Deputy Noonan's back.  He did what he was told yesterday.</p><p>We trenchantly oppose section 8.  The amendment softens the blow by suggesting the amounts referred to shall increase annually in line with medical inflation as measured by the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office.  The Minister's limits are &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child and we suggest that each year it should be allowed to increase in line with medical inflation.  That does not mean we support the restriction in the section, which amends section 40 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.  The Department provided figures yesterday suggesting only 47% of policies are affected.  The bottom line is that the policies of the wealthy are being affected but the vast majority of people lobbying the Department and Members are those with normal plans, the equivalent of VHI plan B.  Generally speaking, they are people from the age of 50 upwards and they will find it difficult to find another insurer.  There have been significant increases in net premia on the basis of the reduction in tax relief.</p><p>It is the worst possible time for the Government to do this when the private health insurance sector is in crisis.  Tens of thousands of people have left the market, most of whom are young healthy people and this further increases the premia.  There is also been a change in stamp duty on the risk equalisation and it will further increase premia.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has introduced a charge for someone like me, a taxpayer who just happens to have private health insurance, for something I do not receive.  If I go to a public hospital, I will be charged &euro;800 per night where the public patients will be charged &euro;80 per night.  This is being done by the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Finance.  It means public hospitals will cherrypick and prefer someone who they can take in at &euro;800 per night to someone they can take in at &euro;80 per night.  More and more people will leave private health insurance.  People are still struggling to pay but they make a family decision to have protection in place.  The amendment suggests that while we do not agree with the reduced amount of &euro;1,000 and &euro;500, the Minister should increase the amounts in line with medical inflation as measured by the consumer price index.</p></speech>

Clearly, in the fullness of time when this Government rolls out its programme for Government in regard to free GP care and so forth, it is my hope that we will be well on the way to a medical system where people do not fear the annual increases in their medical insurance premiums because they will not need them.  However, I accept we are not in that position yet and I have some sympathy with where the Senator is coming from.</p><p>I am particularly conscious of the fact that many older people are very nervous and concerned about the cost of medical care.  To be fair, a number of people do not believe they will be adequately taken care of under the public health system and feel they must have private medical care to protect themselves.  I have some sympathy with what the Senator proposes in this recommendation but I do not think it is practical or even relevant to the cost of medical insurance.  The consumer price index does not reflect medical insurance premiums.</p></speech>

It may not be something that can be enshrined in law but I suggest the Minister's officials keep the three principal medical insurers and the policies they offer under review so that the limits reflect what could be regarded as standard policies <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200028#DD01100"><p>The consumer price index shows the cost of medical insurance and it increased by 86% in the past four years.  There seems to be no control of costs in private medical insurance and much of the time it is a transfer from the consumer, who pays the premium, to the company which transfers it on to settle the bills of consultants and private hospitals.  By capping it at &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child, those on the lower cost policies are fully protected in respect of their tax credit and those above that point lose 20% of the tax credit because the tax credit is not at the marginal rate of tax but at the standard rate of tax, which is 20%.  If a single person has a premium of &euro;1,200, the cost of the measure to them is one fifth of &euro;200.  If it is capped at &euro;1,000, so it is &euro;200 at the standard rate of tax, which is &euro;40.</p><p>The point I am making is that the real exposure of the Exchequer is from the gold plated policies.  If I was explaining it again, I would not have used that expression because it gave ammunition to my opponents but it happens to be true that the exposure is from the very expensive policies.  Of course, they will pay more.  I have been advised by members of all parties that budgets should be progressive and that those who can afford to pay should be the people who have the  impositions placed on them.  Let us examine the measure on the grounds of progressivity or regressivity.  Only 44% of taxpayers have private health insurance, so the proposition not to do this is that 56% of taxpayers should subsidise 44% of them.  That is not progressive.  When one puts into the mix the fact the cap is at &euro;1,000 and that anybody who has insurance of less than &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child is not affected at all by this measure, one can see that it is a progressive and a targeted measure.  </p><p>It is the second most expensive tax credit in the tax code.  In 2013, the taxpayer will subsidise personal medical insurance to the tune of &euro;0.5 billion and Revenue has estimated that if we allow it proceed as it is proceeding, the subsidy will rise to &euro;1 billion in 2020.  I cannot justify that when people on very low incomes who buy a few household goods or a packet of cigarettes or have a pint are effectively subsidising the higher income people who have costly medical insurance policies to that extent.  </p><p>I believe private insurance is a good thing.  I am an advocate of private health insurance but somebody had better do something about the costs.  It rests with the companies in the first instance.  I cannot see why the extravagant bills being presented to the insurers are always honoured, much of the time without them being checked.  I ask the medical insurers to control their costs because astronomical amounts of money are being paid and much of the time for limited enough medical interventions.  That is the argument I would put forward.</p><p>If the Senator requires additional information, he can see how it progresses.  The credit cost &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012, &euro;500 million in 2013 and it is projected to cost &euro;1 billion in 2020.  The credit is not being removed; it is simply being capped.  The Senators can do the sums themselves.  If somebody is paying &euro;1,500, he or she will pay an extra &euro;100.  He or she will get the credit up to &euro;1,000 and then it is one fifth of the balance above that.  I know some people who have very high cost medical insurance will pay a lot.  If one is paying &euro;3,000, it is capped at &euro;1,000, so it is one fifth of &euro;2,000, which is a good bit of money.  It is an extra &euro;400.  I would assume that if one was paying &euro;3,000 for one's medical insurance, one could afford it.  I do not see why there should be a transfer of resources from people who are relying totally on public health, which is 56% of the population, to the top tranche of the 44% who are availing of medical insurance.  Those are the arguments.</p><p>There is a context also.  We had a very difficult budget where a lot of tax had to be raised.  It is a series of bad choices.  One would like to be in a position where one did not have to raise taxes, and I hope we will get back to that before too long.  In terms of raising taxes, we have to be fair and put the burden on the people who can best bear it and eliminate tax credits which are no longer necessary.  One could object to any one of them but when one lines them up against the other choices available to raise the same amount of money, one would return to these kinds of choices.  At least it is a progressive measure.  I thank those who have supported this measure and I commend it again to the House.</p></speech>

What is the Minister's view on the actual recommendation that he would effectively index link the tax credit in line with medical inflation?  I do not mean purely medical health insurance premiums; I am talking about medical costs.  That can be done because it is in the basket for inflation.  This would be a way to recognise the fact that all medical costs have gone up.  I agree with the Minister that the private health insurance companies need to look at their own costs and charges.  However, pressure is being put on that sector by the Minister for Health as a result of a number of initiatives he has taken, including further increasing the stamp duty and the additional charges for beds and so on.</p> <p>If it continues like this, with no certainty in the market, providers will leave.  Medical health insurance companies will be put out of this country.  We will be then left with the VHI.  </p><p>I have no idea where the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is going with his universal health care plans.  No-one knows.  I have consistently asked for debates on that issue in the House.  If this could be put in the context of the Minister's plan, it might be possible to argue that we do not need private health insurers in the long run but it is not clear to me what he intends to do.  The bottom line is that we can argue about figures as much as we like but a sizeable chunk of the population have been negatively affected by this measure.  I expect it to be counterproductive in the sense that it will push a lot of people out of private health insurance.  </p><p>To pull back from the section and deal specifically with the recommendation, does the Minister accept that there is some validity in it?  Will he consider it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200029#EE00200"><p>I support section 8 and did so on the night of the budget.  This is a subsidy which members of the Houses of the Oireachtas intended to be for sick people but it has been transformed into a provider subsidy, as the Minister has just described.  I fear that the same thing has happened with pension subsidies.  It is the industry which benefits and not the consumer, the intended beneficiary.  The figure provided by the Minister of an 86% increase in four years is astounding.  Apropos of the recommendation from Senator O'Brien, data from the Brookings Institution indicates that medical inflation in the United States is finally coming in below consumer price inflation.  The United States has traditionally had the highest medical costs in the world, equating to 17% of gross national income.  Our rate of 11% probably puts us second, or very close to it, on the list.  The Minister is right to ask the awkward questions about what this subsidy is for.</p><p>I have mentioned the 2010 Milliman report on private health insurance in Ireland in this House previously.  That report found a limited focus on investing in ways to manage claims, regardless of the risk profile of the population or on the need to limit inappropriate treatment with no proven medical benefit.  What are subsidising here?  The Minister is right to ask value-for-money questions.  The Department of Health must have a stronger focus on the sector because we cannot continue with 85% increases in four years.  The aforementioned report also found that there is considerable opportunity to reduce utilisation through avoiding unnecessary admissions and reducing the length of stay.  The report contains data on the average length of stay for inpatient admissions.  In Ireland, the average is 10.6 days while best international practice is 3.7 days.  Senator O'Brien has already referred to the charge of &euro;800 per night for seven unnecessary days in hospital.  Page 37 of the Milliman report refers to the fact that attempts to reduce the average length of stay for inpatients have run into &quot;push back&quot; from medical consultants.  </p><p>This is not gold-plating.  These guys are solid gold the whole way through.  They do not plate the ornaments.  Let us say, for the sake of argument, that we decide that we are only accepting 3.7 days and are not going to pay for 10.6 days.  That would be one way to tackle the problem as opposed to the method opted for in the budget.  My amendment was judged to be outside the scope of the Bill but in it I was trying to increase the Minister's chances of being able to do it, if HIQA gives us references for length of stay and appropriateness of treatments.  </p><p>Senator Burke wins the Peter Mathews prize for advocacy on the question of the cost of drugs.  That is one of his leading topics.  Newspapers today are reporting that some drugs here cost more than twice the reference rate in Spain.  In some instances, our drugs cost 90% more than elsewhere.  We are trying to help sick people here but it looks like a tax break for tax payers is benefiting the insurers rather than sick people.  In terms of recommendations to try to stop the cost going from &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1 billion, some reference point is required so that we can judge whether treatments are unnecessary or excessively expensive and would not meet the qualifications set by Milliman.  Mr. Pat Mc Loughlin is preparing a report on this area for the Department.  He has already submitted a report on cost-saving in local government.  We must confront this issue head on.  This is a tax break that has ended up benefitting seriously rich people in this country and not sick people.  I believe the Minister is right to tackle it.  As long as a tax break continues, we must deal with average length of stay, the cost of drugs and the appropriateness of medical procedures.  We must figure out why we pay so much more than the Spanish for our drugs and why we have such high levels of unnecessary hospitalisation for excessively long periods and why the bill for all of this-----</p></speech>

The costs are doubling and the tax break is available which is why we are moving from hundreds of millions to a figure of &euro;1 billion by 2016.  The people on the other side of the House who are criticising the Government for bringing in the types of budgets we have introduced in recent years will also be decrying the continuation of these types of tax breaks.  When costs go beyond a point that is reasonable, we must do something.  That is why we are here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200029#EE00600"><p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions.  On Senator O'Brien's precise question about indexation of this new measure, I would be opposed to that because I want to keep control of the cost of tax credits in the hands of the Minister for Finance of the day.  I do not want to index this because that would transfer the control of costs totally to the companies and they would just keep ratcheting them up.</p><p>A number of assertions were made in the debate which are not factually correct.  One is that everybody will give up their health insurance as a result of this measure.  Health insurance is very inelastic and does not respond very much to price rises.  Despite the fact that prices went up by 86% in the past four years, the number of those insured dropped by only 7.5%.  That was mostly due to the recession and people losing their jobs.  It is quite an inelastic product and does not respond to price changes very quickly.  </p><p>Despite the fact that costs have gone up so much, two of the insurance companies, Aviva and Laya Healthcare, have both indicated that they are going to increase their prices by approximately 5% from the start of next year.  All of the health insurance companies operating here are profitable.  Laya Healthcare is now the second largest insurer and made profits of almost &euro;5 million last year.  It has increased membership by 5.5%, from 450,000 to 475,000.  VHI recorded an after-tax surplus of &euro;54.3 million last year.  However, when once-off credits are excluded, the remaining surplus was &euro;16.1 million for the year.  The insurer recorded a &euro;7.2 million loss on its core health insurance business but this was offset by profits made in its dental, travel and international business.  Premium income was up by 9% to &euro;1.43 billion, as rising individual premiums more than made up for the 50,000 fall in customer numbers.  It was reported earlier this year that Aviva had made an operating profit of approximately &euro;28 million in the first six months of 2013 in Ireland.  This was more than double the profits from the same period last year.  These figures relate to Aviva's life and general insurance business but are not further broken down to allow examination of profits achieved from its medical insurance offering.  </p><p>Companies have to make a profit so that they can continue in business.  </p> <p>I am not one of those advocates who object to profitable companies.  I need to control the costs of the subsidies for medical insurance, which are being paid by the taxpayer.  I think medical costs have gone out of hand and must be controlled.  The insurers are in the best position to control them.  It is not sufficient for insurance companies to pay  consultant fees, which seems high, and when they run short of money raise the premiums at the end of the year.  We cannot continue on that basis.  I know health insurance is an inelastic product and the companies feel they will maintain their customer base.  I ask health insurance companies to control the costs by putting more pressure on the service providers and not automatically pay the bills when they receive them.  I advise policyholders to look again at the multiplicity of insurance policies that are now on offer across the companies and see if they can get the same cover for less.  A number of constituents have told me that when they examined policies across the companies they were able to get the same for significantly less. </p><p>I will now respond to the point made by Senator Barrett.  I like to give certainty on policy so I will not be revisiting this next year.  As long as I am the Minister for Finance, the cap on tax relief for health insurance will be &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child.  I need to give certainty to the industry.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; daoine eile ag iarraidh caint ar seo freisin.  There may have been other contributors.  We were waiting for the Minister to respond to amendment No. 37 which relates to the water charging policy because we are not sure what the water charge will be and, therefore, we want built into the legislation an ability to pay clause.  In other words, where people struggle to pay, their ability to pay will be taken into account.</p><p>The point I was making during the course of the debate on Tuesday was that the ability of individuals, based on their income, has to be taken into consideration.  For example, a different percentage of the household income would be taken into account for a person on a high income of more than &euro;100,000 compared to a person on a low social welfare income of, say, &euro;15,000, that is, a father, mother and children.  It would cost more as a percentage of their income to flush their toilet or to fill the kettle.  It goes back to the amendment tabled by Senator Barrett in respect of a water allowance where I think he proposed 100 litres per person per day.  Obviously a distinction has to be made between those who can pay and will not do so, and those who simply cannot afford to pay.</p><p>I suggested on Tuesday that the Department allow for an appeals process whereby an individual who cannot afford to pay would write to the water section of the county council, building in a process where local councillors could represent individuals to demonstrate a case where they simply cannot afford to pay and that the county council would make the case to Irish Water on the person's behalf.   Often when an ordinary citizen is dealing with a semi-State organisation, a bank or the ESB, it can be very difficult for that citizen and before one knows it the ESB or the semi-State organisation has employed the service of solicitors.</p> <p>That should be cut out and the county council should represent the case for the individual, the individual having demonstrated, through a prescribed form or otherwise, that he or she cannot afford to pay.  </p><p>There are two elements to the amendment and I hope the Minister of State will accept it for the sake of society.  If the amendment is not accepted, the consequences will be that we will have a semi-State organisation that is out of the hands of public representatives and away from the scrutiny of the Oireachtas.  While it may be answerable to the Minister, it will not be answerable to the Houses nor any local authority in regard to determining who will be entitled to a write-off because this is not built into the legislation.  Therefore, the body will have exclusive power not only to charge and set charges, but to go after those charges.  Presumably, this will involve the services of debt collectors and solicitors, just as it does in the case of the ESB or Airtricity.</p><p>This organisation is being established using the same template as those companies.  We all know that where an individual has a dispute with a utility supplier, even if it only involves a couple of hundred euro or less, a debt collection agency or the services of a legal firm tend to be employed and before we know it, the individual consumer has very few rights.  I would hate to see that kind of situation emerge in this case.  It would be bad for society, because water is so important for life.  It would also be very bad for the institutions of democratic politics if this was allowed to happen.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State has reflected on this and that he is willing to accept the amendment or an alternative form of it.  If the provision I seek is not built into the legislation, I have no option but to press the amendment, because I believe that those who genuinely cannot pay will be forced into a corner and their situation will become even darker once debt collectors or legal practitioners are called in to try to obtain the moneys for the massive organisation of Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Cuireann an leas&uacute; &aacute;irithe seo at&aacute; molta cuid mhaith imn&iacute; ar dhaoine i gcomhth&eacute;acs cuid de na r&aacute;itis.</p><p>Many people were listening to the debate the other day and picked up on some of the points made, particularly points made in regard to this specific amendment on the ability to pay principle.  The Minister of State said that the people who can pay, will pay.  Will he clarify which legislation will be used to enforce that?  In the case of the household charge, there was a serious issue when the county councils tried to collect the moneys for the household charge and subsequently the property tax was handed over for collection to the Revenue Commissioners.  In this scenario, what mechanism will be used to take the moneys from those people who do not pay their Bills, notwithstanding whether they have the ability to pay or not?  Will the Government use powers to allow payments be made from State payments, such as social welfare payments or REPS payments?</p><p>With the property tax, the Government has given the Revenue Commissioners the powers to allow them take moneys directly from people's bank accounts.  If people are not in a position to pay their water bill to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, what power will be given to Uisce &Eacute;ireann or what mechanism can it use and how far can it go to take that money from people?  The Minister of State has said that people will not be criminalised or sent to prison.  However, taking money from people who are already stretched means they will not have that money to spend on other essentials and is almost as bad as criminalising them.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200033#KK00300"><p>I support Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's amendment.  The ability to pay should be taken into account and is taken into account in the billions of euro of tax money that goes from households into the system.  People have a tax free allowance and there was a 20% rate charged on medium incomes and a top rate.  The principle enunciated by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is a good one.</p><p>People know there is no role for the National Consumer Agency in this as that has been ruled out of order.  There is no role for the Competition Authority either and we do not know the price people will be charged, because the Minister has not told us.  We do not know how much of a free allowance will be given.  I suggested it should be 100 litres, but that was rejected.  It would be a surprise if it would be more than 100 litres a day and as the 100 litres has been rejected, we can presume what it is intended to award is less than that.  The consumer is completely unprotected in this Bill and by the Minister of State's presentation of it.  We need some protection for consumers because there has been too much secrecy, obfuscation, concealment and unwillingness to allow any consumer element into the legislation at all.  That is unsatisfactory.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is to be commended for trying to open up some principles here, because what has been happening up to now is unsatisfactory.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200033#KK00400"><p>I ask the Minister of State to correct the record of the House.  Senator Barrett said the National Consumer Agency is debarred from this, but it is not.  Any citizen in the country can take up an issue with regard to water, whether it concerns the provision of water, the type of water or whatever, with the National Consumer Agency, just as he or she can with any other consumer goods.  Therefore, the consumer is protected under this Bill, just as in any other sphere in regard to an item that is consumed.  Water is included in this.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to clarify that, because it would be an important element of the Bill if it was to suggest the consumer had no rights at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200033#KK00500"><p>The last evening we were here, we discussed two of these amendments and I understood they had been dealt with and that amendment No. 40 was next.  Notwithstanding that, the picture painted here by some of the Senators on the other side of the House is wrong and misleading and does not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>If we accepted the point of view of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, we would believe that the country is filled with solicitors writing letters to millions of customers, that people are knocking on customers' doors and customers are being dragged before the courts.  That is rubbish.  It does not happen with any other utility and certainly will not happen with Irish Water.  In regard to people sticking their noses into bank accounts, there is no issue in regard to the powers of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  It will not have the power to do that and the Revenue will not be assisting it.  However, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will expect Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and me to pay our bills.  If the Senator can, like me, afford to pay, that is what he should do.</p><p>I accept and acknowledge Senator Barrett's knowledge and integrity, but I am disappointed with his comments because he says the consumer is not protected.  The reason regulators are in place is to protect consumers.  Look, for example, at the CER and the process through which it works.  The CER makes it clear from its perspective as regulator that there will be due process in what it is doing.  It has already had initial consultation on what will be taken into account and has advised the Government on what it thinks of what Senator Barrett and I have said on the issue as members of the public and will now go through a due, fair, transparent and accountable process.</p><p>As a Minister, I am not a member of an Oireachtas committee, but the Senators here are members of committees and have the powers to insist on Irish Water coming before a committee or to invite a regulator to come in or a Minister or Department to clarify these issues.  There is nothing to hide in this regard.  Nothing is hidden and the whole process will be transparent and accountable.  The point I wish to make clear is that there is nothing here that is different.  There are no legions of solicitors and lawyers involved at all.  I have been a public representative for many years and I deal with people who have financial difficulties all the time.  We all do.  I know from my experience with energy companies that a Member can, in the presence of a constituent, make a phone call to the utility and articulate the case and ensure that any issues are dealt with.</p> <p>I must say that any time I have spoken to people in the power companies such as Bord G&aacute;is, they have always listened and they will always do their very best.  That has been my experience and I will stand over it.  I know the country will stand over it because, notwithstanding the fact that there are exceptions which do not work out, it is wrong to paint these utilities as the monster the Senator is making them out to be.  The Senator thinks it is a political point, but I do not think it is.  I would much prefer the Senator would go through the detail and the facts.  The facts are on how water charges will be approved and how they will be analysed.  That is very clear.</p><p>The commission will consider the water charges plan submitted by Irish Water.  In consideration of the costs of Irish Water, the commission will obtain a high level of detail on Irish Water's costs.  It will be subject to detailed analysis by the financial, economic and technical consultants within the commission.  This analysis will include an examination of the historic and forecast operation expenditure of the company, the value of the asset base - the network - and the appropriate cost of capital for the investment plans.  Only after the public consultation process will the CER then consider all matters raised in that process.  At all times, the CER will only allow reasonable and appropriate efficiency costs for the provision of water services by Irish Water.  The overriding objective is to ensure that only reasonable and appropriate costs for the provision of water services by Irish Water are charged to customers.</p><p>The Bill provides that Irish Water will be required to prepare codes of practice on the very issues the Senator has raised.  These codes of practice will cover various matters, including complaints procedures, billing methods, payment of bills, the provision of information to customers.  All codes of practice prepared by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the commission.  The commission has the power to direct Irish Water to prepare a code of practice in any area where it is in the interests of the customers of Irish Water.  For any code of practice published in accordance with the Bill, the commission has the power to direct Irish Water to comply with any aspect of the code of practice which Irish Water is legally obliged to do with such a direction.</p><p>The Water Services Act provides the commission with a role to consult on matters relevant to the regulation of water services.  I do not see this world that the Senators are talking about.  It does not exist.  We are talking about a more efficient, effective model that is transparent and accountable, and the Senators' powers over this, as Members of the Oireachtas, are very strong, notwithstanding anything I might say here.  Members should bring those concerned before their committee and put them through the mill, because committees are there so that their members can have satisfaction of the issues that they wish to raise.  I absolutely reject what Senators are saying here.  We have to get real about this.</p><p>The EPA report into water quality in Ireland, published yesterday makes for profound and important reading.  It shows how well we are doing in many areas, but it also points out difficulties with water supply, with boiling of water and E. coli contamination in some areas.  Notwithstanding all the changes that have occurred, there are further significant improvements to be made.  Where is the money going to come from to do that?  Who is going to improve the infrastructure?  It is not going to fall out of the sky.  We will have to raise the money in the different ways that I said the last day, namely, through tariffs on commercial companies, the borrowings that Irish Water will make, the other capital investors they attract and from the charges that they levy.</p><p>At any stage in the process, the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government has the power to issue a direction to Irish Water.  To say that Irish Water has untrammeled power and can run through the bank accounts of the people of this country is rubbish, as it is to say that there will not be understanding of affordability issues and that needs will not be met.  When we are talking about affordability, it will not work if we do not take into account the ability of people to pay.  It is certain that there will be a free allowance for people.  There are also questions about health issues and high users of water for other reasons and on low income.  All of those issues will have to be dealt with in a transparent, accountable way.  There is nothing hidden here, so I ask the Senator to think again before making the type of comments he is making.  The reality is entirely different.</p></speech>

How can anyone have faith in the CER when everyone's income is going down, yet it allowed the ESB to increase its electricity charges by 15% year-on-year over the last three years?  That happened at a time when the average wage was reduced by around 35%.  That is a crazy situation, yet we are giving the CER the blessing to decide on the charge consumers should pay for their water.  It is flabbergasting.</p><p>Of course we can write to the National Consumer Agency and make a complaint but the simple answer will be that the agency cannot make a determination based on the manner in which the Irish Water legislation is written, the manner in which the company is established, and the manner in which the charging policy is established.  In reality we are giving huge powers to a company that has not proven itself, but which has been established by this Government.  It will be a massive quango operation to decide on the price of the water, to consult with the CER and to decide in what manner it sees fit to collect that money, irrespective of ability to pay.</p> <p>All of this is being done in the ten days before Christmas when we hope Oireachtas Members are busy finishing constituency or other commitments.

I am only reflecting the concerns expressed to me by Members of the D&aacute;il, including Fianna F&aacute;il's environment spokesperson, Deputy Barry Cowen, who is deeply annoyed at the manner in which this legislation is being rammed through the D&aacute;il, as I am sure are the other Opposition spokespersons.</p><p>As the Minister of State rightly points out, there are issues with the quality of our drinking water.  That is absolutely certain.  There are issues about the need to improve the infrastructure for our water supply.  That is why until now tax was collected.  There is a need to charge for water and I can see the point of it.  There is also a need to make sure that those who cannot afford to meet the charge will be given the opportunity to demonstrate that they cannot pay it.  There is a lack of compassion being shown in respect of this amendment and the absence of any form of appeals mechanism.</p><p>No Member of this or the other House will have an opportunity to decide on the charge.  We discussed the level of the charge here.  A few days ago the Minister of State mentioned a flat in London.  I was reading up on charges in London.  They are below the European average.  The average charge for water in Europe, if applied in Ireland, would come in at approximately &euro;360 per household.  If we were to move on the basis of what is charged in London, it would be in the region of &euro;300 per household.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service and Senator Sean D. Barrett have investigated the real cost and it will be approximately &euro;740.</p><p>There has been another cosy deal whereby under local government legislation up to &euro;600 million has been transferred from the local government fund and which I understand will go into Irish Water.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether that is going to happen and whether the money will be transferred to Irish Water?  How will councillors meet the shortfall of &euro;600 million which is being taken from the local government fund to fund semi-State organisations that are beyond democratic accountability?  They are accountable to the committees, but they are beyond democratic accountability in respect of how they set charges and collect money.  I have major concerns about what will happen.</p><p>People will be able to approach their public representatives after they receive their bills and Irish Water has retained the services of debt collectors or solicitors.  Will the Minister of State confirm that Irish Water will not retain the services of debt collectors or solicitors to recover moneys due?  Perhaps that is not the case and I am reading this wrong and it will not go down that road.  Perhaps it will assume people genuinely cannot pay.  There should be criteria set down in legislation to protect those who cannot pay from those who do not want to pay.  There will be people who are well off and can afford to pay but who will decide not to do so.  That has to be laid down in legislation to protect against misuse but also to protect those who cannot afford to pay.  I am disappointed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  We had a very good discussion a couple of days ago, but so far today I am disappointed that it appears that the thrust of the amendment will not be accepted.  If that is the case, I will press the amendment.  That is unfortunate because we are here to be constructive.  We are trying to protect the interests of those who will find it difficult to protect themselves against the beast that will be Uisce &Eacute;ireann or Irish Water.</p></speech>

The Minister of State paints a very benevolent picture of utility companies which, unfortunately, is not recognisable in reality.  In March this year the ESB announced that its profit before taxation had risen to &euro;327.6 million in 2012, up from &euro;78.8 million in the previous year.  The figures published by the Commission for Energy Regulation, about which the Minister of State also spoke, showed that in that year, when it made a massive profit, this benevolent company, as the Minister of State describes it, had cut off the electricity supply to 12,854 households in the first three quarters of 2012.  It disconnected almost 17,800 customers during 2011.  The gas supply of 2,479 domestic customers was cut off between July and September 2012.  In the past two years, prior to last March, gas and electricity prices rose by an average of 30%.  What the Minister of State says about the ESB and other utility companies lending a friendly ear and listening carefully to people&rsquo;s cases is not borne out on the ground.</p></speech>

What he has said is not borne out on the ground.  That is the genuine concern.  People find it very difficult to pay their bills.  Perhaps some of these 13,000 customers are also the people who will find it very difficult to pay their water bills.</p><p>The Minister of State did not answer my question.  He talked about people who could pay.  I asked about those who could not pay, the subject of the amendment proposed.  Who will adjudicate on that issue?  Will it be Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  If so, why should we think it will be any more understanding than the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is Energy, or any other utility company?  We have been told that no water supply will be cut off.  What will happen?  What measures will Uisce &Eacute;ireann take to ensure it receives payment of the money from those it thinks can pay?  What is its measure of ability to pay?  I take it that it will not have the powers the Revenue Commissioners have of checking somebody&rsquo;s income, how much tax they pay and how many dependants they have.  Who will adjudicate?  This is ill thought out.</p><p>Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment is fair and one we have to take on board.  It is not just about politics.  This is about people on the ground who are being put to the pin of their collar now and who will have to pay an extra utility bill as part of their weekly expenses.  Will the Minister of State clarify what measures Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be able to take?  How will it effect payment?  What powers will it have?  Will it use standing orders?  How can it go after people?  If people do not hand over the cash, what will it do?  Will it cut the water supply to a trickle?  It might not be cut off completely.  If it does, what will be the consequences for the households affected? </p></speech>

The ESB was always able to meet people&rsquo;s needs by helping them go to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  I appreciate and understand people get into debt.  The MABS is a fantastic agency which helps people in the first instance.  I have never known of a person who was cut off.  Sometimes the ESB will give a person a special card to enable him or her to prepay.  It might contain a portion of the bill the person owes, plus current electricity usage.  If people can pay, they should.  That is the point.</p> <p> Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to water poverty.  If after dealing with housing and other costs, the water charge is greater than 3% of net income, one is deemed to be in what is termed water poverty.  This is a significant issue that must be addressed and I assure the House it will be.  The protocols will need to be in place.  The regulator will be responsible for overseeing the complaints procedure, the billing and payment methods and the provision of information and assistance for customers.  There is no ogre.  I profoundly disagree with the description of Irish Water by other speakers.  Oireachtas committees have real power in that they may question outside bodies.  I suggest this could be done in January in order to clarify issues to the satisfaction of Members.  I am confident that the Government's decision on the free allowance and the arrangements for those in genuine difficulty will deal with these concerns.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.346" nospeaker="true" time="15:20:00" ><p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 17, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&quot;</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200037#OO00200"><p>We engaged in a lengthy debate on charges and we have just discussed an amendment designed to include an ability-to-pay clause in the Bill.  It is disappointing that the Government voted down that amendment, which was an attempt by those of us who oppose the charges in the first instance to try to bring some element of fairness to the process.  People have different views as to whether water charges are justified, particularly in the current economic climate.  As I informed the Minister of State previously, they have already been hit with a raft of other charges and cuts by this Government and that which preceded it.  The very least anyone would have sought would be for the Government to protect families on the lowest incomes and ensure an element of progressiveness in respect of the charge in order that high-income families will not end up paying the same amount as their low-income counterparts.</p><p>We are going down a very dangerous road in the context of the charges being introduced by the Government.  I accept that we discussed this matter earlier in our deliberations but I reiterate that the same thing happened in respect of the household charge.  That charge - or the property tax, as it is now known - is neither fair nor progressive and it is not linked to people's ability to pay.  It is a case of &quot;Here we go again&quot; in respect of water charges.  More families are going to be obliged to live in poverty if we continue to move away from progressive taxes by means of which people can be taxed directly on their income and towards a situation whereby an increasing number of indirect, unfair and regressive taxes will be introduced.  When the Ministers for Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister of State currently before the House seek to sell these types of taxes and charges, they state that they are necessary because of the need to bring in more revenue.</p> <p>They also state that what we do not want to do is tax jobs because taxing income is taxing jobs.</p><p> If new charges are imposed, the money comes out of people's pockets in their wages through direct taxes or through indirect charges.  That is the reality.  Rather than moving to increase taxes for the wealthy and the top earners in our society, the Minister of State has moved to bring in these regressive charges which are not fair.  I have no doubt that as people learn more about what is being proposed in respect of water charges they will be very angry about it.  I imagine over the course of the next few days the Government will make a great deal of our coming out of the bailout programme and the improved economic situation as its members see it, but there are many families who will not be celebrating with the Minister of State and who will not be looking forward to the prospect of water charges coming on top of all of the other charges that have been foisted upon them during the past few years.  They will be even angrier again when they find out that there is no level of progressiveness to it in that there is no ability to pay element to it.  Any attempt by the Opposition to introduce an ability to pay element to the charge was knocked back.  Essentially, that is the core argument I have with the Minister of State and the Government's approach to this issue.  It is a bit like all of the other charges the Government has brought it.  The Minister of State just wants us to buy a pig in a poke.  He will not tell us exactly or give any indication as to how this will work out, how much it will cost, how it will be calculated or how low-income families will be protected. </p><p><b>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd:</b>That is not true.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister of State that he has not given us any indication of the level of charge that will be imposed on people.  Families have no idea how much this will cost them.  Senator Barrett in a previous debate today mentioned the figure of &euro;750.  The Minister of State said it would not be anything like that figure, therefore, he should give us some indication as to what it will be like and then explain to us again in detail how its will be calculated in a fair and progressive way and how low income families will be protected.   He should at least give families some idea of the bill they will be expected to pay on top of the property tax next year.  I have not heard the answer to that question up to now.  We have heard broad discussions about how he will do his best to protect low income families and broad strokes but we have heard no detail.  For him to say he has given us detail is a nonsense.  I give the Minister of State the opportunity again to set the record straight and to explain the position to families who, when they learn more about this, will be asking all of us how much this will cost them in their pockets.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200038#PP02400"><p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.  I thought I had indicated that I want to speak but I had not.</p><p>Section 17 relates to a water charges plan and it is a very important part of the Bill.  It sets out the criteria and the manner in which the charging can take place.  It sets out where Irish Water can consult with the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It states that a charges plan shall apply in respect of such period as the commission shall direct.  We are giving the commission the power to direct the length of time those charges should apply, whether it be one year, two years or five years.  The commission has the authority to determine, under section 17, the length of time in which the charging plan shall last.  It also has the power to specify the manner and method by which the charges, under section 16, can be calculated.  This goes back to the fundamental question of the competency of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  </p><p>Power is being removed from Members of the Oireachtas to have an input, through both Houses, into the level of the water charge and, in addition to that, there is the question of the inability to pay element.  I very much regret that the amendment on the ability to pay principle has been rejected.  That is a grave mistake.  The spirit of this amendment is that those who genuinely cannot pay the charge should have an opportunity to state their case and explain why they cannot pay it and that should be taken into consideration.  Unfortunately we are leaving that in the hands of the gods or those who may be less compassionate than the gods.  In other words, we are leaving that to Irish Water, which will be a massive organisation.</p><p>Similar organisations have been established by various Governments in the past and have proven, over time, not to be the most effective, efficient or compassionate.  We are establishing another similar type of organisation and entrusting it to be effective, efficient and compassionate when all the similar organisations that have been established meet none of those criteria.  We are now establishing another one and giving it massive powers under this legislation to set whatever price it sees fit based on whatever plans it draws up for whatever infrastructure it sees fit to invest money in.  The Minister of State can rest assured that its bottom line objective will be to make money, not to lose money, and it will make money at all costs because it is compelled to do so and that is the reason it is being established.</p><p>The other question referred to in the section is the water discharged from premises, which will be charged for as well.  What happens in the case of people with individual septic tanks?  Surely they cannot be charged for water.  They would have spent money in putting in place a Pure Flow treatment system or a septic tank and that system would treat their effluent.  They can be charged for the cost of public drinking water but they cannot be charged for the discharge of wastewater.</p><p>The basis of this measure is that the charge will be based on water in and the same amount of water out but if the water out is going into a private contained sewerage system, as is the case in respect of many systems in rural Ireland, it would be very unfair for the Government to charge people for a service that they are not obtaining.  That aspect needs to be clarified as it is not clearly set out on line 4 of section 17 on page 13.  This is a fundamental section.  It sets out the powers we will give Irish Water, in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation, to determine whatever price it sees fit to charge for public drinking water and for the discharge of that water, and it removes that power from Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p>Irrespective of whether Members of the Houses of Oireachtas are in opposition or in government, at least they are in constant touch with the people.  We hear from the people the difficulties they are experiencing on any given day or week through our clinics.  We are better placed to determine what that level should be rather than some quango or the Commission for Energy Regulation which, thus far, has been the administrating authority for the provision of energy to Irish consumers, bearing in mind that Irish consumers are one of the highest paying consumers across Europe for the provision of energy by utilities to their homes with the cost of such provision increasing substantially year on year.</p> <p>How could one entrust that type of organisation to employ or allow a fair charging policy?  It is all wrong.  I fundamentally disagree with the system.  It is wrong to remove powers from democratically elected people - irrespective of which side of the House they are on - in these Houses, or from councillors across the country.</p><p>Councillors are being railroaded out of existence in terms of their function on water service provision.  I accept they are being consulted but I could consult anyone.  I could consult with the Irish football management team of Roy Keane and Martin O'Neill but they will not take on board what I have to say.  I would not expect them to because they have no obligation to do so.  Our role is to impose an obligation on Irish Water to at least listen to public representatives in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and local authorities.  Irish Water is not compelled to do so and that is fundamentally wrong.</p></speech>

The Bill clearly sets out that there is a method of calculation of charges in section 16 in respect of a customer to whom the approved water charges apply.  Therefore, the section recognises that not everybody will come under the same category.  Not everybody will have the same means and not everybody will use the same amount of water.  Different households can have different needs.</p></speech>

If a person cannot afford to pay then free legal aid is available if a person wants to go down that route but, as the Minister of State said, the system is totally transparent.</p></speech>

I would not expect to see that even in a Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto.</p><p>I refer Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill to the EPA report.  It is exceptionally clear on the issues that must be addressed by Irish Water.  There were approximately 339 individual supplies in 2008, in which the EPA found a deficiency with public water supplies when conducting a risk-based assessment, either in terms of the infrastructure or operational practice.  It set up a remedial action list, RAL.  Of the original 339, a total of 237 have now been removed.  However, remedial works will be completed on a further 47 of the original supplies by the end of 2013.  Much work must be carried out to improve the service in various counties.</p><p>I am not sure whether Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is from Donegal but according to the EPA report Donegal County Council has not provided a completion date for seven supplies in his county.  Seven supplies in County Donegal are on the remedial action list and need to be updated.</p></speech>

It has compiled the remedial action list.  Improvement works and schemes with boiled water notices must be prioritised.  If one lives in a town where one has to boil the water because it is contaminated and it is not fit for human consumption without being boiled then Irish Water has to deal with that.  There is a requirement for cryptosporidium barriers where surface water at source is critical.  We must deal with that as well.  Irish Water must take action where there are lead distribution mains to be replaced.  We must have regard to the new lead parameters which means the matter must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  We also have to detect pesticide exceedence in public water supplies.  Many other issues also arise.</p><p>At the heart of everything the Opposition has said is an attack on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  Members have said the CER is not transparent or accountable and that it will not be held accountable.  I pointed out to Members already that the Oireachtas is the primary source of accountability.  I am accountable to the House today and the Oireachtas will be accountable for Irish Water tomorrow and for the CER.  The CER is committed to regulating in a fair, transparent and consistent manner.  Fairness means that it will regulate the water industry in an even handed and balanced way, treating all stakeholders without bias.  The CER will be transparent, which is a point made by Senator Keane.  Transparency means that it will conduct its activities in an open manner so that those who are affected by its decisions can clearly see how it came to those decisions in the first place.  Consistency means that the CER will regulate the water industry with steady continuity by adhering to those values.</p><p>The CER will act with integrity and respect.  They are two very important words.  Integrity means that it will act in an honest and ethical fashion when regulating the water industry.  It will value the opinion and viewpoints of all stakeholders, both those who agree and those who do not agree.  When regulating the water industry the CER will always respect the right of all stakeholders to their own viewpoint and to communicate their viewpoint to the CER.</p><p>The CER intends that there will be proper consultation with stakeholders and customers.  That means it will engage meaningfully with those who are affected by our decisions.  It will come in the form of talking to people, being accessible to people, meeting them, listening to them and being proactive in the sense of communications.  Proper consultation seeks advice and information from people that will help to promote confidence in them that the CER is regulating the water industry effectively.  The CER will be most credible when it listens and shows that it is listening to those affected by its decisions.  The report contains much information for Senator Cullinane to think about.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il proposed that county councillors would decide what the charge would be.  That is the whole problem.  The charge fixed by county councils differs.  If one live in County Kildare one&rsquo;s charge for water is half what it is in County Wicklow.  This is because the supplies are controlled individually by 34 local authorities.  Irish Water is doing away with that difference and introducing a fair system.  The same charge will be levied no matter where one lives, what one&rsquo;s job is or what industry one is in.</p> <p> Second, if one lives in a county that does not have the capacity to meet its water needs or to improve its possibly inadequate water systems, it is by all the country working together and pooling all the resources into a single authority that one will have a plan.  There will be a development plan from Irish Water, extending over a period of years, which will be clear, transparent, accountable and funded in order that everyone will get the potable water he or she deserves and industries, no matter where they are located, will have the water they require to keep going.  Most importantly, Ireland will be the most effective country for water-intensive industries to locate in because we do not have a shortage of water.  While everyone knows that, it is also the case that we do not have adequate water supply in the greater Dublin area.  Members should cast their minds back to three weeks ago, when there was a problem with water in Dublin.  At the time, we were faced with water supplies being shut down during the night, so that people could not use the water system.  There is a serious deficiency to be met and this is what Irish Water is about.  It is not on the level of the county council and one cannot think in county council terms any more, because that is just not big enough thinking for the country.  This is the reason this development is happening and is the reason things must change.</p><p>Moreover, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is absolutely wrong about councillors.  Councillors will be consulted and Irish Water is committed to having in every county council-----</p></speech>

The fact is that there will be an official in the county council of the Senator's home county who will be responsible to the elected members for all issues in respect of water and water infrastructure plans.  Second, notwithstanding the provision of a hotline nationally for everyone, there also will be a dedicated line for public representatives that the Senator or I or anyone else who is a public representative can ring up.  Such public representatives can ring to report a serious problem has arisen, that they are getting calls from such and such a place and can ask what is going on.  There will be accountability from Irish Water, as well as the possibility of sending text messages if issues arise in one's locality.  There will be joined-up thinking in respect of what a councillor knows.  I am familiar with this myself, because it was not too long ago that the entire water supply in the whole country closed down over Christmas because pipes had not been laid at the right depth in many estates.  The Government is building an infrastructure for the future in order that Ireland will be a country that can stand over all the inward investment in industries such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals and, obviously, the information and communications technology sector.  We will be the best in class in Europe in this regard and that is what the Government is about.  I ask the Senator to broaden his mind and to open up to some of these ideas, because this is what is happening.  Ireland must be in that position and by building up Uisce &Eacute;ireann, that is what the Government is doing.</p><p>The points the Senator has repeated endlessly here ultimately do not add up to a tin of beans.  The Senator should listen and should think again.  He should work with us to get this right.  The regulator, Irish Water, the Minister and everyone should be brought in, as this is what is happening in Ireland.  This is the reason we are recovering from this economic recession.  The Government has plans, Ireland has a future and Irish Water is a core part of that future.</p></speech>

The first question I asked him is what people are likely to pay in water charges - that is, what are the likely water charges - and he has not given an answer.  Members of neither this democratically elected Chamber nor the D&aacute;il can tell people out in the communities what they will be paying.  The Minister of State is asking Members to support this Bill without knowing precisely how the charge will be put in place or what people will pay.  The Minister of State cannot even tell Members how much the Government intends to collect in water charges.  He cannot even provide them with a figure in this regard.  He has been asked several times, by Senators Barrett, &Oacute; Domhnaill and &Oacute; Clochartaigh and me, how much the Government intends to take in in water charges but he has not given an answer.  As the Minister of State is not in a position to give an answer, how are Members supposed to support the Bill?  The Minister of State spoke of openness, of working with him and of accountability.  He wants Members to buy a pig in a poke and then tell people in the communities that while they supported the Bill, they have no idea whatsoever how it will affect people.</p></speech>

They certainly know it will not be linked to ability to pay, because there will be a vote on that later and I am sure it will be voted down by the Government Members.</p><p>On the question of ability to pay and in regard to this section in general, I note that in her response, Senator Keane tried to pretend that all the answers were contained in the Bill.  The simple answer is either this will be linked to income or it will not.  This is another simple question for the Minister of State.  Will the charge be linked to the income of a household?  If not, we will be reverting to the Thatcherite notion that the house itself is where the income is earned.  However, it is the people who live in the house who earn money and consequently, the charge should be on the money coming into the house, not simply the number of people living therein.  The road down which the Minister is travelling is the same road Margaret Thatcher took in the 1980s - that is, a move away from the notion of direct and progressive taxation.  It is to get people to pay for everything separately, whereby the millionaire pays exactly the same as someone who earns &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  This is the Fine Gael ideology that is behind all this and that is what is driving it.  However, the Minister of State is not in a position to say otherwise because it is either linked to ability to pay and to income or it is not.  The Minister should at least give Members a straight answer to a straight question.  Will income be taken into account in the calculation of this charge?  The answer is either &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.  I ask for the fifth time, because the Minister of State has accused Members of asking-----</p></speech>

He seeks Members' support for the Bill and wants them to vote for it, to state it is a good Bill, that everything is great and to work with him but they do not even have the information with which they can go back to the people outside this Chamber.

One could consider other infrastructural items to ascertain whether any analogies could be drawn.  One probably would be correct to state that water is a natural resource, in the same way as electricity, yet payment for the latter is not linked to ability to pay.  It requires infrastructure to bring electricity to a house and the household pays for the electricity according to its use of it.  In the same way, infrastructure is required to bring water to a household, which will pay according to its use thereof.  This is very clear, as the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, will set the rates in this regard.</p><p>  It also might be helpful to try to find an analogy in other jurisdictions as to what happens with regard to ability to pay.  I will try to choose a jurisdiction at random that has a rates system or a water paying system, encompassing water in, water out and sewerage.  For instance, I will pick Northern Ireland at random.  A few seconds ago, I consulted the website <i>nidirect.gov.uk</i> on my mobile phone.</p></speech>

If water and sewerage do not constitute water, I am not sure what does.  The website states that if one is having difficulty paying rates, water charges or the household charge - all are linked together - one should contact the Land &amp;amp; Property Services, LPS, which will help one out.  I do not like paying bills - no one does - but the necessity of this legislation is self-evident.  The point is, in a jurisdiction close to here, a party whose members have been shouting and roaring abuse at the Minister of State for trying to bring through this legislation is actually in power and could do something, but it has done nothing.  If Senator Cullinane has suggested to the Minister of State that he is cranky, I would hardly blame him, because hypocrisy is one of the main sources of crankiness in my book.</p></speech>

Often, I blame the local authority as much as anybody else.  However, in a number of schemes that are awaiting construction, it is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, that is dragging its heels and changing the goalposts in relation to those schemes.</p><p>That is really irrelevant because the picture which the Minister of State depicted during the course of his contribution was that Irish Water is a white knight sailing in to improve the infrastructure.  As for who will play for it, the consumer will.  The transfer of assets, from the balance sheet of the State to Irish Water, will occur.  The ability to raise &euro;2 billion on the financial markets will occur.  The &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million, about which the Minister of State has failed to answer thus far, is being removed from the Local Government Fund, where councillors have control of it and decide how it is spent, and will be transferred across to Irish Water.  The charge that &euro;500 million of that money would go to Irish Water was not denied by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, when he was questioned last week at the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht meeting when he confirmed that the money was being transferred across.

The charging plan, which will affect every citizen in the country, does relate to this section.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, has failed categorically to spell out in any reasonable fashion a ballpark figure for what consumers can expect to pay for water.  If he is in control of this brief for the transfer to Irish Water of all of these powers, surely it would be reasonable for a consumer listening in on the Internet tonight to hear a ballpark figure from a Minister of State or are we correct in saying that he does not know, he does not want to know and he wants to give all of that power to the unelected and unaccountable staff of Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation because that is what he is saying if he is not willing to give us a ballpark figure?</p><p>The second issue, which was not answered either, relates to waste water discharged into private sewers.  Will those consumers pay for the water in and the water out, even though the discharges are going into private sewers, and how will that be calculated because it is not clear here?  The Bill, in subsection 17(10), states, &quot;For the purposes of calculating a charge under section 16, the amount of waste water discharged from a premises is deemed to be equal to the amount of water supplied to that premises, unless Irish Water and the customer agree otherwise.&quot;  What process will be established to allow the customer to agree otherwise?  Must every customer with the septic tank suddenly go measure the amount of waste water going into his or her septic tank?  What will be the system?  Will this be simple or will every house with a septic tank - it can be shown through planning permission - pay only for water in?  Does that mean that such a house will pay 50% of what a similar house connected to a public sewerage system will pay?  We need clarification on this.  Let us take the analogy of someone living in Dunshaughlin village connected to the public sewerage infrastructure paying, for argument's sake, the &euro;360 annual fee for water, that is, half for water in and half for water out.  A mile out the road in a rural area of Dunshaughlin, would a consumer living on a farm who has a private septic tank pay half of what the consumer in the town pays?  If Irish Water will not charge for discharged water, that would have to be the case because anything else would not be fair.  Can we get clarification on that point?  I ask the Minister of State to be specific in his reply.</p></speech>

I read it last year and the year before as well and I share the Minister of State's concerns on the quality of water.  He noted a number of counties.  In my county of Galway, there are problems in: Oughterard, Ballinasloe, Carraroe, Inis O&iacute;rr, Kinvara, Ballinasloe No. 1 - two different schemes for different issues, fluoride, lead and trihalomethanes - Ballyconneely, Portumna and Leenane.  The people in those areas are extremely concerned about the quality of the water and I have seen it at first hand.  The issue there is that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will not come in and sort out the problem immediately.  I noted that the people of Roscommon, for example, have been on boil-water notice for a long time.  There are 15,443 persons dependent on the water supply there and there are 30 supplies across the country on boil-water notices or restrictions.  I would contend, as has been alluded to, that the issue there has been a lack of capital investment over the past number of years.  It is important to note that the capital investment on water has been cut, from almost &euro;435 million in 2011 to &euro;331 million in 2012.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200041#SS01300"><p>It relates to the Minister of State's talk of the figures not adding up.  I go back to the charges and the money being brought in and the money going out.  We have had the &euro;1.2 billion figure that it costs to provide water.  The Minister of State needs to clarify how much the Government expects to collect in water charges and how much of that will be spent on capital investment to fix places such as Oughterard, Carraroe, Inis O&iacute;rr, Kinvara, Ballinasloe and Ballyconneely.  We as a rural community are well used to dealing with national organisations.  For example, when it comes to roads, we are always left on the hind teat when it comes to getting stuff in the most peripheral rural areas.  It is bad enough with the local authorities trying to get things done in rural areas.  Once we will be working with a national organisation such as Uisce &Eacute;ireann, how can we be confident that we will see the necessary investment?</p><p>On the figures given by Senator Barrett, there is a &euro;1 billion shortfall.  How much of that will be collected through the water charge?  How much of the shortfall will be divided over the households that can pay for it?</p><p>Another important issue has been brought up again by Senator Gilroy and it is important to nail this.  In May 2007, devolution was restored to the Assembly in the North and we in Sinn F&eacute;in succeeded in reversing the British direct rule proposal to introduce double the household water charges and the privatisation of water and sewerage services when the Assembly supported the appointment of Mr. Conor Murphy MP.</p></speech>

It is important to state that there are two rates - the regional rate and the Assembly rate.  It is important to note that the Assembly, because of my party's insistence, has been frozen for the past number of years.  Local authorities, of which Senator Gilroy would be aware, that have a majority of SDLP, for example, in Derry, have the highest rates in water because they do not have Sinn F&eacute;in ruling those particular local authorities.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is now adding an unknown extra tax &ndash; he will not state how much &ndash; for a service in respect of which we do not know what we will get.  We are not sure what investment will be made in the infrastructure.</p><p>The couple of hundred million euro being spent on water meters would be much better spent on installing the systems that need to be installed to fix the problems highlighted in the EPA reports year on year and to sort out the 34% leakage across the State.  I am not confident that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will solve those problems.  The Minister has not instilled confidence in this regard during the debate.  What he has given us is an awful lot of bluster.  He needs to give us much more detail if he wants any of us to support this Bill.</p></speech>

I have outlined what we have been saying.  The key is that the Senator has gone to the core of the issue, that is, the question of solving water problems where they exist.  He mentioned the significant number in his constituency.</p><p>Right around the country, all the county councils have plans stipulating where they envisage improvements, what they would like to do, the planning and the development commitments and the plans of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  All the agencies will feed into Irish Water.  It is exactly as the Senator describes.  I refer to consultation with local authorities, regional bodies and all agencies to ensure a plan is in place for the development and improvement of the water system.</p><p>It is the capital projects about which the Senator is talking.  There must be capital projects and current expenditure.  The liabilities and assets of each county council must be transferred to Irish Water.  When they are all accounted for and measured, Irish Water will submit its plans to the CER.  Then all the sums will be done and we will know what the plan will be.  We will know whether it covers two years, five years or 25 years.  Thus, there will be a plan for the whole country.</p><p>Paying for the plan is achieved in different ways, namely, through the actual charge, the commercial charge, the raising of funds, and, perhaps, companies investing in water infrastructure.  All these are put together in the plan.  When all I have described is done, there will be transparency in the decision-making.  It will be known what the CER proposes to do as a regulator and its reasons will be known.  The plan will be transparent and debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  At that stage, there will be total transparency.  I believe I have addressed all the points.</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, the Bill passed through all stages in the D&aacute;il recently.  The main objective of the Bill is to specify the amount of risk equalisation credits in respect of age, gender and level of cover that is payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2014 and to make consequential amendments to the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999 to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2014.  In addition, I am amending the amount of the hospital bed utilisation credit, HBUC, and some technical amendments to the Health Insurance Acts are also included.  I will further discuss the requirement for risk equalisation credits within our system of health insurance and the rationale used in setting the level of risk equalisation credits to apply from 1 March 2014 in due course but first, I would like to speak briefly about ongoing reform in the health system where the focus is to deliver a single-tier health service in which access is based on need and not on ability to pay.</p><p>The maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market is an essential step to facilitate the transition to a market-based universal health insurance, UHI, system and the measures provided in the Bill before the House today are a crucial element towards ensuring this objective.  The introduction of UHI is, of itself, a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years and I welcome the significant progress which has been made in recent months as follows.  In February 2012, I established an implementation group on universal health insurance to advise on the development of detailed and costed implementation proposals for UHI and the implementation of various elements of the reform programme.  The implementation group has met on 11 occasions and has advised the Department in respect of its work on some of the core building blocks for UHI, including the introduction of a money follows the patient funding system.  A money follows the patient policy document was published earlier this year and provides for a fairer and more transparent means of funding health care. Preparations for the roll out of money follows the patient are ongoing.  These preparations include a shadow funding exercise which is underway and detailed plans for the commencement of phased implementation of the new system in January 2014, which are in the process of being finalised.  In addition, intensive work is currently underway on the preparation of a white paper on UHI, which will provide more detail on the UHI model for Ireland with a view to publication as soon as possible.  I have received a draft.</p><p>While work is underway in respect of the key building blocks that will pave the way for the introduction of UHI, it is equally important to keep focus on the maintenance of a functioning voluntary private health insurance market in the lead-in to UHI.  The measures contained in this Bill are designed to ensure that the overall market is supported by keeping health insurance as affordable as possible for everyone in line with the key principle of community rating which underpins our health insurance system.  Community rating, reflecting the principle of inter-generational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance market.  Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely health status.  The aim of risk equalisation is to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers.  Risk equalisation aims to make health insurance more affordable for older people by supporting community-rated premiums.</p><p>There are four commercial insurers operating in the private health insurance market.  However, there is a clear disparity in the membership profile and thus the associated costs being incurred across the various commercial insurers.  Risk equalisation creates a level playing field in the market and provides for risk equalisation credits based on age, gender and level of cover in respect of insured people aged 50 and over.  Under the Health Insurance Acts, the Health Insurance Authority which is the statutory regulator of the industry, makes recommendations to the Minister annually on the applicable rates for the following year.  Having considered the expert analysis provided and having consulted with the Minister for Finance, I then set the rates for risk equalisation credit and the Minister for Finance sets the rate of stamp duty required to fund those credits.  The benefits of our system of community rating can best be seen as supporting the market as a whole and ensuring that through the provision of risk equalisation credits for older and less healthy customers, they can be helped and supported to purchase health insurance at an affordable price.  I wish now to focus for a moment on the specific changes made to the risk equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duties.that will apply from 1 March next year.</p><p>I am committed to progressively increasing the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  The Health Insurance Authority has determined that when luxury benefits are excluded, the revised risk equalisation credits will compensate for 78% of the higher claims costs of people in their 70s, which is up from 75% this year, and for 86% of the higher claims costs of those in their 80s, which is up from 83% this year.  Compared with 2013 rates, the revised risk equalisation credits for products providing advanced cover are increased.  In 2013, the risk equalisation rates for non-advanced cover were set at 85% of those for advanced.  This year, I am reducing that differential to 72.4% - this reflects the sharing of cost in respect of ageing but not sharing all of the costs of richer benefits provided under advanced plans.</p><p>A critical element of risk equalisation is to ensure that it promotes efficiency.  In its assessment of the required support levels, the Health Insurance Authority compares data across the market.</p> <p>Using market average data means that an insurer with higher than market average claim costs will continue to lose out to its competitors and will therefore have a strong incentive to reduce its costs towards, or even below, the market average.  In setting the rates for 2014, the net claims cost ceiling has been reduced from 140% to 133%.  Before allowing for the impact of the scheme, the claims costs of older lives are considerably higher than the claims costs of younger lives.  This gives insurers an incentive to target younger healthier people and push up prices for older people.  We see this through advertisements focusing on young people and a proliferation of products in the market where the products with benefits appealing to older people, such as 100% orthopaedic cover, are far more expensive than those appealing to younger people.</p><p> The risk equalisation scheme is self-funding, in other words, the cost of credits is met by the stamp duties raised.  In effect, the price of a health insurance premium payable by older individuals is discounted by the appropriate credit for their age, meaning that they actually pay the same price for the same product as a younger, healthier member.  This is in keeping with my overall commitment to community rating in the first instance and to progressively increase the extent to which risk equalisation compensates for the costs of insuring older customers.  Otherwise, health insurance would become prohibitively expensive for older customers, the majority of whom would be forced to leave the market at a time in their lives when they are likely to benefit from having it the most.</p><p> The stamp duty applicable for advanced plans is increased by &euro;49, from &euro;350 to &euro;399 per adult, and from &euro;120 to &euro;135 per child to fund the targeting of support where it is needed most, namely, older and more vulnerable patients who would otherwise not be able to afford private health insurance.  The availability of cheaper entry level products, in respect of which there is no increase in stamp duty, may encourage more young people into the market and others to remain in the market.  Therefore, from the perspective of the market as a whole, this measure is intended to encourage sustainability.</p><p> The latest figures from the Health Insurance Authority show that just over 2 million people, or 44.6% of the population, have private health insurance.  This figure has fallen over the last five years from a peak of 50.9% of the population in 2008.  These figures underline the need for cost containment by insurers so that people can afford health insurance but they also demonstrate the importance for consumers of shopping around to get the best value for the coverage that they choose.  I have urged insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  I have also consistently raised the issue of costs with insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.</p><p> Last July, I appointed an independent chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with health insurers, my Department and the Health Insurance Authority to identify ways of achieving cost reductions in the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin has just submitted his report under phase 1 of the review process and the contents are being examined by me and health insurers.  The second phase of this review will commence immediately and will report within three months.</p><p>  A range of lower cost plans is available from all four health insurers.  It is quite possible for consumers to find the same level of cover in the market for a cheaper price.  It is important to explore the full range of products now available on the market to avoid missing out on potential cost savings.  I strongly advise consumers to research the market and check the options that are available to provide the same level of cover at a competitive rate.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA plays an important role for customers both in ensuring that they have accurate information and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance.  The HIA's website, <i>hia.ie,</i>has a useful plan comparison tool to assist in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p><p> In terms of policy development it is valuable to set out a basic roadmap for risk equalisation for the next three years.  In this context, I am committed to the following: at a minimum maintaining the current level of effectiveness by age group as measured against market average claim costs; adjusting the hospital bed utilisation credit as a proxy indicator of health status pending the introduction of a more refined measure, while ensuring that the rate never creates an incentive for unnecessary hospital stays; introducing a more refined measure of health status, such as through the use of diagnostic related groups; and incrementally increasing effectiveness over the period from 2014 to 2016 with a view to further increasing effectiveness to 85% for those over 70 years and 90% in respect of customers aged over 80 years.  In line with existing legislation and other requirements, my policy aims are subject to the following critical requirements: annual expert current market analysis by the HIA; scheme rules relating to over-compensation as agreed under EU state aid approval; and a final decision on applicable risk equalisation rates, set by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance, in line with the governing legislation.  The measures I am now introducing will continue to protect community rated health insurance, which is a vital part of our health system as we move to universal health insurance.</p><p> I now wish to outline the main provisions of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Section 1 defines the Principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 amends the definition of &quot;net premium&quot; in section 2(1) of the Principal Act.  Section 8 of the Finance (No 2) Bill 2013 introduces new ceilings on medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief at &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child.  This has implications for the manner in which community rating is applied under the Health Insurance Acts.  This amendment clarifies that community rating applies to the gross premium less any risk equalisation credits and excludes any applicable tax relief.</p><p> Section 3 amends section 6A of the Principal Act.  This amendment includes a technical amendment to correct a reference; a consequential amendment to the definition of &quot;hospital bed utilisation credit&quot; from 1 January 2014 to reflect the enactment of section 55 of the Health Act 1970, whereby private patients will incur a hospital charge in respect of an overnight stay in a public bed; a consequential amendment to the definition of &quot;relevant amount&quot;; and deletion of the definition of &quot;reasonable profit&quot; at section 6A(2), a replacement definition for which is provided for in section 5.</p><p> Section 4 amends section 7AB of the Principal Act.  For consistency, the timeframe by which a registered undertaking planning to vary benefits payable under a type of health insurance contract is required to notify the HIA is extended from 1 January to 1 March.  This measure is in line with section 6.</p><p> Section 5 amends section 7F of the Principal Act.  First, section 7F(1) is amended to provide an addition period of one month to 1 May for registered undertakings to fulfil the requirement to maintain and furnish information returns, including a statement of profit and loss and balance sheet to the Health Insurance Authority.  This has the practical benefit of providing insurers with an additional month to finalise their preparations and is in line with the timeframes for similar returns under Central Bank requirements.  In other words, they do not have to perform the same function twice, one month after the other.</p><p> Under section 7F(4) of the Act, an overcompensated registered undertaking is required to make a payment to the risk equalisation fund if it has made more than reasonable profit.  The HIA carries out the overcompensation test on a three year rolling basis as provided for in the legislation.  This amendment specifies that the HIA will take what would constitute reasonable profit for a registered undertaking in respect of its relevant health insurance business as a return on equity not exceeding 12% per annum on a rolling three year basis using approved accounting standards and having regard to the European Union framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation.  A registered undertaking is not deemed to have made a profit in excess of reasonable profit if its return on equity exceeds 12% per annum in respect of that business for part of the three year period but not for all of that period.  Further, it defines &quot;relevant health insurance business in the State&quot; as &quot;all of the undertakings health insurance business in the State&quot; and treats return on equity in the case of a registered undertaking or former registered undertaking established otherwise than under the Companies Act as the equivalent, using approved accounting standards, of a return on equity of a registered undertaking which is a company established under those Acts.</p> <p> Section 6 amends section 7H of the principal Act.  Registered undertakings provide premium information to policy holders in the renewal notice or statement issued.  This amendment provides that the renewal notice clearly shows, in addition to the gross premium before risk equalisation credits and after any credits that may apply, the premium payable by the insured member net of tax relief at source following recent changes to the limit of relievable amount of premium available under the Taxes Consolidation Act introduced in the Finance Bill.</p><p>Section 7 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 March 2014 as the effective date for revised risk equalisation credits to be payable from the fund.  Section 8 amends section 11E of the principal Act.  This amendment provides that where the HIA is satisfied that a &quot;changed existing contract&quot; is now a contract which it classifies as now providing non-advanced cover, it will make regulations accordingly.  Where the HIA is satisfied that a &quot;changed existing contract&quot; now provides advanced cover, the HIA will amend the relevant specification.  In addition, provision is made for the HIA to review any evaluation and analysis of sample types of contracts and where an error occurred in the classification of a product, the HIA will amend regulations and the register of health insurance contracts accordingly.</p><p>Section 9 amends the reference on Schedule 2 to the principal Act.  This is a consequential technical amendment to change the reference on the schedule to section 7F from section 6A.  Section 10 amends Schedule 3 to the principal Act to provide that the revised amount payable from the risk equalisation fund, REF, in respect of the hospital bed utilisation credit will decrease to &euro;60 in respect of health insurance contracts renewed or entered into from 1 March 2014 and confirms that the specified rate for the hospital bed utilisation credit for contracts entered into after 31 March 2013 remains at the higher rate of &euro;75.</p><p>Section 11 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act.  With effect from 1 March 2014 the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the REF in respect of certain classes of insured persons are revised.  Section 12 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Act 1999.  This amendment specifies the accounting periods as &quot;3 consecutive months beginning 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October.&quot;  It defines the due date for returns to the Revenue Commissioners as the 21st day of the second month after the end of an accounting period.  It then specifies the applicable stamp duty rates for 1 January to 28 February 2014 and 1 March 2014 onwards.  Finally, it deletes subsection (2A) in each place.  Section 13 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction of the Bill.</p><p>I thank the Senators for their attention and I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200046#XX00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We will not support the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013.  While we fully support the concept of risk equalisation and community rating, these policies will not work if we continue to undermine health insurance at every step.  The market is becoming more unbalanced, as we have seen, with approximately 280,000, arguably younger and healthier, people leaving the market.  That continues at a rate of approximately 5,000 per month.  More of the under-50 age cohort are dropping out, thereby increasing the levy required for risk-equalisation.</p><p>Government policy on this is incoherent in terms of health insurance policies, such as the capping to tax relief.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, spoke on that earlier in our debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  The redesignation of hospital beds will arguably force more young people to quit, which will further exacerbate the imbalance in the market.  I have substantially reduced the level of cover that my family of five has because of the cost.  It was no longer affordable to continue with the levels we had, and we did not have a gold-plated policy, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan liked to call them.</p><p>The budget relief cut and the levy hike is expected to add &euro;330 to the annual cost for two adults and two children.  That applies to my family, although I have three children, and I do not know whether I can afford to continue with the insurance.  Thankfully we are a relatively healthy family.  It is possible that this time next year I will not be in the health insurance market and there will be an increased burden as a result because the relatively younger, healthier people will no longer be there to cross-subsidise those in the autumn of their lives requiring more health cover.  At the same time we have taken medical cards from 55,000 over-70s over the last two budgets.  More of them will presumably need to take out health insurance and will increase demand.  This triple whammy will make the market even more unbalanced and will mean the Minister will be back here next year with another levy hike.  It is a vicious circle.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the HIA a number of times and its report is due on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I do not know whether the Minister already knows what is in that and was able to draft this legislation accordingly.  Last year the HIA made a series of recommendations to the Minister on what could be done to try to entice younger, healthier people into the health insurance market and he has done none of those things.  I wonder why.  He did the opposite.  He increased certain things the HIA had recommended he decrease.  Will the Minister act on any new recommendations in next week's report?  The point was made in the other House when this was being discussed that we should have waited until the HIA report was published before debating this legislation.  Again, the Minister may already be aware of what is in that report but the rest of us are not.</p><p>In the absence of the HIA report and in view of the cap on tax relief being reduced, we are unable to support this Bill.  We have seen no indication of any effort or initiatives over the last number of years to get younger people into the market.  I have grave concern that the Minister will be back next year to further increase this.  With 5,000 people per month leaving he will have no option unless something is done to entice people into the market.  The haemorrhaging of younger, healthier policy holders threatens the sustainability of the market and puts huge upward pressure on the likes of myself, as an example, and anybody who has private health insurance.</p><p>The debate in the D&aacute;il has a lot of &quot;remember what you said&quot; in it.  The transformation of people's opinion on these issues is interesting, particularly the Minister's opinion when, as Opposition spokesman, he spoke of not recommending the Bill going through the House at that time, how he was vehemently opposed to it, it was ill-advised and would put more pressure on our already pressurised health system.  Those were all the Minister's words when we were imposing a levy of &euro;160.  This Bill will authorise a &euro;399 levy.  On that occasion, in what was a very good performance from the Opposition benches, the Minister proclaimed it to be the last straw that broke the camel's back.</p> <p>One wonders how the mind has evolved since in the Minister's approach to this issue.</p><p>I could support the Bill if it contained tangible initiatives to encourage young people to enter the health insurance market, but, unfortunately, it reflects an acceptance that the policy is not working.  The levy, therefore, will be ratcheted up and between 5,000 and 6,000 people like me a month will exit the market, which is not sustainable.  This is many millions of miles way from the Minister's UHI vision.</p></speech>

It is always difficult to introduce changes such as this, but we must respond to what the market requires and provide equal access to health insurance.  This is, unfortunately, the way it has to be dealt with.  More than 530,000 people are aged over 65 years, many of whom, thankfully, have health insurance.  That cohort will continue to increase in the coming years and it is estimated that 900,000 will be in this category by 2030; therefore, we must engage in careful planning in this regard.  The long-term plan for the health service will take a number of years to implement and the Government is working on it.  In the meantime, the Minister must deal with the market as it stands.</p><p>VHI has 89% of the over 80s market.  It is interesting that the number of people in this age category has increased dramatically in recent years, with an increase of 20% in the past six years alone.  That reflects how the market is changing and the Minister has to introduce legislation to make sure people have equality of access and that there is an equal health insurance contribution.</p><p>The cost of health care went unchecked for a long period.  The Government parties have made a significant effort in the past two and a half years to address increasing costs in health care and that effort will continue.  It is not easy, but we need to achieve greater efficiencies.  In the past few weeks an area was highlighted in which there was still no scrutiny.  The Minister and the HSE are dealing with this issue of the 25% of the health budget going to non-Department and non-HSE controlled organisations.  It is being tackled to make sure taxpayer's money is used in a proper manner.  In fairness, the vast majority of organisations provide a good service in the areas in which they specialise and comply in full with the regulations, but a few have not and the Minister and the HSE are right to scrutinise them to ensure moneys are not being used for a different purpose than was intended.</p><p>The health insurance market is under pressure and the numbers who have cover have decreased, but the only way to reverse the trend is by improving the economic outlook and getting more people back to work.  The Government has succeeded in reversing job losses.  At one point, more than 7,000 people a month were losing their jobs, whereas now almost 5,000 new jobs a month are being created.  There are 58,000 more people at work than at this time last year and I hope that number will continue to improve in the next 12 months.  This will help people to return to the health insurance market.  The level of health insurance coverage has reduced from 50% of the population to 44%, a substantial reduction, but given the pressure people have come under financially, it is good that many of them have been doing everything possible to stay in the market.  That should be encouraged.</p><p>In dealing with the health service it must be ensured the insurance companies carrying the older age cohorts are not penalised.  The demands they place on health services are greater than those of younger people, which is why the adjustment is being made.  The Bill is comprehensive in that it sets out clearly what the strategy is for the next three years.  This is important to provide security.</p><p>Further efficiencies will have to be generated in the health service and we must continue to work towards reducing the cost of medical care.  A major change in the cost of drugs was introduced in the past year.  Payments for drugs had increased from &euro;570 million to more than &euro;2.3 billion annually.  The Minister introduced legislation to deal with the use of generic drugs because only 18% of drugs prescribed were generic, whereas in other countries the figure was as high as 70%.  In addition, the cost of drugs was much higher than in other countries and changes are being made in this regard.  This can contribute huge savings also.  By tackling these issues, the cost of health care can be reduced and I hope more people will then re-enter the health insurance market and the cost of insurance will not increase.  That is the long-term plan we want to work towards.  This legislation is a step that must be taken at this stage to stabilise the cost of insurance and make sure the companies providing insurance cover, especially for older age cohorts, can continue to provide the requisite level of care.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>

He has the hardest job in public life and Senator John Crown and I try to help him in any way we can.  However, Senator John Crown is away.  We strongly support the Minister's efforts to counteract tobacco use and wish him well in that regard.  The G8 chose dementia as its topic of consultation and perhaps we might have a debate on it in the new year.  Reference was made to physiotherapy for the mind.  The Minister, as a medical professional, is much better positioned to debate that issue than I am.</p><p>The problem we face was graphically illustrated by the Minister for Finance two hours ago.  Health insurance costs have increased by 86% in four years, which is why he had to reduce tax relief in this regard.  He said it was costing &euro;500 million annually and rapidly heading towards &euro;1 billion.  I support everything the Minister for Health said about the need for cost containment and I am delighted he appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin.  We might debate the substance of his report also in the new year because what he has attempted to do is important.  We cannot bear the rate at which costs are increasing.  According to a most useful document the Department produces, approximately 11% of gross national income is spent on health care and the only country in which the figure is substantially in excess of this is the United States.  We have a high cost problem which is reflected in the cost of health insurance.</p><p>I downloaded a document from the website of the Congressional Budget Office in the United States entitled, &quot;Is This Time Different?  The Slowdown in Healthcare Spending&quot;.  We are at a figure of 86% and in the United States which we always thought had the high cost model a slowdown is being discussed.</p> <p>Another paper from the Congressional Budget Office is entitled "Why has Growth in Spending for Fee-for-service Medicare Slowed?"  I never believed in the old medical inflation clich&eacute;.  The clich&eacute; seems to be coming to an end in the United States.  How did we end up with the 86% increase the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, told us about?</p><p>I support what the Minister said in his speech.  I ask people to switch.  Locking oneself into a high cost system and then requiring bailout by the taxpayer is counterproductive from everyone's point of view.  People, including the old, should switch.  Some of the competing companies will say that they never refuse to recruit older people.  It was a mythology invented so that the State could back up its insurance company, VHI, because it has most of the old people.  Competing companies say they never refused customers so I wonder why old people have not switched.  A new entrant could then generate some of the efficiencies on drugs spoken about by Senator Colm Burke.  This is contained in the Milliman report.</p><p>A new entrant can insure old people and young people for less than the previous monopolist in the field.  When the Milliman report looked at the dominant health insurance company, it saw major efficiency possibilities.  One of them is addressed in page 31, which lists the average length of stay for medical inpatient admissions.  It is 3.7 days by world standards and 10.6 days in Ireland.  Throughout the report, the finding is that not enough has been invested in utilisation management and investing in ways to manage claims that can yield savings, regardless of the risk profile of the population.  It refers to unnecessary medication and the extra days spent in hospital.</p><p>The amendment I tabled to the Finance Bill, when we discussed the tax break, concerned whether HIQA might do this job for the Minister.  The Minister mentioned the diagnostic related group, DRG, but HIQA could say its estimate is that a procedure should have been done in 3.7 days, not 10.6 days.  A crucial point in the report, which is grist to the mill of the Minister, refers to push back by consultants following previous attempts to reduce the high and rapidly escalating cost of health services in this country.  There is plenty of evidence in the executive summary of the Milliman report, on page 31 and at the end that we have a high-cost health service that is being refinanced by an uncompetitive health insurance business.  The result is that a couple of hundred thousand people have left, directly contradicting the Minister's goal and the Government's goal of universal health insurance.  We are going further away from the target.  The Minister can use regulatory agencies, in the form of the HIA, in order to extract these gains.  I know the Minister's power of advocacy on behalf of efficiency gains but it is an extremely high-cost system.  The Milliman report refers to unnecessary hospitalisation and average hospital stays far in excess of other countries.</p><p>The health insurance sector has no interest in extracting monopoly rents and high costs from the Irish health care system.  I asked the Minister for Finance whether the tax break was an industry subsidy or a subsidy to sick people.  Where costs rise to absorb all of the subsidies, we are rewarding the producers.  The cost base has to be tackled and I support the Minister strongly.</p><p>There should be open enrolment and lifetime cover.  It should not be a requirement for people to state what age they are.  That is one way to prevent age discrimination although they might need age information for records.  Previous medical conditions should not be known either, unless we can judge from the writing on the application form that the person is sick.  There should be completely open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating but in a competitive market.  The Department has been historically bound up with defending the VHI from competition and we have ended up with an incredibly high-cost system.  It has not tackled the producers.  It is strongly stated in the Milliman report that the culture of the VHI was to issue statements saying how many old people it had rather than confronting the high cost of the product in Ireland.  Until we confront that, we will face another 86% rise in these next four years.  I share the concerns of the Minister for Finance on those matters.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage.  </p><p>The cost base problem was not tackled historically.  Having the leading health insurance company oblivious to costs allows other companies to make supernormal profits.  I want them to go into hospitals, extract efficiency gains and pass them on to consumers.  I will frame amendments with that in mind.</p></speech>

I watched the debate with some interest but it took me a little while to assimilate the necessity for the Bill.  It is technical and complex legislation.  When I gave it a lot of thought, I realised it is a fundamental part of the transition to the universal health insurance system we have long awaited and hoped for.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Alex White, talked about medical cards during the week and he has often talked about the building blocks required in advance of establishing the long-awaited reforms of the health system.  Nothing is as complex as the health system.  The role of setting the rate of stamp duty involves the Minister for Finance along with the Minister for Health, which demonstrates the level of complexity.</p><p>Policy change in one area automatically leads to policy change in other areas so that we can have a coherent policy across all areas.  Risk equalisation and community rating are the core issues at stake.  How we achieve them is the fundamental part of social democracy and we are all social democrats.  The rising cost of health insurance is the bugbear of everyone and we must balance access to affordable health insurance with a need for equity in access to health services.  The current system is the cause of the two-tier health system.  Access to health must be based on medical need not on the depth of one's pockets.  While I welcome this aspect of it, we have a long way to go.</p><p>Second Stage of any Bill is time to ask whether the legislation is good.  I think this Bill is good and it is something we can support.  I hope everyone can support it.  Senator Barrett referred to cost containment and how he would like to see efficiency achieved in hospitals.  This also applies to how health insurance companies do their business.  One example concerns a woman whose 15-year-old son developed chest pains while playing a match.  He could not play until he had the problem sorted out.  On the public system, it would take 12 months to get an appointment to see a cardiologist.  Because they had a health insurance plan, they decided to go privately and went to a private hospital in Dublin.  The  minor surgical procedure required a two-night stay before being discharged, being admitted the night before and discharged the day after the procedure.</p> <p>She showed me the bill which was for &euro;17,000.  It was shocking at every level.  It was also shocking that when she telephoned VHI, her service provider, it could not adequately explain the reason for such a bill.  One might even have said it was excessive at &euro;1,700.  Is it not strange that people feel they have to go to politicians?  Is there not something wrong with the system when a member of the public must go to her local Senator to explain something rather than her health insurer?  Is it any wonder Senator Marc MacSharry is complaining that the cost of his health insurance is becoming so exorbitant that he will not be able to afford to pay it next year?  </p><p>Is there any mechanism, as Senator Sean D. Barrett asked, to ascertain whether health insurance companies are getting good value in the private sector?  I would be all in favour of health insurance companies paying as much money as possible to the public sector, but we are looking at exorbitant prices which are being passed on to customers.  Is it any wonder that we see super profits about which Senator Sean D. Barrett talked?  I am happy to see section 7(4) introducing a requirement to make a payment into the risk equalisation fund if a company has made more than a reasonable profit.  That is progressive.  It is a big change in many policy areas, not only in health but other areas also.  </p><p>I look forward to teasing out these and other issues on Committee Stage.  Obviously, we support the Bill, but there are many questions I would like to ask on Committee Stage which would be more appropriate than loading the Minister with many technical questions to which no doubt he does not have the answers now.   However, I might not be in a position to assimilate these answers.</p></speech>

C&eacute; go bhfuilimid ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille, t&aacute; roinnt deacrachta&iacute; againn leis an treo ginear&aacute;lta ina bhfuil c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte ag dul &oacute; thaobh na polasaithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar sin.</p><p>This Bill is a follow-on from the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012, very important legislation which significantly updated the regulatory regime for the health insurance sector in the State.  The 2012 Act introduced a permanent risk equalisation scheme from 1 January 2013.  That scheme makes possible the scheme of community rating which ensures all consumers are charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, regardless of age, gender or health status, thus preventing price discrimination against those more likely to require medical treatment.  </p><p>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013 has as its main purpose specifying the amount of the hospital bed utilisation credit and the amount of risk equalisation credits in respect of age, gender and level of cover payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2014.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently argued that as long as we have the type of health insurance market and health funding system in place in the State, the regulatory regime provided for in the Bill will be necessary.  It involves a complex system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle.  This entails the transfer of compensation from insurers which carry lighter risk burdens to those which carry heavier risk burdens.  All of this requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and penalties for infringements.  Without such legislation, the unregulated market would discriminate against the old and the sick or any other group or individual insurance companies decided were a greater risk.  This legislation is, therefore, supposed to be protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector.  It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and between the healthy and those who do not enjoy good health.  This is welcome in so far as it goes, but Sinn F&eacute;in would go much further, extending the principle of solidarity to the way we fund, organise, structure and manage the entire health care system.</p><p>The cost of health insurance premiums is rising and there is real concern this legislation will inevitably lead to further rises by as much as 15%.  The Minister stated it is up to insurers to decide their own pricing plans and insurers can reduce their outgoings under the scheme by taking on a fairer share of older customers, but he admits this is not happening.  That is clearly the case.  As has been stated, VHI holds 89% of the market share of those aged over 80 compared to only 6% held by Aviva and Laya Healthcare.  For the 70 to 79 year age group, the equivalent figures are 78% for VHI and 9% and 12% for the others, respectively.  Clearly, this is not sustainable.</p><p>The option of health insurance has become a luxury that is no longer affordable for many thousands who previously held it.  In 2008, 2.3 million people had private health insurance.  In 2012 this figure had dropped to 2.1 million; more than 60,000 people dispensed with private health insurance in that year alone.  Those who have dispensed with health insurance because they can no longer afford it are dependent on the public health system that is under attack from the Government's failed austerity strategy which it happily embraced when it took over from the previous Government.</p><p>The State continues to heavily subsidise the private for-profit health system with private beds in public hospitals, a fast-track to care for private patients, while public waiting lists grow, and the dual working of hospital consultants in the public and private sectors.  The Minister claims the Government is making progress towards its ultimate goal, which he describes as a single tier patient-centred system of universal health care for all.  However, this is to be achieved by a market-based universal health insurance system, which is where the big gap presents.  According to the Minister, the maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market is an essential step in the transition to this goal.  The Bill is, presumably, one of the steps he deems necessary in this transition.  The Government wants to move to an entirely health insurance-based system of funding in managing and delivering health care.</p><p>Like its 2012 predecessor, the Bill is based on the recognition that there must be social solidarity within the insurance sector.  In that context, why will the Minister not extend social solidarity across the entire health care system?  If one takes the concept of solidarity to its logical conclusion, one will move to a system of universal provision of health care based on need alone, not ability to pay.  The question that arises is how to pay for such a system to ensure the best possible care for all who need it and achieve the best value for money.  The Government is proposing to introduce universal health insurance, with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums.  The State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role.  Why then give private for-profit insurance companies such a central place in the system?  What contribution will they make?  They are funded by the consumers who buy their products.  The insurance companies, on behalf of policyholders, will buy services from private or public hospitals or other service providers.  In addition, they will have to make a substantial profit in the process in order to satisfy both their hunger for such profit and the interests of their respective shareholders.  The Minister has recognised the failure of the insurance companies to reduce their outgoings and address their cost base.  Why not cut out private profiteering from the entire equation and retain the money in the health system and any surplus thereafter in the pockets of citizens?</p><p>The Government should re-examine its position.  People's ill health, the requirement to provide health care and the protections necessary are not the basis on which profits should be made.  The bottom line for citizens is that when they need health care, they need it promptly.  They also require the best care possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-12-12a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013121200049#AAA00300"><p>I thank all those Senators who contributed to the debate.  This is important legislation to underpin the principle of community rating, on which both sides of the House agree.  Senator Sean D. Barrett mentioned not asking the age of customers applying for insurance.  Unfortunately, to assess them for risk equalisation credits, we have to know their age, but I take in good stead what then Senator is implying in adopting that approach.</p><p>In regard to insurers which state they never turn away older customers, there are many ways to segment the market and discourage older people.  Let us go through the figures which are interesting and which I stated on radio.  Aviva Health has 17% of the market, yet it only has 6% of the over 80s cohort and 9% of the 70 to 79 year cohort.  One would expect it to have three times as many of the over 80s and twice as many of those aged between 70 and 79 years.  Laya Healthcare has 22% of the market.  Therefore, one would expect it to have 22% of the over 80s, but it has only 6%.</p> <p>One would expect it to have 22% of those aged 70 to 79 but it has only 12%.  I am sure the Senator would agree that these things do not happen by accident.  The VHI, on the other hand, has 56% of the market and one would expect it, therefore, to have 56% of those over 80.  It actually has 89% of those over 80.  With 56% of the market, one would expect it to have 56% of the 70 to 79 year olds but it has 78% of that age cohort.  It is very clear from their marketing campaigns that insurers can find ways of discouraging older people from joining and can create products that are attractive to younger people, thus encouraging more of them to join their companies.  I would also point out that having 256 products on the market, plus another eight, giving a total of 264, is designed, in my view, to confuse the market and confuse customers.  There is no need for that number of different policies to be out in the marketplace.  </p><p>The other question to ask is what is going on in our private health care system?  We have seen a reduction, year on year, of up to 60,000 customers and yet we have seen an incessant rise in both the cost and number of claims per person.  Another startling issue is that of medical inflation.  If my memory is correct, medical inflation has been at 9% per annum on average, when from 2008 until now general inflation has been at certain times negative and, at most, 3%.  The average rate of general inflation over that period is 0.3%.  There is no justification for this.  The reality behind it is the failure of the insurance companies to tackle the cost of private health care.  They have failed to undertake proper auditing.  The VHI started auditing last year and one private hospital in this country found itself paying back &euro;5 million.  All of the other private hospitals will be similarly audited.</p><p>There has been no clinical auditing at all, which is astonishing.  Clinical audits involve checking whether tests carried out were actually necessary.  One company, when challenged on this, said it had four personnel to deal with this issue.  It had four nurses to do this work and, no disrespect to the nursing profession, but I do not think it is fair to ask a nurse to challenge a cardiologist on why a test was done.  It is not even fair to ask a GP or surgeon to do that.  The only person fit to challenge a cardiologist is another cardiologist and the only person fit to challenge a surgeon is another surgeon.  The insurance companies need to employ these people to carry out proper clinical audits.  What has been going on in some instances is just outrageous, with one person earning &euro;1 million from the VHI in a single year.  That indicates, in the clearest possible way, that we are paying far too much for medical procedures.  No bench marking has been done and there is no ongoing review of what it takes to carry out these procedures, even when they are necessary.  In many instances, the procedures are necessary but the controls have not been put in place and the methodology for paying people has not been reassessed in any meaningful way.  Some procedures used to take two hours but now only take 20 minutes but we are still paying the same money for them.  That is not acceptable.  All of these issues must be addressed and will be in 2014 as contracts which have been in place for the last two or three years come up for renewal.  That must be done.  However, that is not the purpose of the Bill before us today.</p><p>This Bill is very important in terms of its capacity to support the market, to allow people to remain in the market and to encourage older people to continue in the market.  Lifetime community rating is something that we are going to consider.  Why should someone at the age of 60 who decides to take out health insurance have the same premium as somebody who has been insured for the previous 30 years?  That is something we are going to look at.  We are exploring, through Patrick McLoughlin's report, other methods of encouraging younger people back into the market.  I will not delay the House.  I believe this Bill is very important and will help to underpin the market.  It will assist older people and those who are  less well to stay in the market by being subsidised by those who are younger and healthier, which is what, in fairness, many of the people who are older now did for the previous generation.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the support of Senators.</p></speech>

Aithn&iacute;onn muid ar fad an r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach a bhaineann le hOifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a aithint freisin gur r&oacute;l ombudsman at&aacute; i gceist.  N&iacute;l an coimisin&eacute;ir mar an gc&eacute;anna le daoine eile at&aacute; ceaptha ag an Aire, ar n&oacute;s ball n&oacute; cathaoirleach ar bhord St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ceaptha mar ombudsman faoi sh&eacute;ala an Uachtar&aacute;in, rud a thugann gradam agus neamhsple&aacute;chas faoi leith don r&oacute;l sin.

T&aacute; an Roinn fhreagrach as daingni&uacute; sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  T&aacute; 75% de na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga imithe in &eacute;ag.  C&eacute;ard at&aacute; ar bun i Roinn na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil s&eacute; in ann fi&uacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a dhaingni&uacute;, rud a chinnteodh go bhfuil dul chun cinn &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh an bealach ina dtiocfadh lucht labhartha na Gaeilge i muin&iacute;n seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge?  T&aacute; cuid mhaith tuarasc&aacute;lacha leagtha ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga os comhair Thithe an Rialtais.  Baineann cuid acu le Ranna &eacute;ags&uacute;la, ar n&oacute;s na Roinne Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute;.

An bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;t ag f&aacute;il taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;na chomhghleacaithe ar bord an Rialtais?  T&aacute; fait&iacute;os orainn go bhfuil s&eacute; ina aonar agus an coirn&eacute;al seo &aacute; troid aige.  T&aacute; imn&iacute; orainn nach bhfuil le f&aacute;il aige ag bord an Rialtais ach an chluas bhodhar.</p><p>T&aacute; lucht na Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge ar buile leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; tarluithe le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Is d&oacute;cha gurb &eacute; seo an rud is tromch&uacute;is&iacute; at&aacute; tarluithe le cuimhne na ndaoine &oacute; thaobh saol na Gaeilge de.  Ba cheart don Rialtas an t-imeacht seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i bhfad n&iacute;os d&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de dhualgas orthu gach gur f&eacute;idir leo a dh&eacute;anamh le cinnti&uacute; go bhfaighidh an duine a thiocfaidh i gcomharbas ar She&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in an taca&iacute;ocht riachtanach.

N&iacute;l amhras ar bith ach gur thug an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga faoi bhun&uacute; a oifige nua le f&iacute;s agus d&iacute;ograis.  T&aacute; an t-ardmheas at&aacute; air i measc phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta le sonr&uacute; go soil&eacute;ir.  Chuir an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in i&uacute;l don Uachtar&aacute;n ar 4 Nollaig 2013 go raibh s&eacute; beartaithe aige &eacute;ir&iacute; as oifig ar 23 Feabhra 2014, tar &eacute;is deich mbliana a chaitheamh sa phost.

T&aacute; meas agam ar an gcinneadh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige.  T&aacute; t&uacute;s curtha leis an phr&oacute;iseas chun Coimisin&eacute;ir nua a cheapadh faoi r&eacute;ir alt 20(3) d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  Cuirfear moladh ina leith seo faoi bhr&aacute;id an Rialtais in am tr&aacute;tha.  Maidir leis an tsaincheist at&aacute; ardaithe ag an Seanad&oacute;ir, ba mhaith liom a mheabhr&uacute; d&oacute; go bhfuil tiomantas an Rialtais maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa saol poibl&iacute; agus i measc an phobail i gcoitinne le feice&aacute;il go soil&eacute;ir.  T&aacute; an tiomantas seo l&eacute;irithe n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in tr&iacute; na gealltanais shonracha at&aacute; tugtha i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais, ach freisin tr&iacute; bhearta dearfacha agus caiteachas an St&aacute;it laistigh de chreatlach polasa&iacute; na strait&eacute;ise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.</p><p>  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; anois ar roinnt saincheisteanna a bhaineann leis an &aacute;bhar at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha ag an Seanad&oacute;ir.  I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, measaim go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a aithint go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar l&iacute;on agus ar chaighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it i nGaeilge a chuireann comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ar f&aacute;il &oacute; th&aacute;inig Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la i bhfeidhm.  Aithn&iacute;odh &oacute;n t&uacute;s nach mbeadh s&eacute; ind&eacute;anta dul chun cinn suntasach a dh&eacute;anamh thar o&iacute;che agus gur pr&oacute;iseas forch&eacute;imnitheach a bheadh i gceist le feidhmi&uacute; an Achta, ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il c&eacute;imeanna de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile le comhoibri&uacute; agus le dea-thoil na bp&aacute;irtithe leasmhara &eacute;ags&uacute;la.</p><p>  Is aidhm l&aacute;rnach de chuid an Rialtais &eacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge a &eacute;asc&uacute; agus a chur chun cinn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ina ghn&eacute; th&aacute;bhachtach den pholasa&iacute; sin go bhfuil baill fhoirne at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge ar f&aacute;il sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s chun freastal ar riachtanais an phobail i gcoitinne agus ar riachtanais shaini&uacute;la na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta ag an Rialtas go bhfuil g&aacute; le cur chuige spriocdh&iacute;rithe a chinnteoidh go mbeidh foireann leis na scileanna riachtanacha Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, th&oacute;g an Rialtas cinneadh i m&iacute; Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair an polasa&iacute; maidir le marcanna b&oacute;nais do chom&oacute;rtais earca&iacute;ochta agus ardaithe c&eacute;ime a chur ar ceal agus bearta a chur in &aacute;it a gcuirfidh leis an l&iacute;on oifigeach sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s at&aacute; in ann feidhmi&uacute; go d&aacute;theangach.  Mar ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im sa phr&oacute;iseas seo, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist com&oacute;rtas d'oifigigh feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il go luath agus beidh fo-phain&eacute;al de dhaoine at&aacute; inni&uacute;il sa Ghaeilge le bun&uacute; mar thoradh ar an gcom&oacute;rtas seo.  Cuirfear bearta sonracha i bhfeidhm fosta chun tac&uacute; le hoili&uacute;int sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Creidim f&eacute;in gur polasa&iacute; dearfach &eacute; seo a thabharfaidh deis do ranna St&aacute;it a gcuid riachtanas maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; i nGaeilge a aithint, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; don Ghaeltacht san &aacute;ireamh.  T&aacute; m&eacute; d&oacute;chasach go rachaidh an t-athr&uacute; seo chun sochair don Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras sa todhcha&iacute;.</p><p>  Faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, t&aacute; an tAire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta freagrach as sc&eacute;imeanna teanga na gcomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a dhaingni&uacute;.  Is gn&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach den Acht &eacute; daingni&uacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga chun go dtiocfaidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; ar l&iacute;on agus ar chaighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; a chuirfear ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ar bhealach eagraithe agus tomhaiste thar thr&eacute;imhse ama.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;shoil&eacute;ir &oacute; alt 14(3) den Acht go maireann sc&eacute;im teanga i bhfeidhm ar feadh tr&iacute; bliana &oacute;n d&aacute;ta a dhaingn&iacute;tear &iacute;, n&oacute; go dt&iacute; go ndaingn&iacute;tear sc&eacute;im &uacute;r, cib&eacute; acu is moille.  T&aacute; beagnach 200 comhlacht poibl&iacute; cl&uacute;daithe faoi na sc&eacute;imeanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la at&aacute; i bhfeidhm.  Is dul chun cinn suntasach &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; miste a aithint go n-athra&iacute;onn feidhmeanna comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; agus go nd&eacute;antar cuid d&oacute;ibh a scor &oacute; am go ch&eacute;ile.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; na boird oideachais agus oili&uacute;na tagtha in &aacute;it na gcoist&iacute; gairmoideachais.  T&aacute; iarrtha agam ar gach ceann de na boird &uacute;ra sc&eacute;im teanga a ullmh&uacute;.</p><p>  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; pl&eacute; gn&iacute;omhach ar si&uacute;l ag mo Roinn le 128 comhlacht poibl&iacute; maidir le sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a aont&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta cheana f&eacute;in go bhfuil an pr&oacute;iseas chun sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a aont&uacute; casta.  T&aacute; c&eacute;imeanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la chun an c&oacute;ras a &eacute;asc&uacute; &aacute; mbeart&uacute;, go h&aacute;irithe i gcomhth&eacute;acs na leasuithe reacht&uacute;la at&aacute; beartaithe ar an Acht.  T&aacute; na dr&eacute;acht-chinn den Bhille chun Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a leas&uacute; ullmhaithe.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il iad a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an Rialtais ag t&uacute;s na hathbhliana.  Chomh maith leis na leasuithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la at&aacute; beartaithe mar thoradh ar an athbhreithni&uacute; ar an Acht, beidh leasuithe i gceist fosta a bhaineann le c&oacute;nascadh Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga le hOifig an Ombudsman.  Ba mhaith liom a threisi&uacute; nach gcuirfidh an c&oacute;nascadh seo isteach ar neamhsple&aacute;chas an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga i bhfeidhmi&uacute; a chuid cumhachta&iacute; agus go bhfanfaidh an oifig sa Ghaeltacht.</p><p>  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l ar&iacute;s don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga as an m&eacute;id a d'&eacute;irigh leis a chur i gcr&iacute;ch in achar deich mbliana.  N&iacute; inniu n&aacute; inn&eacute; a aithn&iacute;odh na constaic&iacute; agus na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in a bhaineann le mionteanga, in ainneoin gurb &iacute; &aacute;r dteanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta &iacute;, a chur chun cinn taobh le taobh le m&oacute;rtheanga domhanda.

Arguments for such a register were set very eloquently in <i>The Irish Times</i>  last week in an article by Sorley McCaughey, the head of policy and advocacy with Christian Aid.  The problem is that currently companies are able to use complex legal structures to separate their legal and beneficial ownership is such a way as to make it impossible for anybody to know who is the beneficial owner of the company, who is getting the money and who is pocketing the profits from the company.</p><p>  The European Union is considering introducing measures in this regard.  Discussions are ongoing in Brussels on the anti-money laundering directive and the Union is looking at the possibility of introducing a requirement across the Union for all member states to maintain public registers of the beneficial owners of companies.  The reason I have tabled this debate is to ascertain from the Minister for Finance whether it is Ireland's intention to support that process and whether, in the interim, the Government will consider taking a step to introduce such a register ahead of any EU requirement.  </p><p>  The difficulty is that under the current system, money launderers, tax evaders and terrorist groups are able to rely on the secrecy that is provided by the complex network of trusts and shell companies to hide money and to hide the beneficiaries of profits.  Christian Aid has pointed out the damage that this is doing to African economies.  The African progress panel that was led by Kofi Annan estimated in its 2013 report that Africa loses twice as much in listed financial flows as it receives in international aid.  Some estimates put capital flight at as high as &euro;850 billion a year, depriving countries of vital capital and revenues.  Much of this money flows out into shell or phantom companies.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, five mining contracts were awarded to anonymous companies in the British Virgin Islands, at a vastly under market rate and then sold on at market rate to major extractive companies.  The estimated cost to the DRC was &euro;1.35 billion, or twice the entire health and education budget of that country.  The identities of those who own and benefited from the British Virgin Islands companies remain unknown to this day.</p><p>  Public registers of the real and beneficial owners will address this problem.  Not only will they provide a way to identify those who are profiting and hold them to account, but will also deter such practices.  From Ireland's point of view, the introduction of such a requirement before it is enforced on us from Brussels would be another way for us to demonstrate our commitment as a country to promoting the highest levels of transparency in the areas of international finance and taxation and would seem to be a sensible position for us to adopt.  The Department of Finance's recent publication on Ireland's international tax strategy talks at some length about our commitment to transparency and tackling tax evasion and justifiably points to some of the successes achieved in that regard under the European Presidency.  </p><p>  Taking this step now and introducing a public register of beneficial owners would be consistent with that policy and show we are serious about taking on the issue of tax transparency.  The measure would only affect a small number of companies as the majority of companies in Ireland are small, family-owned companies with simple structures and where they are listed on the stock exchange, it is very clear who are their major shareholders.  The issue I am concerned about affects approximately 1% or 2% of companies that use complicated structures to separate their legal and beneficial ownership.  This is the type of practice we should not tolerate and should try to stop.  France and Britain have already indicated that they support the introduction of a public register, regardless of whether it is introduced in the new EU money laundering directive.  I urge that we do the same here.</p><p>  I look forward to hearing the response from the Minister of State and hope he can indicate whether the Minister supports the proposal for this requirement at European level and whether Ireland will, like France and Britain, take the step of going ahead and doing it anyway, in the absence of any European requirement.  We should do this as part of our overall commitment to showing we are serious about transparency in international finance and taxation.</p></speech>

While the Department of Finance plays a lead role, the proposed 4th anti-money laundering directive covers a number of policy areas which come under the responsibility of a number of different Departments.  The issue of beneficial ownership of companies is a matter of interest to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which deals with company law matters.</p><p>The Minister for Finance advised me that he has consulted with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who has confirmed that there are a number of mechanisms already in company law through which beneficial ownership of shares can be identified.  For example, any person with a financial interest in a private company may apply for a court order, under section 98 of the Companies Act 1990, to ascertain details of ownership of that company.  Additionally, in regard to public companies there is a requirement, set out in Part IV, Chapter 2 of the Companies Act 1990, to disclose interest in shares when such interest reaches a specified percentage threshold.</p><p>Under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990, the Director of Corporate Enforcement may appoint inspectors to investigate and report on the membership of any company and otherwise with respect to the company for the purpose of determining the true persons who are or have been financially interested in the success or failure, real or apparent, of the company or able to control or materially influence the policy of the company.</p><p>At the European Council, Ireland has supported the Lithuanian Presidency approach in the proposed 4th anti-money laundering directive, which will require that member states ensure that the beneficial ownership information on companies incorporated within their territory is held in a specified location, for example, in one or more registries, or by means of other suitable mechanisms.</p><p>The issue of a public register for beneficial ownership has been discussed at ECOFIN and while there was support for beneficial information to be known and made available, there was majority support for the specific procedures and mechanisms around this to be left to individual member states.  Negotiations are continuing on this proposed directive at the Council of the EU and due consideration will be given to this issue as part of the final agreement on the 4th anti-money laundering directive.</p> <p> Ireland's International tax strategy, published on budget day, clearly sets out Ireland's policy objectives and commitments on a range of international tax issues, including countering tax fraud and evasion.  This document includes Ireland's international tax charter which sets out the principles that guide Ireland's approach to these international tax issues.  The charter includes commitments to both full exchange of tax information with our tax treaty partners and also commitment to automatic exchange of tax information in line with existing and emerging EU and OECD rules.</p><p>As the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners stated, information, particularly third party information, is the lifeblood of tax administration.  It is one of the most powerful tools in combating tax fraud and evasion.   Automatic exchange of information between tax administrations is being heralded as the new global standard in the fight against tax fraud and evasion.</p><p>During Ireland's term as President of the Council of the European Union, work in the area of tax fraud and evasion was prioritised.  Ireland brokered agreement by ECOFIN on comprehensive council conclusions on tackling aggressive tax planning, tax fraud and evasion.  Progress was made on the negotiating mandate to align EU savings taxation agreements with non-EU jurisdictions, with the extended scope of the proposed revised savings tax directive.  Ireland supports the global move towards automatic exchange of information and welcomes the work of EU to amend the directive on administrative co-operation in the field of taxation.</p><p>The issue of beneficial ownership is also linked to the country by country reporting issue.  Ireland supports the G8 Lough Erne declaration on country by country reporting and ongoing work at OECD level on tax and development issues, including work on country by country reporting.</p><p>Ireland continues to support the anti-money laundering and anti-tax evasion agendas and promotes greater transparency across the financial services and tax areas.  As outlined, Ireland supports the idea that beneficial ownership information should be known and due consideration will be given to the most appropriate mechanisms in light of our work in the various international fora and the final compromise agreed on the fourth anti-money laundering directive.  Any legislative change which will reduce or eliminate corruption is clearly welcome.  However, to be effective it must be properly targeted and proportional.  Otherwise, innocent parties will have undue administrative burdens placed upon them and those who are breaking the law will remain unscathed.</p></speech>

It is crucial that any such register be public.  He also indicated that the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners stated that information, especially third party information, is the lifeblood of tax administration.  Access to such information should not be confined to the shareholders of a company or people with an interest in it who can apply for a court order to obtain details about a company.  The register must be made publicly available in order that any person with an interest in a company, for example, an individual who has heard that issues may have arisen in respect of a company, is in a position to obtain information about the company.  Access to such information should not be limited to public officials or shareholders of the company.  Any member of the public should be able to obtain such information.  This is the best approach and the basis on which Revenue operates in many other areas.  The same approach should be adopted in this area.</p><p>The only argument the Minister of State provided for not establishing such a register is the administrative burden that would arise from such a register.  As I stated, the issue I raise does not affect the vast majority of companies and is confined to companies which have highly complicated structures, most of which are large multinational companies.  Given the burdens placed on companies, I do not accept the argument that providing information on beneficial owners would add an unnecessary burden.  The benefits in terms of transparency would be much greater.  </p><p>This is a serious issue because developing countries are frequently deprived of resources as a result of corruption in the awarding of contracts and so forth.  In many cases, it is difficult to ascertain which company benefits from the contracts.  In addition, issues such as money laundering and the financing of terrorist organisations also arise.  The benefits of a register far outweigh the administrative burden it would create.  I ask that the Minister for Finance review the position because the Lithuanian approach, which is supported by Ireland according to the Minister of State, does not go far enough.  I hope Ireland will be a world leader in this matter and take action ahead of the European Union, as Britain and France have done, rather than being dragged into accepting it.  </p><p>The Minister of State indicated that Ireland has argued that it should be up to individual countries to decide how to proceed in their own jurisdiction.  We have seen the problems this approach creates in respect of other aspects of taxation where one ends up in a race to the bottom.  Let us put this approach behind us and instead lead the way on transparency and fairness in taxation systems internationally. </p></speech>

As he will be aware, decisive action is required on the current structures of the direct provision system, which have been criticised at home and abroad.  An independent appeals mechanism is needed, as is legislation to ensure a fairer system for those seeking asylum.  I thank the students of Pobalscoil Inbhear Sce&iacute;ne and their teacher, Lisa Sanford, for inviting me to the school to debate this issue about which they are very concerned.  The students are involved in a project to highlight this issue.</p><p>People seeking asylum, some of whom will become citizens, are being treated appallingly.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has the ability to change the direct provision system which he regarded as flawed when he was an Opposition spokesperson.  After two and a half years in Government, he and the Labour Party, which was also critical of the system when in opposition, have not shown any urgency in addressing the issue. </p><p>The former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who is now the European Ombudsman, brought a number of reports to government on direct provision and raised concerns about asylum seekers.  At the time, two thirds of asylum seekers had been in direct provision for approximately three years.  Government policy, as enunciated by the current Minister and his predecessor, is that the period spent in direct provision should not exceed six months.  The former Ombudsman raised the possibility that the circumstances in which people were living, for example, in very close quarters, were having negative mental and physical health effects and could constitute child abuse.  The Council of Europe warned about the asylum process here in 2012 when it referred to negative consequences on mental health, family ties and integration prospects. </p><p>This returns me to the point that direct provision is the first port of call for many asylum seekers who will subsequently become citizens.  It beggars belief that the Government has not taken any action on direct provision in the past three years despite the criticism levelled at the system by organisations at home and abroad.  Ultimate responsibility lies with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am disappointed he is not present.  I could cite some of the criticism he made of the direct provision system while an Opposition Deputy.  As the person with power to change the system, I ask him to explain the reasons he has not tackled the issue.  I hope he will listen to the campaign of the students of Pobalscoil Inbhear Sce&iacute;ne and others who are trying to highlight this issue.  </p><p>Asylum seekers do not have a vote and asking politicians, notably those in government who were critical of the direct provision system while in Opposition, to tackle the issue does not seem to be bearing fruit.</p> <p>Will the Minister read the reply he has from the Minister for Justice and Equality to ascertain whether we can make progress on this important issue?</p></speech>

Much of what I have to say, therefore, has been said previously.  In addition, legal challenges to the direct provision system are likely to litigated in the High Court next year.</p><p>Currently 4,381 persons reside in 34 accommodation centres managed under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of the Department of Justice and Equality.  At the end of 2009, 6,494 were persons residing in 54 centres.  The number of centres and the number of persons residing in them have decreased by a third in the space of three years.  The Minister is not saying this issue will disappear over time but it is being managed and controlled.  The efforts of the Minister and his Department will continue to further reduce the numbers of persons in direct provision.  He hopes that the new arrangements he recently introduced to deal with outstanding subsidiary protection applications will contribute to this.  He equally hopes that the passage of an amended immigration and residence Bill next year and the introduction of a single procedure will make for a more efficient and effective procedure.</p><p>The Minister is aware of the proposals of the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, on an alternative reception system for people seeking international protection.  The RIA will shortly meet IRC representatives at their request to enable them to elaborate on their proposals.  It is notable that the document states that the proposals &quot;are addressed on the basis that Ireland is now receiving less than 1,000 new asylum claims a year&quot;.  The reality is asylum trends can fluctuate and we cannot assume that this will remain the case.  Moreover changes to the asylum system, including reception conditions, can and do impact on the number of asylum claims that are made and that this also needs to be borne in mind.  It would be wrong therefore to ignore this &quot;pull factor&quot;.  While the State has an important obligation to provide refuge for those in genuine need of protection and asylum and it is crucial that we comply with our international obligations in this regard, it is also appropriate to acknowledge that a significant number of those who have during the years sought asylum here have been economic migrants evading our immigration and visa requirements whose personal narratives have ultimately proved to be both untrue and unreliable.  The State at this time cannot afford to provide supports and accommodation for individuals who so behave.</p><p>I would also like to reiterate a number of points about the direct provision system and how it has operated.  It is important to note that not once has an asylum seeker arriving in this State been left homeless.  That cannot be said for several other EU states.  The Minister has said on several occasions that while the direct provision system is not ideal, it facilitates the State in providing a roof over the heads of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed on humanitarian grounds to stay in the State.  It allows the State to do this in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where it is under financial difficulty.</p><p>If the State was to permit all asylum seekers to avail of full social welfare supports, including rent supplement, the immediate impact would be that every asylum seeker, including those not currently in accommodation provided by the RIA, would avail of this financial support.  Every asylum seeker does not live in direct provision accommodation, as they are not compelled to do so.  Accommodation is provided for those who cannot provide accommodation for themselves and do not have friends, family or others in the State who are willing to provide accommodation for them.  Some asylum seekers live with friends or family or provide from their own resources for their accommodation needs.</p><p>The accommodation system cannot be in place solely in its own context.  It is inextricably linked with the surrounding international protection process.  An amended immigration, residence and protection Bill will be published next year, the purpose of which will be to substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure in order that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p><p>The direct provision system remains an important element of the State's asylum and immigration system and the Minister has no plans to end it at this time.  The Minister accepts, however, that the time spent in direct provision accommodation and the complexity of the asylum process are issues that need to be addressed.  His resolve, therefore, is to deal with the factors that lead to delays in the processing of cases in order that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in the accommodation system.</p></speech>

When he was in opposition, he had plans and energy and what he was not going to do was not wroth mentioning, yet when he is in a position to make a change he is not willing or able to make it.</p><p>I note a hint of sarcasm in the Minister of State's comment that the Minister has replied to 50 parliamentary questions and addressed the House on the direct provision issue.  It is amazing, however, that despite all the replies and debates on the issue that his new proposals to amend the reception system and the IRC's alternative proposals will only be discussed by the RIA and the IRC in 2014.  It is amazing that a man who has answered a question about this issue 50 times and has participated in a debate in this House has not instructed the RIA to meet the IRC prior to now.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I hope some more time in opposition might help the Minister for Justice and Equality to regain his enthusiasm.  He might be able to find the notes he used previously to outline how he would change the direct provision system when he got into power.</p></speech>

Deputy Shatter is one of the most reforming Ministers we have had in this Department for many generations.  Between legislation and everything else, he will go down in history as one of the most reforming, imaginative and creative Ministers.</p></speech>
