I requested this Commencement debate to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to outline the timelines for the publication of legislation to give effect to the proposed new local authority structures for local government in Cork.</p> <p>We have gone through a very deep process in Cork over the last two or three years with the local boundaries and the local government structures.  These are the most significant changes in local authority structures in Cork since 1965.  There was an extension to the city boundary 52 years ago, and we have now gone through a similar process, which was a lengthy process, and in some regards we have come to a conclusion on the boundary.  This new proposed boundary will see up to 100,000 people move from the Cork County Council area into the Cork City Council area.  This would have a knock-on effect in many ways.  It would have a knock-on effect in how the city and the county communicate and operate, which will have to be worked on in time.</p> <p>There are 31 councillors in City Hall and 55 councillors in County Hall and there is an issue around when these new electoral boundaries are to be put in place so that councillors can plan for a local election that is 65 weeks away.  Clarity is required on those boundaries.  Clarity is also required for the 542,000 residents of the city and county so the authorities can work together and put structures in place.  The structures may include some kind of contractual arrangements on planning and housing, for example.  To put the structures in place and to see a move on the huge projects involving planning, environment and housing for these 100,000 people in less than 60 weeks will be a burden on the two local authorities.</p> <p>There are many aspects that need to be considered such as the local authority structures and how the services will be delivered to the people on the ground.  From the local election perspective, clarity is required on the boundaries because currently there are eight districts in the county and six districts in the city.  I assume we will have completely new districts in place.  That will also have to be clarified.</p> <p>I have more questions than answers so hopefully the Minister of State will be able to point us in the right direction around the timeframes for these new structures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When does the Minister of State propose that the legislation will be brought before the House?  When is it proposed to set out the new district boundaries so that local election candidates can plan?  What does the Minister of State envisage as the system for planning and housing?  Does he expect them to be moved immediately or will it happen over a period of time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-02-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018022700002#C00200"><p>This important issue has often been discussed in this Chamber and elsewhere in recent years.  Members will be aware that the issue of the local government arrangements in Cork has been the subject of much consideration over the past four or five years.  The committee report in 2015 did not produce agreed recommendations, although all concerned agreed that the retention of the <i>status quo</i>in Cork was not a tenable option.  An expert advisory group established to re-examine the matter and consider a wider range of options reported in April of last year and, on balance, it stated that an expanded city council area offered the best solution, particularly in terms of the structure of local government and a strong focus on the needs and demands of the metropolitan area of Cork.</p><p>This approach was accepted by the Government and an implementation oversight group was established to provide a definitive boundary configuration and to oversee arrangements for the boundary alteration.  The oversight group submitted a report in December 2017 outlining the proposed delineation of an extended boundary for Cork city, which was agreed by Government.  A boundary alteration can be given effect either through existing statutory procedures in Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 or by means of primary legislation.  The Department has not received any formal proposals on the Cork boundary under the 1991 Act.  Government approval has been given to bring forward legislation in the absence of local authority agreement under the existing procedures.  The Department has, accordingly, commenced work on the preparation of the necessary legislation.  Members will appreciate that primary legislation involves a number of formal processes, including drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel, Government approval and consideration by the Oireachtas.  It is difficult, therefore, to be definitive about timing.  The objective is for the relevant legislation to be published in time to ensure enactment before the summer recess, however.  Our target, therefore, is to publish a Bill by the end of May.</p><p>All matters necessary for successful implementation of the boundary alteration will be addressed in the context of the work of the implementation oversight group under its terms of reference.  Given the extent of the change involved and the range of organisational, financial and other implications, the implementation process will involve a substantial body of work.  The role of the oversight group will be crucial to this but, above all, the key to successful implementation will be the role of the two local authorities, working with the oversight group, in terms of effective planning, organisation, co-ordination and co-operation.  I am confident that this work will be rewarded by giving Cork a more robust and rational local government structure which will help to maximise its success as Ireland&rsquo;s second city, particularly in the context of the recently published national planning framework as part of Project Ireland 2040.  Once the heads of the Bill are published which, all things being equal, it is hoped will happen in April, the intention is that instructions will be given to the committee considering local electoral area boundaries within Cork to commence the work and receive public submissions.  The Cork boundaries will be part of the overall package to be published nationally at the end of May or start of June.</p><p>On the services being transferred, that is a matter for the implementation group.  It caused some controversy and I saw it was reported in the national newspapers today that I issued a response to the chairman of Cork County Council stating I did not want to meet him to discuss those matters.  I do not want to meet him at the moment because there is a process in train under the oversight group.  It is not a slight on him or the membership of Cork County Council but it would be a severe slight, on my part, of the independent oversight group which is charged with implementing the boundary change if I were to engage in a parallel process with the local authority while its work was ongoing.</p></speech>

The Cork local election boundaries for the wards in the city and the districts in the county will be part of the national publication of the reports of the two committees that are examining local authority electoral areas.  It will not be treated differently.  At the moment it is being parked because there are 31 local authorities.  There is plenty of work for those committees to do and Cork will be left towards the end of their work so that when the heads of the Bill are published, and I hope that will happen in April, they will be able to go into the formal process of considering drawing the local authority electoral area boundaries within Cork city and county, and then publish a request for consultation with the general public who might have observations and submissions to make.  It has always been my intention, and it is that of the Government, that we would have boundaries a year out from the next local election.</p></speech>

Last week, a well choreographed national development plan, NDP, was rolled out in Sligo with a promise of large-scale capital projects being rolled out nationwide.  The truth is, however, that these will never be delivered because there is a huge shortage of labour in the country not just in the construction industry, but throughout the health service, the Army and the education sector to name a few.  The apprenticeship figures relating to the construction industry tell their own tale.  New apprenticeship registrations are 58% behind 2017 targets while only 1% of all apprentices are female.  My colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, reported an alarming statistic in respect of the take-up of apprenticeships.  In 2017, there were only 121 bricklayers and 63 plasterers with no apprentices in floor and wall tiling.  With these numbers in the pipelines, the Government must take us for fools.  Where it will get the labour to build all the ambitious projects in the NDP?  I would like a Minister to come to the House to describe how it will do same.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to the Government's strategic communications unit.  The Taoiseach confirmed during Leaders' Questions earlier today that departmental officials were in charge of the advertising spend for the 2040 development plan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to know why Department officials authorised Fine Gael election candidates to be included in Department advertising across national and regional newspapers nationwide.  It is hard to accept that the Government's strategic partnership arrangements form some sort of arm's length political advertising transaction between the Government and newspapers.  I know the Leader has in his possession today various articles from Fianna F&aacute;il Government's and the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party coalition, but these are in fact identified clearly as advertising articles, which is completely contrary to what the current Government is doing with the strategic communications unit.  It is clear the Government is using State funds to fund the Fine Gael political machine.  This is wrong; it is not right.  State funds should not be used as a public relations vehicle for An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, or the wider Fine Gael Party.</p><p>The final issue I would like to raise concerns the storm which we know is on its way from the east.  We need to ensure that the Government has made plans for those who are most vulnerable, particularly the elderly and those living alone.  We need to ensure that there is adequate emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, that there is grit on our roads for those who have to use our road services, that emergency waterworks provisions are in place and that proper instructions on working times are given to the public.  I understand one Minister of State asked people to keep their heat on full blast for the period.  However, this is a big call when one does not have the money to pay one's heating bills.  In this vein, I call on the Government, as many of our colleagues in the D&aacute;il have done, to commit to provide an extra week of the fuel allowance on foot of this bad weather in order that people, if they are directed to leave their fuel on by Government Ministers, have the money to do so.  This is a very important issue and I would like to hear the Leader's response to it.  I also call on the Minister to direct the local authorities to leave the heating on for those living in local authority housing schemes who have communal heating schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-02-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018022700002#O00200"><p>I wish to raise three issues.  The first is the annual report of the Data Protection Commissioner for 2017.  The watchdog has clearly criticised Tusla over its record-keeping.  I was particularly interested in reading an article about this today not because of Tusla, but because I was conscious and mindful of the Data Protection Bill that will come before us, which is a really important piece of work.  I am also mindful of the fact that Tusla would come under the designation of what are called public bodies.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE and Tusla are three that come to mind that hold an awful lot of sensitive information about citizens.  Because they are public bodies under the legislation that, it appears, will be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas - though let us wait and see - there will be no penalty, no compensation for any breaches in this regard.  The legislation we are considering will give them a slap on the hand if they breach data but, unlike other organisations and private bodies, there will be no sanction.  It will be a poor day's work if we let this through the House.  I am putting that down as a marker and I intend to raise it later.  It is a very important point.  I wish to put it on the record of the House that we have to be seriously concerned that there will be no sanction regarding the HSE breaches or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla.</p> <p>Getting back to what the watchdog said about Tusla, he has issued 59 findings against Tusla and is asking the agency to report back on them.  Let us see what happens.  This is a serious issue.  To put it in context, he received 2,642 investigations and complaints in 2017.  This represents a major rise in complaints, but I suppose we can tie that down to the amount of knowledge about data retention and data protection.</p> <p>I thank the Leader for arranging for the Minister of State with special responsibility for local government to come before the House tomorrow to discuss councillors' pay, remuneration and conditions.  The Leader did give an undertaking that he would do this.  I am delighted that the Minister of State responsible for this area, local government and councillors, will be here tomorrow and I think this will give us a great opportunity.  I saw a few emails sent around today to elected members, city and county councillors, from all sides of the House, so I look forward to hearing what those Members of this House will have to say tomorrow in line with that communication to those members.</p> <p>Finally - and I will be very brief on this - I said I would stand up every week in the Seanad to raise the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire until I finish here.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In January 2017, 12 beds were closed.  We were given a commitment they would be open within the year but they were not.  We had the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health out turning sods for the new phase 1.  As we also saw all of this being announced as part of Project Ireland 2040, I do not know what they are talking about.  There seems to be double-counting there and we need to look at this.  I have arranged for a parliamentary question to be asked on it.  I spoke to the hospital this morning and six of the beds remain shut, at a time when people waiting for rehabilitation services are holding up beds in acute hospitals.  Will the Leader make it a priority to talk to the people who matter, because I intend bringing this up once a week as long as I am here?</p></speech>

I flagged it when the event was first announced by victims' families and campaigning groups, and I encouraged Members and those available to attend it.  I went on Sunday.  There were thousands of people on the streets of Belfast, the vast bulk of them victims and survivors - people who have lost loved ones during the course of the conflict in the North.  Some of them are very well known in the public discourse and many of them are lesser known.  People carried portraits of mothers, brothers, sisters and fathers.  The striking thing for me was to see people my age and younger carrying portraits of grandparents, great-aunts and great-uncles.  Sadly, those young people of my age and younger must again lift the mantle for their families in campaigning for truth and justice.  Many of them simply want an inquest into the murder, killing or loss of their loved ones.  I noted that thanks was given from the stage to the Irish Government from the families for its steadfast support for the campaigning groups for victims.  On Sunday, they urged the Irish Government to remain steadfast in championing the rights of victims who have lost loved ones in the conflict, many of whom came on Sunday from every and all backgrounds, including people who had lost loved ones at the hands of the British state, republicans and loyalists.  It was heartening to see but it is a great shame it had to happen.</p> <p>I also noted the call from the stage for the Irish Government to publish the Crowley report into the murder of Aidan McAnespie.</p></speech>

I have no doubt we will continue to raise it.  I referenced it last week so I will not go into it in any great detail at this stage.</p><p>I note too, with regard to the broader issue of victims and where it sits in the current political discourse in the North, that the victims' commissioner in the North was on the BBC this weekend and restated that no political agreement <i>per se</i>from the latest round of talks was necessary and that an Executive was not necessary in the North for the legacy money to be released, for which the Lord Chief Justice in the North has been calling.  I call, through the Leader, on the Irish Government to reiterate to the British Government that there does not need to be any delay in releasing the funds for legacy inquests and that the call from the Lord Chief Justice, who is impartial from politics and sits separate from everything else that is happening in the current context, should be heeded and fulfilled.</p><p>I welcome, and I am sure the Leader noted it also, the call from more than 100 voices from within civic unionism to come together in a space around equality and a discussion on equality and rights.  Many of them are very eminent figures within the unionist tradition.  They stated issues of rights and equality are not issues for nationalism or unionism, as they are just issues for all of us.  We are here to try to create a space in institutions such as ours, and perhaps we should consider, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, creating space for representatives of that civic body of unionism to come to the Seanad and address us on some of the issues they raised.</p></speech>

There is now a stampede by the banks to sell mortgages before legislation is enacted.  I welcome that the Government proposes to abstain in the vote tomorrow on Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.  I thank Deputy McGrath for introducing that Bill and I also thank Deputy Durkan for the Bill which he proposes to bring to the Minister on this issue.  It is about time something was done.  </p><p>Last week, when people contacted Permanent TSB to find out if their mortgages were to be sold they were told that they would receive a letter in due course if their mortgage is to be sold, which is very nice of them.  It cannot be legal for these lenders to sell loans to vulture funds without the permission of borrowers.  That could not stand up in a court of law.  The vulture funds have been getting their own way in this country over the last five or ten years.  Legislation to address this issue must be enacted.</p><p>Permanent TSB previously sold off mortgages to Springboard Mortgages Limited.  In cases where borrowers were paying interest only, Springboard increased the interest from 3% or 3.5% to 6.5% and it dragged those who could not pay through the court system.  If, owing to the sale of these mortgages, people lose their homes it will be the taxpayer who will foot the bill.</p></speech>

Young people are being left at risk because standards in these counties are very weak.</p> <p>Last November, HIQA undertook an inspection of these services which are operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in respect of which it identified five failures.  At that time, the service had a waiting list of 213 children and families in need of initial assessment.  Even worse, HIQA inspectors discovered that the waiting lists were not being effectively managed, leaving children at risk.  The report outlined that the systems in place to alert garda&iacute; are not robust enough and it also called into question the quality of the screening of families that are referred to the services.  Network checks with other professionals and appropriate contact with parents were not routinely undertaken as part of the screening process.  The report identified a failure to carry out background checks and, most worryingly, there was a lack of speed in following up some allegations of physical abuse of children.</p> <p>I have heard from service users that the system is broken but to read in a report that there was concern about multiple referrals of the same children but there was no joined-up response from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, was shocking.  These vulnerable children did not receive a consistent response in line with the national and local area procedures.  They were not given a family response and their safety was compromised.  This is an incredible failing.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  The Minister is not doing her job if she does not throw her whole weight behind sorting out this problem.  There needs to be an immediate spotlight shone on the services in these areas, including my own county, Carlow, as a matter of urgency.  The plight of these families has to be highlighted and standards need to be radically improved.  We are not looking after those in need when we are not listening properly.  There must be change and an urgent audit nationwide of these services.  </p> <p>Like other speakers, I encourage everyone to check on their elderly neighbours over the next few days.  It is important that we do not forget to call on them and on people with mobility issues.  In addition, I call on the Minister to provide additional funding to these vulnerable people.</p></speech>

Item No. 22 is the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill entitled the Arts (Dignity at Work) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which is, "an Act to enable the Arts Council to ensure that funding is contingent on compliance with employment law and for that purpose to amend the Arts Act 2003; and to provide for related matters".</p> <p>I commend the women in the arts who have come forward and told their stories and who have contributed to a watershed moment.  I commend Grace Dyas for her bravery.  However, we should be crystal clear about the fact that unacceptable behaviour, toxic masculinity and the abuse of power is not solely confined to the arts.  Those who suggest this and paint this as a picture facing artists alone are mistaken.</p> <p>Everybody deserves a safe culture and environment at work.  We are told by Government that laws are already in place but there are legislative opportunities for us to explore, of which this Bill is one.  The national and global conversation that is ongoing has not been followed up by action.  In that context, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that by attaching the allocation of funding to compliance with the law, we can fast forward a change in culture and in harassment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the State gives contracts or funding to organisations, it should expect the highest levels of workers' rights.

Quite an unsavoury piece was written in today's edition of the local newspaper, the<i>Westmeath Examiner</i>.  To build the background, and as the Cathaoirleach knows, when one comes into Mullingar from the Dublin road one passes the Mullingar Park Hotel, which has a fabulous convention centre - one of the finest in the midlands - and a health club and spa.  Having passed the hotel, one sees the new National Science Park, which was previously the tobacco factory.  We talked about that factory 18 months ago.  It was closed and has been reopened by the businesspeople of Mullingar.  Gary Moore and the guys from TEG and Mergon are in there.  They are hoping to create 100 jobs there in research and development.  It really is a flagship building and a flagship project for Mullingar.  After that, one passes the new Curraghmore school, which is being built, and the new local shopping centre, which is also being built on the way into Mullingar, before one reaches the town itself where the canal is.  As we are aware, in the town there are three fabulous hotels and there are approximately 20 restaurants and 20 coffee shops within the canal which encircles the town.</p><p>I was quite disturbed to read in the local <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>this morning that Mullingar has been described as unkempt, neglected and degrading by a Senator in this House.  I got many phone calls about the article.  I was very disappointed to read it to be honest.  Senator Norris is correct, one would not have to look any further than Senator Norris.  I mean Senator Craughwell. </p></speech>

In fairness, Mullingar is in the top section of the Tidy Towns competition.  It also has a very active town team.  It has a full-time chamber of commerce and is one of the few towns that has been awarded a purple flag.  As I have said, I have talked to several business leaders in Mullingar town and they have told me that they were shocked and disgusted by this article.  As an active businessman and member of the business community in Mullingar, I ask Senator Craughwell to rethink his piece in the paper.  It would certainly be appreciated by the people in Mullingar.  I ask him to amend it or to apologise.  If one cannot make a good comment about a place it is not worth making any comment at all.  We are very disappointed that the Senator has seen fit to run down our town.</p></speech>

It identifies 18 out of the 20 people affected as having not been vaccinated.  It highlights the importance of vaccination in that whole area.  The uptake of measles vaccination over recent years has decreased.  We need to reach a target of approximately 95% vaccination in order for it to be fully effective.  It is disappointing that the uptake has decreased by so much.  What has now occurred in the Limerick area highlights its importance.  It is time for us to encourage both the Minister for Health and the HSE to put an appropriate campaign in place to help highlight the importance of this vaccination.  There is also good news in respect of vaccination.  The uptake of the HPV vaccination programme has increased in 2017 compared with 2016 and now stands at 62%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a programme due to operate again in March and April encouraging parents to have their secondary school children vaccinated.  Hopefully that percentage can continue to increase.  Vaccination helps to prevent particular infections or diseases occurring and it helps to reduce demand on our health care system.  It is important that we encourage everybody to avail of the vaccine when it is available.  At this stage it is important that the Minister and the HSE organise a major information campaign on these two areas.  I am aware that a lot of work was done in August, September and October on the HPV vaccine.  This needs to be done again to continue to grow the number of people who will avail of the vaccine.  It is a very important issue and is something we should be encouraging.</p></speech>

One of the British soldiers who was there said how shocking it was.  This young man had to pass through that checkpoint twice a day on his way to and from work.

When I was chairman of the James Joyce Centre it took us several years; umpteen hoops had to be jumped through and we had to produce certificates of this, that and the other before we gained charitable status.  How are these people, who produce no benefit to the society or the economy of Ireland, allowed to get charitable funds? What precisely do they do that is charitable in any legitimate meaning of the word? I have already spoken at length about this matter.</p> <p>This issue is also affecting people, who have paid their way with their mortgages.  Just yesterday I listened to Charlie Weston on the wireless.  He is the financial correspondent with Independent News and Media.  He has never been behind with one red cent of his mortgage yet he received a letter, which was unsigned, from one of these mortgage funds called Proteus Funding.  The letter directed him to go to a Garda station with his passport to identify himself.  This is a hell of a cheek.  I would like to know the status of this situation and if the Government is going to do anything to remove charitable status from these blackguards, otherwise we will be paying for the evictions, we will be paying for the rehousing of people and these funds companies will not pay any income tax at all on their profits.</p></speech>

I have brought this issue up as a Commencement matter with regard to our local Educate Together primary school at Canal Way in Dublin 8.  The headlines would have people believe that parents are choosing to enrol their children in Catholic primary schools.  It is, unfortunately, because a cap has been put on Educate Together schools.  Parents have no choice.  My Commencement matter for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, was about the issue of choice, albeit for an individual school in Basin Lane.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, the issue is not just local, but national.  The cap has been placed on all developing schools throughout the country.  I know of at least six or seven of them and parents have no option but to send their children to the Catholic school.  Some 96% of our primary schools are run by the Catholic orders.</p><p>I would like the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, to attend the Chamber so that we can find out how we will accommodate the increasing and overwhelming demand from parents for their children to be educated in an Educate Together school where the ethos is that of a learning centre that values democracy for parents, pupils, teachers and the boards.  I would like him to respond to how we will progress this divestment from the church to our primary schools and the plans in place, because this has been an issue for a number of years.</p><p>Canal Way Educate Together national school was given a ten-year lease and six years remain on it but it is not allowed to do any repairs even though the school is practically falling down.  The church still has a hold over those buildings.  Eighteen years ago I was involved in setting up of the first Educate Together school on the South Circular Road at Griffith Barracks.  This was very successful even if they were tough times.  We got it from the OPW and not the religious orders.  I would like to see more of those schools meet the demand of parents for an all-encompassing education.</p></speech>

Therefore, I note that I am glad the debate is to take place because it is an important matter.</p> <p>Many Members of the House are in regular and close contact with our local authority members throughout the country.  They do a fantastic job.  Their pay and conditions were changed and these changes mean that the majority of them are out of pocket regarding mileage, making a bad situation even worse.  Local authority members who stood for election for the first time on the last occasion tell me they are not in a position to contest the elections again.  They cannot afford it.</p> <p>These are young people with responsibilities such as those associated with mortgages, child care and the general rearing of families.  They cannot afford to be local authority members any longer.  This is a disgraceful situation that throws their hard work in their face and makes their situation even worse.</p> <p>I hope the Minister will address the matter in a meaningful fashion.  I appreciate the time he has given to the Chamber tomorrow night.  Many contributions will be made across the House.  I hope that we can move forward tomorrow night with these concerns being addressed fully.</p></speech>

I join with Senator Ardagh in calling for the expedition of the apprenticeship programme.  Ireland has a deficit of apprenticeships that has been well documented.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, have been to the forefront in the action plan for apprenticeships for 2016 to 2020 and 26 new apprenticeship applications were approved.  We have an aim of having 9,000 apprentices registered by 2020.  Therefore, there is a clear pathway.  Eleven new apprenticeship programmes have been developed and approved since 2015.</p> <p>Every time I listen to Senator Ardagh speak about apprenticeships and the construction sector, I wonder if I am living in "Dallas".  Am I like Bobby stepping out of the shower and awakening from a dream?  I remind Senator Ardagh-----</p></speech>

There are more people back at work, there is a construction sector that is beginning to re-emerge from the doldrums of a decade, a lost decade caused by Senator Clifford-Lee's party in government and nobody else.  We had to re-brand and reconstruct F&Aacute;S as SOLAS, following the mess the Senator's party in government created with F&Aacute;S in respect of the construction sector.  Now we are working with industry to ensure people are back at work in the construction sector.  I agree with Senator Ardagh, it is absolutely important that we prioritise construction apprenticeships because skilled craftspeople and others are needed to work in that sector.  That is what this Government is doing.  There is an action plan for apprenticeships under the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.</p></speech>

That is understandable because we have good news to tell people but we have a very clear separation between the fourth estate and Members of the Government and of the Oireachtas, and that is how they should do their business.</p> <p>In keeping with the previous national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, there was no communication with members of local media or local newspapers the way the Senator purports.  It was quite the opposite.  The instruction was that this was in partnership with the Irish Government, in keeping with what Fianna F&aacute;il did when it was in government, travelling the country, advertising on the backs of buses or in newspapers.  They went around the country with their policy units.  Senators Clifford-Lee and Ardagh know that quite well.  </p> <p>I agree with Senator Ardagh and Senator Murnane O'Connor that we must encourage all the elderly people and those most vulnerable in this time of an impending cold weather alert not to be afraid to turn on their heating.  We will all work to ensure, whether through special needs payments, the fuel allowance, or by whatever means we can, that people do not feel they cannot put on the heating.  I appeal to all in this House to cast aside their political baggage, ideology and rivalry to ensure that all the elderly and most vulnerable have access to heat and can be properly taken care of.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senators Boyhan and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of data protection.  The Bill will be discussed in the House later and we will be debating the issues raised by Senator Boyhan with the Minister.  The issues the Senators referenced about Tusla are worrying, because it is the organisation charged with protecting the most vulnerable young people in our society and it has a responsibility to ensure the findings of the HIQA inspection report are acted upon.  I understand that Tusla has responded to the issue.  It is important to recognise that Tusla has made changes but it is not good enough when a report by an independent group such as HIQA highlights key issues of concern.  All of us want to ensure the safety of our children and to ensure they are protected at all times.  I do not have an answer on the question about the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter. </p><p>Senators Norris and &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of Aidan McAnespie's killing.  As Leader of the House, I join with the two Senators in condemning his death.  If one listened to the "Miriam Meets" programme last Sunday, one could not but be moved by the powerful testimony of family members about what happened and how Aidan McAnespie was treated.  It is unbelievable that a young man travelling to his own GAA club should be the victim of a tragedy like this without any recourse to justice for the family.  It beggars belief that at one level, it is claimed that his death was caused by a ricochet bullet when - as other Members have pointed out and as was said on the programme last Sunday - there was an ongoing campaign of harassment involving Mr. McAnespie.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is committed to ensuring that the truth is found.  He is examining all options that might be available to assist the family.  I know, having spoken to the Minister, that he is concerned that there is disquiet about what may or may not have happened but the bottom line here is that it is important that the truth is uncovered for all victims and families of victims of the violence on both sides of the divide, and equally that we have reconciliation whereby we can bring our country forward again.  </p></speech>

I join with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in saying that the issue of equality is important for the North, and particularly the issue of marriage equality.</p> <p>Senators Butler and Norris raised the issue of Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank, and we had two debates in the House last week on the issue; it was in the Order of Business twice and the Minister was in the House last Thursday.  The Minister is committed to working with all sides to ensure that we find a way forward so that we can have certainty for families, homeowners and landowners in the case of the use of the non-performing loan book.  It is also important to recognise there are many people who are paying their mortgages, struggling to pay and working through their issues with the banks.  The State should work with those people as well and they should not be forgotten in this debate.  The issue is being taken seriously.  The Minister has met Deputy Michael McGrath and there is a willingness to work to ensure that we do find a way forward.  The Minister has asked the Central Bank to look at the situation.</p></speech>

I know the Cathaoirleach may rebuke me for that.</p> <p>I am not familiar with the issue raised regarding retired members of the Defence Forces.  I will be happy to talk about that after the Order of Business.  </p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the very important issue of an engineering technology event due to take place in Shannon tomorrow which has been cancelled.  The initiative is one we should welcome and embrace because it is not just about primary and secondary school students being able to avail of opportunities.  Recently in Cork three women, Gillian Keating, Ruth Buckley and Caroline O'Driscoll, produced a very important initiative called I Wish which is about the STEM subjects, namely, science, technology, engineering and maths, and the need to have more women involved in all of those subject areas.  I agree with Senator Byrne that it is important that we promote and advocate for girls and women to study these subjects and go on to different careers.</p> <p>I would be happy to accept Senator Warfield's amendment to the Order of Business.  We should give consideration to working with all sides of the House to ensure that there is protection for workers in the arts.  His points were well made.</p> <p>I will not weigh in on the comments made by Senators Davitt and Craughwell on Mullingar, other than to say it is a fine town and a place I have visited on a number of occasions.</p> <p>Senator Burke raised a very important issue raised by Senator Byrne last week, namely, the measles epidemic in Limerick.  The fact that some 18 of the 20 people affected had not been vaccinated highlights the need for an ongoing campaign to promote the importance of vaccinations and immunisations because they work.  Those who say they do not are doing a disservice to young people and young women in respect of the HPV vaccine.  Senator Burke referred to the HPV vaccine uptake having increased to 50%, which is something we should support.  All of us in the House support the campaign by the HSE and Department of Health on vaccinations.</p> <p>I have addressed the matters raised by Senator Norris.  In respect of the matter raised by Senator Devine, the Minister will come before the House in the coming weeks on the issue of divestment.  It has been raised on the Order of Business a number of times and there was a Topical Issues matter on it.  The Government is committed to delivering on the commitment in the programme for Government to deliver 400 multidenominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  That is the Government's plan.  In some cases things are taking longer than they should, but the point she raised is one that we should all work to see achieved.  There should be diversity and choice, and a different model of delivery should be achieved.  We will have a debate on that soon.</p> <p>I fully agree with Senator Clifford-Lee on the pay and conditions of councillors.  We had a debate on the matter in the House last week.  She is right to raise the point and it is one we should all support, irrespective of politics.  Councillors are the vanguard of local government.  They are foot soldiers and policy makers. They are employed on a part-time basis, but in reality they work on a full-time basis.  They deserve to be paid properly.  I agree with the Senator.</p> <p>I accept the amendment from Senator Warfield to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I thank Members, in particular Senator Buttimer, for facilitating the Bill this evening.  It is hoped that with the consent of the House we might conclude matters by taking all Stages.  It is a short Bill, with the the sole purpose of ensuring that the same age limit applies to internal and external candidates for appointment to the ranks of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner.  The immediate impetus for this Bill is the upcoming competition for the next Garda Commissioner.  Before proceeding, I want to acknowledge the dedication and service of acting Garda Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.</p> <p>The former Garda Commissioner announced her retirement last autumn.  For the first time, the independent Policing Authority, working in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, will now conduct the selection process for a Garda Commissioner.  Shortly after the former Commissioner announced her retirement, I engaged with the chairperson of the Policing Authority.  The authority has undertaken a significant amount of work to prepare for the appointment process, and I wish to acknowledge that.  Members of the House will be aware that the Government triggered the statutory process included in section 9 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, for the selection and appointment of the next Commissioner last December.  I am pleased to say that preparations for the competition, which will be an open international competition without any restriction as to nationality or policing experience, are almost finalised.  However, before the competition can proceed, I seek the support of this House to rectify an anomaly that has the effect of barring an external candidate aged 55 years or older from appointment as Commissioner.  </p> <p>The anomaly dates from 2004.  It is an unintended effect of the retirement regime introduced at that time for new entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At that time, the long-standing tradition, dating from the 1960s, was to appoint the Commissioner from within the ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This unintended age barrier has no logical basis, and in the context of an open, competitive process, unnecessarily restricts the field of candidates for one of the most important public service leadership roles in this State.  </p> <p>As I have already stated, the Government's overriding concern, a concern I believe is shared in this House, is that the best possible candidate is selected to take up the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government has no preference as to whether the person is an internal or external candidate.  Rather, the Government's concern is to ensure that the selection process attracts the widest possible pool of high calibre candidates, and that whosoever is selected and nominated by the authority for appointment by the Government is tested against a strong field.  Seeking to ensure a level playing field where the age of the appointment is concerned is part of this concern.  It has the support of the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service.  </p> <p>I will turn briefly to the Bill itself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It amends the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  It contains two sections.  Section 1 is the substantive section while section 2 contains the general provision in regard to the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.</p><p>Section 1 amends section 4 of the 2004 Act.  For the assistance of Members, I will set out the background and purpose of section 4.  In essence, section 4 introduced a new retirement regime for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who enter on or after 1 April 2004.  The retirement of those who entered prior to that date continues to be governed by regulations made under the Garda Acts.  While section 4 maintained the maximum age of retirement of 60 for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it made it conditional for new entrants on or after 1 April 2004 on health and other checks.  The purpose of this conditional approach is to ensure the operational capacity of the police service.  Specifically, section 4 provides that a new entrant shall "cease to be a member" of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, "on attaining the age of 55 years" but may continue to 60 years subject to the Commissioner being satisfied that, "the member is fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the duties of his or her position as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na".  Where the member concerned is the Commissioner, it is the Minister for Justice and Equality who must satisfy himself or herself as to capability and competency.</p><p>The Attorney General has advised that the manner in which section 4 is constructed has the effect of excluding the appointment of a person, who is not already a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before the age of 55, to the rank of Commissioner.  It has the same effect in regard to the rank of deputy commissioner.  Accordingly, the Government has made the decision to amend the legislation to better support an open competition.  Quite apart from the importance of ensuring a level playing field between internal and external candidates, it puts prospective external candidates who may be already 54 years of age in the unenviable position of trying to determine whether it is worth their while applying for the competition and running the risk of ageing-out before the process concludes.  To rectify this anomaly, section 1 inserts a new subsection 4 in section 4.  It provides that nothing in that section shall prevent the appointment, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, of a person who has attained the age of 55 years but is under the age of 60 as a new entrant to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the rank of Commissioner or deputy commissioner.  Section 1 also inserts a new subsection (5) to clarify that the regime in section in regard to medical and other checks applies to such appointees.</p><p>It is important to note that these amendments make no change to the retirement regime in operation for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The regime approved by the Oireachtas in 2004, under which all those who join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on or after 1 April of that year cease to be members on attaining the age of 55 but may continue to the age of 60 subject to certain conditions, remains intact.  This provision, in conjunction with regulations made by the Government recently, means that any person appointed to the office of Commissioner on foot of the upcoming competition shall serve for five years or until he or she attains the age of 60 years, whichever is the earlier.</p><p>As I previously stated, on this occasion for the first time, the independent  Policing Authority, working in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, will conduct the selection process for a Garda Commissioner.  I am advised that the selection process itself is likely to take some four months from the launch date.  Further time may then be required depending on the candidate.  I and my colleagues in government are keen to remove any possible obstacle or barrier to ensuring the best possible candidate can be identified to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and deliver the best policing services to the people of Ireland.  I am keen that the competition proceed without delay.  In that regard, I want to specifically thank the Members of this House for their co-operation with the passage of this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his comprehensive background to this issue.  I note the Bill passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il on 21 February 2018.  It is a short Bill, as he said, that seeks to alter the current position that had the effect of barring an external candidate aged over 55 years from applying for the position of Garda Commissioner.  That raises serious concerns and is something of which I was not aware.  I do not know how that arrangement was allowed sit for so long.  It is extraordinary.</p> <p>Let us be clear.  I am a great believer in simple messages and one of the things I have found since becoming a Member of this House is that when a fellow says that something is complicated, one wants to sit up and look.  I refer to that type of diversionary tactic.  When politicians say, "It is all very complicated" or "It is in the Bill for a very good reason", one really needs to start digging.  However, I was amazed that the legislation precluded external candidates over 55 years of age from applying for the position but if they were internal candidates, that was grand.  They could stay on until the age of 60.  The issue has now come to us today for discussion.  That is my simple message because sometimes setting the narrative is important and the narrative that needs to be set is that at this late stage, the issue is being addressed and that has to be welcomed.</p> <p>The sole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the same age limit applies internally and externally to the candidates for appointment to the rank of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner.  The Minister is right.  It is a fundamental position within our State.  I wish him well with the Bill.  Originally, I thought this job was advertised but I understand now that it has not been advertised.</p></speech>

As the Fine Gael Leader of the House, we will be supporting this Government Bill.  As Senator Boyhan rightly said, it is about ensuring that we have the same age limit for external candidates and that they are not barred from being able to apply and be interviewed for the position.</p> <p>The next Garda Commissioner is pivotal in terms of the reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is fair to say that the Garda has suffered in the eyes of the public for a variety of reasons but it is important now that we restore that morale.</p> <p>As the first female Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan deserves our thanks and praise for the role she played.  I always found her to be a very amicable and fair-minded person to engage with who did her best and wanted to see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advance.  Equally, we are very fortunate with the men and women who serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in our towns and cities who do Trojan work to protect but also build a sense of community.  It is now opportune that we bring reform to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that we will have an open, international recruitment campaign.  I welcome the age barrier being changed.  It is a pity the 5 ft 9 in. height barrier could not have been changed over time.  Many of us who are of a smaller height might have been considered for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I always found that to be discriminatory and unfair because the many of us who might have considered applying were precluded from doing so because of the height restriction.  That was wrong, and I am glad that has changed.</p></speech>

To a large extent, it is a relatively minor technical Bill.  It is intended to address the unintended effect of the retirement provision applying to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who entered service on or after 1 April 2004 and external candidates for appointment to the rank of Garda Commissioner or deputy Garda commissioner.  It relates to section 4 of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, which states that such members of the force shall cease to be members on attaining 55 years of age but may continue until 60 years subject to checks.  The provision, however, has the unintended effect of creating a bar on the appointment of persons aged 55 or more to the rank of Garda Commissioner or to the rank of Deputy Garda commissioner where those persons are external applicants.  Clearly, that is not sensible.  We support legislation to rectify such an unintended but obvious anomaly and consequence.</p> <p>As colleagues have said, it is vital that the process be as open as possible to external candidates.  We previously expressed that it would be preferable to have an external candidate take on the position of Garda Commissioner for a number of reasons, one of which is that it would be invidious at this stage for somebody within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take on the position.  A person from within the force would find matters difficult from the outset.  We should be considering external candidates and, very likely, people from outside the jurisdiction.  It is possible that the Minister has commented on this already but, if he has any update on the process for the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, it will be very welcome.</p> <p>My colleagues in the D&aacute;il expressed the view to the Minister that we would have believed it preferable to have an extended period with an acting Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  They also expressed the view that it would have been preferable for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to have been reported before a Garda Commissioner was appointed in order to allow the Public Appointments Service and the Policing Authority to take account of them.  While the Minister is proceeding in any event, we still have some concerns in this regard.</p> <p>This is going to be a crucial appointment.  With the right appointment, together with enthusiastic implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it may be possible to draw a line under recent controversies and begin a new future for policing in this State.  As has been said, however, that would require the commission to come up with radical proposals, and these must be implemented fully and enthusiastically by the Government.  It is essential, therefore, that we get the appointment right.</p> <p>Let me add to previous observations regarding the maximum age, which, even after the enactment of this legislation, will still be 60.  It is unusual that we require garda&iacute; to retire at that age when in other areas we force employees to work for a longer period, perhaps up to the age of 67 or 68, in places they would rather not be.  This is the other extreme.  In many circumstances, those who would be forced to work for longer would be least likely to be able to do so.  In the case of garda&iacute;, however, there are people who would very much like to remain in service and who are perfectly capable of so doing but who are prevented from doing so.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.</p> <p>The legislation is technical and is intended to rectify an anomaly.  We will support it.  I will assist in ensuring the process for appointing a new Garda Commissioner is robust.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The right person must be appointed to ensure that there is a new era in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

For a responsible position such as Garda Commissioner, not many people under 55 would apply.  One would need that degree of experience.  A large number of commentators have suggested that it would be a very good thing to have someone from outside the jurisdiction take up the role.  As such, I am very happy to support the legislation, which rectifies a technical anomaly, as the Minister said.</p> <p>I want to raise something else because this legislation deals with the terms and conditions of work of civil servants.  I would like the Minister to take back to Cabinet my view, which I think is widely supported in the House, notwithstanding that people are reluctant to say it in public because of voter reaction.  There are 111 civil servants in Leinster House who get more than we get as Senators.  That is a pretty astonishing situation.  Approximately half a dozen of them at least get three times what we get.  During the financial emergency, the long-service increment was removed.  I cannot think of another job where one does not get a long-service increment.  Certainly, everyone around here gets it, including the secretaries.  What is wrong with us?  Why are we so utterly mealy-mouthed?</p></speech>

It is time we did something about this anomaly.  We do not need to be mealy-mouthed.  I can tell the Minister that the public of Ireland would not give a toss if we gave away every penny we had to St. Vincent de Paul and danced naked across the roof of Leinster House.  They would not be impressed.  This is a very serious thing.  I must say the civil servants were shrewd enough.  I see one of them having a good smile.  They got it.  It is the smile of the cat who got the cream.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister, therefore, to take back to Government a feeling which is shared very widely in the House, but which many of my colleagues are afraid to say anything about.  We really need to look at the terms and conditions of our own employment.  If we do not, we will not get really good people into politics.  They will get a hell of a lot of abuse from the media and very little thanks from the public.  If they are paid buttons as well, it will have an effect.

In particular, I acknowledge the support of Senator Clifford-Lee and Fianna F&aacute;il, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile of Sinn F&eacute;in, Senator Boyhan and, indeed, Senator Norris, in our objective of ensuring the best possible candidate is appointed to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I reiterate that Government has absolutely no preference as to whether the person is an internal or external candidate, but whoever comes through the process, whether they be a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or otherwise, will face a significant task.  The person will be required to continue the implementation of the major reform programme, to improve governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, improve performance management, build managerial capacity, and enhance service delivery while continuing to ensure that the organisation has the capability to secure the State and keep citizens safe.  The person will also be required to implement any further strategic reforms to the sector generally that may flow from the work of the Commission on the Future of Policing.  </p><p>I note Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's view that it might be best to delay the appointment of the Garda Commissioner until the Commission on the Future of Policing has completed its work.  The commission's work is well under way and I acknowledge its work under the leadership of the experienced former police officer Kathleen O'Toole.  It will produce its report by September this year at the latest.  I am sure Senators will agree that it is not in the public interest or that of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that we allow a state of uncertainty to persist.  We must proceed and ensure that there is not a vacuum around the leadership of the police service.  It is some time since former Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan retired, whose leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and whose contribution I want to acknowledge, and it is important that we move swiftly towards a replacement.  I know from my engagement with Kathleen O'Toole, the chair of the Commission on the Future of Policing, that she shares my concern that after a careful and deliberative approach to the recruitment process we need to proceed to ensure the best candidate is selected.  The approach has been followed that has allowed the policing authority to engage with the Commission on the Future of Policing to see how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I will refer briefly to points raised by Senators Buttimer, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Norris on the maximum retirement age of 60 years.  It is less than that which applies to the majority of public servants with the exception of other uniformed services such as the Defence Forces and Prison Service.  The distinguishing feature of the uniformed services is justified by the physical nature of the role and need to maintain operational capacity at all times.  That also means the retaining of talent and refreshing the supervisory and management tiers in organisations that are often seen as having somewhat limited promotional opportunities.  I have listened carefully to Senators on this.  I believe there is merit in considering whether these justifications hold the same sway for the leadership tiers of the police service, particularly in the context of open competitions.  I have asked my Department to undertake a review on this matter.  Any proposal for change will have to be carefully managed to avoid a silting up of senior leadership tiers for several years that might be a consequence.  I acknowledge the input in any such change of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Patrick Donovan.  I understand he will bring forward a Bill later in the session to amend the 2004 Act to extend the retirement age for the majority of pre-2004 public servants to 70 years.  This Bill may provide a timely vehicle for any proposals for change in the retirement arrangements applying to the office of the Garda Commissioner and other senior leadership ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Indeed, the Minister's Bill may provide a timely vehicle for any proposal for change in respect of the retirement arrangements applying to the Office of the Garda Commissioner and other senior leadership ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As regards an interview board and who will manage this process, I reaffirm that this is a matter for the PAS.  Its staff will manage the competition and arrange the selection procedures in conjunction with the Policing Authority.  I expect the advertisement to be placed in national and international newspapers and on appropriate online services within a couple of weeks.  I am keen that the process formally gets under way without undue delay and I suspect it may well be completed within four months of the launch.  I expect the launch to be on or about the date the advertisement is placed.  There will be an accompanying booklet setting out the terms and conditions, and the information regarding the vacant position.  It is important that the successful person be required to implement reforms to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a significant nature.  In the meantime, the enactment of the legislation is necessary to ensure we have the widest pool of candidates for competition.</p><p>With regard to Senator Boyhan's comments, there is no diversionary tactic or ulterior motive other than to ensure a level playing field for those who wish to apply from outside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, those who wish to apply from within, those who wish to apply from within the State or, indeed, persons on the international stage.  I would welcome the passage of all Stages this evening in order that the Policing Authority and the PAS can launch the competition.  They are almost ready to do so and it could well happen within a matter of days.  I hope it will but adhering to a strict timeframe is desirable in view of the time involved for selection processes for senior posts.  Further time may be required in the making of the appointment as well.</p><p>I thank the House for facilitating the process and I look forward to returning-----</p></speech>
