The Minister of State's predecessor, Brian Hayes, who is now an MEP, visited the castle and acknowledged the fact that the local heritage trust in Carlingford was prepared to include visits to it on its heritage trail.  As the Minister of State is aware, Carlingford is a medieval town and, thankfully, many monuments from the past remain in existence there.  Including the castle on the heritage trail would be a major asset to the tourism infrastructure of the town.  I am anxious that work at the castle to facilitate Carlingford Heritage Trust in order that it might include visits to the castle on its heritage trail should recommence as soon as possible.</p></speech>

He has convinced me to be passionate about it as well in the context of wanting the project to be brought to a conclusion.</p> <p>As the Senator is well aware, Carlingford is a very historic town with a number of fine structures, including two national monuments in State care - namely, the historic Mint building and Carlingford Castle, known popularly as King John's Castle and named after Richard the Lionheart's brother.  Even though the castle is named for King John, it was actually built by Hugh de Lacy, a Norman Knight who founded the town of Carlingford.  Construction on the castle started prior to 1186, but there were various additions to the building over the years and many eras of architecture and history are represented.  It is, therefore, an important monument and a significant priority for the Office of Public Works.</p> <p>The castle is, as I have said, a national monument which has been in State care since 1919 and has been managed and maintained by my office since that time.  In the initial period it had limited access, and many of the interiors were not safe, so large parts of it were inaccessible.  A programme of stabilisation work was carried out in the 1950s, which addressed the worst of the problems apparent, but nothing further of a really substantial nature, apart from holding maintenance, has been carried out since then.  More recently, the OPW's national monuments service embarked on a programme of safety works.  The first phase of this, which included the putting in place of a pedestrian walkway around the outside of the castle, was completed in the past few years.  The intention is to carry on with further work to extend the accessible areas and allow visitors to more easily enter the castle site.  A key aspect of the work will involve the careful dismantling of a crucial 19th-century wall and its reconstruction on a new firmer foundation but with the addition of an access door through which members of the public will be able to pass.  This will dramatically improve the position for visitors wanting to get into the Castle in the future.</p> <p>This next phase of the works is a major conservation project and will, as I have said, improve safety, access and presentation of this important historic monument to a significant degree.  A large amount of preparation work, design and careful archaeological investigation and assessment has been carried out.  In 2014 the Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht signed the necessary archaeological consent required under national monuments legislation to allow the work to proceed.  All of the work that has been carried out to date at the castle, though substantial, has essentially been preparatory in nature and has really just set the scene for the major element that is yet to come.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Simon Harris"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Simon Harris"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know Senator Brennan is eager to see that happen.</p><p>As the Senator will appreciate, the National Monuments Service of my office is, like many organisations in recent times, under a significant amount of pressure currently, with demands on scare resources a particular problem at the moment.

The amount of effort involved in bringing this to completion should not be underestimated; this is a large conservation undertaking and works will therefore take some time to finish.  </p><p>I can appreciate fully that the Carlingford Heritage Trust is anxious to exploit the potential that a more easily accessible castle will bring to the area and I am sure that this project, when completed, will bring much visitor and tourism benefit to the town.

I should have acknowledged at the outset the significant works done by the Office of Public Works, OPW, from the 1950s to date and I compliment it on the condition of the castle.  It is great news that the Minister believes works will commence in the summer.  I know the difficulty involved, and restoring the original entrance to the castle will be a phenomenal achievement.

I thank the Senator and the Carlingford Heritage Trust, and indeed the local community of Carlingford who I know hold this castle in such high regard because they, like me, see its potential benefit for Carlingford from a tourism, heritage and economic point of view.  I very much look forward to visiting with the Senator, looking around the historic town of Carlingford and the great benefit the works recommencing in the summer will ultimately bring to the town of Carlingford.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021800002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I am delighted to have him respond and am hoping for a positive outcome, as he gave to Senator Brennan.</p> <p>I refer to the need for the Minister for Social Protection to re-evaluate the eligibility rules related to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance grant for parents in full-time education who are no longer eligible to receive the one parent family payment, and transferring to the back to education allowance, are not currently eligible to keep their maintenance grant, which assists them towards the cost of child care and commuting.</p> <p>As of 2 July this year, any parent on the one-parent family payment with a child aged seven years or above will no longer be eligible for the payment.  That means that lone parents who are currently in full-time education will now need to apply for the back to education allowance, which is granted on a discretionary basis.  Hence, it will be up to individual social welfare officers to decide if these students will be granted this allowance, which will ultimately determine whether they will be able to continue in their studies.  Obviously, being denied this grant would be devastating for anyone who has been working hard towards a degree for years in that they will be forced to drop out of their course.  This is something that we cannot accept and must work towards changing.  Even if they are granted the back to education allowance, they are not currently eligible to receive the SUSI maintenance grant and will only receive the fee portion of the grant.</p> <p>As the Minister is aware, the SUSI grant consists of a student contribution towards the fees and the maintenance grant.  This has been indispensable for the lone parents, of whom 97% are women, to pursue their higher education goals while on the one-parent family payment.  There are many women currently in education full-time on the one parent family payment and when their child moves beyond the age of seven they will be in the midst of the education, and this is impacting on them.  The rate of the maintenance grant ranges from &euro;300 to &euro;5,915 a year and it is based on household income, living distance from the college and the number of children.  It is a grant that has assisted lone parents towards the cost of child care and commuting while they are in full-time education and without that financial support most of these women will be forced out of education.</p> <p>The Minister is here on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection and I ask that reason and common sense take hold here.  Good parenting tells us that children under ten years of age still need minding and cannot be left on their own while their parents are at work or in education.  Their school days are short, and access to affordable after-school places is limited.  That is one of the reasons I have, since the introduction of these changes, opposed the lowering of the age threshold to seven under the one-parent family payment.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has promised that a child care system similar to what is found in Scandinavian countries would be in place before these changes take effect but that has not been acted on.  I know there are movements towards that.  I am very familiar with what is going on in that arena but this is where we are now, and we would all agree that we do not have anywhere near such a Nordic model of child care as a public service in this country.  This is where we are now, and it will impact a number of women.</p> <p>The Minister, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, are sincere when they advocate their support for lone parents to participate in education and training.  I am aware of the reform the T&aacute;naiste has introduced in that regard, but the women I am speaking about have been hit disproportionately harder than any other segment of Irish society.  They are dynamic and they are driven.  They do not want to have to drop out of the education course they are in the midst of because they will no longer get a maintenance grant.  I ask the Minister for a guarantee that the lone parents in full-time education would be granted the back to education allowance, without discretion, and that the rules of the SUSI grant would be adjusted to better facilitate their care duties when they move to the back to education allowance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-18a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021800002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Zappone for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection who is not in a position to attend and who has asked me to deliver a response on her behalf.</p> <p>As the Senator will know, the eligibility rules governing the payment of a student maintenance grant are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills and are set down in its legislation.  In budget 2010, the Department of Education and Skills amended the eligibility criteria for the receipt of the student maintenance grants in respect of persons in receipt of the back to education allowance and the VTOS allowance.  As a result of this amendment people in receipt of the back to education allowance for all schemes, and the VTOS allowance for those pursuing a PLC course, are no longer eligible for a student maintenance grant.  However, the cost of the student service charge and any fees payable to third level colleges may continue to be met by the Exchequer on their behalf.  This applied to all new grant holders from the 2010-11 academic year onwards.</p> <p>With effect from the academic year 2010-11, students entering or progressing to a new course are no longer eligible to hold the back to education allowance together with a student maintenance grant.  These students may continue to apply to be assessed to have the student contribution and any tuition fees paid on their behalf.  The Department of Education and Skills decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the back to education allowance or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represented a duplication of income support payments.</p> <p>In budget 2012, the Department of Social Protection introduced reforms to the one-parent family payment, OFP, in particular the reduction of the age of the youngest child for receipt of such payment to seven years of age.  These changes have been implemented on a phased basis with the final phase due to take place on 2 July 2015 when the age of the youngest child will reduce to seven years for all existing and new one-family payment recipients.  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside the workforce indefinitely and to assist these customers to make their way into employment and financial independence.  All customers who are affected by this reform will be supported by the Department of Social Protection to transition onto an alternative income support payment as appropriate.</p> <p>In regard to the education element, given that there is no work conditionality attached to the one-family payment, recipients of the payment can participate in training and education programmes and are not obliged to inform the Department of Social Protection.  In some cases, such recipients do inform the Department and, where relevant, move to the back to education allowance scheme at the start of the course.  Where entitlement to the payment ceases for these recipients, they can continue, and this is important, to participate in the back to education allowance scheme until their course is completed.  In cases where the customer has not informed the Department of Social Protection, and they are mid-way through their studies, as Senator Zappone outlined, the back to education allowance scheme has been amended to allow them avail of this scheme at mid-course point, assuming that all other relevant qualifying criteria are met.  This allows these customers to complete their course of study while also receiving an income support payment from the Department of Social Protection.  If the customer has received a student grant, they are informed that they are no longer entitled to the maintenance portion of the grant.  They may, however, retain eligibility for the student contribution or tuition fee portion of the grant, if applicable.  The rules that determine payment of the student maintenance grant are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

I am most appreciative of that.  I take it from that, first, that if they are mid-way through their education they can move automatically, as distinct from going through another assessment process.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Katherine Zappone"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Katherine Zappone"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The second point that the Minister of State is saying loud and clear is that it is a matter for the Department of Education and Science and that it has amended its legislation so as not to include the maintenance grant.  That may have been done before these other changes were made by the Department of Social Protection where women are going to be left midway, by 2 July, without maintenance.  We need to take a look at the Department of Education and Science being aware of what has happened in the Department of Social Protection to ensure that these women are able to stay in education which I am sure that is what the Ministers in both Departments would hope for.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has been very consistent in her view that she wants to help people access education, training and the workplace.  The changes that have been made to the back to education allowance scheme allows a customer of the Department of Social Protection who may not have informed, nor were they obliged to inform, someone they were in study, to access the back to education allowance scheme at the mid-point in a course, which is an important change.  It will mean that people who are not in receipt of the back to education allowance, but would qualify for it, can now take it up at mid-point to allow them to complete their course.  I hope that is helpful to the Senator.</p></speech>

I appreciate it very much.  It has come to my attention through local people and some workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann that Bus &Eacute;ireann intends to terminate the bus route 7 from Carrick-on-Suir to Dublin.  The route commences in Clonmel, travels south-east for 13 miles, then north-east to Callan and on to Kilkenny and then to Dublin.  Bus &Eacute;ireann proposes to terminate this service from early March.  No public representatives, to the best of my knowledge, have been contacted by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have had several contacts with Bus &Eacute;ireann through telephone calls and e-mails.  I got one standard reply from a representative of Bus &Eacute;ireann which was basically an announcement.  There was no interaction and a refusal to engage with me to discuss the matter.</p> <p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has a public service obligation and is subsidised annually by &euro;34.5 million of taxpayers' money.  The current service is used by many people from the Carrick-on-Suir area.  The town of Carrick-on-Suir has a population of approximately 6,000 and the number of people who live in its hinterland brings that number up to 10,000.  To the best of my knowledge, Carrick-on-Suir is the only town of its size in the country from which Bus &Eacute;ireann does not provide a service directly to the capital city.  There is also no direct rail link from the town to Dublin.  Instead, one must travel to Limerick Junction, and wait to change trains, which means it takes  three and half hours to get from the town to Dublin.</p> <p>Many people rely on the bus service such as people who work in Kilkenny and those who avail of facilities run by the Camphill community and rehabilitation centres in Grangemockler and Callan that are located along the route.  These people have no other way of travelling every day to their work.  Many people use the route to attend hospital appointments in Dublin, to visit sick people in Dublin, to get to the airport, to attend clinics and to attend social events.  People from my region use the service fairly regularly.  On the Sundays of the All-Ireland championship the bus is packed in Carrick-on-Suir even before it leaves the town and makes its way to what is usually the enemy territory of Kilkenny.  The bus service is very important to the town.  For it to be withdrawn without any discussions or negotiations is completely unacceptable.  How will the people who rely on this bus get to their places of work or the capital city from now on?  Bus &Eacute;ireann has made no provision to replace the service.  In other places Bus &Eacute;ireann has made provision and supplied feeder services.</p> <p>The change in the route is the big query that I have.  The travel time from Clonmel to Carrick-on-Suir, rather than leaving out Carrick-on-Suir, is only 20 minutes.  I do not know how Bus &Eacute;ireann can justify completely cutting off the town.  It is a town of high social deprivation with high unemployment.  We rely on people to come into the town with their income at the weekend.  People use the bus service to go to their places of work in Dublin and spend their income in the town at weekends.  Such expenditure will be affected if the bus service is cut off.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to intervene in this issue even though I know he is not directly responsible for same.  In other parts of the country, when similar cases were brought to the attention of the Minister of the day, common sense prevailed.  In some cases pilot schemes were put in place and some link-up services were put in place.  I have outlined my case to the Minister and await his response.  I thank him for coming to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-18a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015021800002#C00700"><p>I thank Senator Landy for raising this matter.  He has raised it with me on a number of occasions and I am aware of his deep concern about the issue.  I welcome the opportunity to respond to him formally on the floor of the Seanad and I will outline the position.</p> <p>I am very much aware of the importance of this matter.  I am also aware of the concern that this change is causing among the communities to which the Senator has referred.  Last week, I and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, met some residents who live along another part of the route that the Senator referred to in order to discuss this issue with them. </p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the National Transport Authority has responsibility at national level for securing the provision of public passenger land transport services.   This includes the provision of subvented bus and rail services by Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail.  The National Transport Authority also licenses commercial bus passenger services.  Under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the National Transport Authority assumed responsibility for the regulation of commercial bus passenger services.  These services were previously regulated by my Department under the Road Transport Act 1932.  The Act obliges all operators to be licensed if they are providing public bus passenger services, and it is applied equally to both private and public bus companies.</p> <p>Public service obligation, PSO, services covered by public service contracts do not fall within the licensing system.  Commercial bus services are licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and in line with the NTA's published guidelines for the licensing of public bus passenger services.  The guidelines are published on the NTA website.  The guidelines were prepared in accordance with the detailed provisions set out in section 23 of the 2009 Act.</p> <p>Where operators apply to withdraw or curtail commercial bus services, and this goes to the heart of one of the questions posed by the Senator, the NTA will grant such amendments as it has no legislative powers to refuse them.  In such circumstances the NTA may examine whether, in the absence of any commercial services, a PSO exists to provide socially necessary but commercially unviable public transport services.  Such examination will include an assessment of the demand for public transport services and options either to reconfigure existing PSO services or to tender competitively for the provision of services.  In either event, the NTA's ability to provide such services is subject to the availability of funding.</p> <p>As to the specific issue of the funding of substitute services, I am acutely aware of the concerns of many people regarding recent decisions to withdraw licensed commercial services to a number of intermediate locations on major routes into Dublin, including route 7 from Carrick-on- Suir.  Major improvements to the national roads network on the M9 motorway have provided the opportunity for commercial bus operators to offer improved journey times between Dublin and regional cities in particular.  What has happened is Bus &Eacute;ireann and other commercial bus operators have sought to amend their licences accordingly with the consequent effect of reducing the level of service provided to a number of intermediate locations on the network.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Paschal Donohoe"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Paschal Donohoe"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The NTA has indicated that it will examine options either to reconfigure existing PSO services or to tender competitively for the provision of services to those areas affected by the changes.  I should add that I gave a commitment to avoid further reductions in PSO funding, and for the first time since 2008, the level of funding for bus and rail services is being maintained in 2015 at the same level as in 2014.  I will continue to liaise with the NTA on the issues involved.  I also recently secured &euro;110 million for public transport as part of the 2014 Supplementary Estimate for my Department, which included &euro;45 million for Irish Rail's network renewal investment and &euro;50 million for bus renewal for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I assure the Senator that I will be examining this issue further in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that I have been in contact with him on a number of occasions.  There is a bit of ducks and drakes going on here.  I have a letter that is the only correspondence I got from Bus &Eacute;ireann even though I wrote to it at least five times and probably tried to ring it ten times.  It says that it can confirm that it has accepted an offer of a revised schedule of services for route 7 from the NTA and is in discussions with its drivers.  It seems that Bus &Eacute;ireann is putting the onus on the NTA when the Minister's reply shows that it is Bus &Eacute;ireann that should be going to the NTA to change its routes and to see whether this is acceptable.  I am delighted the Minister will take a personal interest in this and will examine it further.  Could the Minister facilitate a meeting for me with the NTA - regardless of whether it involves the Minister as well - to flesh this out and get clarity on it?  We will pursue it.  It is saying it will change by the beginning of March so we do not have too much time but I will be in further contact with the Minister about it.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that we have this debate here because it is a really important issue.  The Senator already knows that it is a complicated and challenging issue.  A big contributory factor to this is the fact that as our national motorway network has been upgraded - the M9 is the particular motorway that has contributed to this - the bus operators want to make use of that improved network to service more people.  A consequence of that is that people who are not located immediately adjacent to that motorway or who are in places with lower population densities than larger towns or cities are now facing the consequence of that decision.  That is a core cause of what is happening here.</p> <p>I understand very clearly that the availability of public transport or, more broadly, communal transport, be it operated by a private bus operator or public company, provides essential connectivity to people.  A challenge that must be responded to is how that kind of connectivity can be delivered given that national routes have been upgraded and bus companies are understandably looking to make use of them.  I cannot tell the Senator that I have an immediate answer to this but I can assure him that the NTA, which is the regulatory body in this area and does excellent work managing competing demands from what are often scarce resources, is examining the matter to see if a response is possible.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have an interest in this matter and I will be contacting and working with the NTA to see if a response can be put in place to respond to the needs articulated by the Senator.  I assure him that I will certainly keep him abreast of this because I know it is a charged matter.  I met a resident recently who explained to me that if the changes were to go ahead, she did not know how she was going to get into work.  That is a legitimate concern for somebody to have.  I have only have a fixed amount of money and while we are in a better position than we were a year ago and an even better position than we were the year before that, it is still a fixed amount of money.  I have growing demand and am trying to figure out how we can bridge that gap.  The NTA is looking at this matter.  I will keep in contact with the NTA about it and I assure the Senator that I will keep him fully aware of and updated regarding any developments in this area.</p></speech>

This matter concerns the need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish an environmental ombudsman office to deal with complaints made against the EPA.  This stems from a number of sources.  It goes back to the report commissioned by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the previous Government, John Gormley.  In fairness, it was a very comprehensive review undertaken by John McCarthy.  It said that serious legislative change was needed to make the EPA more accountable and effective.  It said that under the legislation covering it, the EPA had blanket statutory immunity when carrying out its functions.  The report said that this was very difficult to justify in a modern context because there should be no need for that kind of statutory immunity if the EPA is carrying out its job and functions correctly.  What is it afraid of?  I do not see why it should be afraid of litigation if it has done everything in the right order.  Perhaps that is the crux of the problem.  That report also said that it would be appropriate for the agency to be brought under the remit of the Ombudsman in respect of any alleged maladministration.<br/><br/>I raised the matter of an environmental ombudsman with the director of the EPA, Laura Burke, when she attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last November.  That stemmed from an interview with Ms Burke when she took over, which I read.  It alarmed me because when she took over, she said she wanted to reposition the agency to support economic growth and move away from the perception that it was purely an environmental watchdog or policeman.  She did say that Irish businesses were broadly compliant.  I do not know what kind of statement that was.  Was she referring to investors who are not Irish and who might not be compliant?  That investigation also noted concern among stakeholders at the apparently low level of prosecutions being taken.  At the time, the director general said:<blockquote>What you don't want to do is go racing to prosecute.  What you look at is guidance for the sector, you put in a proper licensing regime, you then do audits, inspections, etc, and you give businesses a chance to put in rectifying measures.  And in the context of companies not delivering on their side of licensing, then you go to prosecutions, but enforcement is much more than prosecution.</blockquote>That to me gave <i>carte blanche</i>to any investor and told them that the EPA is open for business, that they could do what they wanted and that the EPA would not be heavy-handed with regard to any regulation.  It seemed a bit lax and light touch.  We have seen where light-touch regulation got this country in the past.  When it comes to investment and investment in jobs, this Government's mantra has been that it is all about jobs.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Heffernan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on James Heffernan"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on James Heffernan"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where I come from, there is a plant called Aughinish Alumina, which employs approximately 250 people.  While it is great that we have those jobs in the county, the EPA should not be facilitating jobs for the sake of jobs or economic growth if human health comes second.  This may be what is happening.  When I questioned the director general of the EPA about whether the agency would have an argument against falling under the Ombudsman legislation, she said &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;  She stated:<blockquote><br /><br />In drafting the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government engaged extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Attorney General on this issue to achieve an acceptable legislative wording to enable administrative procedures to fall within the legislation, but excluding the quasi-judicial function of the EPA.  A satisfactory form of wording was not finalised so the EPA remains exempt for the purpose of the Act.  However, we have no objection to falling within that Act.</blockquote>Is it that there has not been enough capital investment to create such an office?  There certainly is a need for an office of the ombudsman for the EPA when decisions have to be questioned.  This is so people will not have to go to the High Court, Supreme Court and elsewhere.  There should be an ombudsman's office to protect people.</p></speech>

The effect of the Act is that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can, by regulation, provide that entities be included under the remit of the Ombudsman.<br/><br/>I am advised that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, under whose remit the Environmental Protection Agency rests, had communicated to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that it wished to see the administrative functions of the EPA included in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2012, but that the substance of licensing, regulation and enforcement be excluded, on the grounds that such decisions are quasi-judicial and highly technical.  In any event, there are separate review and appeals structures governing these functions.  As an acceptable form of wording could not be devised, the EPA was placed on the list of exempted agencies, as outlined in the Second Schedule to the Act.<br/><br/>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government fully endorses the recommendation of the independent review of the EPA, which was completed in 2011 by a panel of experts from across the main areas connected to the work of the agency.  It stated the &quot;EPA should be subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in respect of alleged maladministration&quot;.<br/><br/>In considering oversight by the Ombudsman, the review was positive about the possible impact of the EPA coming within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, as follows:<blockquote>The Group concluded that the EPA should be subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  This development would provide a free, independent complaint mechanism in the case of alleged maladministration by the EPA.  The availability of such an avenue of redress would serve to increase accountability and transparency and underpin public confidence in the EPA.</blockquote>However, the executive summary of the review stated clearly, &quot;Given its quasi-judicial role in respect of licensing and the technical environmental expertise required, it would not be appropriate for the substance of decisions taken by the EPA to be subject to such review.&quot;  It should also be borne in mind that EPA decisions may also be challenged in the courts by way of judicial review.<br/><br/>It remains the Department's position that the administrative functions of the EPA should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, once a satisfactory mechanism for this outcome has been developed.  However, for the reasons outlined by the independent review group, the substance of the EPA's decisions in areas of licensing, regulation and enforcement should be excluded from the Ombudsman's remit.<br/><br/>It is not proposed to establish a new agency in the form of an environment ombudsman's office, as suggested by the Senator.  Indeed, this Government has put considerable time and effort into reducing the number of State bodies as part of the public sector reform process.  For example, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has reduced the number of agencies under its remit from 22 to 11, including the successfully completed merger of the former Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland with the EPA in 2014.<br/><br/>The Department will continue to work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to agree an appropriate mechanism for bringing the administrative functions of the EPA under the remit of the existing Office of the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

It is what I heard previously from the director general of the EPA, namely, that an acceptable form of wording could not be found.

The documents states: "Notwithstanding this clause the licensee is prohibited from commencing deposition of process residues in [...] in advance of an agreed security being in place."

In that context, I do not know whether the Leader has received an indication regarding whether the Minister is going to provide an update on the gambling control Bill, which was supposed to be introduced in conjunction with the former.  Last week the Minister gave a commitment to seek an update on the current status of the gambling control Bill.  These two items of legislation should have been dealt with together, but that has not proven to be the case.  I know the Leader shares my concerns with regard to this matter.</p> <p>What is the position in respect of the education (admission to school) Bill?  This Bill was originally scheduled to be published in 2014 but the Government legislation programme indicates that it is due for publication this year.  Only the heads of the Bill have been published.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, was intent on bringing about some degree of standardisation with regard to school enrolment policies and in terms of what constitutes a catchment area.  I agree with what the previous Minister was trying to do because it is very important.  This week, thousands of children in Dublin and, I am sure, throughout the remainder of the country will receive letters refusing them entry to primary schools for a variety of reasons.  Parents find it increasingly frustrating that schools' enrolment policies differ from each other.  For example, a child might be higher up the ladder in terms of eligibility for enrolment in one school and lower down in respect of another.  In addition, schools can arbitrarily redraw their catchment areas in any given year.  A school can decide to expand its catchment area when it wants to increase pupil numbers and retain teaching posts but reduce it when the requirement is to keep numbers static.  It is impossible for parents and children to manage in such circumstances.  The education (admission to school) Bill was promised almost three years ago.  It would, in my view, facilitate an important reform in the area of education.  I accept that she may have done so but I certainly have not heard the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, mention it once.  I am of the view that there is an opportunity for her to introduce the Bill in order that the Second Stage debate might proceed.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to discover what is the current status of the Bill.</p></speech>

There has been a good deal of commentary in respect of this particularly heinous attack, which is the subject of an ongoing Garda operation.  Yesterday, a number of colleagues raised the issue of crime.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is due to begin its hearings on gangland crime at 2.30 p.m.  If colleagues have an interest in that matter or in ways in which the Government and legislators can take action, then perhaps they might consider attending.</p> <p>I welcome the passage through the Seanad last night of the Gender Recognition Bill after lengthy but very constructive Committee Stage and Report Stage debates, to which many colleagues contributed.  I wish to place on record the importance of the Government's introducing the Bill in the Seanad.  In fact, the Government put forward some significant amendments on foot of the debates which took place here.  I refer, in particular, to the amendment which will ensure that the legislation is reviewed two years after its enactment.  It is clear that any changes identified during that review will be made.  The Bill is progressive and it is long overdue, and we can be pleased that the Seanad had quite an impact on it.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, in respect of a &euro;300 million housing investment programme which will be jointly supported by the European Investment Bank and the Housing Finance Agency.  I am sure Senator Hayden will have more to say on this matter.  This is the first ever support provided in respect of housing in Ireland by the European Investment Bank.  This is an extremely welcome and major investment which will facilitate the construction of an additional 2,000 social housing units in the next three years.</p></speech>

There are serious questions to be asked in respect of this matter.  How did the criminal in question, who escaped and who some years ago was serving 22 life sentences in England before absconding, arrive in Ireland in the first instance?  Where did he get the knife he used in his escape?  Did he bring it with him from the prison?  If the answer is in the affirmative, then serious questions arise.  How is it that Irish taxpayers are paying for this man to be imprisoned in this jurisdiction?  I would be quite happy if he were returned to Britain serve his life sentences at Her Majesty's pleasure.  Why was an armed garda not tasked with accompanying this very dangerous prisoner to hospital?  Two prisoner officers were obliged to undergo surgery after he attacked them and another was seriously traumatised.  What would be the position if a member of staff at the hospital had been badly injured?  That could easily have happened.  There are major questions to be asked about how this particular prisoner managed to escape and why no armed protection was provided for the prison officers who accompanied him to hospital.  I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Minister for Justice and Equality should come before the House to make a statement on this matter.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on "/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on "/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For logistical reasons and because the prisoner is still at large, there are the operational difficulties in this regard, but she could make a statement to assuage the fears in this House and among the public.  There is deep concern, not alone throughout Dublin but throughout the country, that such a dangerous criminal is at large.</p><p>It may not be facilitated in the other House, but I also ask the Leader whether the Assaults on Emergency Workers Bill 2012, which was geared at protecting prison officers, firemen, etc., and which was introduced in the other House by Deputy Niall Collins, could be looked at again by the Government.  The Bill included measures to protect prison officers, firemen and front-line service staff.  It is an important issue.  It is so urgent that the Minister should come in here today, even for 30 minutes, to make a statement on this incident.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the reference by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in his budget speech to zoned and serviced land.  In fact, following that, he has launched a public consultation on the potential of taxation measures to encourage the development of zoned and serviced land.  In that regard, interested parties are invited to submit their views on the potential of taxation.  The measure is designed to encourage the development of land.  People should be aware that the consultation will run for 12 weeks, from 16 February until 8 May, this year.  We face much dereliction all over the place.  In the interests of many sectors, particularly housing within cities, it needs to happen.</p> <p>There was mention of the Living City initiative.  Those Senators who are from Dublin would know more about that than I would.  If we are to provide for renewal and regeneration, a scheme, - similar to the wonderful scheme introduced by a previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government, which enjoyed cross-party support - with proper rationale and for a limited period, and not left open-ended, would be put to proper use by those who own zoned and serviced land.  The sooner that is tackled, the better.  Primarily, I want to advertise the fact that there is a public consultation period and that interested parties should avail of it.  Hopefully, as a result of it, a good scheme will evolve.</p></speech>

It is essential that the Minister come to the House.  I do not think she has said anything about it - certainly, there is nothing that I can find on the record.  The prisoner concerned arrived in this country in 2012 after escaping from prison across the water in England, where he was serving 22 life sentences.  We have been left with him.  The Government has not protected the public from him.  There is a lack of resources in the Prison Service and in the Garda, and the Government has let this man free and loose on the people of Ireland.  That is what has happened.  The people are angry about it.  On that basis, I support Senator O'Donovan's amendment.</p> <p>This is a serious public order issue.  It is a serious issue which affects the health, safety and welfare of the people of Ireland.  This man is on the loose.  The Government has put him on the loose.  The Minister should tell us what she is doing to get him back into jail and back across the water where he belongs in the worse jail in England.</p></speech>

We all will be aware of the difficult situation we are in at present, with almost 90,000 households on the housing waiting list.  It is something the Government inherited.  I am not trying to say it was entirely the previous Government's problem; of course it was not.  We faced a major international financial crisis.  We are turning the corner on that crisis, and it is good to see - particularly for the voluntary housing association sector, which has had difficulty in accessing finance - that it will be an important pillar in the social housing strategy.  The voluntary housing association sector, notably organisations such as Cl&uacute;id, which was involved in this announcement today, is active in the local community.  My colleague Senator Paul Coghlan would be happy to know that this announcement was made in Killarney Court, which is in Dublin but is named after his town of origin.  It is good news and I believe it would be welcomed by both sides of the House.  It is one step on the way towards the recovery of social housing in this country.</p></speech>

The company has now been joined, believe it or not, by IBEC and the US Chamber of Commerce in threatening the Government of this country on legislation that passed through this House which mandates plain packaging for cigarettes.  I am merely putting down another marker that I hope that this will stiffen the Government's resolve.  To use American parlance directed at the US Chamber of Commerce and IBEC, "Butt out, guys."  It is the right of the Parliament of this country to pass legislation that we believe is in the best interests of the health of the nation, and to suggest that there will be some loss of tax revenue as a result completely ignores the significant amounts spent on the health service as a consequence of smokers suffering and, sadly, dying of lung cancer.  I am keeping it on the agenda.  I hope that the Leader will continue to convey the stiff resolve of this House, as reflected last year in the passage of the Bill, to ensure that the Bill goes through the lower House.</p> <p>I also propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, come before the House to explain the Government's policy on child care costs.  Yesterday, we heard from over 2,000 volunteers and others employed on miserly wages in the child care sector from all parts, including my part, of the country.  Here, I declare an interest in that I am chairperson in a voluntary capacity of the County Leitrim Childcare Committee and I am, in a sense, at the coalface of what is going on in child care in my county.  I do not profess to be an expert in it, but I know that what they were out there complaining about yesterday is a valid and legitimate cause.  It is extraordinary that people who have gone through the education system and attained qualifications up to third level are being paid &euro;10 an hour, which is just above the minimum wage.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  There is a desperate need for increased investment in child care in this country.  We spend approximately 0.2% of GDP on this area, when the OECD average is 0.7%.  That figure applies right across European countries, although the spend of some of those countries is much higher than that.  We also have the highest child care costs, along with the United States, which is an unenviable position for this country to be in.  The child care costs imposed on hard-pressed parents in this country are 40% higher than average.  Many such parents have had to leave the workforce because they cannot afford child care, which is also not in the best interests of society in general, apart altogether from the economy.  For that and other reasons, it is vital that the Minister come before the House today to outline what the Government will do in response to the legitimate issues that were raised by the rally yesterday.</p></speech>

My message to IBEC is clear.  We are spending &euro;260 million a week in health care in this country.  That budget will continue to increase because of the requirement for us to deal with the issues that arise as a result of people smoking.  If they want to increase taxation, let them come out and state that they are in agreement with the raising of taxation on the business sector to pay for our abandonment of the plain packaging policy for cigarettes.  We have taken the correct decision on this, and if we must face court challenges on it, let us do so.  IBEC should not be putting out a view that is not in the best interests of Irish people.</p> <p>I refer to the issue of taxation on land which is lying idle and which has infrastructure.  It is fine to talk about taxation, but one of our biggest current problems in the housing market is the lack of finance for the building sector.  There is a significant problem.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Colm Burke"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Colm Burke"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I had experience of it when acting for someone.  We looked to the banks for finance, but they told us that they were unprepared to entertain anything involving the building industry.  We can apply all of the taxation we like on land that is lying idle, but until finance is made available to the industry to start the process of building so that we might meet our housing targets each year, we will go nowhere.  We should start to examine this issue and hold a debate on determining the best way forward.  We will address social housing, but we must also consider how to finance the building of houses in the private sector.</p></speech>

Yesterday, there was a protest on the matter outside Leinster House.  A number of issues are at play.  Child care provision is a major issue for many families and the lack of State-provided child care services means that a large number of low-paid people are not getting the support they need, presenting a barrier to many women returning to the labour market.  According to the report of the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, that was published on Monday, 30% of a family's income is spent on child care.  That is a large amount of disposable income.  It is becoming a major issue and is one of the reasons for income and economic inequality in the State, given the fact that we do not invest in public services or child care.  It was not that long ago that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection stated that she would hold off on cutting the income disregard for the one-parent family allowance until there had been proper investment in community child care.  The cuts went ahead, but the investment in child care did not.</p> <p>Many people working in the child care sector are in receipt of low pay.  In the Leader's city of Waterford, people who were working full-time at a child care centre for &euro;250 per week were asked to take a 5% pay cut because of cutbacks.  This is the reality for many low-paid workers in the sector.  They do the courses, many have degrees and they take up jobs to provide a good and necessary service, but they are on low pay.  A range of issues need to be considered.</p></speech>

This week, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, announced a &euro;5.4 million increase in the national ambulance service's budget to help address service gaps in the area.  Provision has been made for 50 paramedic posts in the west, some of which will be used to staff ambulance stations at Tuam and Mulranny and others of which will assist in the move from on-call to on-duty rostering.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced new arrangements to support rural schools, including some smaller schools in County Galway, via better teacher retention thresholds.  Both announcements are positive news for rural Ireland.  As our economy improves, it is imperative that serious consideration be given to the value of developing our rural communities.</p></speech>

I support the argument on rural development presented at the tail end of Senator Naughton's contribution.  We are in the latter part of the Government's term of office and cannot expect miracles at this late stage, but the concept of rural and regional affairs is worthy of more detailed consideration.  Some time ago, I suggested to the Leader that we would try to hold a debate on regional Ireland from the perspective of industry, planning and housing.  The future of rural Ireland would also form part of the debate.</p> <p>The proposed development of social housing was mentioned.  I welcome it and spoke on the subject last week.  It is essential that we have a well-devised and well-crafted plan for social housing.  It is also important that the House hold the debate on housing policy for which a number of us asked last week.  While every additional social housing unit is not just necessary but welcome, we must be careful about the design, style and concept of social housing.  We do not want to repeat some of the mistakes made in the 1960s and 1970s when our approach to social housing caused a great deal of social difficulty, including the unfortunate near ghettoisation of certain communities.  The investment announced for social housing must be welcomed, but we need to debate and make suggestions on how to proceed with a social housing plan for our people.  In conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Leader might attempt to arrange a debate at their earliest convenience.</p></speech>

It means a great deal to the parents and students of those schools, which saw themselves as being under threat in recent times.  In my area, St. Teresa's primary school in Killure near Ballinasloe will remain a two-teacher school for the 2015-16 school year.  The school at Laurencetown, Ballinasloe, will remain a three-teacher school.  I also welcome the decision to change the threshold to 15 pupils for schools that are more than 5 km from a school of similar patronage.  This will help the Church of Ireland school at Aughrim, Ballinasloe, and is good news for everyone involved.</p> <p>This proves that the Government is listening to Oireachtas Members who have referred to the need to ensure that the fabric of life in rural Ireland is maintained.  The recent appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for rejuvenating rural development is to be welcomed.  I join Senator Bradford in calling for a full and frank debate on how to ensure that the quality of life in rural Ireland is enhanced in the years ahead.</p></speech>

There is no more appropriate day than Ash Wednesday on which to speak of the introduction of plain packaging.  I agree with Senator Burke's point about IBEC and the cost added by smoking-related illnesses to the &euro;260 million per week that we spend on health care.  It beggars belief and is deplorable that IBEC and the American Chamber of Commerce would support a global cigarette company in this way.</p></speech>

It is unsavoury and inappropriate, to say the least.</p> <p>On a more minor issue, I was glad to read this morning that on-street chuggers - charity muggers, those people who collect for charities by using inventive measures, to put it mildly, to ask people on the street for direct debits - will be subject to new regulations under which they will be required to hold permits.  Permits are required on the streets of Dublin for far less, including busking.  Where a person is handing over banking details to someone on the street, it is appropriate that the transaction be regulated to some extent.  Charities would welcome this, as would I, given the fact that I called for it approximately two years ago.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that it was initially intended that the Betting (Amendment) Bill and the gambling control Bill would be run fairly closely together.  Unfortunately, however, that is not the case.  We will await the Minister's pronouncement on that matter when dealing with the Betting (Amendment) Bill later today.  As regards the education (admission to schools) Bill, I will try to ascertain the current situation and will revert to the Senator.</p><p>Senators Bacik, O'Donovan and Byrne extended good wishes to the prison officers who were seriously injured yesterday by a very dangerous person.  As we know, that person had been convicted of many offences in the UK.  I agree with Senator O'Donovan that a thorough investigation should take place.  My understanding is that it is a current ongoing Garda operation and, consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to attend the House to discuss the matter at this stage.  What occurred yesterday highlights for us the work of the Prison Service which goes unnoticed by many people.  Prison staff do tremendous work which is very dangerous.  We should be grateful to these men and women who work in difficult circumstances.</p><p>I agree that quite a number of questions need to be answered in this regard, including why it was decided that no armed guard would accompany this dangerous man.  Such questions will form part of the ongoing Garda investigation.  It is to be hoped this man will be apprehended in the coming weeks.  He has many sentences yet to serve in the UK, as he also escaped from a prison there.  That highlights the danger this man poses.  I agree that, if possible, those sentences should be served in the other jurisdiction.</p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to proposed tax measures to encourage the use of zoned and serviced land and derelict sites.  As he pointed out, there is a public consultation on this issue for the next 12 weeks.  He also mentioned the living cities initiative, which was discussed in the Finance Bill.  At that time, the Minister said he had expected that initiative to be in place by February.  They were awaiting the go-ahead from Europe for that incentive and I hope that is still the situation.  The initiative would be of tremendous benefit to Dublin and other cities in the scheme.</p><p>Senator Hayden welcomed the &euro;300 million from the European Investment Bank and the Housing Finance Agency to the voluntary housing sector.  This area needed such an injection of cash which will go towards building 2,000 extra homes.  It is good news for all concerned in the sector.  Senator Bradford also raised the housing question.  I have invited the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to attend the House to discuss the housing strategy.  I hope that will happen in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Senators Mooney and Noone referred to the perceived support of the tobacco industry by IBEC and the American Chamber of Commerce.  It is Government policy that plain packaging will come into play.  The Government is intent not to bow to pressure from the American Chamber of Commerce, IBEC or anybody else.  As was pointed out yesterday, this House voted unanimously for the introduction of plain packaging of tobacco products.  We will have legal threats from that sector, but the Government intends to proceed as planned.</p><p>Senators Mooney and Cullinane also raised the question of child care workers.  There is definitely a need for greater investment in this sector.  As I said yesterday, quite a number of professionals have spent three or four years in college, yet the payscales are very low for such qualified people.  I am sure that is one of the areas the low pay commission will be investigating.  We might be able to get the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, to attend the House for a debate on the child care sector.  I think many Members would appreciate having such a discussion.</p><p>Senator Naughton referred to increased funding for the National Ambulance Service, particularly in the west.  That will be welcomed by everyone in rural areas.  In addition, Senator Naughton, along with Senator Mullins, sought support for small rural schools, an issue that has been raised in this House on many occasions.  I am glad the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has listened to those concerns and has acted upon suggestions made by many Senators and Members of the other House.</p><p>Senator Bradford raised the question of rural and regional affairs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, has attended the House for a debate on the CEDRA report, so perhaps we can invite her back for a debate on rural and regional affairs.  There are many good news stories which need to be told, so I will invite the Minister of State back again. </p><p>Senator Noone mentioned regulations on what are called charity muggers.  The regulation of all such activities is necessary and will be welcomed by all concerned.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned the education (admission to schools) Bill, the drafting of which is well advanced.  A further item for inclusion in the Bill was recently prepared for Cabinet approval.  The Bill will be published by the end of the summer.</p></speech>

Before we commence, I remind Senators that they may only speak once on Report Stage except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Also on Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded.  Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Senators O'Brien, Byrne and other Fianna F&aacute;il Senators and arises out of committee proceedings.</p></speech>

This amendment calls for the Government to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of the enactment of the Act, which we support, a report on the measures which will be undertaken to protect vulnerable people from engaging in harmful gambling and the manner in which remote betting intermediaries must assist in this.  When the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, was in this House last week, we sought an update on the Gambling Control Bill and its progress and we were given a commitment on it.  This is crucially important.  I know Senator Cummins, as Leader of the House, agrees that we were hoping for both Bills to be introduced in tandem.  The amendment is clear and makes sense.  I will not delay the House on that basis.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Darragh O'Brien"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Darragh O'Brien"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like Minister of State to advise the status of, and the progress that has been made on, the gambling control Bill.</p></speech>

I share the Senator's concerns regarding the gambling control Bill.  It was intended that it would be introduced in parallel with the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  I am aware it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality but it is not leading to the spirit that was intended in respect of them in our not having them running fairly close together.  I hope the Minister of State might be able to throw some light on that in regard to the gambling control Bill.</p> <p>This Betting (Amendment) Bill fails to introduce even the most basic social protection measures such as those found in other regulated jurisdictions whereby online operators are obliged to provide time-out facilities and allow players to set a maximum time limit for gambling purposes before they commence play.  Such measures would be a fundamental licensing requirement in other jurisdictions.  While this Bill is worthy of support, the heavy hitting in terms of the backup measures that are required will come in the gambling control Bill .  I am disappointed that it has not been advanced to such a stage where we could immediately move on to discuss it within the next number of weeks.  That is obviously not going to happen, but I would hope it could be enacted this year.  If more resources are required in order to deal with the framing and drafting of it, they should be put in place because of its importance for people to have such a Bill in place.  I am sympathetic towards the Senator's amendment and I await the Minister's response as to whether he can accede to it.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is fully in agreement on the need to provide protection for consumers and the supervision of operators providing online betting services is a first step in this direction.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill puts in place a regulatory system for the remote sector, including betting intermediaries, who, up until this point, have been unregulated.  The Bill provides that in order to offer betting services in this jurisdiction, a remote betting operator or betting intermediary must first secure a certificate of personal fitness from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This certificate of personal fitness determines whether a person is a qualified person to hold a remote bookmaker's or betting intermediary's licence and, together with the possession of tax clearance certificate and the payment of the appropriate licence fee, the certificate must be presented to the Revenue Commissioners to allow them to then issue a licence.</p> <p>The Bill also includes specific grounds for the refusal or revocation of a certificate of personal fitness, including where a person stands convicted of an offence under specified Acts in Ireland or elsewhere, relating to the conduct of gambling where an applicant who has previously held a bookmaker's licence has in the past refused to pay sums due or conducted the business in a disorderly manner, or where an applicant is not a fit or proper person under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  In addition, the Bill specifically provides for the extension to the remote sector of the prohibition on taking a bet or engaging in a betting transaction with a person under the age of 18.  Up until this point there has been no regulation of this area.</p> <p>As the Minister said in earlier debates during the passage of this legislation, the introduction of this Bill is an interim measure pending the enactment of the gambling control Bill.  One of the fundamental principles underpinning the gambling control Bill is the protection of minors and other vulnerable persons.  That Bill will make clear the responsibilities of licensed operators when it comes to ensuring that these persons are not permitted to access gambling services.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be responsible for the monitoring of the activities of operators in this regard.  </p> <p>I am conscious that Senator Darragh O'Brien and others have sought an update on the position regarding the gambling control Bill.  The Government approved the general scheme of that Bill in July 2013.  I am informed that the scheme is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and awaiting formal drafting.  However, Senators will appreciate that a significant body of priority legislation dealing with societal issues, piloted by the Minister for Justice and Equality, is already scheduled for the Oireachtas in this term, including the amendment of the Constitution (marriage equality referendum) Bill, the Children and Family Relationships Bill, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  Accordingly, it is not possible to say when the gambling control legislation will be published but I certainly will convey to the Minister the comments of the Leader of the House and Senator O'Brien in terms of the view that this legislation needs to be seen as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I pressed an amendment to this Bill last week to provide that warnings would be issued by Government on all gambling and betting outlets.  My colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, brought to the Seanad's attention the number of gambling machines that are available in betting offices.  I heard today that a public house in the south east, well away from the Leader's constituency, now has a mini bookie office on its premises.  I read some of the research on this area and this has particular resonance for the Minister for Finance.  As much  &euro;27.3 million being lost annually as a result of gaming machines.</p> <p>I related two stories here last week.  One is the case of parents who found their son had raised debts of &euro;15,000 through gambling.  The other case is that of a married man who had lost &euro;80,000 in the space of six weeks and was going home to face his wife.  That man came in here and asked to see me.  I did not know him, I do not know why he came here and why he asked to see me other than that he said I had recently been elected and he saw my name.</p> <p>It strikes me that the Betting (Amendment ) Bill 2013 is more about revenue raising than anything else.  There is not one sinew of social care, social justice or social protection to be found in that Bill.  I understand the purpose behind it and that when the amendment to the Bill was drafted, it was not possible to include it in it.  The amendment put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il today is the best I could possibly hope for in light of what I heard last week.</p> <p>I wonder where the power is in this country behind gambling and why it is that we are afraid to confront this issue.  When I turn on my television at night, I am invited to play bingo, roulette and every other game under the sun.  I get constant messages through Facebook and Twitter inviting me to engage in some form of online gambling.  Last week, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien told us about how she had registered simply to see how the system works and when she attempted to deregister from an online site, she got a plethora of e-mails and messages demanding to know why she wanted to leave it.  We cannot afford to sit back and wait for the promised Bill.  I cannot see a way that Bill will ever see the light of day in the life of this Government.  The only way we can provide some form of protection is through this Bill.  I commend Fianna F&aacute;il on putting forward this amendment in light of the fact that my amendment was defeated last week. </p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to consider two actions.  The first is that he would genuinely consider including the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment but, more importantly, I want the Department of Finance, given that it controls Revenue, to start getting Revenue to do the job it is paid to do.  I want every gambling house and betting shop in this country raided.  I want Revenue to go out and find the  illegal machines that are in place.  I understand there are gaming machines on which a VAT rate of 1% is paid when a rate of 23% should be paid on them.  I want that to be examined.  I do not have to walk more than two miles to where I can see a few hundred machines that are in use all day every day that no longer takes coins but take notes.  This is outrageous.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Families are being destroyed.  Let us consider what wives are told.  The man who came to see me haunts me.  I have thought of him going home to his wife and asking her to sit down because there is something he has to tell her.  This haunts me because in 1983 when my business went bust, I had to walk out of the Bank of Ireland at 43 Eyre Square, go home to my wife and ask her to sit down because there was something I had to tell her.  I had to tell her that I had lost not alone the business but our home and everything we owned as a result of a bad business venture.  I had never backed anything much in my life, but I had backed a business that went wrong.  I think of the pain and suffering that my wife went through at the time.</p> <p>Now let us consider that in the context of the nonsense of gambling.  Let us suppose I had taken the money and put it on a horse, a roulette wheel or whatever.  I may have had to explain to my family that I had destroyed their lives, lost their home and all of their assets.  The man in question told me about getting up in the middle of the night to get his smartphone for a couple of shots on the roulette wheel.  I asked him whether it was the excitement of waiting for the win.  He said that, in truth, the excitement passed the moment the bet was laid.  He said he never cared whether he won or lost, it was a question of laying the bet.  Waking up in the middle of the night to lay a bet is bad form.  I call on the Minister of State to take on board Senator O'Brien's amendment and to amend the Bill.  We need to do something urgently.</p></speech>

We had a good debate last week when a different Minister of State was in the House.  We are trying to improve this legislation.  Long before Senator Craughwell was elected, I and Senator Cummins had been raising issues about the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  We wanted this legislation before the House for a variety of reasons.  It is not, as some people have suggested, to create a nanny state in any way, shape or form.  One of the reasons we sought to have the Bill relates to the betting side.  It would provide some controls, bring extra funds to the Exchequer and provide a level playing pitch for independent bookmakers.  They are closing every week throughout the country.  It would give them an opportunity to stand up against the multiples.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The response he gave, however, related strictly to betting rather than gambling.  I know this Bill will regularise online betting but it does not do the same for online gambling or for the gambling machines to which Senator Craughwell adverted.  We reckon there are approximately 6,780 of these machines in the country.  The machines are not necessarily the problem.  If someone is placing a bet, I would rather he did so at a bookies.  People working in local bookie's shops know their punters.  They can decide, for example, that a person has done enough on a given day and should not put on another bet.  However, that cannot be done online.</p> <p>Last week, I raised a matter with the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  Bookies shops are now operating roulette wheels, virtual betting and virtual racing.

Let us consider all the various screens in bookie's shops, or roulette wheels with maximum bets of &euro;100 per number.  People can go into a card club or casino.  I had hoped the gambling Bill would be introduced to regularise that sector and allow a public element in casinos.  It is ridiculous that they are set up as private clubs.  We could regularise that sector better.  At least if a person goes into one of those establishments the maximum bet is &euro;50.  Again, these are generally run by professionals.</p> <p>Let us return to what Senator Craughwell said.  The Minister of State outlined the important legislation being processed in the Department at the moment.  I fully appreciate that without question.  The problem is that I have looked back over notes indicating that we were promised this legislation absolutely by summer 2014.  However, based on the answer provided by the Minister of State it is not going to be brought in this year.  It will not be brought in during the term of this Government, unfortunately.  When is it going to become important?  This is not a pop at the Government, the Minister of State or the officials, who are doing their level best, but it is not a priority.</p> <p>The Minister of State should consider this with his revenue hat on.  Money is being lost to the Exchequer by not regulating the gambling part of the sector.  It amounts to millions.  We reckon it is approximately &euro;27 million, although it is probably more.</p> <p>Let us consider the size of the industry in the rest of Europe and the question of foreign direct investment.  Firms are looking at other countries to develop further what they are doing, but they are not coming to Ireland because we have not regulated the sector properly.  We reckon there is considerable potential in the sector.  However, I am concerned that although we are bringing in the Betting (Amendment) Bill now, there is no protection for people in real terms on the gambling side or for online gambling, which is actually the largest sector.</p> <p>Senators Craughwell and Cummins have referred to roulette, bingo and so on.  It is rife throughout the country.  I am not a killjoy by any stretch of the imagination and I am not into big government or controlling everything and so on, but the fact that we are bringing forward legislation without a timeline for gambling control measures is wrong, especially since everyone agrees they are needed.</p> <p>We should set something down in this area.  That is why the amendment was tabled in good faith.  It was to provide a timeframe under which the Government would have to come back within three months.  This would indicate to the industry that the Government, whatever its make-up, was serious about addressing the sector.  The problem is that when this goes through, it is done.  There are no measures for a proper review.  I realise the Minister of State referred to reports being laid before the House.  If the Bill came back amended from the Seanad, it would send the message that we have included an important amendment that should be reconsidered in the D&aacute;il.  It could go to Cabinet then which could decide to prioritise gambling control legislation and ensure that, even if it is a slimmed-down version, it would get started.  We are not seeking a panacea to all our ills, but perhaps a slimmed-down version.  Why not do that?</p> <p>I have no wish to divide the House on the matter and I opted not to divide the House last week.  Instead, I asked the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to seek an update.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, has provided an update but, unfortunately, it is insufficient.  If we let the Bill go through with no amendments, the matter will be done and will not see the gambling control Bill in the term of this Government.  I am willing to bet my house that the Government will not produce it because of the other priorities the Minister of State has outlined.  This is why I will insist on pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

There is very little of what Senators Craughwell, O'Brien and Cummins said with which I disagree.  I, too, have seen at first hand the damaging effects of gambling on many people, including people close to me.  It can be devastating, and Senator Craughwell is correct in that regard.  The only point on which I disagree is on the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which I believe is doing its job.  Many of the issues fall outside its scope.  They might be issues for the Garda or local authority, and that is where the gambling control Bill comes into play.</p><p>The priority regarding the Betting (Amendment) Bill has always been to put in place the regulatory system for the remote sector with a view to levelling the playing field for all bookmakers, remote and traditional, in terms of betting duties.  Everybody in this House is largely in agreement with that.  The other issues, such as the questions on the prohibition of advertising, and the wider societal issues, some of which we have touched on today, will be dealt with in the gambling control legislation being brought forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Upon the enactment of that legislation, we will have a regulator for the entire gambling sector for the first time.  This marks significant progress.</p><p>Let me outline the difficulty with the amendment and the reason I am not in a position to accept it.  This is the finance-related Bill while the gambling control Bill is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is at Parliamentary Counsel level and will deal with the justice and legal issues.</p><p>I am not sure what the amendment will achieve that is not already being achieved in preparation for the gambling control Bill.  Members on all sides in both Houses and in the Government should work together on the gambling control Bill.  By producing another report outlining what should be done to protect vulnerable people, one is basically serving the purpose of the gambling control Bill in dealing with the wider societal issues.  I do not wish to be confrontational or partisan on this, because I accept that the amendment was tabled in good faith.  Much of what has been said is valid, but I argue that there are two Bills proposed by the Government for the sector that must be considered, namely the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is to put in place a regulatory structure for remote and traditional gambling and deal with the finance side, and a justice-related Bill, the gambling control Bill, which is to deal with the wider societal issues and gambling regulation.   I understand Senator O'Brien will push this amendment to a vote, but I am not in a position, acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance, to accept it.</p></speech>

However, I inform colleagues that it does nothing about online gambling.  I ask each Member here who has a concern about this area - including the Minister of State, who has more power than any of us - to ensure something is done this year about gambling control.  The Bill is welcome and we support it, but nothing in it relates to gambling control, which needs to be addressed urgently by the Government.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State's response today on behalf of the Government tells me nothing will be done this year, but let us try to change this.  I ask the Minister of State to take a message back from the Seanad today that it is not acceptable for this to be left to the next Government or a future Government and that it continue to be long-fingered.  It is far too serious an issue.  We have regulated one part of the industry but have left the other free.  I state this on behalf of my party as finance spokesperson and leader of the group.  This needs to be addressed, and I ask the Minister of State to take this back to the Government very clearly.  We support the Bill, which is a good and important step, but nothing has been done on gambling.  We need to get there much more quickly than the Government is outlining.</p></speech>

Senator O'Brien is 100% right in what he has said.  Not a Senator in the House would disagree that the gambling element of the betting industry needs to be regulated.  We all know of heartbreaking cases of gambling addiction which need to be dealt with urgently.  As we stated earlier, we could not support the amendment because we feel it would be better placed in the gambling control Bill.  I believe the Minister of State will take heed of what Senator O'Brien stated - that there is no timeframe for the gambling control Bill to come to the House and this is a real weakness and flaw.  I hope we will be in a position to deal with it in this term as opposed to the next term.  I know it is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality to bring forward this legislation.  It would be good if we could initiate it in this House.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and handling his brief so competently.  We look forward to seeing the gambling control Bill as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Its focus is on facilitating the taxation of remote betting and levelling the playing field for bookmakers.  Everybody will agree with this.  I cannot disagree with anything my colleague in the Opposition stated.  The gambling control Bill is an essential part of the gambling and betting jigsaw which must be put in place.  We have now put in place one very important piece of this jigsaw, but it will not have the desired effect until such time as we have debated the gambling control Bill and it is in place.  I appeal to the Minister of State through his good offices to try to expedite the passage of the Bill so that it will be published by summer and introduced before the end of the year.  Without it, what we are doing will only deal with part of the problem.  We are trying to repeal a 1931 Act, but online betting and remote betting is far ahead of the legislation, as much has changed since 1931.  Much has changed since 2010 in the industry and this will continue on an ongoing basis.  We are in a catch-up situation.  Unless we deal with the gambling control Bill as a matter of urgency we will fall further behind.  People and families will suffer as a result, and I appeal to the Minister of State to try to expedite the gambling control Bill.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials, as much work has gone into the Bill.  I wish him well and I hope the gambling control Bill will come before us before the summer.</p></speech>

Last night, I was thinking about gambling.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on "/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on "/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I was thinking about it, an advertisement appeared on the television offering me access to the best bingo game in the world.  I could pick from five or six by dialling some number or getting online.  No sooner had that advertisement finished than something came up on the television offering me roulette and blackjack.  I asked myself how many different ways I could have gambled if I wanted to.  What could I start betting on if I wanted to?  Apart from the flies walking up the wall, I could bet on any of the things I had just mentioned - card games, roulette, blackjack, poker, you name it.  I could bet on live and computer-generated horse races.  I could bet in and out of the cloud.  I could bet with Irish-based gambling houses or gambling houses from God knows where.  I started to look a little further.  I can bet on currencies and stock market movements and I can engage in spread betting.  I can lose or make fortunes in moments.  We have seen how contracts cost one man in this country &euro;1.2 billion.  That was gambling with the livelihoods of his workers.  We need controls urgently.  </p><p>As I have already said, there is a problem here.  The Revenue Commissioners have responsibility for some part of what goes on in the gaming and gambling world while the garda&iacute; have other responsibilities.  God knows who else has responsibility everywhere else.  It is possible to put forward some form of task force that will go into the betting houses of this country and start rooting out the illegal machines that are there.  This will regularise the revenue requirements that are there.  I understand that one can license a machine for three months and operate it for 12 months.  One can decide whether one is going to pay 1% VAT on earnings from gambling or 23% VAT.  It seems to be very much down to the owner of the emporium or saloon to decide what they are prepared to give.  </p><p>I did not get the Government health warning through.  I have not given up on it and will be pushing hard for that on aspects of gambling.  All we are asking is that we control it.  If I run an online system, I can have a database that will work the odds against the individual.  As an individual improves, I can worsen their lot.  I can limit the amount they are allowed to bet on any individual race on any individual issue because I do this with technology.  I can profile John Bloggs, see where he normally bets and make it harder or easier for him in order to entice him and when he is in, give him a kicking because this is what technology does.  </p><p>The Leader mentioned a 1931 Act which we are updating it in 2015.  </p></speech>

Let us bring them together in a room, sit down and see what we can do without the warnings I am looking for to limit the ripping-off of people.  The sum of &euro;27.3 million, to which Senator Darragh O'Brien alluded, would take many people off trolleys and put many people into nursing homes.  We are allowing the fat cats of the gambling industry to rip us off day after day.  It is time to put an end to this.  I have no vested interest in it, thank God.  If the Minister of State can do nothing else, he can do this much.  He has the power to bring in the various heads of various statutory bodies which have responsibility and tell them he wants a report on his desk within a week about what steps they have taken to ensure that the law is adhered to the letter.  Let us try with the gambling control Bill and look at all the aspects of gambling.  Let us be very broad in our definition of gambling.</p></speech>

To be fair, when the Leader was Opposition spokesperson on justice, he prepared some very good Private Members' legislation in this area.  This is a step in the right direction.  I have no doubt about the commitment of the Minister of State in this regard because he knows only too well that lives are being destroyed.</p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held significant consultations with various stakeholders on gambling.  I made some very interesting observations during that process.  If one looks at traditional betting shops, it is a way of controlling and making it a little more difficult for people who, unfortunately, find themselves addicted to gambling.  It is certainly a stumbling block.  If horses are non-runners, what happens to that money?  We need a system like the deposits system where banks traditionally would hold on to deposits which were transferred into a fund that is used for good causes.  I will not delay.  </p></speech>

There are millions of unclaimed prizes and money on horses that are non-runners being retained by bookies' offices throughout the country.  This Bill is a step in the right direction but much more needs to be done.  We should be world leaders in protecting our citizens against the scourge of gambling.  We should not be catching up.  We should make virtual betting illegal.  An online provider should not be allowed to create these fictitious hobby-horse, pretend races.  We would all have a shopping list a mile long as regards what we could do with &euro;30 million.  I want to see in the lifetime of this Government an effective and appropriate gambling control Act and I have no doubt that under the stewardship of this Minister of State, who is one of the most competent in the Government, we will see that happen.</p></speech>

I wish both those amendments had been accepted because they were excellent amendments dealing with the issues of a Government health warning and Government accountability in terms of what measures are being take to protect vulnerable people from engaging in harmful gambling.  It is very important for us to take measures in the area of gambling control.</p> <p>I foresee difficulties with this because some issues arise that are very similar to those that arise in the areas of alcohol and tobacco.  We see how the vested interests are not slow to get their act together and to lobby politicians and those in the corridors of power.  Of course, we have lobbying legislation that will, hopefully, make all of that more transparent.  When I occasionally watch racing on St. Stephen's Day or Easter Monday, the power of the gambling industry lobby and their advertising in particular is quite noticeable.  The same issues arise when we talk about the dangers of sponsorship of sporting events by alcohol companies and the way that lures young people into a culture of drinking.  There is no doubt that this is a fact and a problem.  The same thing can be said about these advertisements for betting companies.  They are very slick and are targeted at a particular demographic, namely, young men, encouraging a culture of bravado and recklessness.  There is no doubt about the truth of what Senator Craughwell said.  It is possible to win fortunes in an instant but one is much more likely to lose fortunes.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=18"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must be worried about the families that are being endangered and the family resources that are being compromised in an upstairs room by somebody gambling online, before anybody even knows about it.</p><p>We have to address this issue.  We cannot be wring our hands about the cynical activities of the tobacco industry and the way it seeks to resist controls, plain packaging or whatever or the behaviour of the drinks companies as they seek to water down efforts to prevent the way in which they influence the culture and at the same time pretend that there is no such problem going on in exactly the same way with gambling and the betting industry.  I appreciate that people have jobs in the betting industry, and I know this helps, directly and indirectly, the bloodstock industry, which is very important as well.</p></speech>

I join colleagues in urging the Minister to put pressure on his Cabinet colleagues to bring forward the betting control Bill as soon as possible.  We all want to see as much control as possible put in place but I am concerned that we will still have a major issue with gambling in this country.  We need to start a major national conversation about the effects of gambling.</p></speech>

I am concerned that when local radio stations are reporting on upcoming sporting events, they give the odds that the local team will beat their neighbours.  It is encouraging young people to consider whether there is money to be made on the upcoming match between two local parishes.  That is sending out the wrong message, and the media should be much more responsible in that regard.</p> <p>There is no doubt that excessive gambling is a serious issue in this country, particularly among young men, as previously stated.  It is very easy now to access all sorts of betting opportunities, which is frightening.  We need to do much more in the schools to highlight at an early age the dangers and the destruction that can be caused to families and individuals as a result of excessive gambling.</p> <p>I would like this House to have a major debate on a future occasion where we would flag the start of a national conversation on the problems gambling is causing here, and the destruction it is causing to families.</p></speech>

This is significant legislation in its own right.  Nobody on this side of the House or in Government is claiming that the Bill is a panacea or some sort of magic wand solution to all the ills, many of which have been documented throughout this debate.  There is a need for a gambling control Bill, and the Government is committed to such a Bill.  Many of the issues the Senators outlined would be better placed in the context of that discussion.</p> <p>I thank my officials who have put a significant amount of work into this Bill.  I know a number of Senators would have engaged with them through various Stages.  I look forward to the Bill going to the other House and, ultimately, being signed into law as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
