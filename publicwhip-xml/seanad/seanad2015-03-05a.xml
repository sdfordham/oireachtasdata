It would appear that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is busy.  I ask that the Minister responsible for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, whom I understand to be Deputy Heather Humphreys, would meet a delegation of residents from the area.  We are talking here about a very important part of our country and an important site of world heritage, including the Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth areas, which encompasses half of the parish of Slane and almost the entire parish of Donore in County Meath.  A major public meeting was organised last week by the Department which I attended with my party colleague, Councillor Wayne Harding.  It is fair to say that there was bitter anger among the residents at the way they are being treated.  They feel that their entitlement to live in a community and for that community to carry on is being threatened, not just by the actions of the Department but also by the actions of the local authority.  Indeed, my colleague, Councillor Harding, will be raising this matter with the local authority again, having done so previously.</p> <p>Everybody in the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne area and in County Meath generally is exceptionally proud of the heritage that has been left to us by our forefathers.  We have some of the most important works of megalithic art and the most important megalithic tombs in the world.  Albeit from a different era entirely, it is the equivalent of the Louvre in terms of the importance of the art there.  The art is of the same standard and of equal importance as that in the Louvre, and the community values that enormously.  In fact, many members of the community in Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne have worked on the excavations at Newgrange and Knowth or in the interpretative centre, while some continue to work on the bus service that runs between the interpretative centre and the monuments.</p> <p>Enormous restrictions have been put in place through the actions of the Department and the local authority, particularly with regard to planning for one-off houses.  Nobody is looking to develop this area or is calling for mass building or anything like that.  All people are looking for is for the life of the community in that area to continue.  People want their children to be able to live in the area in which they grew up.  We want to preserve this very important heritage but we also want to make sure that the community is preserved there too.  It was the forefathers of some of those living in the community who built these monuments and that is a fact.  Many of the families to whom I refer have been living in this community since time immemorial.</p> <p>I would suggest that the Minister should listen to the concerns of the local people.  I would hate to think that last week's meeting was a box-ticking exercise for the Department.  I hope departmental officials do not feel that the public consultation process is out of the way now and that they can roll ahead with their plans, along with the local authority.  I would like last week's meeting to serve as a starting point for meeting some of the requirements of the residents.  It should be possible to arrive at a happy medium whereby we preserve the important heritage of Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne while also allowing the indigenous community to thrive.  Nobody is looking for outsiders to be allowed to build houses there, nor does anybody want to build housing estates.  Nobody wants to build a house that would do any damage to any monument or view in that area.  They simply want people to be allowed to live within their own community.  That is a very simple request by people who value and treasure the history and heritage of the area more than anybody.</p> <p>Other concerns raised at the meeting last week related to signage, which has been a disaster for years.  There are still no concrete plans by the Department to mark this very important world heritage site with welcome signs and with signage pointing visitors in the direction of the monuments and the interpretative centre.  Much of the signage there at present is completely wrong and has been for a long time.</p> <p>The other concerns expressed related to the fact that the tourism potential of the area has never been fully developed.  The community, the local authority and the Department, which has a very important role as the State body dealing with UNESCO on the world heritage site status, could work together and come up with a plan that occupies the middle ground.  It should be noted that many members of the community have done a huge amount of groundwork and have an enormous amount to offer.  They can make suggestions that would not be contrary to world heritage status but which would complement it and also complement the life of the community.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to meet a delegation from the community and listen to their concerns in order that last week's meeting does not represent a box-ticking exercise in terms of public consultation?</p></speech>

However, the Minister is very much aware of the concerns of the Senator.</p> <p>The UNESCO world heritage committee requires every property inscribed on the world heritage site list to have a management plan or other documented management system in place that explains how its outstanding universal value will be preserved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Tom Hayes:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1807"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1807&amp;amp;pid=TomHayes&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Outstanding universal value is a fundamental requirement for retaining world heritage status.  The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention, issued by UNESCO in July 2013, set out the issues that need to be addressed as part of the management plan for a world heritage site.   UNESCO also provides guidelines on what content must go into the plan before it can be submitted to the organisation for approval.</p><p>A new draft Br&uacute; na Boinne Management Plan, to replace the previous plan that dates back to 2002, has been prepared in accordance with the UNESCO guidelines.   The draft needs to be finalised and submitted to UNESCO as soon as possible.  In accordance with UNESCO requirements, the main responsibility for implementation of the plan is shared between the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The development of the present draft management plan has taken place over the past four years, during which there have been two periods of public consultation, one of which is still ongoing.  Observations were initially invited from the public in April 2011.  Fifty-seven submissions were received by the Department, all of which were considered in the course of the drafting that has taken place since.  A special public meeting was also held on site in June 2011 to improve community awareness of the plan.</p><p>The Br&uacute; na Boinne world heritage site management plan steering committee was established by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2011 to help oversee the preparation of the management plan.  The steering committee, which the Department chairs, is made up of local interest groups, officials from the Department and the OPW, along with representatives from Louth and Meath county councils, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council, the International Council on Monuments and Sites Ireland and An Taisce.  Representatives from the Boyne Valley consultative committee and two local elected councillors also sit on the steering committee.</p><p>The draft plan sets out the key objectives and future vision for the management of the world heritage site.  It provides a framework for the proactive management of the site, helping to ensure that its outstanding universal value is sustained and preserved for future generations.  It informs and guides the day-to-day and long-term management of Br&uacute; na Boinne.</p><p>Agreement has been secured, at steering committee level, for the vast bulk of the actions set out in the current draft plan.  One new major initiative is the creation of an enhanced management structure for the Br&uacute; na Boinne site that includes a special community forum and other community involvement and oversight in the decision-making process.  The community forum will meet at least twice a year to oversee the implementation of the management plan and its proposed actions.  The forum will meet at the start of the year to consider and discuss the actions that can be implemented in the coming months, and again at the end of the year, when the Department and the OPW will report on progress made on agreed actions.</p><p>The Minister can understand that there are issues that continue to be of concern to some sections of the local community.  These include planning, with some community representatives looking for a separate planning system to be put in place for the world heritage site.  The draft plan, through consultation, seeks to accommodate all reasonable proposals.  Obviously not all aspirations are resolvable through the plan itself.  That said, two new actions directly related to planning are included in the draft plan.  These mean that there will be special recognition of the world heritage site in the administration of the planning systems in Counties Meath and Louth, with clear, precise and time-bound actions in place in regard to pre-planning consultations with prospective planning applicants.  There will also be specific guidance for potential planning applicants on the site and the design of proposed new developments.</p><p>The present position of the draft plan is that the Department and the OPW have invited the public to make written submissions which can be lodged any time up to and including 20 March 2015.  This is an important process which allows all members of the community to express their views, offer opinions and have their say about what is in the plan.  Apart from updating the general strategy for conserving and managing the world heritage site, the public can also comment on how it should address matters such as visitor management and public awareness, research, education, nature conservation, liaison with the local community and sustainable tourism.</p><p>All submissions received will be carefully reviewed and considered by the Department.  The Minister can assure the Senator that everything that can reasonably be taken on board will be built into the final draft.  That element is important to note in terms of the points made by the Senator.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the steering group is made up of a number of interested parties and, most importantly, includes local representatives.  I urge the Senator, as a public representative, to use this structure, which we do not use often enough.  Public representatives or Oireachtas Members should consult the local public representatives that are part of the group.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, encourages all concerned to avail of this opportunity for public input and to take part in the public consultation process.  I will relate the Senator's points to the Minister.  The consultation process that is in place should be availed of first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1116" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015030500002#B00200"><p>We are afraid that the public consultation process is merely a box-ticking exercise.  The evidence for such a belief is that the project was started back in 2011 and, as the Department's officials admitted at a meeting last week, very little has happened since.  The Department was restructured and there was a move from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, etc.  The sections do not seem to have moved offices too much.</p> <p>As I have said already, there was bitter anger at the meeting due to the way this project has panned out.  The local councillors and residents on the consultative committee are not happy.  In fact, some of them are very angry.  As I suggested in my request, which was left unanswered, it would go a long way if the Minister were to meet the people, or even a delegation of those who are or have been members of the consultative committee, and the local councillors.  It would mean a lot if she could meet them and listen directly to their concerns.  Such a meeting would also be an opportunity for her to hear their sincere appreciation for the world heritage site, which is an acknowledgement of the location's beauty, history and art.  Let there be no mistake about that.  If she met them as part of the consultative process it would go a long way.  No reasonable Minister could fail to be moved by the stories of sons and daughters, nieces and nephews having to move out of a community.  The Minister of State would not put up with such a situation in his county of Tipperary or in any rural area.  It is unfair that this parish and a half must put up with such a situation.</p></speech>

It seems to me, having listened to him, that the local residents are deeply concerned about the project.  The best process for him to follow is to make sure and encourage residents to put their issues on paper and consult with the local public representatives who are on the committee.  I have a deep understanding of the situation from what he has said.  I will convey his concerns to the Minister and can assure him that she will take all of his concerns on board.</p> <p>At the end of the process there may be a reason for a meeting.  There is a process in place that should not be interfered with and I encourage the local community to participate.  All public representatives can understand that people in a community want to meet a Minister and air their views, but there is a process in place whereby every viewpoint can be listened to and taken on board.</p> <p>I assure people, notwithstanding their fears, that the Minister will look at and read all of their local concerns.  When that process has been finalised there may be room for a meeting.  I urge people not to miss the opportunity that presents itself now to make their concerns known.  I assure the Senator that I will relate his points and concerns about the project.  I live in an area that has the Rock of Cashel, and everyone would love if it were designated a world heritage site.  Br&uacute; na Boinne has been designated a world heritage site, which is unique, and the people of the region should be very proud.</p></speech>

It is the Minister from Tipperary who will make the final decision on the future of local government and the future of town councils.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Some people say Irish Water will be the legacy of EU Commissioner Hogan but the legacy with which he will be most associated, and it will be negative unless there are changes, are the new structures of local government.  There were elections to new local government structures in 2013 but those structures are a butchered, slimmed-down version of local democracy.  The public spin was that we were going to manage local politics with fewer councillors so town councils were abolished and replaced by municipal districts.  All of us have served on local authorities and all of us know the importance of localism to local government but we now have local authority areas which, in some cases, are 50, 60 or 70 miles long and that is not local government.  The savings from abolishing town councillors, who were on modest stipends, were cancelled out by creating additional county councillors and it is already apparent in many of our huge municipal districts that the current structures are not working.  </p><p>I am the first to recognise that town councils in some areas were not working well.  There were five town councils in my former constituency of Cork East.  Some worked very well but some less so and such a ratio would be replicated across the country.  On the whole, though, in the past 100 years town councils were the first recourse of politics and representation for tens of thousands of our citizens.  The person who walked up and down the main street of Cashel or Mallow always felt comfortable walking into the town hall to meet town council officials.  Sometimes they met town councillors, whom they often met on a daily basis anyway because they generally worked around the town.  There was great interaction between local politics and the local community.</p><p>I was very pleased to hear at the weekend from certain members of the Labour Party that consideration was being given to putting town councils back in place.  We will have to plan it in a very strategic fashion.  I have said to Senators down the years that if they went into the Oireachtas Library they would find the 1991 Barrington report on local government, which was accepted and agreed by virtually every political party at that time.  It proposed the replacement of town councils across the country by district councils with general populations of between 25,000 and 30,000, small geographical areas where the councillor would be local to his or her constituents.  That is one option, but new supercouncils, such as Cork County Council with 55 members, Dublin City Council with over 60 members and west Cork, which is 70 or 80 miles long and larger than most D&aacute;il constituencies, are not local government.  </p><p>There were difficulties with town councils, though some were excellent.  Some of the larger towns in the country did not have town councils while some small towns had functioning town councils but we need to look afresh at the structure.  It is nearly four years until the next local elections and we need to flag our intentions for local government at an early stage.  At a time when we are lecturing Europe on the need to practise devolution of powers down to smaller countries and communities, in this country we have taken power away from small towns and communities and from local citizens.  </p><p>I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State will not make the political call on this matter but he was aware of the great work done in Cashel, Tipperary, Carrick-on-Suir and other town councils in his constituency.  I hope some serious consideration is being given to the question by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Government and that it was not just a conference slogan.  Nobody can blame the previous Minister for making the decision he made and if people in politics are wrong it is not a sin.  Such decisions can be reversed.  I hope we will look at local government in a meaningful fashion to restructure it to give the citizens of this country what they need and deserve.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is otherwise engaged this morning.</p> <p>It is over two years since the Government published the action programme for effective local government, which set out decisions for a range of measures to reform and strengthen local government structures, functions, funding, governance and operational arrangements.  During that period, the focus has been directed at implementation of the extensive reform programme and progress has been swift.</p> <p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, would like to make it clear that he will ensure that the fabric of local government and local democracy are fully intact and effective.  He does not consider, however, that the re-introduction of the pre-reform configuration of town councils would be the correct approach.  As the comments attributed recently to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on this matter acknowledged, reform was needed in this area.  In some ways the system that operated up to last June was a distortion of democracy.  For example, 46% of all councillors represented only 14% of the population.  Residents inside the old town boundaries had double votes at local elections, while the often large population resident in towns but outside outdated boundaries were not served by the town council at all.  Indeed, many large centres of population had no sub-county municipality.</p> <p>Town councils did achieve worthwhile results but their capacity was very limited.  All the 80 town councils combined accounted for only 7% of local government activity and a significant number of them had no revenue-raising powers and no decision-making capacity in key areas such as housing, planning and roads.  It was not feasible to extend the powers, resources and jurisdiction of the town councils without seriously undermining the county councils.  Instead, a new integrated system of governance was introduced.  Municipal districts now cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance.  As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.  The status of the town is explicitly recognised in these new structures.  The mayor is appointed by the relevant district, and the title of "Mayor" can only be used in this context.</p> <p>An important benefit of the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  The performance of different functions by members at county and district levels over time will result in greater effectiveness than the previous parallel town and county system, which involved a significant element of duplication.  The division of functions between county and district levels has been determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters are to be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are being decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions.</p> <p>It is important to bear in mind that we are in the very early stages of a reform process.  The provisions of the 2014 Act only came into effect on 1 June 2014 and 2015 will be the first full year of the operation of structural and other significant changes in the local government system.  However, it is essential to ensure that the new system is being operated effectively and as intended.  The Minister has already emphasised to chief executives the importance of fully supporting the role of the elected members at municipal district level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Tom Hayes:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1807"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1807&amp;amp;pid=TomHayes&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Equally, the members must take full ownership of their powers and responsibilities in this area as well as for the other new governance powers such as the statutory audit committees, annual service delivery plans, management reports, approval of new local authority corporate plans and adoption of schedules of municipal district works by municipal district members.  The structured training programme for councillors, which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is supporting, will help to ensure elected members are well-equipped to perform their governance functions effectively.</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, intends to have a review carried out on the operation of the new structures.  In this context, the Department is reconvening a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government and a broadly based advisory group, both having played an important role in the local government reform process.  The groups will give particular consideration to how the new governance arrangements are impacting on the towns and whether any adjustments are needed in light of experience to date, including civic aspects, such as the status of mayors of borough and municipal districts.  Moreover, these groups will have an important input into strengthening the role of the local government sector in economic development and the particular role to be played by urban centres.  The importance of the role to revitalise the economy of towns and their rural hinterlands has been emphasised in guidelines issued to local authorities by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, expects action in this regard to feature prominently in the local economic and community plans that authorities are developing.  The experience of urban centres will be evaluated to ensure urban issues are being addressed effectively through the new structures.</p><p>The thrust of Government policy is to strengthen local government and foster the potential for improved subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency, resulting in greater value for money for the taxpayer and, ultimately, improving the services delivered for our citizens.  The review that the Minister is initiating will provide a sound evidence base upon which to consider any further changes to local government and local democracy, structural or otherwise.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is speaking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The script represents the biggest U-turn I have heard in a long time.  Clear indications were given in print and oral interviews at the weekend that consideration was being given to having town councils restored.</p> <p>I am keen to raise one point with the Minister of State, although I imagine he is very much aware of it given that he comes from a large geographical county.  I wish to emphasise the importance of local government being local.  The Minister of State remarked in his reply - the script was provided by the office of the Minister, Deputy Kelly - that there was an affinity among the people within municipal districts.  The Minister of State should consider County Cork.  He need not tell me that he could possibly believe people outside Charleville, on the Limerick border, have any sort of political or geographical affinity with the people of the parishes of Conna and Ballynoe, near Tallow, County Waterford, yet, they are part of a single municipal district.  Certainly, I do not believe the people of Millstreet and the surrounding area have any political affinity to the Mallow municipal district in the centre.  What about the areas in west Cork that are 60, 70 or 80 miles away?  A former councillor, Dermot Sheehan, known to all of us through his father, remarked to me after the local elections that it would have been as easy for him to represent the congressional district of New York as the huge sprawling area where he had to contest the election.  We have got it fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>I find it ironic and I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is not in the House.  The politics of stitching up these municipal authorities last year into eight, nine and ten-seaters was to save the party that lost all the seats.  That is the ultimate irony.  Leaving aside politics, the people need good strong local democracy.  The town councils were not perfect but they had and have a role to play.  I hope that long before the next local elections there will be a serious dialogue again about the need to restore genuine real local government whereby local actually means local.</p></speech>

That is a matter of the drawing of a boundary map.  It is not an argument, however, to bring back local town councils.</p><p>I served on a local authority in Tipperary.  The duplication between county and town councils was unbelievable, as was the waste of time and energy.  Officials at county level would address one meeting in the morning and then go on to address the town council that same night.  The amount of time taken up by officials was unbelievable and totally at variance with the delivery of services.  This is about the delivery of service to the people.  The purpose of local authorities is to deliver a better service.</p><p>Senator Bradford can signal what he likes but I have a real belief that what is happening in the new structures represents a major improvement on what was in place.  For example, let us consider the towns of Cahir and Cashel, which are beside one another.  Cahir was better served by South Tipperary County Council than Cashel.  That is the truth.  I have lived in Cashel and I have an office there and I know all about the duplication of services.  There was a serious waste of money and resources.</p><p>I accept the point Senator Bradford makes about people living outside Charleville not knowing people near Waterford, and that it is difficult for one person to represent all of them.  That is true and I take his point in that regard.  However, going back to the old structures of town councils would be a backward step.  I am not simply sticking to the script when I say that I would be totally opposed to going back there.  I really believe it.</p><p>At the weekend, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, expressed his view, but that was a personal opinion.  The Government opinion is to move forward with and protect what we have and then improve it.  Senator Bradford is right in his views on the municipal areas and perhaps there could be an argument to cut in half the municipal areas, but the duplication of services and what we had in the past represented a great waste and we should not go back to it.</p></speech>

This is a way of doing that and of making local government more effective for the people.</p></speech>

I have been raising this issue in this House for some time, as well as the fact that existing staff will not sign any waivers.  While the aforementioned meeting has been reported in the media, there has been no official announcement on this.  I have written to the Minister and ask the Leader to use his good offices to encourage the Minister to use the Seanad in the next week or two to provide an update on the situation.</p> <p>I wish to raise a very serious issue which came to light in recent years but which has been put into sharp focus in recent days, namely, the decision by the Government that the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service will be put under the effective control of the HSE.  Issues have been raised with regard to the HSE ambulance service although I must emphasise that these issues do not relate to the staff.  I know many of the HSE ambulance service staff in Dublin and they are very dedicated people who do an excellent job.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service that is provided in the city and county of Dublin is second to none.  If anything, we should be considering rolling out that model across the rest of the country because most of our major towns have fire stations and all of our firefighters are trained to paramedic level, with many trained to advanced paramedic level.  </p> <p>My major concern and that of my party is the fact that the local authority does not want to pay for the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and is throwing that service to the HSE which cannot manage its own ambulance service.  This will be to the detriment of people of Dublin.  The Government should be looking at the option of a combined emergency service, and this will be part of Fianna F&aacute;il policy in the run-up to the next general election.  Such a combined service will ensure that all of our emergency resources are working together.  The situation at present appears to be one of the HSE winning a turf war.  </p> <p>The Minister for Health said on 3 March last that he is a big supporter of the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service.  If he was a real supporter he would have been true to the assurances he gave that nothing would happen without prior consultation with those who would be affected, namely, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance staff themselves.  There was no consultation whatsoever.  The Government is using last year's HIQA report as an excuse to bring about very significant changes which have not been thought through.  This situation is extremely serious for the city and county of Dublin.  If anything, we should be looking to replicate what is being provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service in the other fire brigades all over the country in order to improve response times.  </p> <p>I ask that the Leader invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss this matter and I will table an amendment to today's Order of Business to the effect-----  </p></speech>

The unemployment rate is now down to 10.1%, a dramatic fall over a number of years from the crisis peak of 15.1% when Fianna F&aacute;il presided over the economic crash.  This sustained fall in unemployment is very welcome.  We have had a number of debates in this House on job creation but I ask that we have a further debate on the issue before the end of the session to review the progress of the Action Plan for Jobs and to look at the Government's target of achieving full employment by 2018, which no longer seems as over ambitious as it was accused of being originally.  Certainly, the fall to 10.1% is very welcome and today there were more positive announcements concerning an investment by Microsoft and the opening of a new state-of-the-art facility by Glanbia in Kilkenny.  It is wonderful to see the great progress being made on job creation and the falls in unemployment.</p> <p>I also welcome the publication and passage of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill through this and the other House.  This makes Ireland a leader in tackling the harm associated with tobacco.  I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly and all the Members who supported that Bill.  It received a large amount of support from across the political divide.  </p> <p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on mental health in the context of the review of mental health legislation that has been carried out by the expert group commissioned by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  The group reported today with 160 recommendations for changes to mental health law.  I note that the Minister of State has said that she accepts the recommendations and hopes to see them brought forward through legislation amending the Mental Health Act later this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We might have a debate on that issue again in this House.

I commend all the events that are happening throughout the country for International Women's Day.

There are proposals to remove mathematics and languages as entry requirements, and my correspondence indicates these are gathering pace.  Discussions are taking place in the University of Limerick and in UCC this week.  It is reported that UCD is totally in favour of the proposals and that TCD has dissented.  The Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, said in this House that the report of the expert skills group indicated to her that we needed more language skills in Ireland and not less.  I do not believe she is being kept in the loop on these kinds of proposals.  We are members of a multilingual European Union and we should not be cutting back on languages.  Mathematics is the basis of all our investment in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects.  These proposals should be passed for consideration to the education committee chaired by Deputy Joanna Tuffy and the Minister should certainly be advised of them because they seem to contradict what we are seeking to accomplish in the development of this country.</p> <p>On a related aspect of the development of this country, I praise the Labour Party on its decision in Kenmare, or Killarney - I named the wrong town in Kerry-----</p></speech>

The Labour Party took a stand against the British Airways IAG takeover of Aer Lingus.  Its members are looking after the interests of the workers.  We in this House have an interest in the development of this country.  Aer Lingus, in generating 11 million passengers for a population of 4 million people, is doing four times better than British Airways in generating 38 million passengers for a population of 64 million people.  If fellow Senators are interested in developing this country, we do not want a situation to develop where future Ministers with responsibility for tourism and industry have to telephone Heathrow to get flights into this country.  Aer Lingus, as a development agency, outperforms British Airways by a factor of four.  I ask the Senators to bear that in mind when this decision comes before their parties.</p></speech>

If he has time between selling insurance for private companies, he might have an opportunity to drop into to us to report on the important issue that was raised.</p> <p>I draw to the Cathaoirleach's attention that it has been a precedent in this House that we do not refer to Members, whether they are present or not present or whether they have contributed or not contributed to debates.  I had to leave to go to another appointment yesterday.  Senator John Kelly referred to the fact that I was not present for the debate on the plain packaging of cigarettes Bill on Tuesday, 3 March, which was brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The fact is that this Bill was scheduled to be taken at 3.30 p.m. last Thursday, 26 February, when I would have been present and would have participated in that debate and I had my research done.  However, the Bill was pulled and was rescheduled for Tuesday, 3 March, when I was with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in London engaged on official business on the future of Europe and Britain's position in that regard.  I returned to Dublin and was in the House at 5.30 p.m. and, following a very short discussion, the Bill was completed.  I am not a very sensitive person about these things and I do not really care very much about them, but I ask the Cathaoirleach, who is a very fair person, if he will deal with that.</p></speech>

This young man, as we know, was only 17 years of age when he was detained during a peaceful protest in Egypt and he has been detained for over a year.  As we know from correspondence many of us have had from his family, he is obviously in great distress.  His family are anxiously trying to get him home in order that he can continue his studies.  I hope that this will be a first positive move in securing his immediate release.</p> <p>I was present this morning for the launch of the Alcohol Health Alliance, which is a coming together of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and Alcohol Action Ireland to support the enactment of the public health (alcohol) Bill.  This alliance is being chaired by Professor Frank Murray.  As we all know, abuse of alcohol in this country is a national crisis with almost half of Irish drinkers engaging regularly in an episode of heavy drinking.  The number of deaths due to liver disease has doubled in the past 20 years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Alcohol abuse is now associated with the occupation of approximately 1,500 beds each night in Irish hospitals, and 25% of all injuries presented to accident and emergencies in our acute hospitals are alcohol related.

It is going great.  People from all over the world are coming before it to talk about what happened the banks, why it happened and what we should have done differently, but the banks are still doing what they have always done.  They have reverted to type.  They are not only throwing people out of their homes but they are also imprisoning them within their homes in so far as the people are subsisting and not actually living.</p> <p>One has to pay now to go into a bank.  One has to pay for cash and for one's cheque.  One has no return on one's savings, and a crippling interest rate.  I will forget about the case in Vico Road because that is a different situation; it is a more opulent situation.  I am not arguing for that; they can argue for themselves.  I am arguing for genuine workers and families in homes the mortgage on which they cannot afford to pay, or they cannot afford the mortgage the bank is demanding they pay back.  Between cr&egrave;che fees, food and life fees they cannot afford the mortgage.  They are being put out of their homes every day of the week, and the banks continue to hike up the interest rates.  That is very serious because downstairs this major banking inquiry is taking place, and still the banks are reverting to type.</p> <p>Bank of Ireland announced a &euro;900 million profit last week.  I understand that a bank has to make a profit to fulfil its mandate but what will happen that &euro;900 million?  That profit is our money.  It is our universal social charge and our interest hikes.  I would like the Minister for Finance to come into this House and tell me the manners he is putting on the banks for the working people of Ireland.</p> <p>I was in Tulsk last week and I saw what is happening rural Ireland, but one of the most important developments is that young couples had paid &euro;160,000 for a semi-detached house in the middle of Tulsk, with no trees and very few amenities.  The same houses next door were being sold for &euro;49,000.  The banks should be brought to heel over that and told they can wipe out the first &euro;100,000 and let the people start paying at &euro;49,000.  Something must be done about that.</p> <p>I received a letter from a woman, Cait O'Beirne, in Cork.  There were 60 repossessions in the Cork Circuit Court.  These have nothing to do with the house in Vico Road, which everybody is running to with cameras.  There were 30 people in Cork Circuit Court and do the Senators know who they were?  They were people representing the banks because the poor unfortunates were scared out of their wits and did not have the bottle to attend.  They did not know what to do, and they did not have the language of the banking repossessions.  I have had enough of that.  I ask that the Minister come into the House and tell me exactly what manners he is putting on the banks that all of us have mortgages in because we are running to feed ourselves and pay all the bills. Can I have an answer to that question immediately?  This is about the fifth time I have asked for that.</p></speech>

A recent report in <i>The Lancet</i>indicated that the increasing prevalence of high potency cannabis use among young people in particular is putting people at a much greater risk of developing major mental health problems, despite what I would call some irresponsible public commentators saying publicly that there is no health risk associated with the use of cannabis.  The literature is clear on the matter.  The Leader might arrange for a debate in the House at his convenience.</p></speech>

Competition has been of huge benefit to this country, and to the marketplace as a whole.  When I first went into business we were not allowed to cut the price of anything.  If we cut the official price we were refused supplies.  We need an open market, and we need competition.  I disagree with Commissioner Hogan who is planning to introduce at European level a restriction on competition between suppliers and supermarkets.</p> <p>The question of competition is a reminder of how well our economy is doing now.  We are showing signs of getting the unemployment rate down, but there was an interesting development yesterday.  The British House of Commons is now allowing Stormont to set its own corporation tax.  That will be more competition for us on this side of the Border.  It is great competition.  We are all the one island and it will do no harm to have that competition but it is a reminder that we should not become complacent.  We have to continue to ensure we will be competitive in the future.  </p> <p>I refer to Senator Barrett's point about the suggestion that we take the pressure off teaching languages, which seems to me to be outrageously wrong.  We need languages if we want to export, and to take languages off the curriculum would be a huge error.  We must make sure that we do not do that.  Whatever about mathematics, that seems outrageous.  We cannot concentrate on everything but we should not on any grounds take the pressure off teaching languages.  The necessity to do that, if our economy is to continue, is very high.</p></speech>

Thankfully, the number of people signing on for social welfare has continued to fall 39 consecutive months in a row.  That is great news.  Unemployment figures are down from a high of 15.1% in February 2012 to 10.1% currently, and the figure is about to reduce to below 10% for the first time in many years.</p> <p>I have no doubt that the Government's Action Plan for Jobs is working.  That must be recognised and appreciated.  There are decreases in all eight regions of the country, and the fastest decrease is in the mid-west region.  In excess of 141,000 people left the live register in the past 12 months.  That is a true indication that the Government's plans for job creation are working, and long may those efforts continue.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his team on that magnificent achievement.</p></speech>

Last weekend at the Labour Party conference, and subsequently, the leader of the Labour Party and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, endorsed this initiative by her colleague.  Speaking with Deputy Penrose it is obvious that this has struck a chord with people across the country, not just with those we might perceive to be wealthy people but people in dire financial circumstances who are unable in many cases to pay their bills.  If we link that with a statistic that was brought to my attention in recent days that this Government has levied some 45 tax increases since it first came to power in 2011, it is no wonder the response to Deputy Penrose's initiative has been so overwhelming.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to outline the position of the Fine Gael Party on this matter.  The Fine Gael Minister is in government.  Towards that end I ask that there would be a debate here, even if it was only statements, to give some indication of the way the Government is thinking because it is obvious from the debate in this House at the time with the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, that the three year rule was not feasible, nor was it practical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As pointed out to him by me and others, which he refused to countenance, one can go across the Border and if one fulfils the conditions of bankruptcy, one can be discharged after one year.  One can take the ferry to England and do the same, as some have done, but not everybody can afford to do that or to stay within those jurisdictions for the required time.  I believe this is one way, as stated in the newspapers again today by respected commentators who are familiar with the mortgage distress area - one positive way - of resolving the issue of those who are unable to pay their debts.  It would also engage the banks because they would have no choice as they would be faced with a bankrupt and they would get no money.  There is a two-edge sword to this issue, in a positive sense, and therefore it is vitally important that we understand the Government's thinking on it.  Given that the Labour Party now supports the initiative, what is the position of the Fine Gael Ministers?  Towards that end, there is a need for a debate which would allow all Members to discuss the entire mortgage crisis issue.</p></speech>

As shareholders in AIB, most of us are probably delighted it had a &euro;1.1 billion pre-tax profits in 2014 as opposed to a &euro;1.7 billion loss in 2013.  However, a closer examination of the figures reveals that &euro;188 million is a write-back from amounts it had previously set aside for expected bad debts.  That basically means that the rest of the money is operating profits.  I very much share the concerns of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell that these profits are being made by exorbitant bank charges, interest rates on variable rate loans that are unsustainable and unacceptable, and, dare I say, a certain amount of a fall in the level of arrears that has been brought about by nothing but pure terror being imposed on people who are in mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, it is clear there is a tsunami of repossessions coming and people in mortgage arrears are not being properly represented.  There is no level playing field when it comes to the relationship between somebody in mortgage arrears and their bank.  That is an issue the Government will have to address.  I want that debate as a matter of urgency.  I also call for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to come to the House to address the State scheme which supposedly gives advice to people in mortgage arrears.  It is a joke, to say the least, that people get advice when they have actually been made an offer and they have no choice but either to accept or reject it.  That is not genuine advice.  It does nothing to help people in mortgage distress and is a total waste of money.  I am seeking two debates, one on the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the second on the facilities being made available to people in mortgage distress.</p></speech>

It was obvious at the time that its provisions would neuter any effectiveness the Bill should have had.  In Wexford 13.09% of people with mortgages are in default.  The level of arrears ranges from 10.2% to 19% across every county.  It is an appalling scenario.  I agree with Senator Aideen Hayden who said there is a tsunami of repossessions coming but what in the name of God is the Government doing about it?  It is in government, not in opposition, but what is it doing about it?  It has the power to change it.  It has the power to give a balance so that people are not removed from their houses.</p></speech>

We have a serious problem with repossessions.  What Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and others have said is absolutely correct.  It needs to be dealt with.  We should not skirt around the edges but deal with it head on and upfront, and the banks need to be dealt with head on and upfront.  There is too much pandering to the banks by everyone in society.  Whatever length of time is left in this Government, it has to deal with the banks and ensure that people are left with their homes, not with &euro;7 million worth of homes, as we saw on television last night.  I commend Mr. Vincent Browne because what he did last night was a fantastic example of public service broadcasting.  Of course, it was TV3 that exposed exactly what is going on and exposed the leadership of the so-called phoney, stupid New Land League.  How anybody can go on national television and justify the actions of an organisation such as the New Land League is beyond me.  The Land League goes back to Michael Davitt, who must be turning in his grave at what is going on.</p></speech>

Apple's investment in Athenry, County Galway, is a fantastic news story and it is one that I, as an Athenry native, am thrilled with.  However, I am concerned that the current planning process could end up delaying the development due to the lack of aforementioned time limits when it come to decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This means that the decision-making process could be delayed, causing a problem that those rejoicing in the much-desired investment in Athenry could do without, especially in regard to the development of employment opportunities that are badly needed in Athenry and the greater area.  For this reason, I call for the introduction of targeted timeframes for planning decisions as soon as possible.</p> <p>It is important that people have an opportunity to submit their appeals and that they are properly considered.  However, we must also ensure that planning applications do not become stuck through endless appeal processes and delays.  Such a situation affects not just Apple but all developments in general.  Planning decisions must be taken prudently and with the best interest of Irish citizens at their heart.</p> <p>Target times would bring greater clarity to the system and would streamline the process overall.  Such improvements would make for a better planning process in Ireland.  At a time when new housing is badly required, building is being delayed because of the length of time involved in getting planning permission through the process.  This situation has unarguably added to the housing crisis.  It has also stopped construction workers from getting back to work and thus allowing us, as a country, to make further gains along the road to recovery.</p> <p>I ask the Leader of the House to allocate time for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in order to discuss time limits for An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-05a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015030500002#O02000"><p>I generally support the comments made by colleagues on the housing matter in terms of bankruptcy and the heavily indebted citizens all across the country.  Of course we must ask ourselves why.  The answer to the why question is that the property market crashed and analyse the policies that were in place which brought about that market.  The crash did not happen by chance.  Very wrong policy directions were engaged in.  We put the construction industry in a league of its own and it was about profit and not housing or looking after the housing needs of the Irish people.  In that regard, I am concerned that the situation could be back to the future when we read again today about private meetings - and they are not secret meetings - taking place between property developers and the Minister.  That scenario is a replica of what we saw in the Celtic tiger era where one group in society almost set the Government's policy agenda.</p> <p>I have called in this House previously, as have many of my colleagues and in particular Senator Hayden, for an urgent debate on housing policy.  We should have a housing policy debate and not a construction industry policy debate.  The purpose of the construction industry should not be about turning millionaires into billionaires; it should be about providing decent accommodation for every strata of Irish society.  Housing was provided in the much tougher times of the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and also in the 1970s and 1980s.  That is what our agenda should be.  If people want to lobby then let us arrange a public forum on housing which would allow us to hear from developers, auctioneers and the people who are trying to buy houses.</p> <p>I remember the comments Taoiseach Ahern made when people were critical of property people and developers.  He said that people had no entitlement to criticise.  It was that sort of blinkered thinking which ruined this country and brought about much of the banking crisis.  We do not want to go back to that situation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, has indicated he will make himself available for a debate.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on housing policy which will be led and said by the interests of people looking for housing, not led and said by property speculators and developers.  </p></speech>

It is regrettable.  I do not believe the way forward is to close satellite clinics or community welfare offices.  We have received categoric assurances from the Department of Social Protection and the Minister that where somebody feels discommoded and cannot travel to a clinic, the community welfare officer will call out to his or her house.  Nobody will be left without a service.</p></speech>

I am very glad to hear the reassurance from Senator O'Donnell that the female Senators in this House never heckle.</p> <p>We should all welcome the new dairy processing facility in Belview Port announced by Glanbia.  It will create 75 direct jobs in Kilkenny and we might say that the cats have got the cream yet again.  The really good news is the 1,600 spin-off jobs around the country.  It is excellent news for rural Ireland in particular.  It is a reminder, yet again, of how much a driver of progress and positivity agriculture is in rural Ireland.  It is worth &euro;10 billion in terms of Irish exports.  An uplift in dairy production will be required to provide the raw material for the facility.  It is very reassuring for those involved in agriculture in Ireland and for all of those who are keen to see stimulation of the economy in those parts of Ireland, such as smaller towns and villages that have not yet benefitted from whatever good news there has been in recent times.  </p> <p>I am torn between admiration and horror in regard to the news about the money Sinn F&eacute;in has managed to raise in the United States.  I would say, "Good luck to them" in one breath, but when it tells us that none of the money was spent south of the Border and it was all spent in the North I have to say, "Pull the other one."  It is not just North of the Border that Sinn F&eacute;in has so many people working full-time for the party.  I will not quibble at any organisation's fundraising ability, but it is time for us to consider whether we have the mechanisms in place in this country to allow us to scrutinise properly from where political funding comes and is spent.  We have a laughable situation whereby all donations under &euro;600 to an individual politician simply do not have to be disclosed.  That is not a transparent system of fundraising.  We pretend to have accountability in these matters, but in reality there is no accountability.</p></speech>

For the past year and a half people across Europe have been led up the garden path when it comes to roaming and have been told that the abolition of EU roaming charges was imminent, had passed through the Parliament and was about to be enacted.  We now find the measure is likely to be delayed by three years, until the end of 2018, as a consequence of a European Council decision which has extended the deadline by which telecoms companies are obliged to end roaming charges.  </p> <p>Europe has let its citizens down through its dithering, indecision and willingness to give in to special interests.  I am an advocate of the European project as a mechanism through which all of our lives can be made better and I am bitterly disappointed with this retrograde step.  Great work was done during the past decade to make roaming cheaper and break down the invisible telecommunications borders which exist across Europe.  We all know roaming is a significant money maker for telecommunications companies.  Europe set about tackling that, yet now it appears it is not such an urgent issue after all.  People can simply continue to pay through the nose for another three years as a consequence of the Council's dithering and indecision.  </p> <p>I am glad that my colleague in the European Parliament, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, plans on raising this important issue in seeking a reversal of the decision of the Council.  What exactly is the Council hoping will change in the next three years?  What is the difference between doing away with roaming charges in 2015 or leaving them in place until 2018?  It seems to me there is little difference, apart from allowing the telecommunications companies to continue to rake in money hand over fist for an extra 36 months.  I call on those who made this decision to reconsider it in the interests of European citizens.</p></speech>

It does nothing for the decorum and dignity of the House to have such occurrences.  People should reconsider, when they come into the House, whether they do things properly.  It would be better if they did not come in if they are going to involve themselves in the type of activity we have seen here today.</p> <p>Senator O'Brien raised the question of the Dublin ambulance service, something which was raised in the past two days on the Order of Business.  It is subject to a HIQA report.  Patient safety is of paramount importance and must be addressed.  There must be consultation and negotiation.  I have been in contact with the Minister's office.  He is willing to come here at 5 p.m., but cannot be here any earlier.  He is booked up.  He cannot give a guarantee he is available next week.  I leave it to the Senator to decide if he wants to be here for 5 p.m. when the Minister will be available.  We will have to decide whether the House wants to wait until 5 p.m. for the Minister.  </p> <p>Senators Bacik and Brennan and several others referred to the unemployment figures.  The latest live register figures show a continuing fall in the numbers of people signing on, marking 39 consecutive months of decrease.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has highlighted other positive trends including, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the fact that 4,300 people left the live register in a month.  The standardised unemployment rate is at 10.1%, a decrease of 0.2% in a month, and is down from a high of 15.1% in February 2012 when the Government launched and began implementing the Action Plan for Jobs.  </p> <p>The annual decreases occurred in all eight regions, as Senator Brennan has outlined, with the fastest decrease occurring in the mid-west region.  Some 141,151 people left the live register to take up work during the past 12 months.  The exit rate from the live register into work is running at 40%, up from 33% in 2012.  Every person who leaves the live register to take up employment saves the Exchequer approximately &euro;20,000 per annum in reduced social welfare expenditure and increased tax revenue, and helps to create a reinforcing cycle of positive economic benefits.  Seeing our economy thriving as it is at the moment is something that is to be welcomed by all.  The benefits are filtering down to people in the regions and throughout rural Ireland.</p> <p>Senators Bacik and Mullen referred to the wonderful news from Glanbia, namely, the opening of a plant in Belview Port in Kilkenny.  It will create over 1,600 spin off jobs, as Senator Mullen mentioned.  It is a great investment in rural Ireland, about which we have been speaking on the Order of Business today.  There were some negative but many positive points about the activities in rural Ireland, which need to be highlighted.  I compliment Glanbia on its development.  It will be very important for the dairy industry in the country and the economy in general.</p> <p>Senator Bacik mentioned the review group report on the Mental Health Act 2001.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has published the expert group report on the Mental Health Act 2001, which review is in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to initiate consultation with service users, carers and other stakeholders on mental health and human rights standards.  We might have a debate on that issue in early course.  </p><p>Senator Barrett, Senator Healy Eames and other Senators raised the issue of the removal of languages as entry requirements in third level colleges.  We need to upgrade our language and maths curricula.  As stated by Senator Healy Eames, this issue should be discussed by the education committee as a matter of urgency.  I hope that members will raise it with the chairman of that committee, Deputy Tuffy, whom I am sure will facilitate that debate.  There is a need for greater emphasis on language and maths skills.</p><p>Senator Coghlan spoke about the unfair treatment of suppliers by multiples.  Senator Quinn had a different viewpoint from Senator Coghlan in that regard and outlined that he would not be in agreement with any plans to limit competition.  Senator Quinn also raised the issue of the corporate tax rate in Northern Ireland and the need for us to be vigilant in that regard.  I agree with him that competition is of paramount importance.  I agree also with the Senator's commentary on the language skills issue.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to a proposed Private Members' Bill which seeks to reduce bankruptcy from three years to one year.  I am sure it will be debated in the other House and also in this House.  There has already been far-reaching and substantial reform of our bankruptcy law, including by way of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which reduced the period of automatic discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to three years.  That legislation came into effect in December 2013.  There have been drastic changes in this area.  During debate on that legislation, the Minister mentioned that if there is a need for further review of it, that will happen.  </p></speech>

Senator O'Donnell also mentioned that she is not a great fan of the banks in terms of what they are currently doing and called for a debate on the banking sector.

The Government is determined to ensure that as the recovery deepens, nobody will be left behind.  We are making headway in terms of improving the situation.  The most recent figures show a significant improvement in arrears, particularly in respect of family homes.  The Central Bank figures underline this progressive trend, with the number of family homes in arrears having fallen for the past five quarters.  Figures from the Department of Finance for the six main banks show that the number of cases of arrears in excess of 90 days, when compared with the situation at the start of 2014, have fallen by over 17,500.  In August 2013, some 2,500 split mortgages had been put in place by the six main banks.  The current figure in this regard is 20,500.  During the same period, permanent restructures put in place by the six main banks in respect of family homes increased from 41,000 to 91,000.  However, the same progress is not being made in respect of those who are in arrears of over two years.  For this reason, the Government has undertaken to review the arrangements put in place to ensure there is a viable route forward for anybody who wants help.  The Government has been working with the banks, which have been meeting the targets set for them by the Central Bank under the MARP process.</p> <p>We will have to consider whether the current approach is the one that will really help to move forward the most difficult cases.  It is not right that people should live with extreme mental pressure in respect of debts they cannot pay.  As mentioned by many Members today, this is damaging the mental health of families and individuals throughout the country.  It is a matter of serious concern to Government, which has thus far been responsible for the most radical overhaul of debt management in this State.  As mentioned earlier, we have rewritten laws on bankruptcy in an effort to move away from the previously draconian-Victorian approach taken to this issue heretofore.  The Government has put in place a range of options to help ordinary people who find they cannot pay their debts, including their mortgages.  </p> <p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland is in place to help people in a practical and understanding way.  We know that people who have gone through the process have experienced great relief.  The ISI has been proactive in encouraging people to use its services.  Following suspension of application fees, the number of people availing of personal insolvency arrangements increased.  These arrangements are a solution to the mortgage problem and more people should be availing of them.  The first step is to make people aware of what is possible and this will be a focus of Government.</p> <p>The issue of bankruptcy was mentioned a great deal today.  In 2014, there were 448 bankruptcy adjudications, 95% of which were sought by debtors.  It is wrong to say that no progress is being made in relation to mortgage arrears and insolvency.  There is more to be done and progress to be made, but the Government is aware of the problems that exist and is doing its best to rectify them.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the New Land League, on which issue I do not propose to comment.  Senator Higgins spoke about the large number of jobs that will be created during development of new Apple facility in Athenry and of her concerns regarding delays in the planning process in this regard.  Senator Bradford called for a housing policy debate.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, who is responsible for planning and housing to come to the House in the next couple of weeks to address those issues.</p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about Glanbia and also referred to Sinn F&eacute;in's fund-raising machine inside and outside of this country and the need for greater scrutiny in this regard.  I will try to arrange a debate on that issue in the next session.</p> <p>Senator Noone raised the issue of roaming charges and the delay in abolition of these changes.  There is no question but that what is happening is a retrograde step.  The delay is unacceptable.  We were promised by Europe that these charges would be abolished in many instances but this will not now happen for another three years.  On EU affairs, it was agreed by this House that we would deal with more European affairs matters.</p></speech>
