I know everybody is very busy on one of the last days, but I am raising an issue that I raised before about a year ago.  Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna is a school in Knocklyon where the students and teachers have been in prefabs for 18 years.  This is unprecedented and unacceptable in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every education Minister has said that prefabs are not suitable for the education of children and that they do not expect any school to be in a prefab for longer than three years.  This school has been in a prefab for 18 years.  I had this matter on the agenda here before.  Parents and teachers are looking for a permanent building.  When I was attending a meeting in Knocklyon last Thursday night, a mouse ran across the floor.  I understand this is a daily occurrence in a space where children are being educated.  The Minister of State knows what that does from the perspectives of health, safety and cleanliness.  It disrupts the class for a time.  It is a regular occurrence.  I have campaigned on this issue for almost 20 years, since I was first elected to South Dublin County Council.  I do not usually raise local issues in the Seanad, but the question of prefabs is a national educational issue.  I know it is now the policy of the Department of Education and Skills to have all schools out of prefabs within three years.  That is a new policy.  I have heard the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, speaking about that.</p><p>This case has been going on for far too long.  An urgent solution needs to be found by South Dublin County Council and the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is disappointing, to say the least, that delays have been caused by bureaucracy and the legalities of the purchase of this site, which is in no-man's land because the bureaucracy has taken so long.  I have raised this matter with the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the current Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I raised it here with the Minister of State, Deputy English, approximately a year ago.  I was told ten years ago that the site would be vested in the Department of Finance.  Then I was told that there would be a compulsory purchase order.  Now it is back to a compulsory purchase order again.  It is totally unclear.  I want a clear answer.  If the Minister of State cannot verbally give me a clear answer here on the record of the Seanad, I want it in writing.  I want to be told in simple language - A, B and C - when this is going to happen.</p><p>In May 2015, the Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the commencement of the building could not take place before the formal transfer of the land.  On 22 June last, my office received a further letter from the Minister for Education and Skills which stated that the board and the Department had agreed a proposal that would possibly serve as a satisfactory solution.  Today, we are back to square one.  The compulsory purchase order has still not been taken.  I have been told by South Dublin County Council that it will be initiated.  The context is a clear commitment from the Government.  The money is there.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Minister have said that money is not the issue.  The money will be forthcoming.  The legalities need to be ironed out with the legal people in South Dublin County Council.  Perhaps more pressure needs to be put on the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>I want to see this happen in the next month.  I want to see the compulsory purchase order out of the way and dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister of State's last act in the Department of Education and Skills will be to get this school on the road for the people of Knocklyon and Dublin South-West by 2021.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills said that the use of prefabs for more than two years would be a rare exception.  This case is a rare exception in Ireland.  It has been 18 years on the go.  I ask the Minister of State to highlight the reasons for this and say how and when it is going to be solved.  I would appreciate it if he could give me a date and the other clear details I am seeking.  It has slipped through the net.  I do not like to use the word "negligence" when I am talking about officials in councils or elsewhere, but it is downright irresponsible, to put it mildly, that such delays are being caused by bureaucracy, carelessness and inefficiency.</p></speech>

I am sorry for keeping her waiting.  I could not make it here before 2.45 p.m.  I thought I was due to respond to the third Commencement matter.  I apologise for the problems that were caused.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, officials from my Department have been working closely with officials from South Dublin County Council to secure a suitable site to facilitate the delivery of permanent school accommodation for Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.  Agreement in principle on the acquisition by the Department of a site owned by South Dublin County Council has been reached.  That is going back quite a while now.  The site in question is the current location of the school&rsquo;s temporary accommodation and has been deemed to be technically suitable for the development of permanent accommodation.  As has been outlined to the Senator previously, certain title issues associated with the site were identified as part of the standard conveyancing process.  As the Senator will understand, it is critical for these issues to be resolved before the Minister takes ownership of the site.  The resolution of title issues can sometimes be complex.  Unfortunately, this has proven to be the case in respect of the site for Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.</p> <p>South Dublin County Council has worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the Property Registration Authority for some time in an effort to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  The complexity of the issue has meant that the site acquisition has been delayed significantly while officials work towards a resolution.  Officials from my Department have discussed with their counterparts in South Dublin County Council possible mechanisms which could provide a satisfactory resolution to the title issues and thereby facilitate the land transfer.  Officials from my Department have been informed that South Dublin County Council intends to initiate a compulsory purchase order process as soon as possible, subject to legal advice which is under discussion with a law agent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My officials have also been informed that representatives of the council have arranged to meet the school's board of management next week to update it and discuss the matter.</p><p>Once the acquisition of the site is finalised, it is the intention of my Department to initiate the architectural planning process for the provision of a new school building.  Officials from the Department will continue to work closely with officials from South Dublin County Council to progress matters in the context of the pressing need to advance the project for the provision of permanent accommodation.</p><p>I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the Seanad.  The matter has been ongoing for a long time.  I would have assumed that it would have moved on at this stage, but it has not.  At this stage the only way to move the issue forward involves compulsory purchase orders.  The council has tried to do all it can to avoid having to do that, but it looks as though progress will involve that.  There is a commitment for that to happen.  I can make sure the Department keeps the Senator informed of the situation over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

I was informed that it had to go down the route of vesting in the Department of Finance because it was impossible to have compulsory purchase orders.  I have been told about legal advice for the past ten years, which seems to involve people sitting on their backsides.  As I said, this is not the fault of the Department of Education and Skills.  I have never before seen that Department draw up plans for a school when it did not own a site.  It has gone as far as drawing up plans for the school, which is unprecedented and for which I thank it.</p> <p>The Minister of State's Department will have to contact the legal department in South Dublin County Council and make sure the work is done.  If it cannot be done, it should say why that is the case.  I ask the Minister of State to send a letter.  The Department of Education and Skills is meeting the board of management, but the board is sick of meetings.  I do not know how many meetings it has had.  I want the Minister of State's Department to send a letter telling the relevant bodies to proceed with the project.  I again thank the Minister of State.  As I said, the money is in place, something which has to be acknowledged.</p></speech>

That person cannot instruct them on what to do or demand that they do something.  Rather, that official can work with them and ask them to proceed as quickly as possible.  I ask the Senator to use her good offices and those of her council colleagues to try to put any pressure that is needed on the officials involved and stress the urgency of the matter.</p> <p>This situation is very serious.  I do not know what happened nine years ago regarding the compulsory purchase order.  I understand the intention is to drive the project forward and build the school.  As the Senator said, once the site is secured in name, there will be no delay in progressing the project thereafter.</p></speech>

Last week, on the Order of Business, I raised the case of Carol Brill who has Usher syndrome.  She has a devastating rare genetic disease that causes the gradual deterioration of hearing and sight for which there is no cure or treatment at present.  The Leader proposed and suggested that it would be more appropriate for me to raise the matter as a Commencement matter this week.</p> <p>Last year, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, Carol spoke and pleaded passionately for help for people who have the dual-sensory loss of sight and hearing.  She spoke about the urgency of recognising deaf-blindness as a unique disability.  In 2015, Carol was formally diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 2a.  The diagnosis was only possible through the relationships that Carol had forged with many of the international researchers working in the field.  She did all of this with drive and energy, despite being handicapped with deteriorating sight and hearing.  She has to wear very high powered hearing aids but she is not entitled to get them on a medical card.  She is 45 years of age and it is very difficult for her to get a job with her unique problem.  </p> <p>I wish to point out that there is no dedicated entry on the national physical and sensory disability database to record her needs and that of people like her.  Such people should have their needs recorded on the database.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M. White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2011"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2011&amp;amp;pid=MaryMWhite&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is not a single case worker to look after her needs and the needs of other people with her unique disability.  I am pleading with the Minister of State in the dying days of this Government and, please God, when she goes forward again herself in the next Government, that this issue be dealt with and that there be compassion for the people who have this rare syndrome.  The horror of going deaf and blind simultaneously just does not bear thinking about - everything going dark.  Deafness and blindness, generally speaking, are unique to people as they get older but this affects young people.  Carol herself is 45 years of age.  What is keeping her spirits going is her daughter of eight, Sarah.  She conquered depression when her marriage broke up and her baby son died.  She has come through so much and is an inspiring person.  I am here today pleading her case.</p></speech>

I did listen to the evidence given.  One could not but be touched by what we heard.  I would like to thank Senator White for raising the issue on the Commencement of the Seanad today.</p> <p>In addressing the specifics of the question raised in the Commencement matter, the Minister for Health does not classify or recognise specific medical illnesses or conditions as a disability.  There are a number of definitions of disability that are used for particular purposes, for example, the Disability Act, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act, the Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Acts and the census.  In addition, there are definitions of disability in use for determining qualifying criteria for income supports such as domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance.  These definitions describe disability in terms of an individual&rsquo;s functional ability in his or her environment, rather than a medical diagnosis or condition.  The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.57 billion to the disability services programme as described in the HSE&rsquo;s national plan for 2016.</p> <p>Persons with disabilities, including those who are blind, those who are deaf, and those who are both deaf and blind can access the broad range of acute hospital, general practitioner, primary care and community-based services, as well as specialist disability services.  I would like to outline for the Seanad the specialist disability services provided for people who are deaf or hard of hearing and for those who are blind or vision-impaired.  Services for blind and vision-impaired people are provided as part of the HSE&rsquo;s physical and sensory disability services and are delivered directly and in partnership with a number of voluntary service providers, including the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Association of Housing for the Visually Impaired, ChildVision and Fighting Blindness.  The HSE community audiology services provide assessment and rehabilitation for medical card holders and, separately, for children.  The audiology services provided include audiological assessment, hearing aid fitting and management advice, and advice on the use of assistive listening devices.  In addition, the service provides onward referral to acute hospital specialist services, the cochlear implant programme, speech and language therapy or other services as appropriate.</p> <p>There are a number of voluntary organisations providing specialist disability services to people who are deaf or hard of hearing including DeafHear, the Catholic Institute for Deaf People, the Irish Hard of Hearing Association and the Irish Deaf Society.  DeafHear is the largest provider of such services and receives over &euro;4 million in funding from the HSE.  The services offered by these organisations include family support services, assistive technology and assistive listening devices, communication therapy and lip-reading classes, sign language classes, and a mental health and deafness service.  These organisations receive funding from the HSE.</p> <p>Along with the broad range of acute hospital services, general practitioner and community care services and the specialist services outlined above, the HSE also supports the Anne Sullivan Foundation for Deafblind.  The foundation is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 and provides residential services for people who are deaf-blind.  The foundation receives over &euro;1.9 million from the HSE for the provision of specialist services to people who are deaf-blind.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The foundation received over &euro;1.9 million from the HSE for the provision of specialist services to people who are deaf-blind.  People who are deaf-blind receive a wide range of health and professional social care services from the HSE.  They attend general practitioners and specialists in acute hospitals to provide for their clinical needs.  In addition, specialist services and supports are provided by the HSE and a range of agencies and organisations.</p><p>I know Senator White will understand this, because she has heard it before.  Not a month goes by when we are not approached and asked to define a different area differently or in a specific way.  Most of us would know off the top of our heads what these areas are.  It is our intention to provide a service with a broad range.  If Niall Keane from DeafHear were sitting in the Gallery today - I am sure he will be listening in another way - I imagine he would agree.  I have always believed that deafness is different.  It is isolating and it keeps people separate from the rest of the community.  However, we must ensure that the services provided have a broad range and that people need not fit into a particular category to access a given service.  That is important and it has always been my belief that this is the best approach when it comes to disability.</p></speech>

Fewer than 50 people benefitted from the services of the Anne Sullivan Centre, which is a primary residential care centre.  I am referring to people who are living in society.  The 2011 census gave us a figure of 10,365 for people who indicated that they have a combination of the disabilities.  The key is the combination of one or more of the disabilities of hearing difficulty and sight loss.  It is a question of suffering from the conditions simultaneously.  It is not a question of hearing loss or blindness, it is a matter of when a person has both.  That is the key and that is what we are discussing today.</p> <p>There is no register for deaf-blind people, yet there is a register for blind people and for deaf people.  That is the issue.  There is no register for people who are deaf-blind or who have Usher syndrome.  This issue has fallen through the cracks.  Please God, this is my second last day in the Seanad and I will not be back here again, but I will fight my cause in the outside world on this matter.  It is a serious matter that deaf-blindness is not recognised on the database.</p></speech>

It may simply be a question of altering how the question is answered or indicating that there might be a position to indicate that both conditions exist simultaneously.

The Government has been slowly opening a number of primary health care centres throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Full and integrated primary health care is essential, not just for curing and treating people, but for solving the hospital crisis.  Too many people are going to hospitals when they could easily be treated in primary health care centres.</p><p>I was pleased that pressure was applied in the Seanad by me and in the D&aacute;il and locally by my colleagues to ensure that the centre in Kells was delivered.  It has been built and is about to open, but a number of issues have arisen, one of which is that of parking charges.  The centre is situated far outside the town and there is no issue with parking in the area except at the health care centre.  The only reason one might go to the building is to attend the centre.  One cannot nip out to the shops beside it because there are none.</p><p>It has been suggested locally that there will be a charge of &euro;4 to enter or exit the car park.  For someone driving from Kells town to the centre, &euro;4 is a great deal of money.  Is there a policy on this matter at national level?  It makes doctors' practices unattractive, as parking can be found at considerably cheaper rates or for no cost at all in the town centre.  The charge goes against the strategy and should not happen.  I hope that the Minister of State will tell me that it will not happen.  It is not right.  There have been too many controversies about parking charges at hospitals and the inconvenience these pose.  Generally speaking, hospitals are one-off events for most people whereas attending a primary care centre is a regular event, in particular for many people with chronic diseases.  They attend centres to get appropriate treatments at an early stage in order to stay out of hospital.  Why are parking charges being tolerated and will the Minister of State stop their imposition?</p></speech>

I am always the most obliging.  However, the notion that I am in here discussing something that the Senator thinks might happen when I should instead be in the D&aacute;il dealing with something that is very serious is a different day.</p> <p>The amount of car parking required for a primary care centre is determined by the size of the centre, the range of services it provides and its location.  The development of these centres will facilitate the accommodation of a range of primary care centres, including general practitioner care, community health nursing services and physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services.  Dental, ophthalmology, podiatry and psychological services may be sited in these centres along with other integrated services, for example, mental health, child care development, disability, antenatal, etc.  However, the amount of car parking provided at a particular primary care centre must comply with the car parking standards set out in the relevant local authority's development plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the largest party on this-----</p></speech>

In certain circumstances that are dependent on a centre's location, however, it may be necessary to control car parking and charge for its use.  I am assuming that this is when a centre is in the middle of a busy and built-up area.  In these circumstances, parking fees are similar to those charged by the local authority for parking in the area.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, local authorities throughout the country operate systems of parking restrictions and fees so as to ensure that parking does not cause obstructions for other people using the roads and footpaths or accessing local businesses or services.  In primary care centres delivered by way of operational leases, a specified number of spaces are provided to the HSE under those leases.  Any additional parking provided by the developer is under his or her control and he or she may charge fees on these additional spaces.  The parking fees charged by the developer are generally in line with the public car parking fees in the area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The modernisation of our primary care structure and practice is vital to the successful delivery of services in the future.  The development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority under the programme for Government and an extremely important element in the health reform process.  The provision of primary care centres and teams throughout the country will significantly increase health and social care in local communities, which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Primary care infrastructure is being delivered under three mechanisms, namely, direct build, leasing initiative and public private partnerships, PPPs, announced in 2012.  As for the slow roll-out - I hope the Senator takes note of this - the development of primary care centres is central to this Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health system.  To date, 90 primary care centres have been completed and a further 16 are under construction.  That is in the middle of the worst economic collapse this country has ever seen.  In addition, it is expected that the PPP contract for the provision of 14 primary care centres will be signed this month, February 2016, and construction will commence next month.

I was pleased to report that there had been a significant increase in the figures for the north west.  I mentioned specifically that my own county, which had recorded <i>nul points</i>up to now, had received eight visits and that County Sligo had received 15 visits.</p><p>While visits are welcome - they are all very well - there must be a focus on what happens afterwards.  In that context, I contacted IDA Ireland to find out exactly what it does after these visits have gone ahead.  The reply I received was somewhat ambiguous.  I was told that IDA Ireland is targeting an increase of 30% to 40% in the number of investments for each region outside Dublin.  This has to be welcomed.  We have often exchanged views on this issue.</p><p>Everyone, including members of the Government parties, will say that even if the statistics support the Minister's statement that IDA Ireland investment is evenly spread, the evidence on the ground does not necessarily coincide with that view.  The reply I received from IDA Ireland made it clear that as part of its strategy, the agency continues to encourage visiting itineraries to visit County Leitrim and the rest of the north west.  IDA Ireland said that when it is marketing County Leitrim and the wider region, it advises visiting itineraries of the availability of relevant skill sets, third level institutes, industry clusters and relevant property solutions, etc.  It pointed out that regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders is also important in positioning any regional location to attract foreign direct investment.  It said it is continuing to engage in such activity, while also working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional jobs.</p><p>At least it opened the veil a little on the exact criteria that are used when these visits take place.  I think that is interesting and should be put on the record, but the main point of my query was to find out what happens afterwards.  Unfortunately, IDA Ireland was not quite as forthcoming in that regard.  Instead, it chose to hide behind commercial sensitivity in a way that reminded me what people say in all the movies we watch about America when a question arises about something.  They say &quot;We cannot answer that because of national security.&quot;</p><p>In this instance, IDA Ireland is saying that information on active leads is confidential between IDA Ireland and its client companies because it is commercially sensitive.  It is also saying that it is continuing to pursue, engage and implement active leads as they arise throughout the country.  It also says that the final decision on where to locate an investment resides and always will reside with the client company.</p><p>I appreciate that there is sensitivity involved here, but surely it would be helpful if IDA Ireland could give some indication of what is happening, other than merely giving details of these visits.  That is all we hear.  We are told about the visits.  I do not think we can do anything to change that.  Although I welcome the increase in visits to my own county and the north west generally, I want to record my hope that those visits will result in something more fruitful.</p></speech>

There has been a remarkable month-on-month fall from 10.1% this time last year to the current rate of 8.6%.  Some 5,125 new jobs were created in January alone.  It is really impressive that, on average, more than 1,000 jobs are being created each week.  I want to note this significant achievement.  I am sure all my colleagues will join me in welcoming it.</p> <p>I commend the Irish Penal Reform Trust on its release or launch this morning of an important new report based on research conducted by academics in Queen's University.  The report, Out on the Inside, documents the experiences of LGBT people in Irish prisons.  This groundbreaking research is the first of its kind because we have no data on the sexuality of prisoners.  This research, which aims to shine a light on a marginalised group of people, conveys some very disturbing findings regarding the experiences of LGBT prisoners in Ireland.  I commend it to the House and commend the Irish Penal Reform Trust for producing it today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would like to express grave concern about the revelations of abuse in a foster home in the south east which occurred over a prolonged period of time.  I know every colleague shares my concern about that.  I note reports were carried out, but these have not yet been published.  Garda investigations are ongoing.  There may well be evidence that points towards an offence of reckless endangerment, something about which we need to be mindful in any debates on this issue.  I commend the social worker who blew the whistle on the appalling extent of the abuse and the numbers of children who may have been affected.</p><p>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has announced the intention to set up a commission of investigation once Conor Dignam, senior counsel, has produced his report, which I understand is due in April.  A number of things are going on.

I always think of the great poem by Antaine &Oacute; Raifteir&iacute;:</p><blockquote>Anois, teacht an Earraigh, beidh an l&aacute; ag dul chun s&iacute;neadh<br /><br />'S tar &eacute;is na F&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de ard&oacute;idh m&eacute; mo sheol.</blockquote> <p>I feel a bit like raising my own sails, in particular with an election in the offing.  That was yesterday.  Today is James Joyce's 134th birthday, something I thought was worthy of mention in the Seanad.</p><p>I will turn to matters less pleasant.  I would like to raise the question of workers in the construction industry, 50% of whom are described as self-employed.  They are not.  Rather, they are forced into this situation by their employers who thereby avoid paying employer's PRSI and all the rest.  It seems to me to be very cruel and wrong.  This kind of bogus self-employment has cost the Exchequer about &euro;80 million a year, a considerable amount of money.  In effect, bogus self-employment means that workers and taxpayers end up subsidising unscrupulous employers.</p><p>Some protesters at the gate of Leinster House gave me an advertisement from a recruitment company, which I will not mention by name.  It categorises a number of things under the heading &quot;advantages of using a recruitment service&quot;, whereby the agency engages individual workers and forces them to be self-employed.  The advantages include the fact that there is no PRSI to pay, which is 10.7% of total pay, no holiday pay, which is 8% of total pay, no pension to pay, which is 10% to 12% of total pay, no requirement to pay for bank holidays, sick leave, redundancy or the administration costs of payroll, including PAYE and PRSI, no recruitment or advertising costs, no disputes with employees, that is, unfair dismissals - there are no rights there - and the ability to hire and off-hire staff at one hour's notice throughout the country.  The expression &quot;off-hire&quot; is wonderful.  I had never heard of before.  It is a bit like the expression &quot;downsizing&quot;.  It means firing or getting rid of people.  This is a pretty atrocious advertisement because every single thing listed is a violation of workers' rights.  I know there is some kind of commission or inquiry in place, but it is not a full one and I am not satisfied it is completely independent.  Will the Leader to contact the relevant Minister and ask that there be a full-blooded inquiry?  Why should 50% of workers in the construction industry be so disadvantaged?</p><p>It is time we examined the issue of self-employed people.  We always talking about entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises doing so much work for the country and that they are the engine on which we will rely for the recovery.  If somebody who has created jobs and employed people becomes unemployed, he or she receives nothing.  That is an utter disgrace.

He had the ability to make emigrants in Britain feel at home during the Troubles.  One always remembers him for his wonderful breakfast show.  He made us laugh so much with his Eurovision commentary.  He used to make Eurovision such fun.  Of course, there was his dedication to Children in Need, and the "Blankety Blank" quiz show.  His Irishness in some way always connected Ireland and Britain through his superb self-effacing humour and wit.  He never stopped laughing at himself, which is one of my favourite human traits.  He was the nicest man.  He never forgot Limerick.  He was always going back there.  He was made a freeman of Limerick in 2009.  I just thought today he should be remembered.</p></speech>

I only want to say I started a little business and I was not particularly great or clever.  I had an idea, a dream.  The first shop I called into was Superquinn in Lucan where one of Feargal's men, Mr. John Foy, gave me my first little chance behind the bakery and I went on to serve all of Feargal's 16 stores.  Today my business has a turnover of &euro;30 million and 200 employees, but it is thanks to Senator Quinn.  I used to see a lot of him, although he hardly knew me.  He knew me a little as a supplier but I would see him in the bakery in Finglas and over in Blackrock.  It did not matter who one was, what one was or what one had, Feargal treated us all the same.  A master of innovation, Feargal was always thinking kindness and looking at opportunities.  I could stand here and list all he has done here and all the Bills he has put through, but the Cathaoirleach would get quite angry with me.  I salute Senator Quinn and look forward to the party tomorrow.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister may not be available today but, hopefully, she may be available tomorrow.  The issue concerns allegations of abuse within a foster home, and particularly what the HSE knew and when.  First, I want to put on record that my heart goes out to the woman at the centre of this case who has become known as Grace and to her family because she suffered horrendously.  Of course, the fault of that lies with her abuser, but it also lies with the HSE for its woeful failings and dereliction of duty in protecting her and, potentially, others also.</p> <p>Like Senator Bacik, I commend the whistleblowers for giving Grace a voice that, due to the nature of her disability, she was unable to use for herself.  I have spent the past year and a half urging people to come forward to speak about their abuse in order that they can get help but also in order that they break the cycle of what happened to them.  The most disturbing fact about this case is that this woman was physically unable to do so.  The HSE had a duty to protect her and it failed her miserably.  One would think after everything we know about abuse by powerful institutions in this county and after everything that we know about the systemic and horrific abuse of children, that somewhere some lessons would have been learned.  The reality, of course, is that they appear not to have been learned.  That is appalling and disgraceful.</p> <p>I also want to deal with the wrong information given to the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to an apology which has not been given to Grace.  At best there was a misunderstanding and at worst it was wilful misleading of this committee.  It stinks to me of cover-up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2403"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2403&amp;amp;pid=MairiaCahil&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is clear that nobody has been made accountable in this case.  I cannot see any instance of staff disciplinary procedures but I can certainly see an erosion of confidence in the HSE as a result.  I understand the current director, Mr. Tony O'Brien, was not in place while all this was happening, but he was appointed in 2012, the same year the work on the Devine report was completed.  Let me be very clear: heads should roll over this disturbing and complete failure of the HSE to protect vulnerable people from abuse.  If the director cannot hold his staff accountable and dismiss those who contributed to this failure, he should resign.  I welcome the fact that a commission of investigation has been established to consider this and I hope it will leave no stone unturned, so that lessons will be learned but also that action will be taken so that we are not in this situation again.</p></speech>

In a land of no consequences, where people who fail to act appropriately, or at all, never suffer the consequence of losing their jobs or positions, such things will go on.  Last week we tried to introduce the corporate manslaughter Bill to prevent the recurrence of a situation such as the blood transfusion scandal, in which women were knowingly infected with hepatitis C but nobody was held to account and nobody was fired.  That continues, because the proposal for a corporate manslaughter Bill by the Law Reform Commission in a report four years ago was not acted on.  The safest country to commit white collar crime is Ireland, because there are no consequences for white collar crime and no consequences for civil servants who know that child abuse is going on because they know they will not get fired.  Last week, when speaking about clerical abuse, I gave the example of a case in Florida in which the church has taken action against a priest who spoke out against a whistleblower.  We have whistleblower protection here, but it is not enough.  There must be consequences for people who do not do their jobs.  One cannot fire people.  The unions will not allow them to be fired, and the civil servants cannot be fired.</p></speech>

There are 30,500 fewer people unemployed than there were 12 months ago.  The unemployment level is down to 8.6%.  We can see evidence that the income that is being generated as a result of more people being back at work is being spent productively in all our communities.  In my own town, Ballinasloe, I have seen the announcement of two new schools and investment in the local town hall, the Garda station and the fire station, and the local rugby and soccer clubs received moneys through the sports capital programme.  We hope it will remain a priority of the incoming Government that the excellent work that was commenced through the Action Plan for Jobs in 2012 will continue and will have renewed impetus.  I certainly look forward to seeing significant job announcements for towns such as Ballinasloe in the next 12 to 18 months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael Mullins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2368"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2368&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMullins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is to be applauded, as are the Ministers of State who have served in that Department, and the Minister's officials, who have worked diligently to ensure An Action Plan for Jobs was driven from the top and bought into by all members of the Cabinet.

In very hard times for Irish people in England he was a one-man Anglo-Irish agreement, and it is coming out now that he played a role behind the scenes in promoting better relations between the two countries.</p> <p>Edmund Burke wrote, "If we command our wealth, we shall be rich and free.  If our wealth commands us, we are poor indeed."  He is one of our greatest parliamentarians, and in that spirit I ask the Leader that we have more time to discuss banking, perhaps an allowance for party leaders, as would be normal.  There are four things which we have to deal with: the future of Parliament and investigations, the banks themselves, regulators and auditors.  I would hate to let each of these off with only one minute each.  Members of the banking inquiry perhaps might have something else to say, so perhaps that might be considered.  It is important, as we near the end of this term, to put on the Seanad record our response to probably the greatest economic disaster in this country since the Famine and the amount of misery which the banking collapse caused.</p></speech>

As it will probably be my last time speaking on the Order of Business, certainly in this term, and as I feel it has always been my duty here to raise issues and anomalies that concern me, I want to raise one such issue today.  I have a constituent who is 19 years of age.  He has been accepted for an access to education course in the University of Limerick.  The course runs for 13 weeks.  He was unemployed.  He chose to take up the course in order that he could get into full-time education and to a degree course next year.  He has a grant of &euro;400 for the 13 weeks.  He has lost his social welfare payment of &euro;100 per week.  His father, who is an unemployed blocklayer, is now claiming &euro;29 per week for his son on unemployment assistance.  It is costing the family &euro;180 per week in lodgings, travel and food to keep him in Limerick.  He does not qualify for a back to education payment because he is under 21.  Therefore, in the 13 weeks there is a shortfall to the family of &euro;1,563.</p> <p>This course is designed to allow this young man to do one module in his chosen subject of aircraft maintenance and would also allow him to get into a full course next year if he passes the first course.  However, by far the most astonishing aspect of all this is that the course is specifically for people from disadvantaged areas, and this man is from such an area.  How can he sustain himself financially without the required financial support?  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the relevant Minister in order that this anomaly can be closed off.  It is proof that we have done a lot of work in government in getting people back into education, but this is an example of more work that needs to be done, and I hope the Government is returned in order that we can deal with those issues into the future.</p></speech>

I have enjoyed my years here and look forward to keeping in touch with people like Senator O'Brien.  I was also impressed by her words about Terry Wogan.  I remember getting in touch with Terry Wogan some years ago to help me with a television programme.  He was very helpful and while he was not able to make that particular visit, he had a strong association with Ireland and such love and enthusiasm for the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He is not the only one.

The relationship between our two islands has been helped a great deal on that basis.</p> <p>I had a very interesting night last night.  I was asked to read a message from Pope Francis at a service run by the National Family Support Network for those who died from substance abuse.  It amazed and surprised me how many people have died of substance abuse.  It was an ecumenical service in the church on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  People are making such an impressive effort from the sorrow of having lost somebody.  It is a reminder to us that we must not take our eye off the ball regarding what we can do to solve this.  Young people are injured, dying and continually coaxed into substance abuse.</p> <p>There is an organisation called Irish Community Rapid Response which is encouraging the use of CPR training.  They say that 400 lives could be saved with CPR training every year.  That is the number of people who die due to people not having the opportunity to receive CPR training.  Every school should do it.  Perhaps every school now does it.  Every sports club and everybody else should do it.  We have the opportunity in this House to do the same ourselves.  We can save lives and it is in our own hands.  Let us encourage each one of us and every citizen to learn CPR.  The organisation, which is based in Kerry, has a very attractive team of people and needs a lot of support.  Let us encourage them to have that support.</p></speech>

I have just returned from Belfast, and the warning I received up there over the last few days was of the dangerous implications for all of us regarding the Border, if a Brexit were to happen.  I am sure Counsellor Maxwell, who was with us recently, being a Border man, will appreciate this even more so.  There are huge implications.  I spoke to a lot of knowledgeable people and there is huge concern.  Hopefully, we all have friends and relations across the water because, as we know in our own elections, every vote is vital.

Also in attendance were the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  There was a general consensus among all the Oireachtas Members and councillors present and among members of the community that this decision is regrettable and it is probably too late to reverse it at this stage.  It was put to the chairman of the meeting, Councillor Cathy Bennett, that a request be made to Government that the new Intreo centre to be allocated to County Monaghan should be based in Ballybay, which is centrally located and ideally placed to service the entire county.  The Intreo centres, which are to be rolled out across all counties in the next year or so, will function as single points of contact for the provision of all employment and income supports.  It is too late to submit this matter for discussion on the Commencement debate but I ask the Leader to use his good offices to impress upon the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection the need to have the new Intreo office for County Monaghan located in Ballybay.</p><p>I understand the Taoiseach will more than likely dissolve the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  However, the Government will remain the Government and this House is, fortunately, still in existence.  Is it the Leader's intention to have any sittings over the next three to four weeks?</p></speech>

They are nearly all women, but there are one or two men.  We need both in politics and it would be great to see all of them on this side of the House.  We need both sexes in the Oireachtas, as I said, and I extend a particular welcome to our women guests.</p><p>Will the Leader allow us a few minutes tomorrow to pay tribute to Senator Feargal Quinn?  I support colleagues' comments in this regard.  Senator Quinn has done the State some service, which is a quip that was made by somebody else.  If we look back at the Senator's history in this House and the legislation he has brought through, we see it is true in his case.  Only last week, he brought forward a Bill on the regulation of drones.  Senator Quinn is never one to drone on and bore people; his contributions are always very relevant and exciting.  Senator David Norris is not here at the moment but I hope he will be back.  I saw him on television the other night.  He and Senator Quinn are two of the most senior Members of the Oireachtas and that seniority has very evidently brought wisdom in both their cases.</p><p>In my first week in the Seanad in 2011, I spoke about the importance of education, particularly early childhood education.  A report today in <i>The Irish Times</i>by Peter McGuire points to the difference in funding for primary, secondary and third level education.  The author notes that primary schools receive 92 cent per pupil per day while secondary schools receive twice that.  For every &euro;8 spent on primary education, &euro;11 is spent at secondary level and &euro;15 at third level.  Primary school certainly is a very important time in a child's life because it impacts strongly on  formation of character, educational attainment and so on.  However, the preschool period is more important again in this regard and every &euro;1 spent in that area is vital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader for a debate on this.  The rates are &euro;62 per week per child, or &euro;73 if the person has a level 6 preschool qualification, but the teachers are not paid and the education system as a whole is left to the private sector.  I want a full debate.  I started here in 2011 stating there should be early childhood education for every child, not just for children of working parents but for every child because zero to three and three to six are the most important formative times in a child's life.  I recognise what the Ministers, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and Deputy James Reilly, have done in government because we have moved a long way, but we still have a long way to go.  I want to see it first thing on the agenda for the new Government that we will have a serious debate on the funding and importance of early childhood care and education as related to this.  It is shown that it pays back.  For every euro spent, one gets &euro;10 back, so it is not investing money in nothing.  It is investing money in the future of our country.</p><p>I do not have time obviously to say anything about Terry Wogan, but Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said it.</p></speech>

Two things come together from today's debate that were on my mind coming in here.  One is the casualisation, to which Senator Norris adverted, and the other is the employment figures.  There is no doubt the Government must be congratulated on the number of people who have been returned to work, but we still have 321,000 people on the live register, more than 81,000 people on activation programmes and more than 41,000 single parents drawing welfare in this country.  One wonders what the situation would be had the 600,000 people who emigrated not done so.  The point I am making is not a criticism of the Government, as it must be complimented, but the job of work for the forthcoming Government will again be massive and the job is far from over.</p> <p>My heart sank a few minutes ago.  Senator Wilson adverted to the fact the D&aacute;il might be dissolved tomorrow.  I can confirm it will be.  The Taoiseach announced on Midwest Radio that he will go to the park tomorrow.  This saddens me greatly.  It means I must start wearing the rubber on my car tyres to get around the country.  We will deal with that when the time comes.</p> <p>The issue of zero-hour contracts will have to be dealt with by the next Government.  The issue of those who do not feature on the live register, those who would attend activation or education programmes but cannot access them because they are not on the live register, will have to be dealt with.</p> <p>I support Senator Cahill.  The one question I ask is why somebody is not in jail when we speak about this lady, Grace.  We then find out a second person was involved in the same house of horrors.  There is something terribly wrong in this country if this type of thing can go on and it is left unsaid.</p> <p>I wish everybody well.  As I say, I am rather saddened to hear it is all coming to an end.</p></speech>

I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the House.  Since it was centralised, it has caused enormous problems for people and an enormous amount of stress for them in trying to get their full entitlement.  Two weeks ago I raised the issue here that people on the rural social scheme, under the guidelines, are entitled to retain their medical cards, as are their wives and children.  I had two cases over the past ten days where people's wives and children were refused cards because of very low income.  Since then these decisions have been reversed, but there was nothing in the guidelines allowing this to be done in the first place.  Now I see young people on the dole are being refused medical cards.  A 23 year old on &euro;100 a week, which is the maximum rate of unemployment assistance he can get, is being refused a medical card.  There is no legislative basis whatsoever for this.  I call on the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister, and have it on the agenda.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Kelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The next Government must, as part of its agenda, review the way the PCRS does its business because it seems quite clear it is making it up as it goes along and taking a chance on refusing medical cards.  Some people believe its decision that they are not entitled to a medical card, with the consequence that they go away and do not get their full entitlement.</p></speech>

I wish to turn my attention to the latter.  There is a need for the Government to take a much firmer hand in trying to dissuade people, particularly the young, from consuming alcohol to excess.  A hotel owner who is a friend of mine said to me some years ago that if we were fortunate enough to have had a couple of quid in our pockets when we were young and went out to drink, we might have got drunk, but nowadays the intent of young people is not just to drink but to get drunk and become blotto.  There is too close an association between sport and alcohol.  A campaign was mounted lately to try to remove the prohibition on selling alcohol on certain days.  I believe the Government should consider having more days on which there is a prohibition, especially around holiday weekends when there are sports events.  The level of hardship drinking causes individuals and families is enormous.  We need to interfere and not just surrender to the drinks trade totally.  We need to be a little more courageous than we are.</p> <p>I join those Senators who expressed their concerns over the sex abuse scandals associated with fostering in the south east.  This will probably be replicated in other areas.  I concur fully with Senator Daly&rsquo;s point that there needs to be greater accountability to ensure the protection of children.  It does not exist.  Obviously in this case it did not exist.  It is interesting that this matter has come to light only through people leaking details to their politicians.  In other words, it was with luck.  I hope there will be a full investigation.  It looks as if the HSE itself was trying to cover up.  There is a lesson in that for us in that, at local level, some accountability tiers need to be built in for the HSE.  At county level, perhaps, there needs to be a forum at which those concerned can be held to account not only for the type of activity in question but also for all the services delivered locally.  This is not happening and the issues are becoming national issues.</p> <p>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  Over recent weeks, I have sought a debate on housing to deal with various issues, including homelessness, local authority and social housing provision, the problems faced by distressed mortgage holders and the difficulties young people have in obtaining a mortgage.  I propose a debate on this subject immediately following the discussion on the banking inquiry report today.</p></speech>

They have been fantastic colleagues.  I include Senators Walsh, Crown, Gilroy and Quinn.  I acknowledge Senator Quinn's 23 years of service.  He and the Cathaoirleach were elected on the same day in 1993.  I congratulate both of them.  It is ironic that the anniversary is the day the D&aacute;il is to be dissolved.  I also acknowledge Senator Norris, the father of the House.</p> <p>We have done and achieved quite an amount here in our five years but, of course, there is always a lot more to be done.  In this regard, I am thinking about education.  A matter that arises quite frequently in my office concerns those who wish to go back to college and qualify for the back-to-education allowance but who miss out on it because they have not been on the jobseeker's payment or social welfare for the required period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A situation arises where somebody has to be on welfare for nine months and may be on it for eight months and two weeks.  It is a ridiculous situation where they do not qualify and are not in a position to take up the offer of a college place.  We need to instill flexibility within the system to help people who are on social welfare and who want to go back to work.  It also applies to those in general who are in employment but want to go back to education.  Maybe their employment is not remunerating them to the degree they should be remunerated and they are going back to education to better themselves.  However, because they are in employment they do not qualify.</p><p>We need to instill flexibility within the guidelines and the qualifications and I also extend that to SUSI.  To be fair to SUSI, three or four years ago we were all inundated with queries, complaints, difficulties and challenges concerning the SUSI application system but it is down to single figures now.  There are always exceptional cases and when there are exceptional cases one needs exceptional flexibility and a commonsense approach.</p><p>For the next term I certainly want to see at Government level a far greater emphasis on education.  There is a buoyancy out there now and I want to see any young person helped who has a desire, an ambition, intent and the ability to engage in education - be it university degrees or apprenticeships.  I acknowledge the Labour Party and T&aacute;naiste Joan Burton's speech, which I watched on Saturday night, and her commitment to creating thousands of apprenticeships if the party is re-elected to Government.  In theory and in philosophy all parties across the political divide would sign up to that.  It should be an all party agreement that we need to revolutionise and create far more apprenticeships.</p><p>I will conclude on the phenomenal growth in tourism that is taking place.  There is an argument for the return of CERT.  It was a fantastic way of training chefs and people within the hospitality industry.  I cannot understand for the life of me why it was discontinued but we need to reignite CERT.  It would bring back quality to the hospitality, catering and tourism industry.</p></speech>

It was one of the challenges faced by this Cabinet and the Government.  It is a huge achievement to now have unemployment rates down to 8.6% and a huge growth in the number of people at work.  It will not be too long before we have over 2 million people working.  When we joined the European Union we had only 1 million people working back in the 1970s.  However, we need to ensure that we continue along that path.</p> <p>We have major challenges facing us no matter who is in government.  By the time the incoming Government leaves office there will be over 100,000 more people over the age of 65.  There will be more demand on pensions and on the health care sector.  When one looks at the health care sector, 51% of all people in hospital are over the age of 65.  Over the next 14 years the numbers of over 65s will increase from 600,000 currently to over 990,000.  We will have huge demands in the health care area because of this change in demographics.  In order to fund that we also have to have more people at work.  It is not just about reducing the number of people who are unemployed, it is also about continuing to grow the number of people who are employed and available for employment.</p> <p>I am very saddened that we have not made progress on the issue of people to whom we provide a comprehensive education but who, once they have finished in universities, are emigrating within a short time, particularly our junior doctors.  We now have a major challenge in that area.  There are problems when hospitals employ junior doctors under agency contracts and junior doctors are no longer getting the level of pay they should get for the work they do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are not getting the same level of support to engage in further education and training.  It is disappointing that no progress has been made in this area in the past four years.  The new Government must prioritise this issue.  As well as providing funding for education, we must also offer health service staff attractive employment conditions.  This will convince them to stay in Ireland and further their education in the health sector and ensure we do not rely on overseas doctors for hospital and general practice services.  The next Government must adopt this issue as a priority and Members of the next Seanad must continue to raise and work on it in the next five years.</p></speech>

I raised the issue at the start of the session.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government my request that he make high visibility vests compulsory for cyclists and pedestrians.  I understand that, on average, approximately 50 of the people killed on the roads each year are not wearing high visibility vests.  I frequently drive in rural areas.  When negotiating country roads, especially at this time of year when we have a great deal of fog, rain and mist, it can be difficult when one encounters a walker or cyclist without a visibility vest.  Many rules and regulations are in place governing safety in cars.  The possibility of making visibility vests mandatory should be considered.  I am not advocating for a nanny state but if this measure could save one or two lives each year, it should be made compulsory.  Perhaps a pilot project could be introduced for children making the journey to and from school.  The elderly are also particularly vulnerable as are pedestrians and cyclists.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the saying that one can lead a horse to water but one cannot make him drink applies.  The companies in question must decide whether they wish to locate in County Waterford, County Leitrim, Paris or elsewhere because that is the nature of competition.  IDA Ireland has a difficult job and has played an excellent role in recent years in creating jobs and assisting companies to locate in Ireland.  The creation of between 135,000 and 140,000 jobs speaks volumes about the efforts made by IDA Ireland and the success of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.</p> <p>On that point, Senator Bacik welcomed the news that unemployment has declined from more than 15.5% when the Government took office to the current rate of 8.6%.  As Senator Craughwell stated, that is all very well.  However, the Government recognises that a significant amount of work remains to be done in that area.  To borrow a slogan from another party, a lot has been done, but there is more to do.  The main reason for returning the Government is to enable it to reduce unemployment by half again. </p> <p>Senators Bacik, Cahill, Daly, Walsh and others raised a case involving abuse in a foster home in the south east.  From reading and hearing about the case, it is both appalling and disturbing and I agree with all speakers that accountability is required.  I understand criminal investigations are ongoing and I welcome the commitment to establish a commission of investigation into the matter.  I also compliment the whistleblowers involved, without whom the case would have gone unnoticed, which is unacceptable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure that if criminal offences occurred, the Garda will investigate it.  I welcome the commission of investigation.  There is a need for accountability and transparency around this appalling issue.</p><p>Senator Norris, as he would as a Joycean scholar, welcomed the 134th birthday of James Joyce.  The Senator also raised the conditions of workers, in particular, in the construction industry.  The exploitation of any workers is to be deplored.  If they are going about it in this way, by making workers self-employed by whatever means, it is totally unacceptable.  That was the subject of a Private Members' Bill that the Labour Party introduced on the rights of the self-employed and around that area.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, agreed to accept the Bill on that occasion.  I hope his issue will be acted upon as a matter of urgency, if not by this Government then by the incoming Government.</p><p>Senator O'Brien praised Terry Wogan.  Mr. Wogan was a wonderful Irishman.  He was gentle and charming and had a witty style which the public enjoyed.  The public remained loyal to him until the very end.  I note Mr. Wogan's comments on journalism nowadays.  He said that radio stations now like people who are "louder, brasher and more shouty".  He said, "I do not like shouty".  That is something that some of the radio presenters of the day might take note of.</p><p>I think I have addressed the matter raised by Senator Cahill.  I tried to have a debate on the issue today but I understand that Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch is in the other House from 5.00 p.m. until 7.30 p.m. and may be there longer than that.  I will try to facilitate a debate but I am not suggesting that I will be successful in holding one tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Daly referred to role of people in public services and the need for more transparency.

If that is not done, I will arrange for it immediately.</p> <p>Senator Mullins referred to the Action Plan for Jobs and lauded the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and Ministers of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputies Damien English and Gerald Nash on the unemployment figures and called for a debate on that issue in the future.</p> <p>I wish to tell Senator Barrett that I had sought more than the hour in which we have to debate the banking inquiry, but I am prepared to amend the Order of Business to give six minutes to the spokespersons and four minutes to all other Senators.  If some of the spokespersons do not wish to use six minutes, they might stick to four minutes and allow as many Senators as possible to contribute to the debate.  I will propose an amendment that spokespersons speak for six minutes and all other Senators for four minutes in the debate on the banking inquiry.</p> <p>Senator Landy mentioned the case of a constituent seeking an education course.  I would suggest to Senator Landy to put down a Commencement matter for that item.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Quinn spoke about Terry Wogan and mentioned the address he made yesterday to the National Family Support Network about people who have died from substance abuse.  It is frightening how many people have died from substance abuse.</p><p>CPR training is of paramount importance.  There is no doubt that schools and clubs do it, and even in the House, I believe, we received notice last week that training was available.  It is very important that people are involved with CPR training.</p><p>Senator O'Brien made some comments about Senator Quinn.  I wish to acknowledge that Senator Quinn will celebrate 23 years in the House tomorrow.  I am sure everyone would agree that Senator Quinn is one of the most outstanding Senators we have had in this House and I believe he has greatly enhanced the Seanad by his presence here.  He has been unfailingly courteous, thoughtful and measured in all his contributions in the House.  He leaves a considerable legacy and a volume of private members' legislation that he initiated.  I would like to wish Senator Quinn every success for the future.  I understand he will not be contesting the next election.  The House will sadly miss his presence and I wish him good health and happiness for the future.</p></speech>

We all hope that an agreement will be reached between the UK and the EU in their deliberations which will avoid such an event.</p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke about the transferral of some jobs from Ballybay to Monaghan town and suggested that the Intreo office that is coming in the future should be located in Ballybay.  I will make those representations to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and with the one or two days we have left in this term, the Senator could table a Commencement debate on the matter for the Minister.</p> <p>On the subject of sittings, after the D&aacute;il is finished I have no plans to have a meeting of the Seanad in the next three or four weeks.  Not having Ministers in here would be like having a parish without a priest.</p></speech>

She rightly said that the Government had made some progress, but there is a need for further progress in that area.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to workers and unemployment.  I note his points in that regard.  While I welcome the reduction in the unemployment figures, I acknowledge that there is a need for further work to be done in that area.  I agree with the Senator on that.</p> <p>Senator Kelly raised the issue of medical cards and difficulties with the PCRS.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  We have seen good progress but we will have difficulties with individual applications from time to time.</p> <p>Senator Walsh warned of the dangers of excess alcohol and alcohol abuse, and spoke about the link between sport and alcohol.  That is something that has been debated and commented upon in the House over the years, and I believe it will be commented and acted upon by any new Government that comes into being.</p> <p>I note Senator Walsh's points about foster care.  I am afraid that in the short period of time we have left, having had a number of debates on housing generally over the last number of months, I cannot accede to the Senator's request to amend the Order of Business in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about further education and the need for every assistance to be given to young people, in particular, who are trying to access education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thoroughly agree with him in that regard.  The Senator also referred to the need for further consideration in respect of CERT, which was an excellent organisation.  There may be a need to put in place something similar to it in order to increase the number of apprenticeships, particularly in the hospitality and catering sectors.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke outlined that there are now almost 2 million people at work.  However, we have an ageing population and there is a need for more people to be in work to pay for all of the facilities and resources that will be necessary in future.  He also outlined the plight of junior doctors, which he has raised in the House on several occasions.</p><p>Senator O'Donovan spoke about deaths on our roads, of which there have been many in recent months.  He discussed the need for high-visibility vests for cyclists and pedestrians and I agree with him.  I remember Senator Sheahan from Kerry outlining similar circumstances not so long ago.  He also stated that there is a need for such vests for pedestrians in particular.  Many people walk lonely dark roads.  For their own safety, in the interests of road safety and for the benefit of drivers, people should wear high-visibility vests in such circumstances.  I agree with the Senator in this regard.</p><p>I do not propose to accept the amendments to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

The hard work and commitment of the Deputies and Senators involved must be properly recognised.  I would like to recognise the contribution of all members of the committee in regard to the large amount of work they carried out.</p> <p>The banking inquiry was the first of its kind under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiry, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013.  It is fair to say, therefore, that it was a learning experience for all involved and proved to be a challenging road.  It is, therefore, admirable on the part of the committee and its support team, through their collective endeavours, that we are here today discussing the report&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.  I am sure we will learn from this process in terms of how we can improve the operation of this type of inquiry.  Indeed, the second volume of the report deals with this specific issue and I am sure the Senators involved will share their experiences in this regard.</p> <p>The main findings and recommendations of the inquiry are welcomed by the Government.  Obviously it will be a matter for the next Government to consider and act on those recommendations.  It is important at this stage to note on the record of the House the key findings in the report.  They include the fact that no single decision or event led to the failure of the banks.  Rather, it was the result of a cumulative series of events and decisions over a number of years.</p> <p>There were in fact two crises rather than one, namely, a fiscal crisis and a banking crisis.  The lending practices of the banks made them vulnerable to a liquidity risk which was not recognised.  Banks had, by 2008, moved away from prudent lending principles towards a riskier asset value based lending model in their dealings with the property development sector.  The business model of some key developers during the boom years led to them being overwhelmingly reliant on Irish financial institutions.  The Central Bank and Financial Regulator had sufficient powers with which to do their job effectively and could have required banks to hold additional capital to absorb losses that could have arisen in the event of a financial crisis.</p> <p>An independent review and assessment of the effectiveness of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority, created in 2003, should have been carried out by Government, but it was the execution by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of their mandate and the absence of interventions that directly contributed to the crisis.  The systemic risk that was building up in the banking sector was not identified by the Financial Regulator.  The financial stability reports of the Central Bank, while monitoring the key risks to the financial system and financial stability, did not identify those key risks.</p> <p>The Department of Finance relied too heavily on reports of the Central Bank and external agencies such as the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission.  The soft landing theory accepted by the Department and external agencies was not substantiated by robust analysis or research.  The Government at the time did not always follow the advice put forward by the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.  In 2010, the ECB threatened the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, that it would not continue to provide emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, for the Irish banks if Ireland did not enter into a bailout programme.</p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s entry into a bailout by October 2010 was inevitable, but the timing of the entry was determined by factors outside the Government&rsquo;s control.  The ECB&rsquo;s position on imposing losses on senior bondholders in November 2010 and March 2011 contributed to the inappropriate placing of significant banking debts on Irish citizens.  As a citizen, I found the manner in which the Houses of the Oireachtas and Irish people were treated by the ECB, in terms of its lack of appropriate interaction with the inquiry, disappointing.  I am sure it was a source of great frustration and contrasts very sharply with how other international agencies and organisations co-operated with the inquiry.  I do not think that is acceptable.  It is something we should regret on a collective basis and it must not happen again.</p> <p>I pay tribute to Senators D'Arcy, O'Keeffe, Barrett and MacSharry, who were members of the inquiry, and thank them for their collective bipartisan work.  While there has been much commentary on the report, some of which we will hear today, it is important to say that, as a citizen, to see people come before the committee and testify in public for the first time and give their perspective and knowledge of the events that created one of the most unprecedented crises in the history of the State was powerful.  It was something no other inquiry ever did.  While it is fair to say that the report may not be earth-shattering, the fact that people came before the inquiry and testified in public and citizens had an opportunity to see decision-makers from a wide range of society testify has done the State significant service.</p> <p>The committee operated in a bipartisan fashion when so many critics were eager to talk it down.  It is regrettable that some of those who were loudest in criticising and talking about the report of the banking inquiry were those who refused to serve on the committee.  I look forward to the debate and thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p></speech>

The members of the inquiry were exhausted by the sheer volume of work.  There was a tremendous effort on the part of the committee and the significance of this undertaking cannot be underestimated.  The hard work and commitment of the Deputies and Senators involved must be properly recognised.</p><p>Tom Lyons wrote in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>about the people who participated and said the members of the inquiry were exhausted by the sheer volume of work, frustrated by legal roadblocks and that undoubtedly they showed real public service commitment.  He asked whether the inquiry was established to prevent a crash happening again or to score political points.</p><p>On that point, I refer to Colm McCarthy's very brilliant article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  He said the Irish banking bubble had been a decade in the making when it began to deflate almost eight years ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M. White:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2011"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2011&amp;amp;pid=MaryMWhite&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I recall sitting here in the Seanad and hearing this soft landing referred to repeatedly, and I was perplexed.  What did a soft landing mean?  What was the back-up that indicated there would be a soft landing?  </p><p>Colm McCarthy makes the point, which we all know, that we had a very cautious and conservative banking system.  He says that every bank went wallop and all required guarantees and capital injections.  He states that not a single detailed report is available into the failings of even one of these banks.  He further states: "All the official reports have interesting things to say about the banking system in the round and its spectacular collapse, but there has been nothing exploring the failures on a bank-by-bank basis".  That is a simple statement.  If there is no investigation into individual banks, as businesses, one by one, how do we know this cannot happen again?</p><p>Colm McCarthy goes on to state:  "In other common law jurisdictions, the investigators, including parliamentary committees, have been free to explore the failings in financial institutions case-by-case.  The report of the Banking Inquiry, as feared, has failed entirely on this score".  There is no mystery about that gentleman making those succinct comments because he is an economist.  It is his job to analyse the inquiry.  He further states: "The report sheds no light on the manner in which each bank mismanaged liquidity and vaporised capital to the point where the State had to find &euro;64bn in rescue funds for the Irish-owned banks alone".  Our generation of Irish citizens will never forget that.  That &euro;64 billion will be imprinted on our minds forever.</p><p>The report does not draw any distinction between the performance of the various banks.  As Colm McCarthy states:  "There are no rosettes to be awarded to any Irish bank but some were clearly the victims of worse management than others.  This continuing failure to explore what went wrong, bank by bank, ensures that lessons go unlearnt and the bank management and boards have been held publicly to account only in the aggregate".  I was here the night of the bank guarantee.  I recall going to the restaurant at about 4 a.m. to get a cup of coffee and speaking to one of the Department of Finance officials.  I am not blaming the Department of Finance official because we were all led to believe that the situation was critical, and that we had to do it.  This is my second last day in the Seanad - I will not be here again - but my personal opinion is that if Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds or Bertie Ahern had been here, we would not have signed up to it.  They would have kicked it to touch, and dealt with it, which would have allowed more time.  We were rushed into it.  I will never forget it in terms of the coldness around it, the fear of it and how we had to do it.</p><p>The other serious point is that the legal system put a constraint on the members of the inquiry in that they could not pinpoint any person as being to blame.  That must change in terms of any future inquiry.  The barristers and solicitors - the m'lords, as Colm McCarthy calls them - protected the reputations of those other actors.  That was wrong, and we have to deal with that in the future.</p><p>I wish the Minister the best of luck in the election.  I am sure he will win.</p></speech>

Those are the facts.</p> <p>After two years I will try to go through the report in six minutes.  The large exposures were the risk.  The banks took all of the risk regarding the commercial real estate sector.  It was the commercial real estate sector that brought down each institution, which in turn brought down the entire sector.  We must put that into context, as I tried to do in the report, where it shows our level of exposure versus that of other countries.  One other country went as far as 50% in terms of guaranteeing the assets of banks; we went to 100%, which was unheard of.</p> <p>In terms of the numbers in the report and those large exposures, NAMA and others had 29 connections, with a debt of &euro;34 billion, equivalent to almost our national debt at that stage.  That was for 29 connections.  The banks took those connections without a statement of affairs, with the bank taking practically all of the equity risk.  The competition was intense.  I heard Senator Barrett say a thousand times that banks that had stood for centuries threw that conservative approach out the window and went chasing Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>The Department of Finance was asleep at the wheel.  The Central Bank Governor, the Central Bank committees and the Financial Regulator did not do their jobs.  We made a finding that they had the powers to do what was required but what they lacked most, in terms of doing what was required, was courage.  I am deeply disappointed with that from a Department of Finance that had the best civil servants, going back to Ken Whitaker.  If Ken Whitaker had been in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator's office, he would have intervened.  Paddy Honohan and Philip Lane would have intervened.</p> <p>Another finding was that we were over the cliff, so to speak, in 2005.  At that stage it was only a question of how bad the position was; we just did not know.  We found that the ECB threatened to remove emergency liquidity assistance, ELA.  That was put into the report and it got a good deal of coverage.  In terms of what I found from that, it was the cumulative interaction between the ECB and the Department of Finance.  It was their correspondence going back to October 2010.  It was the language used with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that was put on the record.  We put it to Mr. Trichet in Kilmainham.  It was also the obstinacy with which the ECB chose not to allow burden sharing with bondholders.  However, I am glad it was put on the public record and that on two occasions the option to burden share with bondholders was put to the ECB on two occasions because almost a year later, with the liquidation of IBRC, a deal was achieved in terms of the &euro;31 billion annual payment and the &euro;3.1 billion in promissory notes that was shoved out into the long term.  The ECB does not like the term "write-off".</p> <p>In terms of who was responsible within the banks, it was the bank executives.  I will not name them.  We have stood by our legal team's direction and we have been very responsible as members throughout the process.  We left our political jerseys at the door.</p> <p>We had one crisis in the process, namely, a 750 page draft report that was presented to us.  I have the ability to read quickly and I was disagreeing with it as I read through it, while asking other members about the stage they were at.  At the end of the 750 page draft report none of the 11 members were prepared to sign it, which was a crisis.  As members we put in place a report finalisation team.  I want to record my appreciation to Senator Susan O'Keeffe and Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who stepped in at that stage, which I believe was a Saturday.  I am sure Senator Barrett will agree that they put in a huge body of work.</p> <p>We were only a partial inquiry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In truth we were disallowed from going near Anglo Irish Bank or from going near Permanent TSB.  On a number of occasions the Director of Public Prosecutions effectively did not want us to discuss those banks at all.  However, we did the best we could with the confines that were there.  I thank all Members, including those who chose not to participate - I apologise, "participate" is the wrong word - who chose not to sign the report.  We worked hard together.  I have nothing in common politically with Sinn F&eacute;in or the socialist parties but that does not mean I am not capable of working with people from those parties.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to put one item on the record.  We expect the dissolution of the D&aacute;il tomorrow and I extend my personal thanks to the Leader of the House and the Government Whip.  Before the last general election my sister was unwell and the leadership on this side of the House gave me the opportunity to travel to bring my sister from her home to Dublin.  I missed many Thursday sittings and I thank the leadership here, the leadership of the Fianna F&aacute;il benches and the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, for facilitating that.  I extend a special word of thanks to my Wexford colleague Senator Jim Walsh who facilitated me in that role, on every occasion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-02-02a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016020200002#JJ00200"><p>I thank the Leader for proposing extra time for this debate.  I also thank Senators D'Arcy, MacSharry and O'Keeffe.  The Seanad was very well served in the inquiry.  All Members across the political spectrum in the D&aacute;il performed splendidly.  They all thanked their assistants when they spoke in the D&aacute;il last week.  I add the names of Dr. Charles Larkin and Ms Ursula N&iacute; Choill.</p><p>We had to do this.  As the Minister of State has said, we cannot have &euro;64 billion walking out of an Exchequer and nobody asking questions.  If lobbying legislation comes up again for consideration, successful lobbying should be looked at and the right to ask questions should be reserved.  The world which the lawyers invited us to inhabit in this regard, as referred to by Senator D'Arcy, is impossible and undermines our democracy.  We cannot have a situation where &euro;64 billion is spent by the Exchequer and we are not allowed to ask any questions.  The lawyers are wrong on that.  I will cite later some of the lawyers who have different views on the matter.  Our democracy was undermined in the way they drew up rules regarding the conduct of the inquiry.</p><p>I will now turn to the matter of costs.  There are huge numbers in negative equity with their mortgages and 230,000 children now live in poverty.  The taxpayer was stung for &euro;64 billion, although the net figure will be about half that.  Davy Stockbrokers has estimated that &euro;55 billion of shareholder value was wiped off the banks.  UK banks lost &euro;20 billion here.  Two shadowy German banks, DEPFA and Saxony Land Bank probably lost another &euro;50 billion.  Patrick Honohan estimated that we have sustained &euro;150 billion in terms of cumulative tax increases and public expenditure cuts.  Some 300,000 people lost their jobs and hundreds of thousands emigrated.  Of course we had to investigate that.  It is why people sent us here.</p><p>Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns, on the occasion of his retirement from the High Court in January, said that a parliament has to have the right of inquiry into legitimate matters of public interest.  We have to distinguish between an inquiry into policy and one into culpability.  He said the courts had &quot;virtually paralysed&quot; the investigatory process where &quot;accountability for matters of serious public concern is required&quot;.  Former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, was quoted by Deputy Pat Rabbitte in his valedictory speech last week:</p><blockquote>The power of the Oireachtas to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process.  That power is broad.  It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws ... defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Oireachtas to remedy them.</blockquote> <p>We cannot have &euro;64 billion being spent in the manner in which it was with a guarantee that no questions will be asked.</p><p>I quoted Edmund Burke on an earlier occasion who said, &quot;It is not what a lawyer tells me I may do; but what humanity, reason and justice tell me I ought to do&quot;.  Oliver Goldsmith, whose statue is beside Burke outside Trinity College Dublin said, &ldquo;Laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law&quot;.  They certainly ruled the law in preventing Oireachtas inquiries.  Matters which are well known in economics, such as regulatory capture, drawing up tables and the contrast between the pay of chief executives in Irish banks and the average industrial workers were taken out of our report by the lawyers.  That has to be confronted.</p><p>I will now turn to the banks.  There is, as Senator D'Arcy has said, so much information in the report on reckless lending on property, reckless reliance on wholesale borrowing and reckless reliance on foreign borrowing.  The report also found that NAMA discovered that there were no proper records kept regarding loans.  The rules were quite simple and they centred on issues such as loan to value, loan to income, sectoral concentration and borrower concentration.  Banks lent to people and they did not know how much those people had already borrowed from other banks.  Banking was reckless.</p><p>I welcome the appointment of Professor Philip Lane as the Governor of the Central Bank.  He has the highest academic standards from Harvard and Trinity College Dublin.  Banks had better get used to the fact that if they have a Government guarantee they will not be allowed to behave recklessly in future, whether they like it or not.  The banks exceeded limits on sectoral concentration to 390% of own funds when the Central Bank's limit was 250%.  The banks then told us they were comfortable with breaching those limits.  I asked if the banks would approve a similar defence if one was found driving at 60 mph in a 30 mph zone.  The comfort of banks cannot be assured.</p><p>The regulators did not do their jobs.  They missed out on so many things going on around them, and the European regulators are included in that.  They gave us a currency which was not prepared to deal with a tsunami of funds flowing into Irish banks.  There was no exit mechanism and no bank regulation in this area until November 2014.  In addition, we had lost the interest rate and the exchange rate as instruments of economic policy.</p><p>With regard to the refusal of Mr. Trichet to appear at the inquiry, one can see in the report that the liaison with the German, French and Italian Parliaments was far superior to what we were offered.  In addition to not addressing the design faults in the euro currency - we should not have sleepwalked into that currency, Gordon Brown made a different decision - Mr. Trichet took the approach of the colonial governor of old.  We celebrated William Butler Yeats recently.  In &quot;Under Ben Bulben&quot; he says:</p><blockquote>They were beaten into the clay<br /><br />Through seven heroic centuries;<br /><br />Cast your mind on other days<br /><br />That we in coming days may be<br /><br />Still the indomitable Irishry.</blockquote> <p>We will not allow colonial governors like Mr. Trichet to treat this Parliament as he did.</p><p>Reform of banks is necessary and we have that in play.  Reform of the Department of Finance is necessary and we need to reform auditors.  Auditors acting in the public interest are required to be audited with new audit legislation effective from June 2016.  Bank auditors must be included in that.  How the auditors missed so much has to be one of the mysteries of this crisis.  The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, will be given responsibility for inspecting the quality of audit work performed by auditors of public interest entities from next June.  I believe that banks are in that category.</p><p>The incoming Parliament has to be reformed to ensure we have the mechanisms to deal with this.  There is so much information in thousands of documents and half a million pages.  Some students from the next generation are in the Visitors Gallery today.  We now have the means to ensure this never happens again.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and the inquiry investigation team deserve the applause and credit of everybody in the State for what they put together.</p></speech>

I use the word "responsibility" advisedly because it was a difficult and at times a frustrating task.  My wise colleague, Senator D'Arcy, described it as a partial report.  That is a very good short version of what happened because it was partial for so many different reasons.  I will refer to some of them.</p> <p>Before I continue I wish to acknowledge that while a book has been produced as part of the report on improvements that might be done, there is one thing that we ought to never repeat and that is we should never again have any committee that has ten men and one woman sitting on it.  Setting that aside as the one women on the inquiry, I believe the report we produced - I thank the Minister of State for his gracious remarks - does bring a new coherence to the story of the banking crisis that affected so many of us in so many different ways.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Susan O'Keeffe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2366"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2366&amp;amp;pid=SusanOKeeffe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also reveals many of the small details on many fronts that were otherwise consigned to files marked &quot;Secret&quot; or, possibly, to the shredder.<br/><br/>As I wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i>last week, I believe this banking inquiry is part of the growing up of this nation.  We are so used to deference, patronage and secrecy, which I believe is a very damaging cocktail whose legacy is ours to destroy.  For me, the inquiry is another piece of that work.We were not experts but we were there on behalf of the people.  That is the important part and that is what parliamentary accountability is about.  The people, not through experts or judges but through their public representatives, did not permit those who made poor or selfish decisions to hide, even though, of course, not all the questions were answered.  They definitely were not.<br/><br/>I have some examples of how those questions were not answered.  We still do not know what happened on the night of the guarantee.  We do not know what the banks said in that meeting because there are no records.  There are not even records of the documents they brought to those meetings.  We know they brought them but we do not know what they were.  We do not know how far they went in asking for a guarantee or what kind of guarantee they asked for precisely.  We do not know precisely what Alan Gray said to the then Taoiseach in that conversation because there are no records.  <br/><br/>Before the former taoisigh came before the inquiry, I noted in an e-mail that no letters that passed between the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach's office were given to us for that entire period of time.  There were no letters between the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  There were no records of any private meetings.  There were no minutes, diaries, speeches, replies to parliamentary questions or records of phone calls.  There was nothing at all.  It strikes me as a very large gap if both the Taoiseach's office and the Minister for Finance's office have no documentation.  It is clear there is a problem.  When we come to talking about accountability, we also have to face up to the fact that while we have done a job and have taken steps, we have more steps to take.<br/><br/>Last Sunday, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>produced some documents it has apparently received from someone in the Department of Finance, which are documents we did not see during our inquiry.  Many of these were memos to Government.  They were from the period 2009 to 2010.  I do not know what other documents are there but I know we did not see these ones.  What does that mean?  It means there are other documents we have not seen.  That is a problem.  Therefore, we have to work very hard to ensure that when we talk about accountability we really mean it.<br/><br/>The question we then have to ask is whether we should have gone ahead.  Should we have persisted despite the problems we actually knew about, including the lack of time, the fact that the legislation was quite limiting, the lack of answers and documents, the fact that Anglo Irish Bank could not be discussed because it was tied up in legal matters and, of course, the passing of the former Minister, Brian Lenihan?  I believe we had to go ahead and that we had to keep going.  We had to persevere.<br/><br/>I thank my fellow members.  In the main, as Senator D'Arcy has said, we did leave our so-called political jerseys at the door.  We did work hard to try to work together as a team of people interested in accountability and not our own political leanings.<br/><br/>We have to learn from the weaknesses of what went before.  As I said, in the second part of our report we discussed those weaknesses.  Why would we walk away now from that kind of process, as some commentators, who were not in the room for much of what happened, suggested?  Why would we walk away from the process now?  Are we afraid of something else?  Are we afraid that we might not have had all the questions answered?  When are we ever going to get all the questions answered?  That is not a good enough reason to give up this kind of parliamentary inquiry.<br/><br/>Before I finish, I thank my assistant, Geoff McEvoy, who is in the Visitors' Gallery this evening.  It might be said he is here to the bitter end.  We were blessed with such hard-working assistants.  Without them, the inquiry would have been much the poorer.</p></speech>

If someone can show me the perfect inquiry, I will be the first to say it is the model we should use.  In the meantime, we make the best of what we have.  We improve and build on it and commit to the notion of accountability and transparency.  The ideal of having parliamentary accountability is necessary.  If we need to go back and ask the people in a referendum for the powers that we failed to get in the first referendum, that is what we ought to do.  The next Government, D&aacute;il and Seanad must have that debate.  We must not throw away the opportunity for us, as parliamentarians, on behalf of the people and as public representatives, to try to bring people to account.  It was a first attempt.  It was not perfect.  It is up to all of us, whoever we are in the next session, to build on and make that better.</p></speech>

He said, &quot;The lending practices of the banks made them vulnerable to a liquidity risk which was not recognised.&quot;  I raised in this House in the run-up to the financial collapse the matter of a major continental bank that was routinely flouting liquidity regulations.  There was no response whatever.  It was ventilated in this House but ignored by the Government.  I would like to refer to another speech that I saw in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  It is the speech of His Excellency, President Michael D. Higgins, launching his report on the President of Ireland's Ethics Initiative.  He said, &quot;How could anybody listen to the debate that has gone on about Mr. Trichet's role in the Irish case without being concerned?&quot;.  Hear, hear.</p></speech>

This is in extraordinary contrast to the response of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in the D&aacute;il.  I understand the political motivation, but he denied there was any threat.  Then we hear that Mr. Trichet said a bomb would go off in Dublin.  I would call that a threat.  If a person mentions the word "bomb" in an airport, he or she is whisked off straight away.  That is the kind of threat involved.  It is a real threat.</p> <p>This inquiry was held in the shadow of the Abbeylara judgment.  The referendum was rejected by the people because of the arrogance of the Government at the time.  However, we have to examine this issue again and we should have another referendum.  It is ludicrous to have an inquiry that cannot make findings of fact.  For God's sake, how pathetic is that?  I congratulate the members of the committee on doing what they did in the circumstances.  The banks are continuing in the same practices as we speak.  What got us into this mess?  They ignored the ordinary account holders, treated them with contempt and ran off on a gambling spree to the casino that was the property bubble.</p> <p>Just last week, there was the case of a woman in Cork with two children and a husband out of work.</p></speech>

I am talking about the consequences, which is one of the things the report should have examined.  It should have examined the impact on the people.  People would like to know about it.  They would like to know about the hundreds of thousands of people put out of their jobs, the many people who took their own lives, the young people forced to emigrate, the special needs assistants who were taken away, and hospital trolleys.   They would like to know about all this kind of stuff.  There was a devastating impact.</p> <p>What about the burning of the bondholders?  I was always in favour of burning the bondholders.  We should have looked Europe in the eye and said, "Okay, bring us down, but we sure as hell will bring you down with us."  People bought those bonds at 25% of their face value and redeemed them at full cost.  That is an absolute scandal.  I asked some questions in this House in the run-up.  I asked, when we were giving the &euro;400 billion guarantee, what our gross national product was.  I was told they had to set out to find &euro;200 billion.  We were giving a guarantee for twice our gross national income.</p> <p>We should look at the impact on the people of Ireland.  The regulators were asleep on the job.  All of them.  Yet they walked away with these enormous pensions.  That is an insult to the people of Ireland, who were bankrupted by it.  Then there are the accounting firms.  How on earth did these people, who are still employed by Government, sign off on the accounts of these banks?  They were there to scrutinise, authorise and put their signature to accounts that said they were all right when they plainly were not.  They were borrowing from Peter to pay Paul and shifting huge sums of money around to conceal the deficiencies in their own banks.</p> <p>I compliment those who were involved in the banking inquiry.  They did a good job within the limitations that applied.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the appointment of Senator Marc MacSharry, I got out of my sick bed just after having a major operation to come and vote on this issue.

As I have stated previously in the House, they should have seen the look on the faces of Fianna F&aacute;il Members at that meeting because the jaw-drop was colossal.  They had not realised I was going to do it, but I did it in the interests of independence and transparency.  Like all other members, Senator Marc MacSharry played a valuable role in assessing the issues involved.</p></speech>

He is always interesting on this and other subjects.</p> <p>I agree with what everybody else has said.  I compliment the four Members who were involved, Senators Michael D'Arcy, Susan O'Keeffe, Sean D. Barrett and Marc MacSharry.  I accept that they put enormous time and energy into the inquiry and that very few others would have been prepared to do so.  We all accept how hamstrung and restricted they were.  I agree, therefore, with what has been said on the need for another referendum to allow proper Oireachtas inquiries to take place.  As Senator David Norris said, there is no point in having an inquiry if it cannot make findings of fact.  I accept the 28 recommendations made by the committee of inquiry and, please God, they will prove useful, despite all of the restrictions.</p> <p>As the report indicates, the regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were asleep at the wheel and, essentially, agreed with the banks.  The Governor of the Central Bank was very strong in agreeing with the banks on the need for a guarantee covering all of the banks which were, of course, reckless in the way they had lent to the property sector, about which there is no doubt.</p> <p>The matter about the pressure exerted by the ECB is contentious.  Whether it was persuasion, of course, there was pressure to accept a bailout.  We all now accept that the troika programme, involving the ECB, the IMF and the European Union, could not have been agreed to if the Government had targeted senior bondholders.  Can any of us imagine, if we had borrowed &euro;1,000 from somebody and refused to pay him or her back, the credit rating we would have had and who else would have lent to us?  We must be sensible and grown up about this.  In fairness, that was accepted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and a practical view was taken.  Because of the way the programmes were extended and rolled over, etc., we got the best deal for the taxpayer arising from what had happened.  It will be interesting to see what the net cost will be.  I accept what Senator Sean D. Barrett has said, but it might be less.  The Senator might accept this, but that is a little down the road.</p> <p>The banks were allowed to breach lending limits on property without fear of the consequences and no action whatsoever was taken by the regulator.  We acknowledge the failure of the banks.  Senior managers and boards of directors had direct responsibility.  They were responsible for the collapse.  Over-reliance on market funding and the continued introduction of new mortgage products also had the effect of masking the underlying problems in the construction and housing sectors.  We have to learn from this and that is where the recommendations will come into play.  However, we must look at the question of inquiries.  We cannot go on having inquiries along these lines.</p></speech>

Barrett and Marc MacSharry, on which I congratulate them.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.</p><p>I agree fully with the view expressed that any future inquiry of this nature must be strengthened.  It would be a waste of taxpayers' money if we were to go down the same road again.  On whatever legal experts can come up with, I am sure it will be a formula that will address the concerns of former Attorneys General that changed the public mood in the days leading up to the referendum.  It is not beyond their capacity to do something along these lines as it happens in all other parliaments.  The American model is an example.  It should be able to guarantee the legal rights of those appearing before such an inquiry and conclude with facts in order that persons, where there is wrongdoing, will face sanctions.  A parliamentary inquiry should not be a cosmetic exercise.  I do not suggest this one was because the inquiry members operated within strict parameters and did an excellent job.</p><p>From a purely partisan party position, there is no question whatsoever - I am not suggesting it came from the Government but it was certainly being aired around the country - that it was an attempt by the Government to taint Fianna F&aacute;il even further, but that has not happened.  In fact, if anything, for the general public, what has come from the conclusions made in the report is that what happened in the relevant period was much more complex, that it involved a variety of stakeholders that had contributed to what happened and, not least, that it had coincided with an international crash of almost biblical proportions.</p><p>In coming here I cannot help but reflect on how we should address what will happen next.  There is an old clich&eacute; that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it.  Three or four years ago a book was published in which the economic progress made in countries across the world from the 12th century was tracked.  Rather interestingly, was called <i>This Time Is Different</i>.  In each economic cycle governments or rulers, in taking economic decisions, stated, &quot;We will do this because, even though we know what happened the last time, this time it will be different.&quot;  If this is a political point, I make it unashamedly.  The Government is already indicating, in the way it is fighting the general election, that it will narrow the tax base.  This will result in reduced services and another crash because all of economic indicators show that we are in for troubled times in the next 12 to 18 months.  The Government's economic projections are based on good times returning and continuing without any consideration being given to the developing international crisis, particularly as a result of the slowdown in China and the American economy not powering ahead in the way it should.  The United Kingdom economy is already suffering to a degree.  I am unashamedly making the political point which I know deserves a political answer.  That is my view based on all that I have read.</p><p>I am sorry to say the Government of the Labour Party and Fine Gael does not seem to have learned from what is contained in the report, that between 2003 and 2007 the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government narrowed the tax base to such an extent that, despite the surpluses in 2006 and 2007 when the former Taoiseach Mr. Brian Cowen, as Minister for Finance, was being lauded as the man of Europe for the manner in which he was looking after the economy, two years later everything had gone belly-up.  Despite what is contained in the report about all of the gathering clouds in 2003 and 2004, it made me ask myself, &quot;My God, is hindsight not a wonderful thing?&quot;  With 20/20 vision, suddenly everybody now says he or she knew this was going to happen when, in fact, very few predicted that it would.  In 2007, in their election manifestos, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party were looking for greater spending.  The Labour Party, in particular, wanted to see an easing of the tax on housing.  It wanted it to be reduced.  These are the political realities emerging from the report produced and I am not taking little bits to suit myself.  For goodness sake, will the Government get real?  We are in a totally different economic position than we were ten or 15 years ago.  </p><p>It has already been indicated that auction politics are being engaged in by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party, as can be seen in the promises the Minister of State is making.  The Government is making promises of tax cuts based on a hope the economy will continue to drive ahead without taking account of international considerations, in much the same way as the previous Administration did.</p></speech>

They amassed a wealth of evidence and pulled together a coherent set of analysis and recommendations that need to be addressed urgently.  We are all agreed on that.</p> <p>I would like to address my remarks, in the time available to me, to one of the principal underlying drivers of the banking crisis as it developed, namely, the bubble in the property market and some of the messages that should be taken from that particular aspect of the debacle.  The report identifies that the weak role played by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank was central to the crisis.  If anything, this is a point that needs even more attention than it has so far received, because it is quite clear that the force of competition in the market drove the banks to focus on building market share and increasing the volume of lending, driven principally by the property market, at the expense of medium-term to long-term sustainable lending.</p> <p>One of the lessons we must learn from this is that markets must be regulated to put limits on that dynamic of irresponsible competition.  At the height of the last boom, the prevailing orthodoxy across most of the western world was that of market fundamentalism, namely, the belief that market forces, left to themselves, will always generate the best possible outcome.  We need to learn from the experience of this crisis that markets are not mysterious forces of nature; they are social institutions that have to be managed for the collective good.  It was the failure to manage the Irish property market that was, perhaps, the single most important reason for the banking collapse in this country.  After the turn of the century, as is well known, our economic strategy as a country went off-course.  Senator Mooney has made an important point; we moved from economic growth that was essentially export-led to a phase of economic growth that was property-led.  That was during the governorship of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  This was not something that just happened; there was a very conscious consensus behind it at senior policy levels.  I am aware, for example, that one Minister remarked in a speech that the level of house-building that had taken place in that particular year had probably gone beyond a level that was sustainable into the future and he was admonished by a senior official from the Department of Finance for being off-message.  I know that to be true because he told me.</p> <p>The inquiry report looks, for example, at how the vested interests in a strong property market extended into the media.  Whether one accepts the assurances of editors that this did not affect editorial policy substantially, the fact is that all parts of the public sector, including local authorities, for example, became increasingly dependent on the revenues generated through property development.  The weight of vested interests in the property bubble prevented due attention being paid to the downside of excessive property prices.  The injustices being done to a whole generation, as has been pointed out, in forcing them to incur massive debts to get onto the property ladder, if they were able to do so at all, still has not received enough attention.  The impact of the property bubble on Ireland's economic competitiveness, feeding through into the cost of living and required salary levels and leading to Ireland moving from export surplus to deficit in the years before the crisis, has also never been fully considered.</p> <p>One of the important recommendations of this report is to put together an official list of indicators to be kept under regular review to warn us of another impending property bubble.  Some of those indicators are addressed individually in the report, such as the proportion of State revenues derived from property-based transactions and earnings, but there are others that are also relevant and should be considered, such as the proportion of the total economy accounted for by construction.  Another is the price of houses in Ireland compared to other countries.  For example, how could one rationally justify that a house in the leafy suburbs of Dublin is more expensive than a similar house in Belgravia in London?  Another indicator to watch for is when a significant number of properties are being bought as investments and not to be lived in.  When assets are bought in anticipation of future price rises without reference to any revenue they can bring in, that is normally an indicator of a bubble.  We need to keep a watch on such indicators and keep them highly visible, so that our regulators will feel the due pressure to take action before it is too late the next time around.</p> <p>There was consideration of the role of NAMA.  It is very important to consider that NAMA has an important part to play, going forward.  We cannot allow the booms and busts of the property cycle to dictate the future of the Irish economy.  In that fashion, it is very important that we look to the housing sector and the construction sector to even out the flows, the rises and falls, the supply and demand.  NAMA could have an important role in doing that.</p> <p>A great job of work has been done by the banking inquiry and we will, particularly given the background documentation, have a great deal to consider over the next number of years.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for coming here this evening.  I want to pay particular thanks to those members of the banking inquiry, including four of my colleagues here - Senators D'Arcy, Barrett, MacSharry and O'Keeffe - who may have sacrificed part of their political career in order to devote their time to the inquiry, forsaking their constituencies while they worked.  That has to be acknowledged.  This was a triumph of what politics can do.  It is very sad that when we brought the referendum to the people, seeking that inquiries like this could have findings of fault, the people did not see what we were trying to do.  Perhaps at some point in the future that might happen.  Senator D'Arcy is shaking his head.</p> <p>The banks have not been humbled.  They are as bad as they ever were, if not worse.  They are utterly dismissive of the people who saved their hides after what was an extraordinary time in our history.  I am not so sure that we are not heading into another bubble.  I look over my back wall and there are terraced houses, built on a postage stamp, making &euro;650,000.  I just do not understand where we are coming from.  Builders in my part of Dublin are now not selling houses until they have completed the entire estate, because they know prices are rising so fast that they do not have to sell the houses.  The Minister of State may very well be back here in government in a couple of weeks' time and I am sure that if he is, he will be in the same portfolio.  I hope somebody takes time out to stop these guys.  It was a total gambler's paradise.  One could walk into any stockbroker in here, open a CFD account, and make thousands in weeks.  That was wrong in every sense of the word.</p> <p>I have serious concerns about the fiscal space we hear about, which is supposed to be either &euro;3.5 billion or &euro;12 billion.  I am not sure where it all fits in.  I fear the auction politics we are heading into.  The Government has done a great job in restoring the economy over a period of time.  We are a small, open economy and can only account for so much, but I would be terribly worried that we would now squander any part of it.  I could go on, but I will not.  I see there are colleagues who want to speak.  I thank the inquiry and particularly my colleagues in this House, who gave a great deal of their time to it.</p></speech>

I wish them all the best of luck and maybe people will recognise the good work they have done on their report.</p><p>I know it is not perfect and everybody is looking for people to blame, but one looks at the Central Bank, Department of Finance and the regulators, in particular.  I read one quote in <i>The Sunday Independent</i>, which was that the regulators were worse than &quot;a neutered bullock in a field of heifers&quot;.  That is one lesson that has been learned from this.  We set up a planning regulator today and one of the things I said was that regulators have to take their powers seriously, as seriously as the members of this committee took their powers.  They had their hands tied behind their backs.  The banking inquiry was established to try to give people insight into how this sorry mess came about and to try to stop it from happening again.

The Taoiseach has said this might have to be revisited by way of a referendum and I would say that if it has to be, so be it.</p><p>Following the banking inquiry in Britain, the committee met a year after the publication of the report to highlight the progress of the recommendations.  There are some good recommendations in the Irish report and I would recommend that our banking inquiry committee be recalled to do just that in a year's time.</p><p>I think Senator White spoke about the individual banks' culpability.  The inquiry committee did not have in front of it a report on individual banks and where they failed or why they failed.  They said there was a systems failure in the banking system, which was not good enough.  Individual banks should have been hauled over the coals to find out the individual failings.</p><p>The ECB, as has been found in the report, behaved improperly, demanding payments when it should not have.  There are differences between what happened when the ECB came in in 2008 and 2010.  It was in 2010 that Brian Lenihan was hauled over the coals and we saw what happened there.  Before that, in 2008, at the outbreak of the crisis, there was no evidence that the decision at that time was forced on the Irish authorities.  It changed in 2010 when burden sharing was looked at.  I think it is a question of the amount of the burden sharing that is outstanding for the ECB.  I know people have said the Government should take the ECB to court but if we were going down that road, we would have to look at what we might gain from it.</p><p>The report was published in the same week as the Law Reform Commission sought submissions on "whether the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State's main financial and economic regulators are adequate" and "whether there are gaps in the criminal law that do not deal sufficiently with serious wrongdoing by corporate bodies, in particular regarding current fraud legislation and the general rules for attributing criminal liability to corporate bodies."  All the members of the committee will be well versed in that, and I think the answer is a big "No".</p><p>I do not have time to say more of what I would like to say.  Again, I compliment those who are here and those from the Opposition who facilitated the Senators' absence from this Chamber during the inquiry.  Senator Jim Walsh, as Senator D'Arcy said, was one of them.</p></speech>

While we can blame international factors for a banking crisis, neither Lehman's nor the ECB caused the fiscal crisis.  Some in the Senator's own party have been good enough to apologise for the role it played.  While Senator Craughwell points out that the banks do not seem to have been humbled, clearly not every member of Fianna F&aacute;il appears to have been humbled.  Senator White said she did not know where this talk about the soft landing came from.  She could not believe it at the time.  At the time of the general election, Fianna F&aacute;il members were going around telling Opposition parties and the public that there was to be a soft landing, everything would be grand, we could trust Bertie and Brian with the gig, we should not worry and they would sort it all out.</p></speech>

I believe Fianna F&aacute;il is also proposing abolishing it to some degree but I am waiting to see the full proposal.</p> <p>We need to very careful going into this election and I mean this sincerely.  Regarding tax versus spend and the idea that it is a choice between taxing or spending, that is not the case if it is done right.  There is a way we can use tax to achieve economic growth that gives us more money to invest in public services.  A simple example was the VAT reduction at 9% in the tourism sector.  We saw more jobs created and more revenue coming to the Exchequer which can be used in our hospitals or to provide social housing.  I do not think we should have that either-or debate.  I look forward to debating this over the coming weeks.</p> <p>On the report at hand, I fully agree with Senator O'Keeffe when she talks about parliamentary accountability.  This is something all of us should defend to the death.  It cannot be outsourced.  Senator Barrett referenced the retired High Court President, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns's comments.  There is a difference between the job a judge has to do in a court and the job we have to do here.  We should not apologise for doing our job or suggest we are inadequate in doing it.  If we believe we are inadequate in terms of doing the job, we should not run for election to these Houses.</p></speech>

I make these points while also saying that one can never be complacent or say that enough is done.  In respect of the Department of Finance, significant work has been undertaken in recent years to address the issues highlighted by the crisis.  A comprehensive overhaul of our regulatory framework for the financial sector has been pursued at both domestic and EU levels since the financial crisis.  Through the introduction of various initiatives, the stability and resilience of the financial sector have been strengthened and restored to a position where it better serves the economies and the people of Europe.  I will not have time to go through all of the various changes but people will certainly be very familiar with them.</p><p>There have been some comments on the Minister for Finance and the issue of the ECB.  I want to put on record my views on this.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, set out to the banking inquiry that the ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was quite clear and that Mr. Trichet used graphic terms about what he saw as the consequences of Ireland burden sharing with senior bank bondholders.  During the banking inquiry, the Minister made it clear to Deputy Joe Higgins that he was never threatened.  In fact, he said:</p><blockquote>I was never threatened that they'd withdraw ELA or assistance to the Irish sovereign but, and you'd well know from your experience here, in saying that Ireland would be treated as a country in default and a bank would be treated as a bank in default, the implications of that to me were clear.  ELA could be suspended. ELA was always temporary.</blockquote> <p>I am quoting the evidence the Minister, Deputy Noonan gave to the banking inquiry.  We can tally that with the quote he gave on the record of the D&aacute;il and will see that the evidence was very much consistent.</p><p>In respect of burden sharing, the Minister for Finance has set out on numerous occasions that the Government considered it in the wind-down of the banks, including the IBRC encompassing Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, but was prevented from taking action due to the ECB's unwillingness to provide the necessary support to allow such action - in other words, the provision of emergency liquidity insurance.  However, it must also be remembered that as a Government, we were aware of the risks of burden sharing with senior bondholders.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated prior to the 2011 election that no action could be taken without ECB support.  In fairness to the late Brian Lenihan and the former Government, they too came up against this issue.  It is important to note the renegotiation that has been carried out since, which has improved the cash flow to this country by &euro;50 billion.</p><p>Senator Barrett has made a valid point on a number of occasions about the number of economists in the Department of Finance.  It is quite an important point.  It should be noted that the Department has significantly increased the number of economists since the Wright report.  The figures contained in that report were based on the Department of Finance as it stood in 2010, including functions and staff which have since transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  At the time, Wright completed his report in 2010, the overall Department had 542 staff.  Of this, there were 39 economists who had a qualification at master's level, as cited by Wright.  The Department of Finance has since focused on increasing the number of economists to meet the recommendations of the Wright report.  The information provided to the joint committee last February detailed that there were 70 staff with qualifications in economics, more than 40 of which were at master's level or above in the Department.  As of today that figure has increased to 89 staff with qualifications in economics, more than of 40 of which are at master's level or above.  That is equivalent to about 11% of the Department's 350 staff.</p><p>In conclusion, I compliment the four Senators who played such a key role in this inquiry along with their colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  It was a proud and good day for parliamentary democracy and for the Parliament.  Clearly, they were constrained by the law.  I share the view that this is an issue which the next Oireachtas should look at, whether by way of constitutional referendum or further legislation to strengthen the hand of any of us or our successors who may be called on in any future inquiry.</p></speech>
