I am raising it in view of the fact that there has been a quite substantial delay in getting work done, particularly in Cork City Council.  On the one hand, there are people saying they are not getting funding and, on the other, there are people saying that when they get it, there is a delay since they are receiving it later in the year.  I understand that although there was some funding allocated in 2013 and 2014 and a programme of works in each case, some of the work was not done, the money was not spent and, as a result, it was refunded to the Department.  I seek to identify exactly where the problem is and what now needs to be done to ensure this is not repeated in future years.</p></speech>

Funding was allocated by my Department to Cork local authorities in regard to social housing for the years in question across a range of expenditure subheads.  In some cases, funding was issued on the basis of a distribution of the available national funding across all local authorities.  For example, funding in respect of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability is allocated to all local authorities based on a national budget secured by my Department and drawn down in line with the allocations issued.  In other cases, funding is allocated for a specific project.  For both Cork local authorities, variations in expenditure across the overall capital expenditure programme in 2013 and 2014 range from underexpenditure of 8% to overexpenditure of 42%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The overspend was in programmes for upgrading, refurbishment and reinstatement of vacant housing units where both Cork local authorities were in a position to draw down additional funds over and above their allocation in 2014.</p><p>There can be a range of issues that give rise either to higher or lower spends against allocations.  My Department officials stay in ongoing contact with their counterparts in the local authorities regarding drawdown levels and may make adjustments where one local authority notifies a potential underspend and another may have capacity and need to spend more.  An underspend in one housing budget line in one particular year does not mean that projects go unfunded.  For example, on social housing construction projects a local authority may anticipate a level of funding drawdown on a project based on anticipated advancement of the project in a particular year.  While funding may be allocated in a particular year for this purpose, it is not unusual, with construction activity, that projects may not progress at the speed anticipated and drawdown may, as a consequence, be less than allocated.  However, as there are contracts to be honoured in respect of construction projects, my Department and the local authorities will provide funding for legitimate construction costs even where they are presented later than anticipated.</p><p>Given the variance that can arise with housing spending, the position revealed by the figures does not always tell the full story.  As local authorities are the housing authorities for their areas, however, it is right and proper that responsibility is vested in them to deliver social housing services.  Their performance in that regard is overseen, in the first instance, by the elected members of the respective local authorities.  Social housing is a key priority for this Government and my colleagues, the Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Alan Kelly and Paudie Coffey, both in this House and in the D&aacute;il, regularly address issues relating to the overall national picture for delivery.</p><p>Social housing delivery for a particular local authority area should be and is, I have no doubt, a key issue of debate and questioning in the council chambers, in this case in Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  This Government's important local government reform policy, Putting People First - action programme for effective local government, highlighted that a key requirement for an effective and accountable system of local authority governance is the effectiveness of the elected councils in setting policy and rigorously overseeing the performance of their organisations.  For that very good reason, I believe that the possibility of any social housing funding being unspent and returned to the Department should be rigorously overseen by the elected members locally.</p></speech>

I asked her to publish details of all housing allocated to Cork City Council.  In other words, what moneys were allocated?  That is not in the reply.  We should be entitled to that information.

One of these cases involves a woman in her fifties who was resident in council accommodation for over 30 years.  I do not want to identify her due to the very real danger that she may find herself in, and because of the obvious sensitivities.  She found herself in a situation in which she had to leave her home recently after enduring decades of domestic violence.  Due to the impending closure of the emergency accommodation she is now living in, she will find herself homeless two weeks before Christmas.  She will also find herself way down the housing list as a result, even though she has never missed a payment of rent on the council house that she has lived in for more than 30 years.</p> <p>Domestic violence affects thousands of people in this country, as the Minister of State will know.  An environment needs to be created to encourage victims to leave the danger they are in.  As many as 207 women have been murdered in Ireland since 1996.  In 2014, Women's Aid heard 595 disclosures of sexual abuse, including 176 disclosures of rape by partners or ex-partners.  Out of all of the contacts to Women's Aid, there were more than 1,600 disclosures of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse.  It is with this in mind that I ask the Minister of State to outline how cases are prioritised in the system.  I suggest that the Department introduce a verified points-based system to enable those most in need to achieve safe, secure and permanent housing, rather than taking cases by date order, or a separation of lists, which would mean there was a tangible way of measuring need.  Victims deserve protection from domestic violence.  Due to the increasing burden being placed on voluntary organisations, which do a great job in providing emergency accommodation, I ask that the Minister of State consider a new approach to the allocation of housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120100002#D00800"><p>Again, I thank the Senator for raising this very serious issue, which unfortunately continues to be a blight on society and has a terrible impact on victims and their families.  It is important to note that housing authorities do not provide or oversee services specifically designed for victims of domestic violence.  Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims of domestic abuse rests with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the delivery of such services is managed through the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.</p> <p>Victims of domestic violence who seek emergency accommodation from a housing authority are generally placed in temporary accommodation arranged by the council or operated by a voluntary service provider.  It is not necessary for such persons to go on the general housing waiting list to avail of short-term emergency housing.  Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homelessness definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>Where victims of domestic violence need continued State support to meet their housing needs, housing authorities are encouraged to work with all service providers to ensure that a victim's housing eligibility and need is assessed in a timely manner.  This assessment is carried out in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which includes a review of the suitability of the household's current accommodation having regard to a number of considerations, including particular household circumstances or on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  This provision allows a housing authority to consider victims of domestic violence as having a housing need and allows them to be placed on a housing list where all other criteria are met.</p> <p>The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes made under section 22 of the 2009 Act.  Each housing authority is required to make an allocation scheme specifying, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households and classes of households on the waiting list.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Allocation schemes may also contain provisions for exceptional or emergency cases, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting list priorities, should circumstances warrant it.</p><p>While the allocation of support is a matter for individual local authorities, the 2009 Housing Act provides that the Minister may issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of an allocation scheme and the housing authority is required to comply with any such direction.  Using this power, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, issued a direction, which applies until 31 January 2016, to key local authorities requiring them to prioritise homeless and vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control.  Victims of domestic violence who are considered homeless by the housing authority or who are in accommodation that is considered unsuitable, on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds, and who are qualified for social housing support on or before 1 June 2015 may benefit under this direction.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current provisions and arrangements provide local authorities with appropriate mechanisms to ensure that sufficient priority is afforded to victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable groups.  In addition to the current provisions, which allow for the adequate prioritisation of victims, my Department is involved in a number of initiatives which support victims.  Under my Department's capital assistance scheme, support may be provided through housing authorities towards approved housing bodies, AHB, costs in providing accommodation for persons that are qualified for social housing supports that may have particular accommodation needs.  There are a number of AHBs which have an emphasis on providing suitable accommodation to victims of domestic violence.  It is a matter for individual housing authorities to prioritise the projects to be advanced under the capital assistance scheme.  Furthermore, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which was established in 2007 as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, works to ensure the delivery of a co-ordinated response to issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across Government.  My Department continues to liaise with Cosc on the development of a second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which should be finalised shortly.  While there is no proposal to redefine victims as a specific category of prioritised housing need, my Department will commit, under this strategy, to develop guidance for housing authorities to ensure effectiveness and consistency in local authority responses for victims of domestic violence.</p></speech>

I note with some concern that the direction made by the Minister only extends to 31 January 2016.  I will obviously be calling on that to be extended for much longer.  We are talking about the need to remove barriers for those who urgently need to leave their homes.  We are not talking about emergency accommodation but about long-term, safe and secure accommodation.  With that in mind and while all of this is welcome, I believe that a national direction should be given in order to have a systematic, joined-up approach.  In addition, some sort of regulated, uniform thinking is required among those allocating housing to assist based solely on need.  This is one category of victims which should absolutely be based on high priority housing need.  Would it be possible, therefore, to get a commitment that there will be some degree of creative thinking nationally, instead of dealing with such problems locally?  In the case I am dealing with, it is clearly not working.</p></speech>

A local solution to a local problem is often the best way to go.  Given that the Department is liaising with Cosc in developing a second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which will be finalised shortly, perhaps the Senator might wait to see what that strategy contains.  I could, perhaps, assist the Senator in working with the Minister to see how we can get a better recognition of domestic violence in that strategy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am mindful of not weighting things too much.

In the past year or so we have seen many protests about water charges and so on.  In some cases people were asked to pay an extra &euro;160 when the conservation grant is taken into account.  In some cases the charge was &euro;80.  In many cases there was no charge at all.  Anyway, we have a bigger problem with charges.  The bigger problem is the major increase in car insurance, house insurance and health insurance costs.  This year, many of the costs seem to have gone up by 25%, 30%, 50% or 60% for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  I know of many examples.  I have one example involving house insurance.  A man made a claim for an iPad that broke.  There was an excess on the policy and all he was able to claim was &euro;150, but his insurance policy went up by &euro;300.  When he rang and questioned those responsible, they told him that if he paid back the &euro;150 they would reduce his policy by &euro;300.  They seem to be making it up as they go along.</p> <p>This problem arose in 1984 and, as a result, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was set up.  The board last reported in 2004.  At that stage responsibility for those duties was transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Now, it appears nothing is listed on the Department's website indicating that the Department has any responsibility.  There seems to be no monitoring body.  Consequently, these companies are showing no loyalty to their customers.  Although I advise customers to shop around, it seems to be clear that there is a degree of cartelism operating with all the insurance companies.  All of them are guilty of the same thing.</p> <p>I am calling on the Minister to re-establish the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  I will set out two examples for the Minister.  An elderly man telephoned me.  He is 73 years of age and drives a 2003 Ford Fiesta.  The value of the car is &euro;1,000.  He has a 60% no-claims bonus.  He is asked to pay &euro;880 per year.  A lady was on the telephone to me the other day.  Her son drives a small 2002 Audi to bring him to college in Mountbellew every day.  The college is not far enough away for him to get accommodation there.  Last year his insurance policy was &euro;1,400 on the basis of no claims, no penalty points and the car depreciating all the time.  The premium has gone up to &euro;2,648 this year.  That is almost a 90% increase for absolutely no good reason.  I heard from another young person who told me that cars 13 years or older are particularly targeted by the insurance companies.  That is the reason the young man I referred to has had this dramatic increase in his policy.</p> <p>We put cars through the national car test.  Either the result of an NCT is of value or it is not.  We have to get clarity on the matter because families are being crippled with these payments.</p> <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the reason for these hikes in insurance charges is vast payouts.  In fact, there is &euro;1 billion in the difference between premium income and the published awards.</p> <p>My final point relates to the 3% levy that policyholders pay.  It is fine for people who are paying &euro;200 or &euro;300 for car insurance.  They can get away with &euro;6 or &euro;9 per year extra.  However, the young man I made reference to will have to pay an extra &euro;158.88 because of the 3% levy.  As well as re-establishing the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, I call on the Minister to introduce a set fee rather than a set percentage.</p></speech>

The MIAB was originally established under the Motor Insurance Advisory Board Act 1984, introduced by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</p><p>My responsibilities, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, in relation to motor insurance are limited to the requirements under the Road Traffic Acts relating to compulsory insurance for drivers of mechanically-propelled vehicles.  To that end, I have responsibility for the current agreement with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  This body was established in 1995, having as its principal role the compensation of victims of road traffic collisions caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  It is regulated under the terms of an agreement with me, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The most recent such agreement is that of 2009.  It is funded by all insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland, which must by law be members of MIBI and contribute to funding the claim in proportion to their market share.</p><p>The area for which I have direct responsibility relates to motor insurance costs and the impact they have on road safety, which is my responsibility.  On the broader point the Senator has raised, to which I want to respond, I am aware of the clear trend to which he refers, whereby there have been increases of between one fifth and one third in many premia within the motor insurance market in the last 12 months.  The motor insurance industry itself is pointing to a number of factors that are causing this, such as the frequency and scale of claims and the cost of those claims.  It is also making some observations about the operation of the insurance market and the particular requirement under the solvency II directive from January of next year for insurance companies to increase their capital reserves, which could be a contributory factor in some of the premia to which the Senator refers.</p><p>The Central Bank is the regulatory body in respect of all this, but it is only able to issue directions to firms in respect of where they price, how they operate and whether any decisions they make would risk the sustainability of the company as a going concern and then cause further issues for policy-holders.  I have met and engaged with representatives of the insurance industry regarding this matter and I believe the Department of Finance, along with the Central Bank, will be reviewing the circumstances that led up to the issues with Setanta Insurance, which have also been a contributory factor in this matter.  They will then report back to the Minister for Finance to see what can be learned from this and whether anything can be implemented to deal with the matters the Senator is referring to.</p></speech>

I sent the request to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport initially because that is where it ended up once it had been disbanded.  When my Commencement debate ended up on his desk, the Minister's Department said it had nothing to do with it.  It sent it back to the Seanad Office, which then sent it to the Department of Finance, which said it had nothing to do with it and sent it back to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Regarding the exact issue I wanted to discuss, namely, the re-establishment of the MIAB, is the Minister saying it was initially established under the Department of Industry and Commerce?  If so, maybe that is who I should have had in here, and not the Minister.  The Minister said the Central Bank was regulating insurance costs, but it is not.  Costs are spiralling out of all control at the moment.</p></speech>

As I am answering the Senator's question in the House, I will pass this debate we have had on to the Minister for Finance this week, because we are engaging within Government at present on some aspects of what the Senator referred to, and ask the Minister to revert back to the Senator with a response on this point.</p></speech>

I am pleased he is taking this Commencement motion.</p><p>I have raised this at least seven times as a Commencement motion in the Seanad over recent years.  When the new hospital groups were being established - it was not under Deputy Varadkar's leadership but under the leadership of a previous Minister for Health - Waterford was grouped with Cork in a new hospital grouping and we were promised 24-7 cardiology care for the south east to be provided in University Hospital Waterford as part of that new hospital grouping.</p><p>We have one catheterisation laboratory, cath lab, which is open five days a week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and three interventional cardiologists.  Patients may be treated in emergency circumstances from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., but outside of these hours, if somebody presents as an emergency, although we have 24-7 consultant cover, we do not have the primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, cover and patients are transferred to hospitals in the south and south west for emergency treatment outside of those hours.  On the previous occasion I raised this as a motion in the Seanad, I was told that an extension to the service would require three additional interventional cardiologists or consultant cardiologists, extra support staff and a second cath lab, involving a capital cost of &euro;1.9 million and a revenue cost of approximately &euro;2.7 million.  The Government tells us constantly that the economy is recovering, there is more money and the Exchequer figures are up.  If that is to mean anything to citizens, these are the types of services which should be provided.</p><p>Figures reported in the <i>Waterford News and Star</i>last week show that Waterford was the sixth busiest cardiology service in the State.  St. James's Hospital in Dublin was the busiest, followed by Cork, the Mater in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  A number of hospitals see fewer patients but yet have 24-7 emergency cardiology cover and two cath labs.  It is the same old story for Waterford and the south east.  While we have the population of 500,000 and there is clear demand given that it is the sixth busiest cardiology service, we do not have the 24-7 cardiology cover that people feel they deserve and need and which was promised by the previous Minister for Health.</p><p>In light of the response I received in August which referred to the cost and the resources that needed to be put in place to have 24-7 cardiology, what is Government policy?  Is there a commitment to 24-7 cardiology, are we working towards it, are there any plans for additional services in this area for University Hospital Waterford and will the Minister update the House on that?</p></speech>

The cath lab at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, performs approximately 40 invasive cardiovascular procedures each week and offers a comprehensive range of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic services.  This includes the insertion of stents, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.  PPCI is undertaken on patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, heart attacks, which account for approximately 20% of all heart attacks.  It is done in a cath lab by an experienced cardiologist.  The cath lab at UHW is open five days per week from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  Patients who require PPCI outside these hours are transferred to Cork University Hospital or to a Dublin hospital.  However, 24-hour, seven-days-a-week consultant medical cover for cardiac patients, and all medical patients, is provided at UHW.</p><p>The acute coronary syndrome programme was established in order to standardise the treatment of patients.  The model of care produced by the programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24-7 requirements of the service.  UHW is committed to the progressive extension of the current PPCI service.  Any extension to the service will require significant investment, both capital and revenue.</p><p>To provide 24-hour emergency PPCI cover requires, at a minimum, two cath labs on site and a minimum of six interventional cardiologists.  As for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding if a 24-hour PPCI service should be provided is whether there is a sufficient volume of appropriate patient activity to ensure the safe provision of the service.  Without sufficient volume of patients or caseload, staff will not be in a position to maintain their skills, and in those circumstances it will not be possible to ensure a safe service with good patient outcomes.  Given that funding for new developments is very limited, it is critically important that the available funds be targeted appropriately.  UHW is a constituent hospital of the south-south west hospital group.  The priority to be afforded to the expansion of the PPCI service in Waterford must first be considered from a hospital group perspective and in respect of the planning for the cardiology needs of the group population.  The development must then be considered in a national context and in light of competing demands for scarce resources.  The issue remains to be considered and prioritised by the HSE, in the development of the strategic plan for the south-south west hospital group.  It is expected that the groups will develop and complete their strategic plans in 2016.</p></speech>

The Minister's answer may be somewhat positive in that the issue remains to be considered and prioritised by the HSE.  The Minister said one of the key criteria is that there be sufficient patient volume, which is the case.  I gave the Minister the figures earlier and we have the population.  It is concerning that the Minister said the priority to be afforded must be in the context of the needs and population of the group of which the hospital is a member.  This will worry many people.  One of the concerns the people of Waterford had when we joined the south-south west hospital group with Cork was that what is now UHW was a regional hospital servicing the population of the south east.  If we are now ignoring this population base, we are ignoring the fact that Waterford is the capital, if you like, of the south east, and facility services patients in Wexford, Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny, but is seen solely in the context of the population of the hospital group.  It is a clear departure from how services were provided in Waterford in the past, and I am slightly concerned about it.  It remains to be seen what will be in the new plan for 2016.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the facts and figures, the population and the patient throughput in the hospital.  He will see that there is justification for full, 24-7 cardiology cover in UHW.</p></speech>

General cardiology is already provided on call, 24-7 in Waterford.  Only a few months ago - this year or last - there were three 24-7 PPCI hospitals in Dublin serving the greater Dublin area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That was reduced from three to two because the patient load was not sufficient to sustain three services in the greater Dublin area.  That decision was made by the national programme.  That is how these decisions should be made.  It is a long time since Ministers or politicians decided where special centres or cancer centres should be.  We are not going back to that.  We are certainly not going back to it while I am Minister.  Decisions will be made based on what is best in terms of patient safety and clinical outcomes.  Consideration is being given to extending the existing service in Waterford to 8 p.m.  Such a decision will have to be made in the context of the group's strategic plan.  We will have to be sure it is safe, sustainable and staffable.  Obviously, that is much more important than any financial issue.  We need to know the caseload is sufficient to ensure any new service or extension of the service is sustainable and staffable.</p></speech>

We should be proactive in our position on global terrorism, as evident from some of the contributions in the Seanad each time there is an atrocity underpinned by the type of depravity seen in Paris.  We should not feel that we are outside the loop in terms of responsibility.</p> <p>I recall a debate in the House during the bombing of Iraq.  A very vulgar title was given to the debate, which included the term "shock and awe".  It is estimated that tens of thousands of men, women and children were killed during that campaign.  At the time a number of Senators spoke.  I recall saying I believed what we were doing there would spawn a whole new generation of terrorists.  World powers are now competing with each other to bomb opposing factions in Syria.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One can only imagine the carnage left behind when all of this is over.  We can be pretty sure it will spawn a further generation of terrorists.</p><p>We have had many debates on the Palestinian situation, and we know thousands of people were slaughtered by Israel in Palestine.  It was allowed to do so with absolute impunity and was able to get away with it, even though it was suggested by spokespeople in the United Nations that it could be held responsible for war crimes.  In recent months, Israeli forces have killed 71 people, including young babies.  What do we expect the outcome of this to be?  In addition to the killings, it has devastated completely the infrastructure in Palestine.  People can barely survive at present.  Recently I spoke to a medical specialist in Dublin who is from Palestine.  He goes back to visit his family.  He said he has to psych himself up for days before he goes and he must psych himself up again when he comes back.  He said one could not believe what is happening out there.</p><p>There is an opportunity for people in Ireland, particularly at Government level, to be more proactive in our response to human rights abuses.  At the end of the day, moderates are being sidelined in this.  One wonders where the great diplomats of the past have gone.  Where are the peacekeepers?  All we are using at present is the language of war and the act of war, and innocent people, as happened in Paris and in so many other cases, are losing their lives.  We will have more of it, because the people doing this cannot be reasoned with, but we can reason with those who are moderate and we must bring the moderates back into the circle.</p><p>Ireland must be clear on where it stands with regard to climate change and the environment.  We must think about the economy, but Ireland has always been seen as being particularly friendly towards the environment.  I would say the farming community could take the credit for being the custodians of the environment.  The language we use on this is important, because if we are not seen to be supporting what now seems to be a momentum towards finding a solution, we may find ourselves to some extent being regarded as selfish and not prepared to play our role.</p></speech>

Any sign that the American Secretary of State, John Kerry, and others are seeking to intervene to try to restore some form of peace or achieve some resolution is very welcome.</p> <p>I welcome the speech by the US President, Barack Obama, at the Paris summit yesterday, where he pointed out that the Paris conference is a potential turning point for us in respect of curbing global warming.  We are at a critical point to try to ensure we do not see it take hold, with the dire consequences we all know will occur.  I concur with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s comments on Ireland's role in this.  Clearly, it will be difficult for us to seek to meet the 20% reduction by 2020, particularly because of our agricultural emissions, but we have a duty to ensure that we try to meet these targets.  The House recently concluded a debate on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which was very welcome, but in the new year I would like us to have a debate on how best to implement the policy in the Bill and how best to ensure we meet our targets in light of whatever decisions are made in Paris.  I know all colleagues will want to join in expressing hope for a positive and effective agreement among the international leaders represented in Paris.</p> <p>I commend the "RTE Investigates" team for its excellent and very powerful documentary, which many colleagues saw last night, on the sex trade in Ireland - in other words, prostitution and sex trafficking.  It had some very disturbing findings.  We are debating changes to prostitution law under sections 20 and 21 of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Bill 2015.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In light of that, I have invited the makers of the "RTE Investigates" documentary to come to the AV room in Leinster House tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. to brief us on their findings.  I have also asked a couple of independent experts to speak in more general terms about the way in which the law can impact on change in behaviour in terms of prostitution.  The links between prostitution and organised crime were made explicit in last night's documentary and confirmed the findings we made in the justice committee report which led to the change in the law.  I welcome that and invite colleagues to attend.</p><p>Finally, I welcome the Northern Ireland High Court decision yesterday, by Judge Mark Horner, in a case taken by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  The judge found a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of the failure to provide for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and rape.  Clearly, there are implications for this jurisdiction, but the Leader has agreed already to a debate on that in the new year.</p></speech>

Its research showed that nearly one in three children in care cases have psychological, educational or physical special needs.  The report highlights the need for a dedicated family court.  The authors, Dr. Carol Coulter with Lisa Colfer, Kevin Healy and Meg McMahon, also raised the reality for vulnerable adults and vulnerable parents and the difficulty accessing services such as mental health, intellectual disability and addiction services.  Perhaps that is an issue we could address in the Seanad.  We could also examine the connected issue of families, children and their parents, being able to access the appropriate services they need in a timely manner.  I commend the authors on giving us this evidence, which will help us in our work.  I also commend the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, Atlantic Philanthropies and the One Foundation who supported this work.</p> <p>I also wish to raise the International Protection Bill 2015.  We will have an opportunity this afternoon to outline our views on the Bill, which is very welcome.  However, I have concerns about children.  Many of the recommendations of the working group report regarding children have been ignored in the Bill.  Committee and Remaining Stages are scheduled for Thursday next.  Given the time that is available to us, I give notice to the Leader that I intend to table Report Stage amendments so I ask that Report Stage be scheduled for a date next week.  That would give us time to table considered amendments.  I was not here last week due to the passing of my father, and I thank Senators for their kind wishes, but I wish to ensure that this Bill is given the consideration it is due.  I also wish to ensure that children are not ignored in it.</p></speech>

We are currently debating amendment No. 42 on Report Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill and 303 amendments have been tabled.  How much time will be given to this?  Even at two or three minutes per amendment, it will be quite late tonight if we are to deal with the International Protection Bill.  I wonder if that is wise.</p> <p>I welcome the decision of the court in Belfast on the abortion issue.  Nobody likes abortion, and nobody feels one is not a complete person unless one has one.  However, it is outrageous that third parties should seek to intervene in a situation where, for example, a 13 year old girl has been raped by a neighbour and is pregnant, where there is fatal foetal abnormality and the parents decide together that they do not wish to bring the pregnancy to term or where there is a case of incest.  It is monstrous that third parties should seek to intervene.  This is a private decision for the family and I very much welcome what has happened in the North.</p> <p>I support what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said about the Iraq war and the situation of the Palestinians.  Mr. Cameron knows perfectly well that bombing Syria will have absolutely no impact on ISIS.  However, it will affect the civilian population.  He is making the very same mistake that Mr. Blair made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a disaster.

The Palestinian family has been in that house for 65 years.  There is an endless process of attrition of the civil and human rights of the Palestinian people.  The Israeli Government suffers no rebuke whatsoever because it is protected by the United States.</p><p>I am not sure I will be able to attend the briefing on prostitution tomorrow.  I saw part of the programme in question.  It is a disastrous mistake to criminalise one half of those involved in a transaction.  Nobody believes that the lamentable legislation in Sweden has succeeded and nobody believes it will end prostitution in Ireland.  I put a great deal of factual, scientific information from a study produced by Queen's University Belfast on the record of this House and it has never been challenged.  This is an exercise in hypocrisy and self-righteousness by people who are, on the one hand, pretty strong feminists.</p></speech>

It is important that we highlight the issue of AIDS.  The average number of people to contract AIDS annually in this country is 350.  To date in 2015, however, there seems to have been an increase.  One factor is that there are better tests available and more people are aware of the syndrome.  The population, especially young people, needs to be aware of the importance of sexual health education, and the curriculum in schools should be fully taught.  AIDS was an issue people did not even dream of talking about a number of years ago.  People totally distanced themselves from it or anyone who had AIDS.  We have moved on from that but it is important that sexual health and the risks be dealt with comprehensively among all students in schools during the year.  It is worrying that the number identified with AIDS this year has increased by comparison with other years.  We need to be careful about this.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on our Government to take an independent line on international affairs, as it has always done traditionally.  Specifically, we should be calling for an end to the civil war in Syria rather than for bombing more people, which inevitably results in a high cost in terms of civilian lives.  To realise this, we have only to see the consequences in the form of an upsurge in the number of Syrian refugees.  The refugees are ordinary, decent people.  A significant number of them were, like us, living normal lives but they have been bombed out of their homes or threatened with bombs or murder.  The key to this is ending the civil war in Syria.  I hope that in the ongoing talks in Vienna, in which the so-called great powers, including the Russians, the British and the French - and now the Germans - are getting involved, some resolution will be reached.  The United States and those supporting it in attempting to remove President Assad should change their tactics.  We saw what happened in Iraq when the Americans got rid of Saddam Hussein.  Instead of maintaining the infrastructure that was in place, they destroyed it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paschal Mooney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Now look what we have.  Is there going to be a similar situation in Syria?  One should end the war and then start political negotiations.  Churchill famously said that jaw-jaw was better than war-war and that statement still holds true some 70 years after he said it.</p><p>Will the Leader say when the Bill on the reduction in bankruptcy years, to be published next week, will come before the House?  Will it be a Seanad Bill or a D&aacute;il Bill?  It is very important that this Bill is brought through both Houses as quickly as possible, particularly in light of the imminent general election.  I compliment Deputy Willie Penrose, who doggedly and, initially, single-handedly fought on this issue.  I and others raised it when the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, was taking the bankruptcy Bill through the House.  I asked repeatedly, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, why we differed from the UK in this regard and why one could be declared bankrupt after one year in the UK but 12 years here.  It did not make sense and I am glad the Labour Party has seen the error of its ways in this regard and now supports Deputy Penrose's proposals.  I understand the decision has been taken at Cabinet and the Bill will be published next week.  It is important and it is incumbent on the Government to introduce the legislation as quickly as possible.  Without having had any prior discussion with colleagues on this side of the House, I assume there will not be any major opposition from Fianna F&aacute;il to the efficient passing of this legislation.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by numerous parents on the failure to have their children accepted into the school of their choice in the town.  It is clear from the information I have gleaned from parents that there are a number of discrepancies in enrolment procedures which warrant further scrutiny.  For example, boys and girls attend the same feeder school to the secondary school for the first three years of their schooling life, at which point the boys progress to the boys national school and all is fine and well until it comes to the point when the boys apply to the secondary school of their choice.  They end up at a competitive disadvantage for school places because the girls get priority on account of the fact that their school is designated a feeder school.  A gender bias exists and the impact is even more far-reaching as it is more difficult for the families in question to establish a family precedence of attendance at the school of their choice if they are unlucky enough to have a male student in the family.  One child in particular, whose parents came to my clinic on Monday, lives in the middle of the town but was placed No. 77 on the waiting list, notwithstanding the fact that the student had attended the feeder school from the ages of five to seven.  It is outrageous that a child from the centre of Athenry cannot get into the school he wants to attend.  There are other difficulties with parents who are applying to numerous schools.</p></speech>

Some parents are applying to have their children educated in numerous schools and are clogging up the system for others who are trying to get their children into just one school.  It is unfair and there are issues relating to the enrolment process which require further scrutiny.  I know several attempts have been made to look into this by the Department, on which I commend it, but given the specific circumstances which have arisen in Athenry, we must have a further debate on this issue and I would appreciate it if the Leader could schedule some time to debate the enrolment process in this country and invite the Minister for Education and Skills into the House for that purpose.</p></speech>

There is a big problem in the sense that many of the areas where there has been a significant increase in prices since the tax was introduced in 2013 are also at the upper end of the local property tax.  Naturally, the people concerned are fearful of an impending increase in the tax if the revaluation date were to be next year, as originally intended.  However, the Department of Finance conducted a consultation process earlier this year which generated more than 40 submissions that have all been posted on its website in conjunction with a review by Dr. Don Thornhill, which I welcome.  The upshot of that is we should take on board the views of professional valuers and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, and that the property tax should not be based on value alone.  Other factors such as location, size and many other aspects should be taken into account.  I hope all this will be borne in mind by the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>

School enrolment is not something that should be confined to a Commencement motion.  For some reason it is an issue throughout the State.  This week I have been contacted by three families and I could not understand why, all of a sudden, school enrolment was an issue.  There seems to be some sort of co-ordinated campaign being conducted by some schools not to enrol children or to enforce rules that always existed but were never enforced.  For some political - with a small "p" - reasons, this issue has arisen.  It has caused real concern for some parents who have had their child on an enrolment list since their child was six months old.  These parents have now been told the school cannot take their child, even though it is the closest school, and there is the potential that they will have to send their child to a school miles away.  Such situations are unacceptable.  Parents have been told that if they baptise their child, he or she will be allowed to enrol.  That is no way for any republic to treat its children and we need to examine the matter.</p> <p>The Government has had five years to deal with the matter.  If the Government were to bring forward legislation to deal with this matter before the election or even before the Christmas recess, we in Sinn F&eacute;in would lend our support.  We are considering tabling our own legislation in the absence of the Government doing so.  School enrolment is an important issue.</p> <p>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; because he raised the issue of Syria.  We need to confront what is called ISIS.  We need to confront the fanatical element of people who live in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and all the region.  It is clear to me that ISIS will not be defeated by France, Britain and America dropping bombs on Syria, and many people, quite rightly, feel that such an initiative would make the situation worse.  We need a global strategy to deal with the people who were involved in the brutal acts of terror in Paris and elsewhere.  What we will see if we continue to bomb Syria is more displacement, more refugees and more people being radicalised.  Bombing the region will not solve the problem.  Ireland, because of its position of neutrality and proud track record of peacekeeping, has a clear role to play.  As I said a couple of weeks ago, we do not have to be neutral on such issues.  As a State, we should not be neutral when it comes to fanatics like ISIS.  Ireland does and should speak out against potential wars which are not in the interests of people located across the world.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a clear role to play in this regard and I would support a call for a debate in this House on that important issue.

The appalling situation that is developing worldwide has to be a cause of great concern to us all, particularly the situation in Syria.  In the four years since the commencement of the civil war there, 250,000 people have been killed and 12 million displaced, with no sign of the situation abating.</p> <p>International peace talks on Syria commenced in Vienna in October and are due to recommence in January.  They are being led by a Syria support group.  Renewed urgency needs to be given to those peace talks.  I find it difficult to see how progress can be made while the Assad regime, with the support of Russia, continues to barrel bomb innocent civilians every day.</p> <p>As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, it is a time for international statesmen to step forward and take this situation in hand.  They must try to resolve it so that innocent people - who are arriving in Europe, having been forced out of their homeland - can start to return to some sort of normality.  I know it will be a major problem but it must be addressed.</p> <p>I welcome the formal adoption by the European Commission in Brussels of a peace programme for Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties.  This programme will bring &euro;270 million of Structural Funds for EU-funded cross-Border activity.  Successive programmes have made an enormous contribution to developing the peace process, as well as building bridges and reconciling people in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties, since the first programme was launched in 1995.</p> <p>The total value of the programme, including Irish and UK matching funds, will be in the region of &euro;270 million.  The programme will focus on four key priorities: shared education, children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relations at local level.  This is very much to be welcomed and I hope significant progress in building closer relationships and friendships between the two communities North and South of the Border will result following this investment.  Much-needed economic benefits will also flow from this funding.  I applaud everybody involved in ensuring this large amount of funding is available for the peace programme 2015.</p></speech>

I have a difficulty, however, in that every time we seek to solve problems in other parts of the world we seem to be saying what they should be doing.  I have a difficulty with that and especially in the case of Israel and Palestine.  Palestine has continued to say it does not recognise the existence of Israel.  It was continually bombing Israel, so it is very difficult to blame Israel for reacting in that way.  I am not defending everything it does, but we should be careful to allow a balanced discussion to take place on that basis.</p> <p>There is one other topic on which I would like the Leader to facilitate a debate.  There is a big concern about obesity, although not just in Ireland as it is throughout the western world.  In Britain they are now talking about introducing a sugar tax.  We should use the carrot rather than the stick.  If we are going to solve the problem of young people consuming so many sugary drinks, rather than taxing such beverages we should reduce the VAT on non-sugary drinks.  A number of Irish firms produce such products.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Sometimes they are water-based, wheat-based, grass-based and fruit-based products which are very healthy.  However, we have a 23% VAT rate on them.  Rather than automatically saying we are going to increase the price of unhealthy drinks, we should reduce the tax on healthy drinks.  That would give us a much better chance of coaxing and convincing young people in particular to look for a healthier way of feeding themselves and avoiding some of the obesity occurring around this country.</p></speech>

This action plan is part of a new &euro;250 million regional jobs strategy.  Since the national Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012 more than 20,000 extra people are at work in the north-east and north-west region.  The plan targets employment growth of 10% to 15% over and above today's unemployment levels which, I am glad to say, are reduced to below 9%.</p> <p>This plan covers counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and my own county of Louth which we all know suffered greatly during the Troubles which thankfully have come to an end.

I woke this morning and heard more jobs announced.  This is becoming such a frequent event that I almost take it for granted.  Credit where credit is due.</p> <p>Then I switch on the radio and I listen to the happy clappy economist from Friends First who told us we were going to have a soft landing some years ago and disappeared when the landing hit the wall.  I tire of listening to people like him.  That is especially the case when I come in here today and the library service gives me figures of 3,428 homeless adults, 738 homeless families and 1,571 homeless dependants - I assume they are children.</p> <p>I say to the Leader that I am not suggesting for one moment that any of us in this room can solve this problem.  We had a very interesting debate at the Seanad Public Consultation Committee with representatives of the agriculture sector which was very productive and well worthwhile.  I wonder if it would be possible to invite some of the external agencies to the House and try to thrash something out.  I do not think any one person has the answer.  I do not believe that the answer is coming soon.  However, I have children who are in the age bracket to buy property or to find homes and I see one of my family who I believe will never see the day when she will own a home.  Rents are at such a level, people cannot save money so they will never be able to get the 20% they need to buy or the get a mortgage to buy a property.</p> <p>I am not sure how we are going to solve this problem.  However, watching it happening is very frustrating.  Today we have another march from O'Connell Street to Leinster House representing homeless people.  I do not know what anyone can do about this.  However, it is time for a consultation involving all interested parties.  Perhaps this is the Chamber in which to do it.  I will leave that with the Leader and perhaps he will consider it.</p></speech>

I call for a debate sooner rather than later, with the Minister for Education and Skills coming in and giving an account of the stewardship of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have had media item after media item about parents allegedly being told to baptise their children in order to get into Catholic schools, without any evidence of this ever happening actually being produced.  It would be wrong for parents to engage in that.  It would be unfair on them, on their children, on the school and on the community that provided the school.  What is going on here is that the Department of Education and Skills has failed continuously over the years to ensure that schools have adequate places.  I happen to know that Christian schools want to provide an education for all who want to be in that school, so why should they be blamed when the Department of Education has not provided them with the facilities they need?  They cannot simply magic up an extension on the spot.</p> <p>I heard last week from a parent who sent me a very eloquent message about her frustration that she could not get her children into a secondary school in east Galway.  About 100 children got a letter to say there was no room for them.  She said she wanted a Catholic education for her children.  She appreciated this product, but she was not in the parish.  She was not complaining about the criteria, because there have to be criteria, but she certainly was complaining about the abject failure of the Department of Education and Skills.  We must not let those who are against denominational education and their friends in the media let the Department of Education and Skills hide behind this scare issue about baptism when in fact it is its failure to provide places for children, whatever kind of education they want, that is at fault.</p> <p>Finally, I was saddened by both Senator Norris's and Senator Bacik's comments on the abortion ruling in the North of Ireland.  What we are seeing here is the corruption of law, the corruption of the human rights community deciding that some vulnerable human being are outside the pale for human protection.  The lack of consistency was also interesting.  Senator Bacik wants open season, in accordance with the law, on unborn children, while Senator Norris wants it to be okay to contract with vulnerable women for the purchase of their bodies in sex.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In each case there is a failure to see the full picture.  One must be consistent when one talks about human rights and human dignity.  In that regard, we can take a leaf out of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s book today.  He set the tone for that need to intervene in the world in a way that never does harm but that seeks to deliver peace, reconciliation, justice and, above all, the protection of the most vulnerable.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is time for a substantial debate on the matter.  It appears that any time we talk about the politics and the conflict of the Middle East in the House we automatically revert to a position in which Israel is seen at being at the core of all problems, and we need to be balanced in our view of that part of the world.  We need to recognise that the state and the people of Israel have for generations been the victims of the most appalling campaign against them, and we need to reflect upon that.  Obviously, the two-state solution, which I think everybody in this House would support, seems to have faded from the political scene and there needs to be an international engagement to get it back on track.  I fully respect the right of the state of Palestine to exist but I also respect the right of the State of Israel to exist.  It is on the record that there are not only groupings but entire political establishments in the Middle East that want to wipe the state of Israel off the map, and we should not bow to that.</p> <p>Finally, I concur with what Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen stated in relation to the earlier comments on the abortion legislation proposals from Northern Ireland.  The Leader has wisely accepted that we should have a more substantive debate here in the early part of next year.  Language is something I want to mention.  Language is not only powerful; it is a very strong weapon.  When we say the easy phrase, "fatal foetal abnormality," we are talking about babies who have a life-limiting or life-threatening condition.  They are human beings.  At least one grouping representing parents who had such babies, who might have lived for a day, a week or a month, attempted to make their views known to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children two years ago but were not allowed to do so.  We need to be sensitive.  There are no such babies as babies with fatal foetal abnormalities.  There are babies with serious, profound, life-threatening and life-limiting conditions, but they are still human beings.</p></speech>

To be honest, it is quite sensible that a medical intervention for the termination of pregnancy in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality be allowed.  That is right and proper, and sensible.  That is the position of most right-minded individuals on the island.</p> <p>On the education issue, which has been raised also, I taught in the primary sector and I have received most of the sacraments, except a Catholic wedding and the last rites - some will say that those are somewhat related.  I also encountered a difficulty because I trained in England.  I taught in a Catholic school in the United Kingdom, where training for the sacraments - communion, confirmation or anything like that - takes place outside school hours, even though the school upholds its Catholic ethos.  That is something that should come into education, especially at primary level, in this country.  However, I will agree with Senator Mullen on one thing: there has been abject failure on behalf of Government to progress the idea of pluralism and reform patronage in the education sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Heffernan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2362"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2362&amp;amp;pid=JamesHeffernan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One need only listen to the president of Mary Immaculate College to know he speaks very dogmatically with a very strict Roman Catholic dogma.  As a republican, I think in a republic of the people there should be a total separation of the powers of church and state.  Such influence on our education system is wrong.  I agree with Senator Mullen that it has been a major failure on the part of the Government, and hopefully this will change in the future.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, many Members who raised points have left the Chamber.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Bacik, Mooney, Cullinane, Mullins, Quinn, Brennan and Bradford, among others, spoke about global conflict and the conflict in the Middle East.  Members had various comments and opinions on it.  The emphasis should be on jaw-jaw rather than war-war.  There is a need for statesmen to come forward to ensure we get a negotiated settlement in Syria and between Israel and Palestine.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, was here recently to discuss these issues.  We can ask him to come to the House again, but given that we have an enormous amount of legislation to deal with over the coming weeks, we will take only a limited number of statements.</p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the "RTE Investigates" report on prostitution.  Although I did not see it, I believe it was very damning.  The Senator invited people to an event in the AV room to discuss the matter.  Senators Bacik, Norris and Heffernan welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland courts on abortion.  Senators Bradford and Mullen took a very different point of view on it.  Many people will have comments and opinions on the abortion debate.  The Taoiseach has indicated that we will have a debate on the issue during the first few months of the next Government, if he is elected, and that we will take cognisance of what is discussed at the proposed committee of citizens.  There must be extensive discussions between all sides whereby we can reach the proper consensus to deal with this problem, which has plagued us for many years.  Senator Bacik also spoke on the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Bill 2015, which will come before us in the coming weeks and will, hopefully, be completed well before Christmas.</p> <p>Senator van Turnhout raised the difficulties encountered by vulnerable people in accessing services.  Although the Order Paper stated that we would take Committee and Remaining Stages of the International Protection Bill on Thursday, in view of the fact that there will be so many Report Stage amendments, it was optimistic to think that we could take Committee and Remaining Stages together.  We will deal only with Committee Stage this week.  There are 60 or 70 amendments tabled for Committee Stage, and we will have them on Report Stage also.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised the Legal Services Regulation Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He mentioned amendment No. 42.  I think we are over halfway through that Bill because a number of amendments were grouped at an early stage of the debate.  We will see how we get on with it today and whether it can be finished.  It is the wish of the Minister to come in after that Bill to take Second Stage of the International Protection Bill 2015, so it could be a late night.  It may not be.  We will have to see how these things go.  As I have mentioned, a great deal of legislation is due to come into the House over the coming weeks.  It looks like we will be meeting five days next week, with a possibility of five days the following week as well.  I am just putting Members on notice that this could be the situation.  I cannot understand why such a large number of Bills are coming in at the last minute.  This has been happening year after year.  At legislation meetings over the past couple of months, we have been begging draftspeople and others to have legislation to deal with in the House.</p></speech>

We can expect that we will more than likely be sitting for five days for the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke spoke about World AIDS Day and outlined the importance of sexual health education in our schools.</p> <p>Senator Mooney asked about the bankruptcy Bill.  He mentioned that this Government has brought the bankruptcy term down from seven years to three years.  It is proposed that it will be decreased further to one year.  I do not yet have an idea on the scheduling of the Bill.  I hope it will be finished here before the Christmas recess.</p> <p>Senator Higgins and several other Senators referred to schools admission policies and the enrolment process in schools.  That is a large debate.  For the reasons I have already outlined, I do not think I can facilitate it before the Christmas recess.  We may get into it early in the new year.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan welcomed the postponement to 2019 of the property tax revaluation.  It has been generally welcomed by everyone.</p> <p>Senator Cullinane spoke about Syria and the global strategy on terrorism.  I emphasise that terrorism must be condemned at all possible opportunities.  It is a question of how we deal with it and respond to it.</p> <p>Senator Mullins welcomed the &euro;270 million in EU Structural Funds that have been allocated for peace projects in Northern Ireland.  I agree that this type of funding has been very beneficial over the years.</p> <p>I note Senator Quinn's points in relation to Israel and Palestine.  He has raised these issues in the House on several occasions.</p> <p>Senator Quinn also spoke about obesity and suggested that rather than increasing the price of sugary drinks, we could reduce the level of VAT that applies to non-sugary drinks.  I do not know how the Minister for Finance would take to that.  It is certainly something that should be considered.</p> <p>Senators Terry Brennan and Jim D'Arcy mentioned the launch in Drogheda of the Action Plan for Jobs: North East/North West 2015-2017.  Senator D'Arcy informed us that it took place at a distillery, of all places.  The creation of over 4,000 extra jobs in County Louth means that there has been a similar reduction in the number of people on the live register.  This proves that the Government is doing well from the perspective of job creation and the development of an environment in which jobs can be created.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell asked about the possibility of the issue of homelessness being considered by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  While this would certainly be a good topic for the committee to consider, time might be against us.  We might look at whether it can be done in the new year.  We will have an opportunity to have a debate and a discussion on the issue when the House considers the planning and development Bill that will provide for modular housing.</p> <p>I note the points that were made by Senator Mullen with regard to schools, education and the failures of the Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maurice Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, more schools and extensions are being built than ever before.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-01a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120100002#CC00300"><p>I am pleased to open the debate on the Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill 2015.  In light of the importance of the haulage industry to our export-led growth and to ensure that Ireland remains competitive, it was announced in budget 2016 that the rates of commercial motor tax on larger goods vehicles would be reduced.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to those reductions.  The reductions, which will apply to all goods vehicles with an unladen weight exceeding 4,000 kg, will take effect for vehicle licences with a commencement date of 1 January 2016 or later.</p> <p>The current structure for goods vehicles has 20 rate bands, ranging from the lowest rate of &euro;92 for electric vehicles to &euro;5,195 annually for the heaviest goods vehicles.  As well as the reduction in rates for all goods vehicles, the rate structure is being simplified.  From January there will be only five bands of motor tax, ranging from the current level of &euro;92 per annum for electric goods vehicles to a top rate of &euro;900 per annum for all goods vehicles in excess of 12,000 kg.  The reductions are tapered from a reduction of &euro;4,295 for the heaviest goods vehicle band to a reduction of &euro;43 annually for vehicles weighing between 4,001 kg and 5,000 kg.  There are no changes to the lowest two bands, which remain at &euro;333 and &euro;420, respectively.</p> <p>The change will benefit the owners of some 29,000 goods vehicles.  The higher rates that apply in Ireland by comparison to those in the United Kingdom, along with the introduction of road user charging in that jurisdiction, have cause a distortion and led to comparatively higher costs for Irish-based hauliers.  The changes provided for in the Bill go some way toward redressing the imbalance.</p> <p>This is an interim measure pending the replacement of the current basis of taxation for goods vehicles, which is unladen weight.  The system is out of line with the basis of taxation in other countries.  Replacing it with a fairer system of calculation based on gross design vehicle weight is under consideration.</p> <p>There are no changes to motor tax rates for any other category of vehicle.  The total cost of the reductions is estimated at &euro;43 million annually.</p> <p>The Bill also contains further amendments to the legislation relating to goods vehicles.  On 21 October 2015, a little over a week after the announcement of the budget reductions, a Court of Appeal judgment stated that the practice of weighing an articulated vehicle on the basis of the heaviest unladen trailer was not adequately provided for in law, and that only the mechanically propelled element of the vehicle - what is commonly referred to as the tractor unit - was liable for motor tax.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The judgment further provided that such vehicles, of which there are more than 10,600 in the fleet, fall to be taxed under paragraph 14D of the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952.  This is the rate for non-agricultural tractors, which attract an annual rate of &euro;333.  Prior to the judgment, paragraph 15 of the Schedule in question, which contains the rates for goods vehicles, applied.</p><p>Following receipt of the of the judgment, the necessary technical adjustments to charge motor tax on such vehicles at the tractor rate of &euro;333 have now been made to the national vehicle and driver file.  Rigid goods vehicles continue to pay tax at the goods rate and are not impacted by the Court of Appeal judgment.  The judgment stated that if it is indeed the view of the Oireachtas that the owners of such tractors should pay an excise duty based on the weight of the trailer being hauled by the tractor, new legislation would be required to make that intention clear.  On that basis, the Bill in question contains not only provisions to give effect to the rate changes announced in the budget but also provisions to bring articulated goods vehicles back within the scope of paragraph 15 of the 1952 Act, the goods category.  This is an equitable approach as it means that all goods vehicles, articulated or not, will be treated in the same way for motor tax purposes.</p><p>The Bill is relatively short and contains six sections.  Section 1 sets out the definitions contained in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the new rates for goods vehicles to apply to motor tax dates with a commencement of 1 January 2016 or thereafter.</p><p>Section 1 of the 1952 Act provides for duties of excise to be charged, levied and paid on mechanically propelled vehicles being used in a public place.  Section 3 of the Bill inserts a new subsection in section 1 of the 1952 Act to provide that, in the case of goods vehicles, a mechanically propelled vehicle means the vehicle inclusive of the additions provided for in the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act 1960.  The current additions contained in the 1960 Act refer to a body, a part, a fitting or a receptacle.  Later sections of the Bill will provide for semi-trailers, which are the drawn components of articulated trucks, and trailers to be included as additions.</p><p>Section 4(1) excludes tractor units from the non-agricultural tractor category and provides in paragraph 5 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the 1952 Act, which is the goods category, for the unladen weight of goods vehicles to include the additions provided in the Act of 1960.  Section 4(2) provides for the new rates for goods vehicles announced in the budget.  Section 4(3) provides for the insertion of relevant definitions in the Schedule to the 1952 Act and deletes a subparagraph that is no longer of relevance.</p><p>Section 5(1) inserts definitions in section 1 of the 1960 Act that are relevant to the amendments being made to that Act.  Section 5(2) provides for semi-trailers and trailers to be included as additions in the 1960 Act.  Section 5(3) provides for semi-trailers and trailers to be included as additions in the enforcement provisions of the 1960 Act.  Section 6 provides for the Short Title.</p><p>This is a short Bill with the purpose of giving permanent legal standing to the decreases in motor tax announced in budget 2016.  The additional amendments are intended to bring articulated goods vehicles back into the category under which they had been taxed prior to the Court of Appeal judgment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The judgment was that articulated goods vehicles fall to be taxed at the non-agricultural tractor rate of &euro;333 annually.  That might have been how our learned lordships interpreted the law, but the economics of it are that articulated vehicles use lots of roads.  They have a high PCU value, whereby one translates the value of a truck into the equivalent number of cars.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D. Barrett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2370"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2370&amp;amp;pid=SeanDBarrett&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The laden weight of a truck accounts for all of the non-weather maintenance costs of a motorway.  If a motorway were used only by cars, no maintenance would be needed.  There is a rational economic case to be made that these trucks should be taxed on foot of these factors.</p><p>The explanatory memorandum which the Minister of State has circulated states that according to the judgment there is no statutory basis for the practice of weighing a vehicle with a trailer.  The economic basis is that the weight of the vehicle and trailer is what we must reimburse in our roads budget.  This should include the weight of the truck and the weight of the load.  There are weighbridges outside most large factories in the country.  Regardless of whether there is a statutory basis, people want to know the weight of what goes into the factory and the weight of what comes out.  This has a very sound basis in economics.  We need to relate this, in turn, to the number of vehicles in use.</p><p>The so-called juggernaut problem is redefined, as the number of axles a vehicle has can make a substantial difference to its track cost.  A relatively small vehicle with a small number of axles could be doing quite a lot of damage while a large vehicle with a much larger number of axles could be doing relatively little damage.  This must be scientifically worked out.  Undoubtedly, what is on the trailer contributes to the road track cost with regard to the PCU value to which I referred and the infrastructure cost.  When the trailer is laden this is also part of the bill.</p><p>What is being attempted here is correct.  Not that we foresaw what would be the result of the court case but we brought to the attention of the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, that changing the basis of the taxation of heavy goods vehicles should have been on the cards for a while.  This is because the issue is not the unladen weight of the vehicle - which has been traditionally used as the basis for the taxation of heavy goods vehicles - but the laden weight per axle and this includes, as the Minister of State said, any trailers.  We cannot allow these to go free or to be taxed at a low rate.</p><p>The timing is paradoxical, because on the night of the budget when the reductions were announced, many people in the haulage industry were very pleased with what had happened.  In restating it in the Bill, the Minister of State will surely have their support.  They were very pleased that the gap between their vehicles and vehicles from Northern Ireland was closed by what was done in the budget.  Section 4(2) provides for those rates as announced in the budget and this will be welcome.</p><p>The Minister of State said the practice of weighing an articulated vehicle with the heaviest unladen trailer was not adequately provided for in law.  It is part of the cost and it is very sensible.  We want to reward vehicles which do not damage the highway and charge people for the highway cost of having them on those routes.  It is important to do this.</p><p>We are building up a haulage industry.  As the Minister of State said, it was at a disadvantage compared to the Northern Ireland hauliers.  Firms which decide not to use hauliers also bear these costs.  What the Government is trying to do via the budget would improve the competitiveness of every company in the country because companies would get a better deal either in respect of their in-house fleets or from the people they hire.  This is why the measure has been warmly welcomed.</p><p>The Minister of State also said later sections in the Bill will provide for semi-trailers, which are the drawn components of articulated trucks and trailers, to be included as additions.  They add to the cost because of the space they take up and the impact they have on the infrastructure.</p><p>I will read through the Bill before Committee Stage but, as matters stand, I am of the view it is the correct response to the High Court decision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sean D.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-01a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1135" speakername="Ca&iacute;t Keane" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120100002#FF00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As the previous speaker noted, the legislation has been necessary since budget night to ensure the very welcome reduction in tax on motor vehicles of up to &euro;4,000 for some haulage contractors.  It is a heavy reduction that was welcomed on the night by the haulage contractors.  The court ruling of 21 October 2015 dealt with the method by which motor tax rates are calculated for articulated vehicles.  That was traditionally done by referencing the combined weight of the tractor cab and trailer and the court ruled that the trailers could not be regarded as falling within the definition of the mechanically propelled vehicle.  Accordingly, legislation was necessary, as the Minister of State and the previous speaker noted, to comply with the court ruling.  Interim adjustments were made by the national vehicle and driver file and put in place by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when this was first noted.  Legislation is necessary to both restore the prejudgment definitions and taxation systems for articulated vehicles and also to give effect to the budget changes announced on the night.</p> <p>As I stated, there were very welcome changes introduced.  Every facet of society in the previous five years saw spending cuts imposed and various taxes implemented.  Relieving taxes in one area is welcome and we have had a year packed with legislation aimed at addressing long-established cuts.  They had been in place for five years really and people expected something back.  This is one action we must take to make it right for the haulage industry and to comply with the court ruling.</p> <p>As we are discussing vehicle registration, section 4(2) deals with electrically-propelled vehicles.  The Bill makes provision for a &euro;92 rate in respect of these vehicles.  We will be considering electric cars in future.  This week the Conference of Parties, COP 21, is ongoing and we had a climate change Bill in the House week.  Only 222 electric cars were sold in Ireland last year.  One way of incentivising people to buy electric cars would be to reduce tax further or incentivise the first year of purchase with a tax exemption initiative.  In other European countries, such as Sweden, thousands of electric cars are sold every year.  Ireland is really down at the bottom, with only 222 cars sold in 2014 and a very small number the year before.  I read that from next year the ESB intends to impose charges in respect of people charging cars in public areas.  When one parks one's car in order to do so, a parking charge must also be paid.  We must examine such issues if we are serious about promoting electric cars and reducing CO2 emissions.</p> <p>We do not often get the opportunity to speak about the taxing of cars, etc.  One suggestion is to link fuel purchased to tax paid, leading to polluters paying more but the person who leaves the car in the driveway, not adding to CO2 emissions, pays less.  People currently pay less for diesel fuel but we saw what happened with the Volkswagen scandal.  Diesel cars have been found to give out more pollutants than petrol cars.  By 2010, the design of petrol cars had improved but the on-road emissions from diesel cars can be 20 times higher than lab results indicate, so we were getting false information.  Perhaps some of our legislation is based on false legislation elsewhere.  This is a matter which we should consider.  Some other European countries and the EU Commission have noted that the dieselisation of a nation's car fleet leads to costs in terms of hospitalisations, reduced quality of life, lost time at work and premature death.  I know we tax our diesel cars in the same way as petrol cars so it is something to consider, along with the link to a road fuel tax.</p> <p>We know garda&iacute; spend time stopping people to inspect tax discs and bringing some of them to court.  Those people might emerge from court and go back on the road without paying a fine.  There are police and courts costs but many fines are not collected.  If tax was linked to fuel, it would streamline the car taxation process, relieving garda&iacute; and the courts from that burden.  In addition, there would be 50% fewer cases in our courts, which would also relieve pressure on the court system.  Our taxation system would also be grounded with an awareness of environmental harm, making a push with transport systems towards greater environmental responsibility.  It is something to look consider, although not in the context of this Bill.  We are discussing taxation and how to tax cars; the issue will emerge again but this is just to put down a marker.  Everybody at COP 21 in Paris is discussing climate change and it would be remiss of me not to say that there should be some changes in this area.  I welcome the changes in the Bill that come on foot of the budget and the court case from October.</p></speech>

Five minutes will be quite sufficient.  This legislation comes about partly to comply with a court judgment and I welcome that there will be a reduction in the tax levied on these vehicles because that will put us on a slightly more level playing field in Ireland in the context of the major transport industry.  One of the complaints of the trucking lobby is that fees must be paid on the Continent for travelling through countries.  We have nothing like that here, however, so the field is not level at all.  We are at a serious disadvantage compared with the other European countries.  When this came in, our negotiators were apparently asleep on the job because they failed completely, for example, to negotiate corridors from Dublin to Donegal.  That aspect was left out.</p> <p>There are various costs here and putting Irish transport companies on a more level playing field by reducing tax is a good step.  I will take up another subject that was glanced at by Senator Keane, although I do not quite know her view on it.  It is the question of taxation of private motor cars.  I had this argument with a former Deputy, Mr. John Gormley, when he was Minister.  In accordance with Green Party policy, it should be the case that the polluter pays.  In other words, the motor vehicle is not taxed.  Rather, the tax obtains in respect of the petrol or diesel because it is these which pollute the atmosphere.  I speak with some feeling on this and I might as well declare an interest.  I have an old motoring car and it is very lovely.  It is a Jaguar XJ6 sports car with a 3.5 litre engine.  It cost me &euro;5,000 but I have to pay well over &euro;2,000 in tax for it every year.  If I combine that with insurance costs, I almost reach the value of the car before I put it on the road at all.  Most of that car tax does not go anywhere near servicing the requirements of road users.  It is used by the central Government for other Exchequer purposes.  I would very much like to see a situation where the tax on large-engine cars would be reduced in parallel with the value of the car.  My car's value is approximately &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500.</p></speech>

I think that is pretty good.  I would use a driverless car if I was covered for accidents.</p><p>There is a lack of logic here.  There is always a temptation within the Department of Finance to claw in as much money as possible but in a democratic republic we should look for some degree of fairness.  In terms of climate change and what is happening in Paris as we speak, we must think in terms of the amount of pollution.  I rarely use my car.  I drive it down here, which is a mile or so from my house, and I take it to the cathedral on Sunday and then to the club for lunch and that is it - full stop.  I make about two forays to County Laois every year and I take the car.  I will probably give that up fairly soon because I do not understand the new motorways at all.  It seems to be a festoon of roundabouts between Maryborough and Mountrath and I have simply not the slightest clue where I am.  I miss all the old wonderful landmarks.  As I am on this little foray, I note how sad I am that we no longer go around that bend in the road in Tipperary and get that wonderful, dramatic view of the Rock of Cashel.  Motorists are deprived by missing out on these glorious aspects of the Irish countryside.</p><p>I welcome the Bill but I wish the Minister of State would take back to the Cabinet a little protest from me to the effect that there is a degree of unfairness in the extraordinarily high rates of tax on old cars.  Something should be brought in that does not fix the tax at the moment a large car is bought and keep it there until the vehicle is taken to the scrap yard.  It means that old cars will be scrapped and there will be very few of them left.  It is a waste.  I put those few matters as suggestions to the Minister.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  The Bill is very welcome and it has come as a surprise to the Irish Road Haulage Association.  It could not have come at a better time.  Hauliers have been on their knees for the longest time due to the spiralling cost of fuel and toll charges, maintenance of vehicles and insurance.  I have spoken on their behalf on numerous occasions.  The issue was the fact that we were not in line with the tax rates in Northern Ireland and the UK.  I am glad to say that some hauliers will now have savings of up to &euro;4,200 per year.  Nobody benefited more in the recent budget.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Norris to a large degree in respect of the tax on older vehicles.  He is paying &euro;2,000 tax on a car worth &euro;1,000.  I was involved in a Commencement debate earlier on a similar matter, which is the spiralling cost of car insurance.  I gave two examples, one of a man aged 73 with a little Ford Fiesta worth &euro;1,000 whose insurance is &euro;880 and another of a young lad with a 2002 Audi worth &euro;2,000 which he needs to go to college and for which the insurance company billed him this year for &euro;2,648, or &euro;648 more than the value of the actual car.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  It will certainly improve the cost of doing business in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Motor Vehicles (Duties and Licences) Bill 2015 is required for two main reasons.  First, to give full effect to changes to motor tax rates applying to commercial goods vehicles announced in the recent budget and, second, to deal with issues raised in a Court of Appeal judgment which deemed the taxing of articulated vehicles to be without a proper legal basis.  The changes announced in the budget apply to all commercial goods vehicles and will reduce the rate of motor tax for approximately 28,000 vehicles in Ireland.  The reductions are tapered from a reduction of &euro;4,295 for the heaviest goods vehicle band to a reduction of &euro;43 per annum for vehicles weighing between 4,001 kg and 5,000 kg.  The rate structure is also being simplified and will comprise of five bands of motor tax ranging from &euro;92 for electric goods vehicles up to &euro;900 annually for vehicles weighing over 12,000 kg.  Have we considered what the tax on driverless cars in future will be?  Will we even be around when that happens?</p><p>There were no changes to motor tax rates for any other type of vehicle.  The changes announced in the budget were given temporary effect by way of a financial resolution on budget night.  The resolution would expire after four months if legislation were not introduced.  A Court of Appeal judgment on 21 October 2015 in DPP <i>v </i>Perennial Freight questioned the method by which motor tax rates were calculated for articulated vehicles.  This has traditionally been done by referencing a combined weight of the tractor, cab and trailer but the court ruled that trailers cannot be regarded as falling within the definition of &quot;mechanically-propelled vehicles&quot;.  Accordingly, such vehicles now fall to be treated at the haulage tractor rate and the annual rate is &euro;333.  As the ruling is that no articulated vehicles fall within the goods vehicle category, these vehicles cannot have the new rates applied to them from January as only rigid trucks can now be taxed as goods vehicles.  Amending legislation is required to exclude the vehicles from the haulage tractor category to allow them to be classified under the goods category.</p><p>I welcome the news for Irish road hauliers.  I live on the Border and I know there are many businesses that have vehicles which traverse it on a daily basis.  Those businesses could not compete with their Northern counterparts or hauliers from Great Britain who were coming in and receiving jobs local people could not compete for due to tax reasons.  The hauliers campaigned vigorously for many years and the Government listened to them.  They are now more competitive with their Northern Ireland compatriots and with Great Britain.  All hauliers should welcome the Bill.  I encourage the implementation of the legislation as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The Bill is a very technical and necessary one.  I take the opportunity to raise a couple of issues on the overall tax system for vehicles as a whole.  We must ask why garda&iacute; are even monitoring whether people pay their motor tax.  In reality, checkpoints are a leftover from the 1920s and they are rarely seen in other European countries anymore.  This is partly due to our experience during the Troubles I believe.  Surely, toll roads and CCTV can be used to monitor tax compliance.  Why do we need to use vital Garda resources to monitor tax, which is a civil matter?  Do people think garda&iacute; signed up to stand at the side of the road to check tax discs on car windscreens?  I think not.  The United Kingdom has done away with tax discs completely after 93 years.  They had tax discs for 93 years but last year they did away with them and moved to an electronic system, which is much more sensible.  Rather than the visual check the tax disc made possible, the UK authorities now use number plate recognition cameras to see if a vehicle has been taxed.  Since the system was introduced, the UK authorities have raised 50% more cases against untaxed cars.  It is clear that a aarda at a checkpoint is not able to check as many cars as a camera on a motorway.  Our system appears - and is - antiquated.  Is it possible to look at ways to modernise the system?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to know if it is possible to look at ways to modernise the system.  All of this should be done online now.  The availability of technology means there is little reason for tax discs to be sent in the post.  More importantly, garda&iacute; should not have to physically stand at the side of the road to check tax matters.  It should be possible for such checks to be done by means of automated cameras, as is the case in other EU countries.  We need to think about freeing up Garda resources to tackle rural crime, which is a big problem.  We are making expensive tax collectors of garda&iacute; by making them stand at the side of the road.  I would like to go beyond that.  We should look at collecting tax in a much more efficient manner.  In most countries, there is either motor tax or toll roads but not both.  I think it is nonsensical that for some reason we have both motor tax and toll roads.  Why do we need a massive system of motor tax administration that involves motor tax offices, Garda monitoring, sending out tax discs, court appearances, filling out forms in Garda stations and so on?  There has to be a better way.  I am impressed by the system used in Switzerland, to take one example.  I did not know until I discovered it recently that there are no toll roads in that country.  Anyone who wants to use a Swiss motorway must buy a <i>vignette</i>, or sticker, which costs approximately &euro;40 a year and can be purchased at any petrol station.  All foreign visitors to Switzerland must purchase one also.  Fines of approximately &euro;200 are imposed in cases of non-compliance.  If we have foreign cars using our roads, surely they should pay &euro;40 based on the Swiss model.  Such a contribution would bring more money into our coffers and help to reduce costs for Irish motorists.  Does the Minister of State have any views on this?  Could the Government undertake a cost-benefit analysis of such a system of fair usage?  I do not expect that to be done tomorrow, but I believe it should be possible for such an analysis to be done.  The very idea of toll roads is a dated one.  Like the turnpikes of the 19th century, some of the modern-day tolls merely serve to slow people on their journeys.  We should consider the Swiss model.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners collect income tax, the universal social charge, capital gains tax and corporation tax.  Local authorities collect commercial rates, business improvement tax, district taxes and levies and the non-principal private residence tax.  The motor taxation office collects motor tax.  An Post collects television and dog licence fees.  I am not sure whether the dog licence is still around.  I cannot believe it is worthwhile.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board collects the residential landlord tax.  In France, for example, rates are collected with electricity bills.  In addition, people who do not have television sets must opt out of the licensing system rather than opting in.  Perhaps we should examine the French system, because it seems to be much more efficient.  This matter needs much more discussion.  There is so much potential here.  I have mentioned some innovative ideas in the area of motor tax and taxation in general.  It is possible for us as a nation to take care of them.  If we were to do so, I think we would benefit from it as a whole.</p></speech>

I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I will respond to the most pertinent of the wide-ranging and interesting contributions that were made, which give rise to much thought.</p> <p>I assure Senator Barrett that it is recognised that unladen weight is not a satisfactory basis for motor tax.  It is open to manipulation and it is out of line with the basis of taxation of commercial vehicles in other countries, which is generally based on gross design vehicle weight.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has established an interdepartmental working group to consider issues relating to the Irish haulage industry.  In addition to the reduction in motor tax that has just been announced, the haulage industry is seeking a change in the basis of taxation from unladen to gross design vehicle weight and the introduction of road user charging.  The group issued a consultation paper late last year to canvass the views of hauliers and other stakeholders on the options for reform of the commercial vehicle motor tax regime.  Following consideration of these submissions, the group is to furnish a report containing recommendations on the future structure of commercial tax to the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Finance, and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Any changes to the current structure will be considered in that context.  It will be necessary to make amendments to primary legislation and technical modifications to the national vehicle and driver file.  The likely date for implementation is from January 2018.  The working group is also considering the feasibility of establishing and operating a road user charging system here.  Given the technological requirements required to underpin a charging system, its introduction is a medium-term to long-term objective.</p> <p>I note the comments that were made regarding electric vehicles.  In budget 2013, a new band of &euro;120 was introduced for electric vehicles with zero emissions.  The rate for pre-2008 electric vehicles was reduced at the same time from &euro;157 to &euro;120.</p> <p>I also note what was said about the polluter pays principle.  There are no plans to replace the current system of motor tax with an additional tax on motor fuel.  Motor tax receipts for 2014 were in the order of &euro;1.159 billion.  Maintenance of the tax base would require an increase in fuel excise rates of at least 20 cent per litre, which would have direct negative impacts on the rate of inflation and on economic competitiveness.  Goods vehicles and other high-usage and high-mileage vehicles such as public service vehicles and buses would have higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system.  There would be other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute.  A significant increase in fuel duty would lead to an increase in cross-Border fuel purchasing, which would further depress the tax base and require a compensatory adjustment, either through further increases in fuel prices or elsewhere in the tax system, to make up the shortfall.  The potential for an increase in fuel laundering is also clear.   The benefits of a fuel-based tax would have to be weighed against these issues and many others before the change that has been proposed could be contemplated.  In recognition of the lower average motor tax that is paid in respect of vehicles taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions by comparison with pre-2008 vehicles, differential increases have been applied in recent budgets with a view to rebalancing the tax base while retaining the environmental incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles.  The percentage increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in budgets of 2012 and 2013.  This compares with average increases of 25.5% in budget 2012 and 19.8% in budget 2013 for vehicles taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions.  Any future changes to motor tax rates will be considered in the context of future budgets.</p> <p>I note Senator Quinn's comments about the abolition of tax discs.  Enforcement of motor tax, insurance and roadworthiness obligations and the instruments used to facilitate enforcement measures, including the application of number plate recognition technology, are matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any change in the requirement to display on vehicle windscreens the discs mentioned by the Senator would need to be considered in the context of the application of number plate technology by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally, in order to ensure adequate enforcement levels are maintained.  The abolition of the paper tax disc in the UK since the beginning of October 2014 was enabled by greater use of automatic number plate recognition in that jurisdiction, which allows the authorities there to pursue the non-payment of tax.  There are no plans currently to implement a similar proposal here.  I will pass on the issues raised by the Senator to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>I put it to Senator Quinn that it should be taken into account that the number of toll points in Ireland is quite limited, and they are largely concentrated in the east of the country.  That would bring its own issues as well.  I think I have addressed most of the issues that were raised.  I thank Senators for their co-operation.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 45 involves the insertion of the word "deletes" into the phrase "destroys, defaces or conceals."

The issue has occupied or exercised the courts.  It is a phrase that is well used throughout criminal justice legislation in respect of offences and the powers of the Garda.  There is well established jurisprudence on how it is defined.  It is determined on a case-by-case basis in terms of what is reasonable in the circumstances.

It deletes the provisions relating to the ability of the authority to make regulations about interest on client moneys.  This is being done to reflect the fact that the Law Society of Ireland will perform this role as part of its retained functions for the financial and compensation fund spheres.  Until such time as barristers can hold client money, the authority will not need to exercise this power in its own right.  This power is not relevant or necessary for the functioning of the new authority at this point.  Obviously, regulations in this area made by the Law Society will be subject to approval by the new regulatory authority.</p> <p>I discussed this question at the beginning of Committee Stage.  I made the point that we do not want the Government to be liable for any of these issues.  A clear decision was made by the previous Minister in respect of the complex issues relating to the compensation fund.  The fund has been handled by solicitors up to now, and it will continue to be handled by them.</p></speech>

I am not going to fight this because it is obviously a hopeless battle, and we battled the other day.  Indeed, I was glad to see that reflected in a report on &quot;The Week in Politics.&quot;  It was rather gratifying to see the Seanad included in the discussions on a major Act.</p><p>Can the Minister comment on whether this is one of the areas in which the Bar Council of Ireland exerted pressure on the Department to alter matters?  That is concerning.  The former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, a worthy predecessor to the current Minister, had an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>in which he said that 85% of the Bill that he had envisaged has gone through, but 15% did not, and he very much regretted that.  It very much seems as though the Bar Council has exerted considerable pressure and has had a considerable impact on this legislation.  I know the Minister will be required politically to massage this, but it is a fact.</p></speech>

Do we have another form of words to cover this or is it a simple deletion, getting rid of it and that is it?  If it is just a deletion, it is a little worrying because it governs the idea of opening and maintaining a separate deposit account for the benefit of the client for the holding of money received from the client.  Accountability for clients' money is very important.  I know we have distinguished leaders of the Bar here at the moment.  This is one of the areas where there are always rows and always trouble and it is an area where, regrettably, there is sometimes fraud in the legal profession, so one would need to keep an eye on this if this entire section is going to be got rid of.  It is about 50 lines, which is not an insignificant amount.  It looks after the safeguarding and the well-being of a client's money.  I would be interested in what the Minister has to say to reassure the House that the interests of the client are still very much being protected.  I see the Minister nodding.  I am sure she can be satisfied on this issue.  Is this the result of Bar Council lobbying and is there a substitution?</p></speech>

The decision on the compensation fund was taken by the previous Minister and he took that decision for very good reasons.  When the Bill was published originally, some of the detail of the work had clearly not been done.  I have had a huge amount of detailed work to do in regard to the filling out of the various provisions of the Bill.  The majority of the amendments I have tabled today have to do with the fact we now have an independent inspection and disciplinary oversight from the regulatory authority, and they also deal with the transitional issues, with the new disciplinary tribunal body and with various other issues on which none of the detailed work had been done.  That is what I have been doing primarily.</p><p>In regard to the point raised by the Senator, this is not about the Bar Council but about the Law Society.  It is about the compensation because barristers do not hold clients' moneys at present.  The decision was taken that the compensation fund, in all its complexity, which has been handled by the Law Society for many decades would continue to be handled by the Law Society and that the State would not be liable in any way for that type of compensation should it arise.  What we are doing is protective of the State.  The key point is that the legal services regulatory authority, LSRA, still has complete oversight.  There is a new independent regulatory authority which has oversight.  There is also provision for people to sit on the committee.  I will deal with that section later.  This was a decision that was taken at an earlier point in the development of the Bill.  I think it is an appropriate decision.  If one were to move the compensation fund with all its complexities, involvement and management, one would be talking about a different sort of body.  We are talking about an oversight body that has approximately 40 staff.  If one were to move everything that is currently handled by the Law Society and the Bar Council, one would be talking about a different body taking over all that detailed work and the liability issues that arise.  The purpose of section 50 is to take out what was in the original published Bill.  However, there has been a journey in relation to it since.  The reason it is being left with the Law Society is well founded.  There is still the independent regulation in terms of financial activities, standards and monitoring of the various complex issues that can arise in regard to compensation.</p><p>In regard to the Senator's point about the Bar Council and comments that have been made about it, I have explained that I was given very strong advice on this issue and the constitutional difficulties that would arise due to forcing membership on a particular body.  That is the reality of the advice I was given and the Government has decided it wants to see the legal services regulatory authority established rather than being tied up in potential constitutional issues that would undermine the whole legislation.</p></speech>

Barrett to change the language from &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; in regard to the new regulatory authority's discretion to make regulations requiring legal practitioners to main professional indemnity insurance.  That is in amendment No. 54.  Government amendment No. 51 makes additional provision to the section.  It does this to make clear that all configurations of a legal partnership between barristers or solicitors must be compliant with the Bill and have the requisite professional indemnity insurance in place.  The amendment arises because it is necessary to cater separately for legal partnerships which consist of solicitors and barristers and those which contain barristers only.  We are accepting the Senator's amendment.</p></speech>

We have compulsory insurance to drive a car.  I agree with the Minister that indemnity insurance in this case seems eminently sensible.  That is the reason for the word &quot;shall&quot;.  The new authority should draw up the regulations to implement that.  Again, I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

This is a question about legal professional indemnity and without that the client might be exposed to damage.  That is very good and I am glad the Minister has accepted that.</p><p>With regard to amendment No. 51, this is window dressing because I do not see much prospect of partnerships between solicitors and barristers because, as I understand it - perhaps I am wrong and the Minister will correct me if I am - if a barrister enters into an agreement for a legal practice of some kind with a solicitor, he or she will be exiled from the Bar Library and that is quite a severe penalty.  To include things that speculate about practices where solicitors and barristers will happily combine together in a legal practice is to a certain extent a bit of pie in the sky if they are going to be subject to this sanction from the Bar Council.  If this is correct, and I am speaking from memory of newspaper articles, it is a rather nasty form of bullying that the Bar Council should seek to disadvantage a member of its profession who sets up a professional relationship with a solicitor.</p></speech>

That is the reality.  The Bill also has a strong section providing that no professional body can take any action that would interfere with the setting up of a partnership and cannot do anything that would be considered to be an interference with the setting up of such a practice.  There are 100 barristers operating outside of the Bar Council.  There is also a provision in the Bill to provide that if a barrister is employed by a charity NGO, a homeless group or by any of the advocacy groups, that person can represent those bodies in court.  All these are new provisions aimed at giving people opportunities to be involved in different ways.  All that is in the Bill.  I have mentioned the constitutional advice I received about the Bar Council.</p></speech>

I would like to know what the opinion of the Law Society was on this matter that has been so persuasive with the Minister.  Page 41 of the Bill is amended on a spectacular number of occasions.  Some are just technical amendments.  According to my colleague, Senator Barrett, page 41 of the Bill is amended 105 times.  That is absolutely astonishing.  It is no wonder we are at sea; at least I am at sea, I am not suggesting the Minister is at sea.</p> <p>If a Member has not spoken then it would be no harm, even on Report Stage, for a Member seeking to be informed by the Minister's contribution to be allowed to speak after the Minister - if he or she reserves the position and decides to not speak until after the Minister and taking into account that the Member can still only speak once.  It would seem good parliamentary practice to allow a Member who decides to hold his or her fire, to make use of the information the Minister has contributed to the House in making an informed comment, especially when there are so many amendments joined together by leave of the House.</p></speech>

Many amendments are improvements in the drafting.  There are a lot of improvements in the drafting.  The core of the amendments is to make crystal clear that all new complaints will go to the new authority after enactment.  The amendments also place a three-year limit on the complaints about inadequate service but there will be no time limit on complaints about professional misconduct by a solicitor or a barrister.</p> <p>With regard to the point raised by Senator Barrett, the amendment is because they will be dealing with the solicitors' accounts regulations and will have to come to a view in relation to the particular issue.  It is they who will come to that view and that is why we have inserted the wording "in the opinion of the Law Society" as they are the people who will be dealing with this, coming to a view as to the irregularity or not.  This would always be subject, as the Law Society and the Bar Council will be, to the independent regulation of the legal services regulatory authority.</p></speech>

I have listened very closely to the debate.  It appears to me that the debate is becoming a little bit shambolic because of the number of amendments to Committee Stage amendments, etc.  I am concerned that we and the Government may make some grave mistakes in the Bill because we are amending parts of it that we cannot see in front of us.</p> <p>I call on the Minister to suspend the debate on the Bill.  Committee Stage amendments should be incorporated into a new Bill, which should be published properly so that we can then debate the Report Stage amendments properly and consider them in the context of the amendments the Government wants to make so that it does not make mistakes.  Even at this late stage, amendments on Report Stage are still coming into our inboxes.  It is an absolute shambles, to be quite honest.  I am afraid that we will make a major mistake.  Rushing the Bill in this manner is absolutely diabolical.</p></speech>

These are a series of amendments which are very much drafting improvements.  There is no change whatsoever in the policy issue we discussed on Committee Stage.  In fact, these are detailed amendments to improve the Bill from a drafting point of view, the drafter having taken a further look at the overall section.  As I said, the purpose of the amendments is to provide clarity and consistency.</p> <p>The key policy point is that there will be independent access.  All new complaints will go to the new authority after the enactment of the Bill.  This is a major change.  In future, all complaints about legal services, rather than going to a committee within the Law Society, which has operated under legislation to date, or the Bar Council, which provided an annual report on its activities, will go to an independent body.  I ask Senators to reflect on that key policy point.  I appreciate that there are a lot of amendments, but they are to improve the drafting of the Bill, for the purposes of consistency and clarity and to ensure a smooth transition from those committees to the new legal services regulatory authority.</p></speech>

That is astonishing.  How can 23 pages of amendments be squeezed onto one page?  The mind just boggles.  It is daft.

The Bill we have before us does not contain the Committee Stage amendments that have already been made.  Would the Minister be prepared to suspend the debate and produce a copy of the Bill with the Committee Stage amendments included in it in order that we can see where we are?  We have just examined an important amendment which adds the words "the opinion of the Law Society" regarding a matter of fact, namely, whether there has been a breach of regulations.  It is not a matter of opinion but a matter of fact.  We have just allowed a fact to be overwhelmed by an opinion of a professional body, and it is worrying.  The Members on this side will not be particularly co-operative and will call a number of votes to reflect the disquiet throughout the House.  Although the Government side is inhibited from making these points, in discussions during the division we found there is considerable concern on that side.  Every December, Bills are rammed through because we must get them done before Christmas.  This is why we are sitting five days next week and the week after.  It is not good parliamentary practice and does not treat the Seanad with the respect it is due.</p></speech>

That has led to a renumbering of the amendments.  Obviously when one inserts a new section all the numbers on the other sections have to be changed.  This is one of a series of amendments reflecting the change to the number of the section we are dealing with.  It is normal with any Bill where there are insertions as there was regarding the disciplinary procedures.  This has meant there is a change in the section numbers.  This amendment changes the numbering of the section.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously once one inserts a new section, all the numbers on the other sections have to be changed.

I accept completely the renumbering and all the rest of it.  In the normal course of events we would just let this legislation slide through but we are not prepared to do that at the moment.  I seek clarification for myself on the following.  I noticed that hash marks were included in the amendment which says: "inserted by amendment 58# .... in accordance with section 49##".  In some cases there are up to four or five hash marks inserted.  Does a hash mark indicate the number of times an amendment has been amended?  What is the purpose of a hash mark in this instance?</p></speech>

The first hash refers to the first section that is being changed and the second hash refers to the second change.  It is just to differentiate the amendments that are being made.  The Bills Office did so to make it clearer what was happening with these amendments.</p> <p>If I could make a point which might be helpful to the discussion about the various changes in the Bill.  The Senator commented on the number of amendments in relation to one page.  That was a reference point for a large number of amendments that were made by the House on Committee Stage on the subject of complaints.  It is a virtual page number to allow for the insertion of the various amendments that had been made but it was not changing any of those amendments.  It was literally just providing a place where those amendments were going into the Bill that had been agreed on Committee Stage so it was not actually amendments to one page.</p> <p>A huge number of the amendments I am bringing in here are to do with the drafters.  It was always going to be necessary at this point in the Bill to look at the overall development of the Bill and the kind of changes made and see how it all stood together.  Many of the changes in these amendments are genuine, as Senators will see when they look at the amendments.  We are not brining in any policy changes.  The policy discussion we have had, both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, is very much the drafters looking over the Bill as a whole.  I appreciate that there are many amendments.  The drafters have looked over them and effectively made the technical changes and the minor corrections that are needed for the Bill to flow as a whole.  I apologise that there are so many of them but it is very much the drafters looking at the Bill as a whole and making the various changes.  I accept that it is a complex and large Bill with many amendments.  These ones we are discussing at this point are very much the technical ones about the numbering changes where one puts the amendments in and so forth.</p> <p>I have detailed notes which I am happy to share on some of the other amendments that have to do with inserting monitoring elements, for example, which we will deal with in the Bill at a later stage, and some of the other key points about transitions and the kind of periods of transition we are putting into the Bill when we move from the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland to the LSRA.  I hope I have been helpful.</p></speech>

It is the fourth amendment being referenced on a particular page.  It is just a note on the fourth.  There is just one hash mark for the first one.

As one can see from page 22 of the Committee amendments, the Report Stage amendment is literally changing 4(b) to 5(b).  Some of these are the result of a new line being inserted and the reference changes.  It is one of the many technical changes because there are changes in the composition of the Bill with new sections inserted, there is a change in the reference.  Instead of 4(b) it reads 5(b).

The substantive amendment in this group provides that an appeal of the outcome of a complaint of inadequate services or excessive costs shall be via a review committee to the High Court.</p> <p>Amendment No. 88 replaces subsection (1).  The intention is that the authority will, in every case where the matter at hand relates to inadequate services or where the review committee has remitted a complaint to the authority, invite the parties to seek to resolve the matter by informal means.  The subsection removes the requirement that the authority should form an opinion as to whether the matter is suitable for resolution by informal means, which it was felt was too subjective.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Amendments Nos. 90 to 101 and 113 to 118 relate to the resolution and review of the complaints sections.  The intention behind the amendments now being proposed is to make clear how procedures regarding the resolution of complaints will operate and to better define the role of the review committee.  Amendment No. 90 makes a change to one of the options available to the new review committee to be established under section 53 of the Bill, as inserted by amendment No. 63 of the Committee Stage amendments.  The option that the review committee had - that is, to find that a complaint was not well founded - is being replaced by an option to remit the complaint to the committee with such direction as the review committee considers appropriate.  It provides that a remittance can be for a complaint against either inadequate service or excessive costs.</p><p>Amendment No. 92 inserts an important new section into the Bill which will enable a party to appeal to the High Court against a decision of the review committee.  Subsection 1 provides that the party, within 21 days of a notification from the review committee, may appeal to the High Court for an order to rescind or vary the determination of the review committee.  Subsection 2 makes it clear, however, that if no such appeal is made within the 21 days, the determination of the review committee is absolutely binding on the parties.  Subsection 3 gives the authority the right to have an appeal dismissed if it considers that the appeal has only been made to delay the conclusion of the complaint.  Subsection 4 provides that a failure by a legal practitioner to comply with the determination of the review committee will constitute an offence under the Act. </p><p>Amendment No. 93 proposes a new subsection which makes it clear that where there is an admissible complaint which, if proven, would constitute misconduct, the authority should invite the complainant and legal practitioner to make efforts to resolve the matter promptly and in line with guidelines published by the authority.  </p><p>Amendment No. 94 proposes to replace section 56, which was inserted on Committee Stage, with a different wording, although the thrust of the section remains the same - that agreement by a legal practitioner to participate in attempts to resolve an issue is not an admission of liability.  We had some discussion on this on Committee Stage and I think these amendments were welcomed.</p><p>Amendment No. 101 relates to the procedures that the authority must carry out in dealing with complaints.  I have decided that there needs to be a clear statement that a complaint about an act or omission which could constitute misconduct, if not resolved by informal means, will be passed to the complaints committee for consideration. </p><p>Amendment No. 113 involves the deletion of subsection 14.  This is about improving the case management of complaints.  Under subsection 14, the divisional committee could refer a case back to the authority to see if it could be resolved by informal means.  Having looked at it again, we believe that cases that reach the divisional committee have already been through the process, so we are not referring them back to the authority.  </p><p>Amendment No. 118 makes it clear that an appeal by a legal practitioner against a determination of a divisional committee will be to the High Court and not to the disciplinary tribunal.  The disciplinary tribunal will have a specific function to investigate certain complaints involving alleged misconduct on the part of legal practitioners.  I am providing that an appeal by a legal practitioner against a determination made or a direction issued by a divisional committee will be by way of application to the High Court.</p><p>We also have a subsection that states that in certain circumstances the authority may also appeal to the High Court against determinations or directions of the divisional committee.  The authority may also appeal against a decision by the divisional committee not to refer a complaint to the disciplinary tribunal.  Subsections 3 outlines the orders that the High Court may make on receipt of an appeal under this section.  Effectively, these are refinements to the resolution of inadequate services.  The substantive amendment in this group provides that an appeal on the outcome of a complaint about inadequate services or excessive costs shall be by way of the review committee to the High Court.  It outlines the various stages that complaints of inadequate service or excessive costs go through within the body and how the authority becomes involved.</p></speech>

I am interested, however, in her remark that the view of the authority is too subjective.  Despite the fact that the Minister provided for the wording that refers to the view of one of the legal bodies - I cannot remember which - she said before that it was too subjective, yet here it is now popping up.  I am sorry; I will clarify that.  The Minister put in the wording that refers to the authority forming a view of something, yet now she is saying it is too subjective, so there is a bit of a conflict there.</p> <p>I welcome the option of appealing to the High Court the determination of the review committee.  I think that is a good thing.  The Minister referred to the fact that during Second Stage, or during an earlier debate on this Bill, we commended the provision that an apology would not constitute an admission of liability.  The tendency of the Bill is to urge the parties towards reconciliation and so on without actually resorting to court procedures, but such recourse to these proceedings to try to reach an accommodation shall not be taken as admission of liability.  That is a good thing because it frees up the system and encourages people to take a course of moderation and to try to sort things out without recourse to the law, which can be extremely expensive.</p> <p>I have a query about one of the amendments, but by and large they are good.  They are fairly substantive amendments dealing with big matters that need a certain amount of thought.</p></speech>

The authority in this instance would be referring the matter for informal resolution, so we do not want it to prejudge the matter.  Thus, we are removing the section that refers to the authority forming an opinion.</p> <p>I think the Senator is correct about the question of liability.  We discussed this in the context of the pre-action protocols for medical negligence as well, where we have provided for a similar wording, so that an apology is not seen as an admission of liability.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 122 is a drafting amendment to eliminate repetition of qualifications for lay membership of the disciplinary tribunal.  The purpose of the amendment is to replace subsection (1) of section 66, which was inserted on Seanad Committee Stage by amendment No. 76.  The subsection (1) which was inserted includes subparagraphs (a) and (b).  Subparagraph (a) carried over the reference to the requirement for ten years practice which was in the published Bill, and my intention is to retain it.  However subparagraph (b) referred to the types of knowledge and expertise which a person must have if he or she is to be appointed a lay chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal.  Since these elements of knowledge and expertise are already set down in Section 65(3) of the Bill, inserted on Committee Stage, as requirements for lay membership of the tribunal, there is no need for them to be repeated here.  The effect of the amendment proposed is thus to delete subparagraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 66, thereby removing the repetition.  I am keeping one part and taking out one other part.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 are consequential amendments arising from the substitution of a new section 62 under amendment No. 118.  Amendment No. 124 substitutes a new subsection (1) within the section dealing with the property of a limited liability partnership regarding the enforcement against it of any debt, obligation or liability.  It is a drafting amendment to ensure that there is no ambiguity as to the access to the property of the partnership to meet the debts of the partnership.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 126 to 129, inclusive, 134 and 139 are technical drafting amendments designed to clarify the meaning of the provisions concerned.  Amendment No. 130 is a consequential amendment arising from the substitution of the new section 62, which provides for appeals to the High Court.  Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 are consequential amendments arising from the deletion of the subsection (8) in amendment No. 130.  Amendments Nos. 135 and 136 have been tabled to change the terminology of the sanctions in the Bill and bring them in line with those already in place in the Solicitors Acts.</p> <p>Amendment No. 137 has been inserted to make it clear that the sanction to be imposed under subsection (1)(l) will apply only where the misconduct consists of a breach of the solicitors accounts regulations.  This is in line with the sanctions already in place under the Solicitors Acts.  Amendment No. 138 inserts a new sanction into the Bill regarding practising barristers.  The amendment allows the disciplinary tribunal to direct the authority to impose restrictions on the practice of a barrister.  Amendment No. 133 is a consequential, tidy up amendment arising from amendments Nos. 137 and 138.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 140, the intent behind the new subsections is to ensure that the aggregate amount of fines which can be imposed on a legal practitioner is &euro;15,000 and that the means of the legal practitioner must be taken into account.  I have based this on legal advice from the Attorney General.

Everything about the Bill is unclear.  It is like asking an artist to paint a picture with a blindfold on.  The amendments are all very confusing.  The fact that amendment No. 122 is to delete an amendment the Minister made on Committee Stage adds credence to the argument that the farce should be stopped and the Bill suspended until a copy of the Bill with the Committee Stage amendments inserted is supplied in order to give us a better picture of what it looks likes.  If the Bill is passed in this manner, it will be full of holes and contradictions and will lead to problems that will require further amendment, perhaps by the next Government.  It is ridiculous that the Minister is continuing in this manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-01a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120100002#EEE05200"><p>I agree with the Senator and I said something similar recently.  Amendment No. 135 states, &quot;In page 41, in subsection (1)(a) of the section 72 inserted by amendment 82 at Committee Stage in the Seanad, to delete &ldquo;a reprimand&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an advice&rdquo;.&quot;  It refers to the section which states:</p><blockquote>Where, pursuant to the holding of an inquiry under section 71, the Disciplinary Tribunal makes a determination under section 71(9) that there has been misconduct on the part of a legal practitioner and determines that the issue of sanction should be dealt with pursuant to this subsection, the Disciplinary Tribunal may make an order imposing one or more of the following sanctions on the legal practitioner ...</blockquote> <p>The first option listed is &quot;a reprimand&quot;.  The amendment will remove this and substitute the term &quot;an advice&quot;.  What is an advice?  It sounds like a very neutral and meaningless term to use.  What does it mean to give an advice to somebody?  Does one advise a person that he or she is behaving badly?  A reprimand is clear.  It means a person has done something wrong and is receiving a smack on the wrist.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not understand why we need to take out the term "reprimand" and put in the term "an advice". </p><p>Further down, the reverse of that is included in subsection (c), where the term "caution" is to be removed and the term "essential" inserted.  Something that is mild is to be removed and replaced with something that is fairly strong.  It looks to me as if the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  Subsection (a) removes a lot of the point and neutralises it, but in subsection (c) the big guns are brought in.</p><p>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  I wish to God that somebody would give instruction in plain English.  During the debate on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, I referred to a group of people with mental disabilities.  They said one of the things they wanted was for legislation to be written in a way that they could understand.  I am not sure it is completely beyond the wit of man to make things more comprehensible.  Amendment No. 138 states, "[W]here the legal practitioner is a practising barrister, a direction to the chief executive of the Authority directing him or her to impose a specified restriction or condition on the legal practitioner in respect of his or her practice as a barrister."  I am not quite sure what that means.  Does that mean that the barrister cannot deal with particular kinds of cases?  Does it mean that he or she can give advice but cannot appear in court?  What are the restrictions and what do they consist of?  What does the term "condition" mean?  Does it mean a barrister can only do such and such if he or she had previously satisfied some requirements?  </p><p>This is fairly vague.  I do not know what a "specified restriction" is.  It would be useful to have examples of them or a limited number to give us an idea of what is contemplated by the Bill.  The same applies to the term "condition".  I do not really follow what is meant by a condition.  Obviously, the meaning of the word etymologically is that one can only do something if such and such applies or under certain circumstances.  It is not at all clear what is intended.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could elucidate.</p></speech>

In the Bill we are introducing some new models of dealing with complaints.  For example, there will be a new disciplinary tribunal.  We are also making sure that the LRSA has an oversight role.  In section 135 we are moving from reprimand and advice, admonishment and censure.  This is very much to align the language of sanctions being used for solicitors and barristers, under traditional terminology, in the Bill.  It is taking account of the previous practice and language used in dealing with complaints.</p></speech>

That seems to me to be an obvious and logical thing, if we are talking about tradition and traditional language.  That is very basic stuff.  It should not come in on Report Stage.

I do not know whether she is agreeing with me.</p></speech>

With the passing of Committee Stage, perhaps the language has evolved somewhat to make it seem more reflective and powerful.

We are not serious about proposing a fine of &euro;15,000 as a deterrent for such people.  The Bill states that in making an order the tribunal shall have regard to the means of the legal practitioner concerned.  These are millionaires.  We should have regard to their means and impose a fine greater than &euro;15,000.</p></speech>

The word "consideration" was used when in fact the word "recommendation" should have been used and that is being rectified.</p> <p>There are a number of references in these amendments to legal practitioners who are to be informed in the event of a striking off of a barrister and listing additional directions which may be issued by the High Court having considered a matter referred to it by the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal. </p> <p>On amendments Nos. 142 and 143 involve the deletion of the term "legal practitioners". </p> <p>Amendment No. 144 inserts the words "legal practitioner" before the word "solicitor."  It is a drafting amendment to ensure that the person referred to is a legal practitioner as well was being a solicitor.  </p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 145 is to include the Chief Justice as a person who is required to be notified of a decision of the High Court to direct the removal of the name of a barrister from the new authority's roll of practising barristers.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 146 is to include three new sanctions which may be imposed on a legal practitioner by the High Court, following an application to it on foot of a complaints process.  These new sanctions are to direct the practitioner to take specific action at his or her own expense in the interest of the complainant, to pay a sum of money as restitution to an aggrieved party and to pay the costs of the disciplinary tribunal's inquiry into his or her misconduct.  These sanctions were in fact available to the disciplinary tribunal under the amendments made on Committee Stage.  However, on the advice of the Attorney General, the power to impose these additional financial sanctions has been transferred to the High Court which will act on the application of the disciplinary tribunal.</p> <p>Amendment No. 147 is a drafting amendment which makes a decision or order and simply adds the words "decision or" before the word "order."</p> <p>Amendment No. 148 is an order to ensure that any decision or order of the High Court, relating to a solicitor is furnished to the Registrar of Solicitors.  In other words, it must be referred to the Law Society of Ireland.  This is in order to ensure that the registrar has notice and may take whatever action is required in relation to that solicitor. </p> <p>Amendment No. 149 is a straightforward drafting amendment which replaces the word "its" with the word "the."  </p> <p>Amendments Nos. 150 to 153, inclusive, are a composite of drafting amendments so that the lead-in refers to a decision of the High Court rather than an order.  The amendments ensure that the word "under" does not have to be repeated in each of the three following subsections.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 154 is to change the reference to a finding of misconduct of the High Court so that it covers any decision of the High Court under the relevant section, and not just a finding of misconduct.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 155 is to replace the reference to a determination by the disciplinary tribunal in that subsection with a reference to a direction, determination or order as comprehended to the new subsection which is being inserted by amendment No. 156.  The purpose, overall, is to ensure that the power of the new authority to apply to the High Court, in section 80, is to enforce compliance by a legal practitioner with a direction, determination or order of the authority of a review committee, of a divisional committee such as the complaints committee, or of the disciplinary tribunal, as the case may be.  </p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 156 is to set out the bodies and entities whose directions, determinations or orders are covered by the High Court enforcement power contained in the revised subsection 81, inserted by amendment No. 155.</p></speech>

That is part of it but there is a part of it that the Minister did not explain.  The earlier part of the amendment reads: &quot;where the legal practitioner is a barrister, that the Authority, in accordance with Part 9.&quot;  I refer to the original amendment No. 85 on Committee Stage which proposed section 75(7)(e) should read: &quot;where the legal practitioner is a barrister, that the name of the barrister be struck off the roll of practising barristers and the Honorable Society of King's Inns informed of the fact.&quot;  The original amendment did not mention the authority.  That is a crucial difference between it and the substituted amendment which clearly specified that the authority shall do it.  The original amendment seeks &quot;that the name of the barrister be struck off&quot; and does not specify.  That is a fairly significant amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 146 is a very practical method, in my opinion, of redress.</p><p>I am concerned and interested in amendment No. 151 which reads:</p><blockquote>In page 41, in subsection (4)(a) of the section 78 inserted by amendment 88 at Committee Stage in the Seanad, to delete &ldquo;under&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The provision refers to where the High Court makes an order and then goes straight into whatever section.  I would have thought that the word &quot;under&quot; was required and wonder if the call for its removal is a mistake.  The authority is quoted in the section.  The amendment does not even make grammatical sense.  The original amendment No. 88 reads:</p><blockquote>78.<b></b>(4) Where the High Court makes an order&mdash;<br /><br />(a) under <i>section 74(3)(b)</i>,<br /><br />(b) under <i>section 74(4)</i>(other than <i>section 74(4)(b)</i>,<br /><br />(c) under <i>section 75 </i>(other than <i>section 75(2)(b)</i>.</blockquote> <p>Today's amendments Nos. 150 to 153, inclusive, seek to get rid of the word &quot;under&quot; which I do not understand.  It seems to me to be common practice to say &quot;under&quot; and quote the section of the Act that is coming into force.  Getting rid of the word &quot;under&quot; seems very odd to me.  Perhaps the Minister can explain.</p></speech>

Are we going around in circles?  It is confusing, to say the least.  We made an amendment to this section a week or ten days ago and now we are deleting it.  There is a quagmire of confusion.  I do not want to add to the Minister's woes, but that there has been a substantial number of votes is understandable.  I have been in the Oireachtas for nearly 20 years and I have never seen a Bill so often amended and re-amended in the same House.  I made my comments on Second Stage and am concerned that the end product, whether we get it next week, this week or whenever, will be a cause for great confusion and be a source of joy and exploration for many lawyers in the Four Courts.</p></speech>

It is complex and detailed legislation.  It was necessary for the drafters to take an overview of the Bill.  The new and, in some instances, composite sections have led to quite a few of the changes that I am outlining now.  It is important that we recommend improvements to the Bill.  I am conscious of the large number of amendments, but we are determined to enact a Bill that is fit for purpose.  One of the purposes of Report Stage is to consider anything that needs to be clarified, dealt with or amended and ensure consistency.  I hope that we can continue to work through the amendments.</p><p>Regarding Senator Norris's point on the deletion of subsection (7)(e), the relevant amendment is No. 145 on page 25 of the Report Stage amendments.  It reads:</p><blockquote>In page 41, in the section 75 inserted by amendment 85 at Committee Stage in the Seanad, to delete subsection (7)(e) and substitute the following:&quot;(e) where the legal practitioner is a barrister, that the Authority, in accordance with <i>Part 9</i>, strike the name of the person off the roll of practising barristers and inform the Chief Justice and the Honorable Society of King's Inns of the fact;&quot;.</blockquote></speech>

That is right.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 155 is to replace the reference to a determination by the tribunal in that subsection with a reference to a direction, determination or order.  This is to ensure the power of the new authority to apply to the High Court to enforce compliance by a legal practitioner with a direction, determination or order of the authority.</p> <p>The drafters have considered this matter.  It is a long and detailed Bill.  At this point, the drafters are making any recommendation that they see fit.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised a point about "under this Part".  A composite of drafting amendments tidy up section 78(4) so that the lead in refers to a decision of the High Court rather than an order.  As such, the word "under" does not have to be repeated in each of the following subsections.  That is the best drafting advice that I have on the use of this word.</p></speech>

The word "under" is removed right at the beginning and cites the section under which the order is made.  Removing it is madness and I have not yet heard an explanation as to why it should not remain.</p></speech>

I am not making personal or derogatory comments towards the Minister or the draftspersons, but something is wrong and does not sit appropriately with me.  To the best of my knowledge on reflection, we agreed to the amendment the week before last like lambs being shepherded by a sheep dog.  A couple of weeks later, it looks like we were either stupid or naive.  The note reads, "the text proposed to be deleted above was inserted by amendment 90 at Committee Stage in the Seanad".  It was agreed - there was no vote - yet the amendment that we agreed to is now being amended.  How can we have trust or faith in a Bill that has major drafting problems?  On a point of principle, I must call a vote on this issue for the first time.</p></speech>

The order is made &quot;under&quot; a section.  It is just daft.  Currently, it reads:</p><blockquote>Where the High Court makes an order--(a) under <i>section 74(3)(b)</i>,<br /><br />(b) under <i>section</i>...</blockquote> <p>These are the sections under which the order is made.

These are effectively transitional provisions.</p> <p>The situation will be as follows.  Where the Law Society has received a complaint about a solicitor before the commencement of the relevant provisions of this Act then it will process the complaint via its existing mechanisms and applying the provisions of the Solicitors Acts.  Where complaints relating to inadequate services or excessive fees are made in relation to a solicitor on or after the date of commencement of this legislation, even though the complaint relates to an act or omission before commencement, it will be dealt with by the LSRA under the new legislation.  It is really important that all disciplinary issues and complaints will now be dealt with by the LRSA, so there will be a completely independent authority dealing with disciplinary issues or complaints about solicitors or barristers.  That is a central element of this legislation and its importance.</p> <p>Where a complaint relates to misconduct, as opposed to inadequate service or excessive fees, and it relates to an act or omission of a solicitor before the commencement of this legislation, it will be dealt with by the new authority but using the old definitions of misconduct from the Solicitors Acts.  This is to protect against a situation in which a misconduct complaint about a solicitor regarding something that happened before commencement of this Act would be evaluated against a new definition of misconduct.  The new definition cannot be applied retrospectively.</p> <p>Where a complaint about a solicitor which relates to an act or omission occurring after the commencement of this legislation is received by the authority, it will be processed by the authority under the provisions of Part 5 of this new legislation.  When the Bill was first published, we had a Part 5 and Part 6 relating to the handling of disciplinary and complaint issues.  They are now all being dealt with under Part 5.</p> <p>These transitional provisions are complex and rather elaborate, but they are necessary in order to ensure that all of the necessary legalities are taken care of.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is critical in any legislative regime that covers the misconduct of professionals.  We are talking here about potential misconduct by solicitors and barristers.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 158, which inserts a new section 82 is to provide for what happens regarding the handling of complaints concerning barristers in the changeover from the existing complaints regime operated by the Bar Council and partly by the Honourable Society of King's Inns to the new regime, which, as I have said, will be operated fully by the legal services regulatory authority.  The transitional provisions concerning barristers are slightly different from those concerning solicitors.  This is because complaints regarding solicitors are currently dealt with by the Law Society.  The process is currently under a statutory regime set out in the Solicitors Acts.  Senators will be aware that five Solicitors Acts have been passed to date.</p><p>At present, complaints regarding barristers are handled under the rules of the Bar Council and involve the Honourable Society of King's Inns where recommendations are required to be made regarding serious misconduct leading to disbarment of the barrister, which is handled by the benchers of the society under its rules and long-standing common law.  To this extent, by contrast with the regime for solicitors, we have no reference point before the commencement of the new Act for a definition of barrister misconduct.  The authority, therefore, cannot deal with complaints about barristers' acts or omissions that will have occurred before the commencement of our new Act.  Such complaints will continue to be handled under the existing Bar Council regime, where applicable, and the processes of the Honourable Society of King's Inns where relevant.</p><p>The transitional provisions concerning complaints about barristers will be as follows.  Disbarment by the benchers of the Honourable Society of King's Inns in respect of pre-commencement misconduct of a barrister will be required to be notified by the society to the new authority, and the new authority will bring the matter before the High Court.  The High Court will, after due process, make an order either striking the name off the authority's roll of practising barristers or imposing another sanction, as appropriate.  All other cases, that is, cases regarding a complaint regarding an act or omission of a barrister after the commencement of the legislation, will be dealt with by the new authority.</p><p>With regard to both solicitors and barristers, these are necessary transitional provisions.  Older cases will be dealt with through the system fairly quickly leading to a situation where everything will be dealt with by the new authority.  As I stated, there are different transitional provisions for solicitors and barristers, and that is because, up to now, solicitors have been dealing with these complaints under the Solicitors Acts whereas barristers have been dealing with misconduct internally, thus requiring a slightly different process.  However, both processes require new sections to spell out quite clearly the transitional provisions as we move towards the new legal services regulatory authority.</p></speech>

We debated amendment No. 91 at length on Committee Stage and the Minister read a footnote into the record in this regard approximately two weeks ago.

We were present here for Committee Stage.  There were very few votes, if any, but now we are being asked to amend what we agreed on Committee Stage, more or less.  I object on principle.  We have been waiting for this Bill for four years; it was published four years ago.  At this late stage, coming up to the Christmas recess, we are dealing with a plethora of amendments that should have been dealt with months ago.  I have no problem being here - I will stay here until morning - but it is unfair on the House and Cathaoirleach.  Some of the amendments are technical.  I am not questioning the propriety or merit of some of these amendments.  We had a long lead-up to this Bill.  The amendments we are now dealing with should have been dealt with on Committee Stage.  We are amending amendments that were made and deleting some of them.  We accepted amendments to the original Bill on Committee Stage.  What is occurring is very disconcerting and worrying.  If the Bill is brought back again from the D&aacute;il, are we to amend amendments we made twice?</p></speech>

This is probably the most significant Bill that has faced the legal profession in my lifetime, yet it is as if we are in a maze.  We are unsure of where we are going.

Amendment No. 158, however, states: &quot;Where, on or after the date on which this subsection comes into operation, the Benchers of the Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns disbar a person [...]&quot;.  In one amendment, we are saying the authority disbars barristers and in another we are giving free rein to the Honourable Society of King's Inns to do the disbarring.  Perhaps the Minister could explain this or elucidate it in some way for me.</p></speech>

Senator O'Donovan, whose point I understand, should note this is why I have had to make an amendment on Report Stage.  We had thought we would be in a position to deal with the two professions in a similar way but it was felt, on having sought further legal advice, that I should insert a new section allowing, at the transitional stage, for different means of handling of both.  The solicitors previously disbarred members of their profession under statute while the barristers did not.  As I stated when going into the details, since disbarment of barristers will have been carried out informally in-house before the commencement of this Act, we will not really have a reference point regarding how cases will have been dealt with.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The recommendation is that before the commencement of this new Act for a definition of barristers&rsquo; misconduct - we have no reference point for that definition - the authority thus cannot deal with complaints about barristers acts or omissions which occurred before commencement of the new Act.  Such complaints will have to continue to be handled under the existing Bar Council regime.  This refers to old complaints but as soon as they have been dealt with, any new complaints coming in can then be dealt with under the new sections that deal with complaints and will be dealt with by the Legal Services Regulation Authority, LRSA, in the way I have outlined.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-12-01a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015120100002#RRR00800"><p>This straightforward amendment concerns the appointment of a monitor as an additional legislative safeguard over the retained functions of the Law Society in relation to the financial regulation of solicitors, and to the maintenance of the solicitors' compensation fund.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 159 is to amend the Legal Services Regulation Bill to provide the new authority with the power to appoint a member or members of staff to be a monitor for the purposes of attending meetings of relevant committees of the Law Society which are dealing with the investigation of solicitors in respect mainly of the solicitors' accounts regulation.  </p> <p>As already pointed out to the House, the Law Society will retain oversight of solicitors' accounts, financial conduct and associated matters.  Part of the oversight role of the new authority in relation to the Law Society's retained functions is the presence of the LRSA monitor at committees where decisions are being made regarding the action to be taken in relation to a solicitor.  </p> <p>The role of the monitor will be to attend and observe.  It is provided that the authority may request reports from the monitor from time to time in relation to the performance of their functions.  The new authority is also empowered under the legislation to make recommendations to the Minister for legislative change.  The intention is that any recommendations arising from the monitor's attendance at Law Society committee meetings would feed into these recommendations.  Therefore, this is to ensure that the LRSA has access to what is happening in those committees, can report back, and can make recommendations based on his or her observations of the Law Society's committee meetings in relation to these matters.</p> <p>The purpose of amendment No. 267, which dovetails with this, is to amend the Solicitors Acts so as to provide in the legislation governing the Law Society that an LRSA monitor may attend and observe at any relevant meeting, and oblige the society to inform the authority of the place and time of any such meeting.  This makes it clear that we now have an independent authority with the power to send somebody to attend meetings of the Law Society at any point in time.  Equally, the Law Society has to tell the LRSA when and where it is having its meetings. </p> <p>This inserts a new section 14C into the Solicitors Act 1994, which provides for the presence of a monitor appointed by the LRSA to attend at meetings of Law Society committees which have powers or functions of investigating alleged misconduct by a solicitor.  It mirrors the power to appoint such a monitor which has been inserted into the Legal Services Regulation Bill by amendment No. 159.</p> <p>Senators will recall that a key part of the strategy, which involves the retention of certain solicitors' oversight and misconduct issues by the society, is that the operation of these functions will be subject to oversight by the new authority.  One of the key components of the oversight is that we have this monitoring arrangement and engagement in a practical way between the LRSA and the committees of the Law Society.</p></speech>

Would it not have been useful to put a definition of "monitor" into the early part of the Bill which contains definitions?</p></speech>

They seem to have had a particular influence on the Bill, securing posts in the new authority.  Who is the monitor and what is he or she supposed to be doing?  I think we need a definition.</p></speech>

I do not know what Senator Barrett said but it was something in relation to who that person would be.  The authority has the power to appoint a member or members of staff to be a monitor for the purposes of attending the meeting.  The new independent authority decides who the monitor is, so it is very much a function of the new authority to put the monitor in place.</p></speech>

The section does not define "monitor", it says the monitor may attend and observe any meeting.  It does not say anything about reporting back.  It refers to performing the functions of a monitor under the section.  I see nothing about reporting back or the duties of a monitor.  It says simply that the monitor will attend and observe and perform the functions of a monitor under the section.  The functions are not defined apart from the reference to observing and attending.</p></speech>

The authority is also empowered under the legislation to make recommendations to the Minister for legislative change and the intention is that any recommendations arising from the monitor's attendance at Law Society committee meetings would feed into these recommendations.  If one has a committee and makes a decision that somebody should go along to the meeting to monitor what is happening there, it is obvious and a common practice that the person would come back to the executive and say what has been happening at those meetings.  Reports would be requested.  There is provision for reports to be made.  It is common sense that the person will come back and make recommendations on foot of attendance at the meeting.  That is what the authority is empowered to ask the person to provide.</p></speech>

I cannot find any reference to the monitor in that section either.  It has been a long day and it may be that somebody else will find it.  We do not define him or her and I do not think we can rely on section 42 as inserted by amendment No. 52 on Committee Stage.  The monitor is not mentioned if I have read it correctly.</p></speech>

The functions of the monitor are clearest between the two amendments.  We do not believe a further definition is needed.  The monitor's function is to report where required.  Given the normal ways a CEO or board acts where a monitor attends at a committee under his or her control or oversight, I would have thought it is clear they would ask the monitor to provide reports back.  If there are issues arising out of those reports, I would expect them to act on them.  That is normal practice.</p></speech>
