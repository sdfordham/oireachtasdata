There seem to be mixed messages coming from the IMF on the one hand and the troika on the other in terms of a perceived delay.  We could do with having some clarity on that issue.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order that the Minister for Health would come to the House and make a statement on the national children's hospital.  It has come to our attention on this side of the House that there seems to be, at a very minimum, a stalling tactic being employed by the HSE and the Department of Health on this issue, and possibly a wish to opt out of the particular site at St. James's Hospital.  It seems that at this late stage, instead of engaging teams to assist the board in advancing the project, the Department of Health has intervened to demand a traffic management survey be carried out.  It is incredible that before the site was selected in the first place, such a traffic management survey would not have been engaged.  It has been suggested to me that due to adjustments to be made to the brownfield site, the overall cost will now be prohibitive to the extent that the Department of Health is looking for an opt-out from this site.  In parallel, An Taisce and others are promoting a greenfield site - or at least a much easier site to deal with - adjacent to the maternity hospital at the Coombe.  There are serious concerns about whether this project will advance, how quickly it will advance and if we will ever see it.  The Minister needs to clarify this position as a matter of the utmost urgency.</p></speech>

It is unnecessary.  I would much prefer us to have a proper debate on that issue when we have had a chance to prepare for it and get briefings in advance.  I was involved in the Coombe hospital bid, as a supporter of that bid, as a local resident and as somebody who has been involved in various ways with that hospital.  I felt at the time that it would have been more appropriate to have had a children's hospital located on the same site as a maternity hospital.  I am concerned to see that this issue has been re-opened since.  As the decision has been taken to site the hospital at St. James's Hospital, it is important that progress be made in order that we can have a children's hospital in place.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has given assurances that it will go ahead, as has the Minister for Health.  When there is a perception of a delay, unfortunately, that allows new issues to arise in respect of the choice of the site.  We need to see some clarity on it.</p><p>While I would welcome such a debate, it is unrealistic to expect that debate to happen today.  It is not helpful to have a debate until we have had a chance to prepare for it and to get briefings in advance.  I would welcome the opportunity to invite in experts to address us on this.  Let us hear from An Taisce and others who have raised issues about the site at St. James's Hospital.  That would be helpful in advance of a debate and it would make our debate much more meaningful.  I would welcome the Minister in a few weeks when we have had that opportunity to prepare.</p><p>When is it proposed to take the new human rights and Equality Authority Bill?  I think we should expect it before Christmas, but I am not sure of the timing of it.  On Monday, I attended the first joint launch of the two authorities' annual reports, namely, the 2012 reports for the existing Equality Authority and Human Rights Commission.  They were launched together in the Mansion House with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is a sign of the work to come when we have a merged authority, but it is very important that we see that merger take place through the legislation as soon as possible.  We have done much work at the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality with the commissioners designate on the merged authority, but we need to see progress on the legislation and I would like to know when it will be brought before the House.</p></speech>

It relates again to the European Union, and it calls into question whether we have the capacity in this House to deal with this without significant additional resources.

I wish to express my concern about this, because it would be useful for us to have a debate on the situation regarding the exchange of information and the eavesdropping on millions of telephone conversations.  We should be very grateful to the whistleblowers involved.  I hope to nominate them for the Nobel prize.  As Members of Parliament, we all get the opportunity to nominate people for the Nobel peace prize.  They have done more for peace than most people.</p><p>We hear much about people having difficulty buying schoolbooks because they cannot pass them from one generation to the next, as the schoolbooks change every year and so on.  It has gone one stage further now, when many schools are using iPads for teaching purposes.  I heard of a parent-teacher meeting at a particular school at which the father of a pupil was confronted by Bank of Ireland officials handing out leaflets offering loans at 14% to buy these iPads.  It is rather unfair that parents should be jumped on in this precipitate manner, particularly when credit unions can offer them loans at 4%.  There is a responsibility on schools, if they are going to make these demands on parents, at least to help them in the most positive way to get the lowest possible loans.</p><p>That all brings me to banks.  It is about time we had another debate on banks and the banking system.  Nothing has happened.  The system and many of the people who were involved are still in place.  I have great sympathy for bank staff, but every time I go into a bank there are fewer staff and more machines.  That indicates that banks do not want any interpersonal interaction.  That is bad for society and bad for banking, and it leads to bad decisions because we do not know the people involved.</p><p>I agree with my colleagues who have asked for the Minister for Health to come to this House, but it should not be just to discuss the national children's hospital.  I am not at all antagonistic towards the Minister for Health.  I think he is a most energetic Minister.  I listened with interest to my colleague, Professor Crown, who should know, saying he was the best Minister for Health in his experience.  I am not attacking him personally, but it is certainly very worrying when the CEOs of four major hospitals write to the HSE to state that because of the cutbacks imposed, patient safety is threatened.  This is added to by another external influence, which is not party political.  It is a mistake to make these things party political issues.  The troika has expressed concern about the situation inside the Department of Health.  It would be useful for us to have a debate on the issue in this House.</p></speech>

Yesterday he told us that he was reliably informed off the record that the committee involved had been instructed not to spend any more money.  I can reliably inform him on the record that yesterday was the first anniversary of the Government's announcement that the new national children's hospital would be located on the St. James's Hospital campus.  The Minister for Health issued a detailed statement of progress that has been made to date, such as the appointment of the national children's hospital group, the appointment of a national paediatric development board, funding of &euro;200 million for the project, the appointment this month of the CEO of the national children's hospital group, Ms Eilish Hardiman, the approval of the design brief, the start of the site decant at St. James's Hospital, as well as the start of preplanning application discussions.</p> <p>The Government is also committed, in the environmental impact assessment, to examining the inclusion of a maternity hospital at the site.  That will address the concerns of An Taisce.  The Government is 100% committed to this major project.  This national children's hospital is badly needed to care for sick children from across the country, not just those in Dublin.  The raising of red herrings and putting question marks over the project will do it a disservice.  I ask all sides of the House to fully commit to developing the project. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1164" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013110700004#C00200"><p>This morning we have learned that 3,500 local authority houses are vacant at a time when 98,000 people are on the waiting list.  We pay almost &euro;500 million per year to private landlords for providing accommodation to people that the State should provide for.  I commend landlords for providing private accommodation but it is unfortunate that the 3,500 units in the ownership of local authorities have not been allocated to the people who badly need them.  The main reason for the delay in allocation is that the local authorities do not have the funds to carry out renovations.</p><p>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister of State responsible for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to attend in the next few weeks to debate the matter.  It is time that local authorities took a look at the tenants that they allocate houses to and the way houses are maintained by tenants.  It is unacceptable to have somebody who has vandalised a house moved to another house without paying some type of compensation to the local authority.  The matter must be addressed because quite a few of the housing units have been vandalised by tenants.  </p><p>I welcome today's announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills that the summer works scheme and the minor works scheme shall be reinstated with an allocation of &euro;70 million.  It is a welcome development for the schools who have had to rely on parents to maintain the school buildings since the Government abolished both schemes.  </p><p>Finally, I join Senator Norris in his call for a debate on banking.  At a time when banks should be opening up to their customers and engaging with the general public, they have reduced the number of public kiosks as a way to encourage people to use machines.  In the past the local bank manager always knew his or her client but that scenario has gradually been eroded.  Nowadays people must deal with machines located in their local branch rather than speak to the bank's personnel.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013110700004#C00300"><p>I support Senator Wilson's call for a discussion on the 3,500 vacant social housing units.  I totally share his concern.  I am aware that money was made available in previous budgets to turnaround the number of vacant units more quickly.  However, I disagree with the Senator on one point.  Not all of the units were vandalised by tenants.  There are a number of the units where the tenant will have died due to natural causes, such as old age, but there is no successor tenant to take over the tenancy.  Housing standards have also improved dramatically over the years so many houses must be completely and totally refurbished.</p><p>I shall outline another scandal.  A brand new kitchen or bathroom installed by a tenant must be removed and the property restored to the standard housing unit provided by a local authority.  That is the epitome of nonsense.  We must examine the vacant housing unit scenario and how quickly they can be made available.  Some local authorities have introduced innovative measures that allows housing units to be turned around more quickly.  For example, in the Dublin City Council area tenants can avail of a unit and carry out some of the work themselves.  </p><p>Senator Wilson mentioned the larger problem of 98,000 people being left on the housing waiting list and practically no construction of local authority social housing.  Along with asking the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, what measures can be taken to turn around the empty social housing units more quickly, we need a larger debate on the future of social housing and where it is going. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013110700004#C00400"><p>There has been a very good campaign to promote safe food in recent times.  Another food-related issue is food waste.  It is a matter that is in our own hands to a very large extent so I am not sure that we need legislation.  We must encourage whomever, perhaps the Department of Health, to convince the public to reduce food wastage.  I do not have the figure for food wastage in Ireland but the figures for Britain and the United States are huge.  The supermarket industry uses promotions called BOGOF which means &quot;buy one get one free&quot; and acts as a real incentive to people to buy things that they do not need.</p><p>  Another matter is size.  In particular, the size of loaves of bread and sliced pans are so large that between half and two thirds is thrown out.  The same applies to salads.  In the past people bought a lettuce but now they buy packs of lettuce.  Apparently, the amount of packs wasted is very large.</p><p>  As I said, I am not sure if we need to legislate against food wastage.  We did not convince the public to reduce their use of plastic bags until the plastic bag tax was introduced.  The measure has worked well and people around the world have been full of admiration for the way Ireland handled the matter.  The plastic bag tax has proved useful and I do not understand why other countries have not followed suit.  The correct way to deal with food wastage is to convince the public of the wisdom of purchasing differently, particularly when it comes to food.  People are starving in the world yet we throw out a very large amount of food.  It is not just the supermarkets who waste food, households throw out the most food.  The <i>safe</i>food people must make a determined and convincing argument to reduce food waste. </p></speech>

The decision is in the best interest of the employees, the company and the travelling public.  I hope that Dublin Bus can be restored to profitability and continues to provide a proper and appropriate service to the travelling public.</p><p>I support the call to arrange a discussion on vacant houses with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I appreciate and realise that &euro;15 million has been allocated in this year's budget to repair some of the housing stock.  The speed at which local authorities turn houses around is insufficient.  I agree with Senator Wilson that there should be a form of penalty when houses are left in an appalling condition and vandalised by tenants.  No citizen of this country should walk away with impunity if he or she has vandalised a property of the State that the taxpayer is hard pressed to pay for.</p><p>The ongoing maintenance of local authority houses is a difficult issue.  I want a system introduced that would incentive tenants to maintain their houses in an appropriate fashion.  I also want a system to deal with minor repairs.  Rather than the local authority having to do the work, the tenant could carry out such work and earn a credit that he or she can put  towards rent.  Local authority housing should be the subject for a very significant debate in the House.</p><p>I am very pleased with the announcement by the Minister for Education and Skills of an allocation of &euro;70 million for school improvements. </p> <p>The reintroduction of the summer works scheme will be greatly welcomed, especially in my county of Galway.  Over the years that scheme provided much-needed repairs and significant improvements to schools.  In recent years schools were under severe pressure to have repairs carried out to keep going.  I urge schools to get their applications in quickly.  For primary schools the application process for the small works scheme is pretty straightforward.  I look forward to seeing a significant improvement in our school stock in the coming months.</p></speech>

It is beyond belief that the HSE would only now be commissioning a traffic survey.  One would imagine that kind of work would have been done in advance.  It just shows the incompetence of the organisation.</p><p>Will the Leader to organise a debate on a disturbing story reported today?  Will he inquire of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Health who in the HSE will be fired given that the HSE did nothing about an abuse victim, whose abuse was identified four years earlier.  The HSE was informed about the abuse and yet it continued for four years.  The HSE's excuse was that it fell through the cracks.  In the name of God, it is unacceptable for a child of four to continue to be abused even though the State is made aware of it.  It is simply not an excuse to say it fell through the cracks and that we will get it the next time.  What is even worse, the HSE's defence was that it happened in light of austerity.  This was brought to its attention in July 2007.  There was no austerity or cutbacks at that stage and yet it is trying to use a flippant excuse.  Somebody in the HSE was responsible for that abuse continuing.  That person is as bad as the perpetrator because he or she is continuing to work in the system and is getting paid, but is obviously incompetent.</p><p>I call for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to clarify whether politicians, judges and senior civil servants will be exempt from the 70% tax on pensions in excess of &euro;60,000.  There seems to be a lack of clarity on this and we are told it will be dealt with in the Finance Bill.  We know the people dealing with the Finance Bill are the senior civil servants who will be affected by this measure.  The establishment and the elite in the Department of Finance being able to exempt themselves, judges and other senior civil servants sounds like the worst form of cronyism and cosy-cartel elitism that one could imagine.  Can the Leader clarify whether judges, senior politicians and senior civil servants will be exempt from the 70% tax?</p></speech>

The money that will be spent by schools will be well spent and, what is important, it will be spent in the local economy of the area of each school.  It will buy local labour and local goods.  The money will cycle through the economy and have a double contribution by improving the schools and the economy.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Finance's promised amendment to the one-parent family tax credit.  There was considerable lobbying and many people were displeased.  He has listened to the suggestions made and will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in cases where the primary carer has no tax liability.  That is something we should welcome.</p><p>There are young people in the Visitors Gallery, many of whom may benefit from the 44,500 jobs in the ICT sector that Forf&aacute;s has predicted over the next six years.  I hope some of those young people will able to get involved in next week's science week, which celebrates the contribution Irish people have made to science and, more important, highlights the role science, technology, engineering and mathematics have in the careers of young people.  I hope those jobs will stay in Ireland and that we will be able to employ Irish people in those jobs.</p><p>I hope I am not too late in congratulating Sligo Rovers on their victory last Sunday.</p></speech>

He felt it incumbent on him to refer to entirely inappropriate interference, allegedly by another judge and a politician, in a family law case in which he had been involved.  That is a serious matter, and it has been touched upon by those on the benches opposite, although not obviously the case in question.  Arising out of it, I hope the Attorney General and the Chief Justice will take whatever steps should be taken.  It may lead to the expedition of the promised judicial council Bill.</p><p>Senator Hayden referred to 3,500 vacant houses.  A debate on that social housing matter would be important.  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on the radio this morning.  Some &euro;422 million was provided towards rented accommodation last year.  We are led to believe that is a normal turnaround in regard to houses.  I take on board what Senator Wilson said about people vandalising them, which is horrific.  In some instances substantial work is required on these houses.  We are aware that the Department is pushing local authorities, some of which are lax in this regard, to speed up making these houses available.  I believe a debate would be helpful and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State if it can be arranged.</p></speech>

He intends to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to allow a transfer of the credit to the other parent where the designated principal carer has no taxable income.  While this may not go far enough for some in terms of equality, it will be of significant practical benefit to many-----</p></speech>

They play a significant role in the care of their children in general, even though they are not the principal carers most of the time.  This is a good decision for the family.</p> <p>We need to recalibrate the role of men in our Constitution as regards the family, in legislation and in our attitudes and assumptions to support and vindicate fathers in the family.  In that sense, I would welcome if the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, came to the House to outline the position.  We had a weekend at the Constitutional Convention considering the role of women in the home and public life, and rightly so.  As a corollary, I would like to hear the views of the Minister for Justice and Equality on the role of men and fathers in the family and the home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-07a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013110700006#E00200"><p>Senator MacSharry raised a question in respect of the national children's hospital and Senator Clune made some valid points in that regard.  The decision to build the national children's hospital at St James's Hospital has been made in the best interests of children with clinical considerations being of paramount importance as well.  The building of the hospital is a Government priority and capital funding has been set aside for its delivery.  No effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  The Minister for Health has restructured the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to enable it to focus on a single core function, the building of the new hospital.  In identifying the site, the Government carefully considered the report of the Dolphin group as well as detailed supplementary information on costs, time and planning, which was sought subsequently from those members of the group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was made in the best interests of children with clinical considerations being of paramount importance.  Co-location and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital on the St James's Hospital campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p><p>The new children's hospital is a key commitment in the programme for Government and the largest project within the current capital plan.  The Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  If it is necessary to bring the Minister for Health to the House to reiterate what I have stated, I will certainly ask him.  It is a good news story.  It is long before time that we had a commitment to build a children's hospital and money has been set aside for it.  The thing is to proceed now at the best possible time to build this hospital and that is what everyone wants.  Certainly, I will ask the Minister to come to the House.  However, as Senator Bacik said, it would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to come today since he has several commitments.</p><p>Senator Bacik also raised the matter of the Irish human rights and equality commission Bill.  I will find out for the Senator when that will be introduced to the House and I will notify her.</p><p>Senator Norris raised a procedural item in respect of No. 1.  As the Cathaoirleach pointed out, that matter is being referred to committee and, if requested, we will certainly allow a debate on it when it comes back from committee.</p><p>Senators Wilson, Mullins, Hayden and others referred to local authority houses and the fact that 3,500 local authority houses are vacant, which is an absolute disgrace.  Funding has been provided for the renovation of local authority houses.  However, a considerable number still need significant renovation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, was in the House only last month to discuss the residential tenancies Bill.  We will certainly ask her to come to the House again to address that problem.</p><p>Senator Wilson and other Senators referred to the summer works scheme and the minor works grant scheme announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  Over &euro;28 million is now being made available to provide once-off minor works grants to primary schools.  This grant will be paid to primary schools in the coming weeks and will enable them to undertake small-scale repair works without the need to interact with the Department.  All schools will welcome that.  A total of &euro;40 million has been allocated for the purposes of the summer works scheme for schools in 2014.  The scheme will be open to primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme which have permanent recognition and which are in non-rented accommodation.  This funding will allow schools to carry out small and medium-scale building works such as gas, electrical and mechanical works, roof and windows upgrades and structural improvements.  These works can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of schools.  This will be welcomed by everyone involved in the education sector.</p><p>Senator Hayden referred to the turnaround for vacant local authority houses and called for a debate on the future of social housing.  I will ask the Minister State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come to the House on that matter.</p><p>Senator Quinn referred to food waste and made some valid points in that regard.  It is something that should be considered by everyone involved, including consumers and retailers.  It is disgraceful that we have so much food waste when we have so many people hungry in the world.</p><p>I have outlined the situation with regard to the schools minor works scheme, a matter raised by Senator Mullins.  I note his points in respect of tenants in local authority houses who leave houses in a deplorable condition.  He reiterated the point that Senator Wilson made, that is to say, penalties should be in place for those people.</p><p>Senator Daly referred to a child abuse case dating from 2007 and called for accountability within the HSE.  We all agree that there should be accountability in every aspect of the State and certainly within the HSE in that instance.  Senator Daly raised a question regarding the exemption of certain people from tax on lump sums.  It is probably a matter we can discuss under the Finance (No. 2) Bill and the Bill before this House yesterday, which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, took.  We will take Committee Stage of that Bill next week and it may be appropriate for Senator Daly to put those questions to the Minister at that point.</p><p>Senator O'Keeffe referred to the proposals to create 44,000 jobs in the information technology sector and pointed out that next week is science week.  I have invited the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, to the House next week to debate the question of science week, something Senator Quinn has asked for previously, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will be in the House to discuss the matter next week.  Senator O'Keeffe also scored a last-minute goal in congratulating Sligo Rovers.</p></speech>

Judges are independent in the matter of the conduct of any court case, including any rulings in the court case, as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of the judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and law.  It is crucial to the functioning of our democracy that each of the vital institutions of state show due respect to the roles played by each other and avoid entering into areas that go beyond constitutional propriety.  I have no wish to comment any further on that matter.</p> <p>Finally, Senators Jim D'Arcy and O'Keeffe raised the single parent tax credit and the amendment the Minister, Deputy Noonan, proposes to make in the Finance Bill, which I am sure will be welcomed by many.</p></speech>

I wish somebody in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would consider introducing a similar rule in this House.  It would go a long way to making it a more efficient House.</p><p>  The Minister will be aware that this amendment arose out of discussions on Committee Stage involving my colleague, Senator Power, who was concerned about rental income being taken on the basis of the gross income.  As section 3 refers to the extension of PRSI liability to all employed contributors who also have unearned income, and that includes investment income, income from rental properties, etc., Senator Power was concerned that this would have an adverse effect on those who were not landlords by definition but who found themselves in a situation where they were renting out a room or where they had a house they were renting out other than their private principal place of residence.  As the amendment states, &quot;the same categories of deductible expenditure shall be allowable as may be used to reduce liability for income tax on that rental income&quot;.  The argument being put forward was that there are costs involved which are not taken into account in this proposal to extend PRSI onto rental income, that it is taken as a gross figure and does not take account of the costs involved such as running repairs, maintenance, property tax and so on and therefore it is unfair on that category of person who will now find themselves having the PRSI liability extended.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that rental income would be treated on a net level rather than on a gross basis.</p></speech>

I opposed that because I believed unearned reckonable income should be subjected to PRSI but a number of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators yesterday made an interesting point about rental income in that a situation could arise where somebody has a second home they are renting out.  They might get &euro;500 or &euro;600 a month in rental income but the mortgage on the property might be substantially more, yet they have to pay PRSI on whatever income they get, which would be unfair.  While I did not support yesterday's amendment because I felt it was too broad, I would support the thrust of this amendment because it would be unacceptable for somebody to be making a loss on a property and then be asked to pay PRSI on that loss.  That does not make sense to me.  It should be on profit and any excess rather than a flat PRSI contribution on the rental income.  It is a fair amendment and it should be accepted by the Minister.</p></speech>

I also asked a question about unearned income and so on and it relates to this to a certain extent because a landlord has certain responsibilities, which were rehearsed again today by Senator Mooney, but the most unjust of all is if somebody is forced into a situation of leaving their apartment, renting it out, renting a cheaper apartment and making a loss.  I do not see how anybody could morally be taxed upon a loss-making situation.  Even though there is income, the gap between that income and what they owe as a result of the financial situation in which they find themselves should be taken into account.  If somebody is in difficulty already, this will only make it worse and for that reason I am very happy to support the amendment.</p></speech>

Generally, the annual tax and PRSI liabilities on non-PAYE income are charged on the same income base.  Broadly speaking, the tax and PRSI liabilities are charged on profits generated.  Where there are losses in a particular year, these losses are allowable as deductible expenditure which results in the reduction or elimination of the tax and the PRSI liabilities.</p><p>There is no provision for the offset of previous years' losses to reduce the PRSI liability.  The principle that the PRSI liability is calculated with allowing an offset for previous years' losses applies throughout the PRSI system and not just in regard to the rental income of employees.  Any change in the application of this core principle would significantly reduce PRSI income to the Social Insurance Fund.  As Senators can appreciate, as well as the one property landlord about whom Senator Power spoke yesterday, we also have many professional landlords in the State with multiple properties.  The loss of PRSI if this rule were to be adopted, therefore, would be very significant.</p></speech>

The statistics quoted yesterday by Senator Power indicate that only 1,500 landlords across the country have an excess of ten properties and that the overwhelming majority of those defined as landlords have only one property at most.  I am not sure where the Minister is coming from in terms of her projected loss of income but the main thrust of my question relates to the calculation of the PRSI liability.  Will it be after all the costs and everything else are taken into account?</p></speech>

Where there are losses in a particular year, those losses are allowable in the year as deductible expenditure which results in the reduction or elimination of the tax and the PRSI liabilities.  Senator Power's question is about carrying those losses forward for PRSI purposes but whether there are only 1,500 professional landlords, and I do not know the statistics, they are very significant and they earn significant streams of rental income.  If this rule was to be applied to landlords both significant and smaller scale, the loss overall to the PRSI system would be very significant and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I do not recall a single occasion during my time in the House that a motion was permitted, which allowed money to be ring-fenced.  The Minister might discuss with her colleagues whether it is possible to do this.  I recall raising this issue in the context of drug money.  Tony Gregory came up with the idea of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  While he did not call it that, he suggested linking the Department of Social Welfare, the Garda and the Revenue as a method of getting at the gangsters, similar to the Al Capone situation, who were running the drugs war.  The Government of the day tried to avoid giving the credit to him but he was right.  I supported him in this House and I tabled a motion, about which I felt strongly, because I live in a area with a serious drugs problem.  The money was bled out of the veins of the people in the area and I wanted this substantial amount ring-fenced to create employment and educational opportunities there.  That was a blazingly obvious measure but it was opposed by the then Minister and it was clear the opposition came from the Department of Finance.  The amendment, therefore, will not be successful.</p><p>With regard to the reduced social welfare rate for the under 26s, this will be a more serious problem than I even thought yesterday, when I spoke at length about it.  I have received further information from one of the people by whom I have been briefed and he says that the Department originally stated these cuts would affect 13,767 people but they will impact on a much higher number.  He attached a table but it is not made clear to me whether the table originated from the Department or whether it is the result of an actuarial calculation.  He accepts that in 2014, a total of 13,767 claimants will be affected but by 2015, the number will increase to 22,756 and then to 28,193 in 2016.  It is possible the number will increase to in excess of 30,000 after that.  That makes this cut much more serious than I even imagined yesterday.  I am afraid I do not hold out a huge expectation that the amendment will be accepted but the issue is more urgent now that these figures exist and I assume they can be authenticated.</p></speech>

I acknowledge where it is coming from but we had a full debate on this issue on Second and Committee Stages when we dealt with sections 9 and 10.  The Minister was present throughout the debate and I take issue with Senator Norris's suggestion that the debate is futile or pointless.  She has listened carefully to all that we have to say and to the issues raised by the Senator and others and she has committed to providing more detail on the provision of placements and opportunities for young people through the plan being developed for the implementation of the youth guarantee, which will be published before Christmas and which we will have an opportunity to debate with her.  We have figures from the Department.  The total number of young people who will be affected by this provision will be approximately 14,000.  The number of available places for that cohort is in excess of 20,000.  That includes the two other Departments affected - the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills.  Other figures are hypothetical.  We will have an opportunity to tease out those issues with the Minister when we debate the plan for implementation of the youth guarantee and that will be the appropriate time to make these arguments.  We are all concerned to ensure the young people affected by this measure will have opportunities available to them through work placements, training and further education.  Nobody aged 25 or under should be forced to languish on the dole.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I described her as one of the two best Ministers in government.  I applaud her stamina.  I was not well enough to remain for the conclusion of last night's debate and I am sorry about that.  I was falling asleep because of the treatment I am undergoing.  I accept absolutely that the Minister gave full attention and listened but the fact remains that the Government tabled no amendments.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Quinn and Norris for moving and seconding the amendment.  I listened carefully to the Minister's comments yesterday.  Youth unemployment and emigration is such a serious issue that we cannot postpone addressing it.  The Government parties have an opportunity to say they are serious about this, they will do something about it and they are committed to laying a report before the Oireachtas.  I accept, based on what the Minister said yesterday, that early 2014 will be adequate.  I understand she must finalise the youth guarantee plan but the guarantee in and of itself will not be enough.  When Professor Pissarides appeared before the House, he explicitly said we should not put all our eggs in the one basket.</p> <p>The youth guarantee scheme is only offering at best a number of months of an opportunity but that, in and off itself, will not do it.   </p><p>On the figures, and I want to return to what Senator Bacik said, my figures indicate that 31,000 young people will be affected by the cuts in social welfare.</p></speech>

In the budget document there is a commitment to the allocation of &euro;14 million towards the youth guarantee scheme but &euro;32 million is being taken away.  Whatever way one's adds up the figures there is a shortfall.</p><p>I am not here to mince my words; I am here to say let us do good by our young people.  Let us invest in them and let us be targeted.  The Pathways to Work strategy is in place, young people access the Intreo service and there is a link up of services.  If a person has completed a degree or a post-leaving certificate course, there is a pathway for him or her.  I want the same approach to be taken with regard to these opportunities.  Given that we are so far down the road on this, I do not know why the Minister is not grabbing this, although perhaps she will, as a fairly constructive proposal.  It is simply saying that the Minister will accept, by early 2014, to lay a report before the Oireachtas on how the &euro;32 million will be reinvested in productive targeted education, training and activation measures.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept that, why not?  Is it that something is being covered up, which it should not be?  If she is not prepared to accept that, she should tell us why she is not prepared to do so.</p></speech>

Some 20,200 are specifically reserved for young people and I have the figures broken down under the headings of Youthreach and JobBridge.  Under the JobBridge heading 2,000 places are reserved for young people but a further 11,300 places are also available and young people are not barred from applying for those.  In all, there are 80,000 places, 20,000 places are reserved specifically for the young people and 58,400 additional places are available for which young people can apply - they are not barred from doing so.

We had a long debate on this yesterday and we all agreed that is not desirable from the perspective of the young individual or that of society.  As I explained to Senator Healy Eames yesterday, we are putting together the framework for the youth guarantee.  I am going to Paris next week with the Taoiseach to work on the second stage of what was agreed among European countries at the last meeting in Berlin.  The reason I am going is that I prioritised this for the Irish Presidency and got the agreement in Dublin last February that Ireland would do this.</p></speech>

Basically, it has a number of strands.  The first one is to develop traineeships and we would start to move to the German-Austrian-Finnish model of a dual system where we would not be simply directing almost all of our young people in terms of opportunity into third level.  We would be offering people traineeships - some traditional apprenticeships that would combine learning and work experience.  That seems to be what makes the difference for the countries which have significantly lower levels of youth employment.  We are engaged in extensive discussions with a range of different organisations, as is the Department of Education and Skills because through the new Solas structure it delivers a good deal on the training and education side.  I spoke about traineeships where people would become associate professionals and go into IT at the entry or mid-level, having been trained for, say, four to six months by a local IT or other educational institution.  They would then work for six to eight months, then have more education and then more work, and then the person is qualified to a mid-level for either an entry level job or a mid-level job.  Under the German, Finnish and Austrian system if such an individual showed a particular talent - such people do in significant numbers - and this could be in mechanics, in a technical area, or in electrics, they could then go on at that point to university.  We might find that the head of Porsche perhaps started off as an apprentice trainee, gained mechanical education and then moved on up the academic ladder.  Up to 20 years ago we had a strong mixed system in Ireland but as the economy developed we moved away from that in 1980s.  The last area of significant apprenticeships left in Ireland were apprenticeships in the construction sector.  In the other countries I mentioned such apprenticeships apply to the retail, banking, IT and technical sectors ranging from people who want to train to be opticians to those who want to train to be accountants and who become accountants and train at the technician level and then advance later.  I am talking about a vocational technical stream as opposed to a more university academic stream.</p><p>Another strand is promoting entrepreneurship among young people.  I have met many young people as I travelled around the country who want this skill covered at secondary level and even at primary level.  Pupils in the primary classes in my old school in Stanhope Street in the centre of Dublin are undertaking small-scale entrepreneurship projects around small companies, coming up with an idea of producing a book or producing  items they can sell to their older brothers and sisters for their debs night such as key rings and so on.  That is an important stream also.  Many jobs in the future will be self-created, perhaps leading to the person becoming an employer of other people.  We are having a very interesting experience as a country as we open ourselves up to new ideas and I am listening very carefully to the ideas.  </p><p>The number of people who will be affected next year by the measure will be approximately 13,500 to 14,000; those are not my figures, they are the official figures.  We can turn around what we are spending exclusively on people's social welfare payments, as it were for them to do nothing, and perhaps feel neglected and tempted to emigrate because they do not see a future here and change that investment into training, education and work experience.  With the number of JobBridge internships having passed 22,000, the most striking feature is the calibre of the young people, which, as I said yesterday, is very good.  Many of their educational qualifications are very impressive but they have never held a job.  They came of age and were in secondary school and in third level when the Celtic tiger was doing very well.  They did not have an opportunity to do low level entry jobs that would have given them the experience of working.  People emerged then with estimable qualifications but because they have never worked employers will not take a bet on them.</p> <p>They will prefer the person who has a mix of work experience and technical education.  If those people were undertaking a graduate course in a German university, one could be jolly sure that they would be employed at the local Siemens facility, or in some other company, during term time or on an occasional basis so they would have some serious work experience by the time they graduate.  I think that has been the missing element here.</p><p>As I said yesterday, I am happy to undertake to come back to the Seanad for a detailed debate on this matter.  By the end of the year, the Heads of State have to sign off on this and we have to put forward the Irish proposals in this regard.  I am interested to hear about people's different experiences and ideas.  We will actually start next year.  We are already doing some of these things through our education system and various social protection schemes.  We need to make some leaps of imagination.</p><p>On 1 January next, we will open the JobsPlus scheme to young people who have been out of work for more than six months.  We will give the employer a wage subsidy of &euro;300 for every month of employment given to the young person, up to a maximum of two years, which is what happens in Germany and Austria.  We will give the employer a subsidy of &euro;400 a month if the person who is taken on has been unemployed for more than two years.  I think that is a good incentive.  It means that employers who are trying to decide whether they can afford to take on more people - whether they have the cash flow and the profitability to support this - will have a wage subsidy, part of which will be targeted at young people.  In turn, the employer will receive the freshness, energy, initiative and enthusiasm that all young people bring to the workplace.  The young person will have an enormous sense of pleasure and achievement at having been selected for work.  That is such a formative experience for young adults.  Anyone who misses out on it has to take a long step back to start to get it again.</p><p>As I have said, I will be happy to come back to the House to go through this approach in detail.  Between 13,000 and 14,000 people will be affected by this measure.  A cache of 20,000 places will be available.  I am very confident that we will be able to provide very interesting, rewarding, fulfilling and progressive avenues and pathways to our young people.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, as soon as practicable, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report detailing the implications of the phasing out of Mortgage Interest Supplement.&quot;.</blockquote>We discussed this issue yesterday evening.  When we speak about emigration, we emphasise the importance of young people to this country.  This amendment has been proposed because a person's home is his or her sanctuary.  This country's mortgage arrears crisis is of mammoth proportions.  Some 142,000 family homes are in mortgage arrears.  One in every five mortgages in this country is in arrears.  In 2012, the Minister and her Department paid &euro;55 million in mortgage interest supplement.  She has said she intends to phase out this payment over four years.  I agree with her that it is ridiculous to give this money to families, which in turn give it to banks only to end up owing as much as if not more than they owed to the banks at the outset as a result of their capital, principal and interest arrangements with those banks.</p><p>  I am concerned to ensure every household that is phased out of mortgage interest supplement is linked up with a bank to provide that a mortgage resolution process is put in place for that customer and home owner.  Something similar is done under Pathways to Work.  I am looking for joined-up thinking between the person who is losing the mortgage interest supplement and his or her bank or mortgage lender.  That is necessary to ensure the person in question is not put out of his or her home.  I have worked with a bank on behalf of two customers who were in danger of losing their homes.  In both cases, solutions would not have been achieved under the mortgage arrears resolution process without my intervention.  On both occasions, the case had to go to appeal.  In both instances, the standard financial statement had been completed.  These people were in difficulty until an oral hearing, which is not part of the mortgage arrears resolution process, was held.  The bank was not accepting their figures.</p><p>  I am not at all convinced.  I am not impressed with the banks.  I accept that I am being quite strong in my remarks when I say I am not convinced that the Central Bank is managing the process adequately.  A former regulator, Mr. Neary, let us down.  I am looking for the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, to be far more proactive on this issue.  There must be joined-up thinking between those who are being phased out of mortgage interest supplement and their banks.  That is necessary to ensure a sustainable solution is put in place to help them to keep their homes.  That is why in this amendment, I am looking for a report from the Minister.  I ask her to speak on that point only.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-07a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013110700012#L02600"><p>I second the amendment.</p> <p>We are also dealing with amendment No. 13, which is my own amendment.  We had quite a detailed discussion on this yesterday.  I do not expect the Minister to launch into another dissertation similar to what she gave yesterday because we have already got the message.  However, the message in this instance, and I assume it is similar coming from Senator Healy Eames and her proposers, is that the solution lies with the banks.  The Government can do all it wants to do.  It can abolish this but ultimately it is about the relationship between the mortgage holder and the bank.  It has been made quite clear that the banks have failed dismally to address this issue.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that I have opposed this measure, I would hope that with the withdrawal of several million euro from the banks that has been paid directly, as the Minister has repeatedly said, the banks will receive a wake-up call that will focus their minds.  The banks have been happy to take this money over the past number of years without seeming to do anything about it.  They seem to be happy just to take the money and let the mortgage holder continue to drift along.  There has been no reduction in the principal, which has remained the same.  There would, therefore, seem to be a moral imperative on the part of the banks aside from a practical one to do something about this once this measure is put in place.  </p><p>That is why I put down this amendment in line with the FLAC and NCLC submission.  It is worded in such a way that it gives the Minister some wriggle room in that it asks her to lay before each House as soon as is practicable a report detailing the implications of the retention of mortgage interest supplement at least until the Central Bank can produce satisfactory evidence that lenders have sustainable strategies to maintain people in their homes without the need for the supplement.  That has been absent in the relationship between the mortgage holder and the banks up to now, particularly those in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  That is why it is long past time the Government as the major stakeholder in one pillar bank and the owner of a 15% stake in Bank of Ireland called those banks to account.  They appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and did not really cover themselves in glory.  They obfuscated and created smokescreens.  Even the best brains of the committee seem to have been thwarted in their efforts to get them to take some action in this regard.  That is the reason for and the context of this amendment.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the withdrawal of the subsidy will not cause people to leave their houses.  Every time a family leaves a property, it is bad for society economically and socially.  It puts pressure on housing agencies, local authorities and voluntary housing bodies.  This debate is probably part of a wider context about the bigger challenge facing the Government where so many households are in huge debt and we do not seem to have found a proper process of resolution.</p><p>The point could also be made that if we were starting with a blank sheet, we could have a better system for administering the mortgage subsidy, which is very much a housing issue yet was being facilitated by officers from the Department of Social Protection, where every issue relating to housing would be corralled within a single housing authority or Department.  Perhaps we need to look at that in the future.  Could the Minister give us some indication that in conjunction with her Government colleagues, in respect of the money her Department is no longer paying and which was the difference between some people being able to pay their mortgage or not, she will ensure that we will be able to put sufficient pressure on the financial institutions to force them to sit down with the affected families with the intention of keeping people in their homes?  The entire House is at one on that.  How will the Minister ensure that the removal of the mortgage subsidy will not result in people being forced out of their houses on to, at best, a housing list and, in some extreme cases, on to the streets?  I appeal to the Minister to give us a positive overview of her and the Government's thinking about debt resolution and mortgage distress as it now sadly applies to thousands of families across the country.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Minister is closing this to new applicants in 2014 and the whole thing will be abolished in 2018.  I presume that to a certain extent it gives people advance notice.  If they are considering buying a house, they must take this into account in their calculations.  In this extreme financial situation, that is not so unfair.  To phase it out for existing people is dangerous because we already have severe strain in the mortgage area.  Banks are determined to increase the number of evictions and we have international advice to do this as well.  This is utterly heartless and cruel and I despise the system that makes this the case.  When this crisis was just beginning to be visible, I suggested that we should have a Department of Home Security, not Homeland Security like mad Mr. Bush.</p></speech>

I agree that he is getting crazier all the time - drones and all that but that is a side issue.  Any measure that would worsen the situation and lead either to greater mortgage difficulties or ultimately homelessness should be looked at very carefully.  For the benefit of Senator Mooney who is anxious to know my sources, this was from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  In its submission on the Bill, it said:<blockquote><br />There has been much discussion on the challenging issue of mortgage debt facing so many people.  A range of solutions have been put in place and it will take time to ascertain if the most recent developments have the capacity to make the progress that is so badly needed.  The income from Mortgage Interest Supplement can play an important role in supporting unemployed people to maintain a roof over their heads and its discontinuance will throw up considerable challenges for these families.  The Government's concerns that a short-term support has morphed into a long-term one should be addressed in alternative manner: leaving people struggling further with the stark realities of being unemployed is not in Ireland's interest.</blockquote>I agree with Senator Mooney when he quoted from the submission from FLAC.  There is a very valuable recommendation that it should be retained until the Central Bank can demonstrate evidence that the banks, of whom there are fewer and fewer, can address the matter.  Large international banks are withdrawing from the country and there are only about two of our own crippled banks left.  We should consider waiting until banks can show that they are actually in the business of assisting people in some way.  Otherwise, we are just leaving people stranded.  That would certainly concern me.</p></speech>

Senator Mooney was very close to the mark when he implied that the banks would not be upset that we have paid &euro;319 million to them since 2008.  Who would not like to receive payments on the nose totalling &euro;319 million?  It is a very nice business for the banks but they are probably the only happy people in this arrangement because the couple whose house it is are not advancing to resolve their debt.  We know from bank crashes around the world, or from companies and individuals who get into financial difficulty, that, at the end of the day, they must try to resolve the financial crisis.  While many people have been built up on the mortgage interest supplement for an average of three years, many have been on it for six and seven years.</p><p>The other difficulty is that these people cannot work for more than 30 hours a week.  That applies to each spouse and both together.  Otherwise, they will lose the supplement.  It is a bit of an employment trap too.  We are talking about people who went out in good faith to buy houses on the basis of their employment and, in many cases, their business because they were involved in construction.  One of the downsides of the mortgage interest supplement is that it locks one in.  If one is going back to work or business full time, one immediately loses the supplement.</p><p>The Keane group recommended the development of mortgage-to-rent schemes for eligible couples or families to give them access to housing supports.  It may interest Senators to know that we have been working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, whose job is housing and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, where appropriate, to move families whose debt is unsustainable from the mortgage interest scheme into the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  That has had a slow take-off but if we can move people from one to the other, it may well be that, down the road when people's financial position has recovered in ten or 15 years' time, they would be able to buy back the interest in the house which they probably bought proudly and in which they started their family life and so on.  The family home is very important in this context. </p><p>We are engaging with the Department.  Almost 1,000 cases are being progressed in the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Lenders are engaging with approximately 600 households, and the number of fully completed cases is low, at 22.  Approximately 30% of these cases are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  Those cases are being progressed.  Over the four years of the winding down of the scheme, we will certainly assist people, where we can and in that way, to sustainable solutions.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is by and large the one delivering sustainable solutions through the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  I assure Senators, who are understandably concerned about this, that I agree with the Keane report that this is not an appropriate scheme and is not doing very much.  I gave examples yesterday of up to &euro;60,000 and more being paid in interest while the capital amount outstanding on the loan had risen, so people were no better off, even though the Department of Social Protection had spent a very significant sum of money on paying the interest to A.N. Other bank.  I agree with the Keane report that we should move to sustainable solutions.  Mortgage interest supplement is not a long-term sustainable solution.  If it makes no provision for people to re-start their business or employment on a full-time basis, it is an unemployment, anti-business, anti-starting again poverty trap.</p></speech>

There is no advantage to dispossessing people.  We know that social housing provision is at an all-time low and this would move the cost somewhere else.  I want to see joined-up thinking.</p></speech>

There was no such difficulty in this House and I compliment the Leader of the House on allowing it.  While we disagreed on a number of vital issues concerning this legislation, as the Minister knows, it is never personal.  It is always political.  She batted effectively in defending her corner and while we did not manage to get her to accept any of the amendments we put forward, I believe she has taken on board many of the contributions made on all sides of the House.  I wish her well.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader for agreeing not to guillotine the debate this week on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which was very productive.  We all agree that painful decisions have had to be taken.  It gives us no pleasure to do that but we do it in the interests of the country.</p></speech>

She gave good and full answers, although she occasionally took advice from her legal eagles behind her.  I regret that none of our amendments was accepted but anybody who reads the Official Report will see that it was a full, clear debate and that on certain amendments the Minister met us part way in that she said she would come back to us or that they were covered in another circumstance.  It was a very useful debate.  Despite that the Bill was not changed in the House, I believe we have helped to alter to a small extent the context in which these decisions are made.  We raised questions which the Minister took seriously, and she undertook in certain circumstances to relay our concerns to some of her colleagues.  It was time well spent.  It is unusual for a senior Minister to spend a very long time here and as Senators we all appreciate that.</p></speech>

She has done a remarkable job.  It is a fair and balanced Bill.  It is a challenging time to put forward a budget but in the midst of that challenge there is great opportunity for reform, and I congratulate the Minister because I know that is her intention.  It is about tackling long-term unemployment.  We inherited a passive social welfare system-----</p></speech>

We tabled an amendment that was ruled out of order but it was a serious amendment on children and direct provision.  We had a debate in the House in recent weeks on direct provision in which Senators from all parties agreed that the direct provision system should be reformed.  The Minister is not yet of the same mind but there is a cohort of children in direct provision who are not eligible for children's allowance.  There are only about 1,500 of them.  We have had a children's referendum recognising the rights of children across the State but these children are left out of that scenario.</p> <p>I plead with the Minister to review the matter.  I appreciate that it is a legal situation between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality.  If we really believe that each child in the country is equal then these children should be included in the children's allowance provision.  I call on the Minister to examine the matter even at this late state.  If the provision cannot be included in the Bill then I ask her to do so moving forward.  I am being genuine.</p></speech>

I remain concerned about the cuts to the maternity benefit and the jobseeker's allowance, a concern shared across the House.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to come here to discuss the Irish plan for the youth guarantee.  She ably shared the information with us on how she showed leadership at European level on the issue.  We are clear that she is committed to ensuring that the youth guarantee is a good plan.  </p><p>Having listened to the debate, particularly on section 9, some good ideas were expressed from all across the House.  We could add and give our support to the youth guarantee in order to ensure that it is successful for young Irish people.</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister has spent time here, as I wish some of her colleagues would do.  She has engaged in debate here and has set an example to her ministerial colleagues in Cabinet to spend more time in the House.  To be fair, I have never criticised her attendance record because she has attended here, listened and engaged in debate.</p><p>We are all commending each other on a good debate on the Bill's provisions but before we take the final vote we must remember that the legislation will reduce and cut jobseeker's supplementary welfare allowance for under-25s.</p></speech>

One can tie the news up in any way one wants but that is what is happening, it is a significant cut.  The Minister proposes to abolish the bereavement grant so it will be completely gone.  In addition, in reducing maternity benefit by &euro;32 per week, the Minister said it was standardisation but it is not, because 96% of women will be affected by the cut and only 4% will gain.  The Minister is abolishing the mortgage interest supplement; increasing the waiting days for illness benefit from three to six days; discontinuing the personal weekly rate of &euro;230.30 paid to invalidity pensioners at age 65; and extending PRSI cover to all employed contributors of unearned income.</p><p>The following is not in the Bill but the Department of Social Protection has abolished the telephone allowance for the elderly.  That has been done already.  The Minister has increased minimum contributions for couples from &euro;5.35 to &euro;40 and changes have been made to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance. </p></speech>

What the Government Senators are voting on today will impact on people who need the State's support.  All of their promises and stances made while in opposition mean nothing and we have further proof today that they mean nothing.</p><p>During the debate the Minister gave a commitment to revisit some of these areas and to examine activation measures.  She has done so and I commend her for parts of that.  The fact of the matter is that this is a disgraceful Social Welfare Bill and its cuts will hurt the people who need our assistance.  Frankly, if the Government Senators feel good about the debate held over the past three days and they feel that they have done a good job, well great.  I shall wait to see what people think about the measures that they have approved here today.   </p></speech>

It was a very long day but we had some very good discussions on many issues.  At times the debate became party political but, in the round, we tried to confine our contributions to the many amendments being discussed.  It was a constructive debate.</p><p>I concur with Senator Darragh O'Brien that we must remember that we are here today to vote for a Social Welfare Bill that contains cuts worth over &euro;200 million that will impact on many people across the State.</p><p>I represent people who voted for me and my party and I have a responsibility, as a public representative, to articulate their concern to the Minister and the people in the Chamber.  I represent people who vote for my party and all of the people who contacted us about various cuts and used e-mail and telephones to express their disappointment at many of the cuts.</p><p>Some Senators in the House have clapped themselves on the back for the Bill but we must remind ourselves about some of the cuts.  For example, extending the waiting time for illness benefit from three to six days; cuts to maternity benefit; cuts to adoption benefit; cuts to injury benefit; the scrapping of the bereavement grant; cuts to the young jobseeker's allowance; cuts to the supplementary welfare allowance for young people; phasing out of the mortgage interest supplement and its cessation by a certain date; cuts to invalidity pension payment level for 65 year olds; and the other cuts that were announced in the budget that are not part of the social welfare Bill.  Many of the cuts are unfair.  Yesterday I made the point that if the Minister was in opposition she would oppose the cuts because this is not a Labour Party social welfare Bill or budget.  I view it as a Fine Gael budget due to the type of cuts outlined. </p><p>I find it very difficult, and share the frustration of the Government representatives, to listen to Fianna F&aacute;il talk about fairness.</p></speech>

I was alarmed by a representation I received from a constituent several months ago who had been trying to contact the children and family services in the area regarding his daughter who is subject to shared custody.  He reported that she was placed on the at-risk register.  She is nine years old and she has lived with her father for the past number of months as she has refused to return to the mother's house.  Her father and grandmother both reported to me that the child has had to seek medical care but is fine while living with her father.  He has sought a meeting with a social worker for many months but has been unable to contact anybody.  On one occasion, he called to the office and remained there for the morning in an effort to speak to someone.</p><p>I was approached by him for help and I contacted the appropriate services on his behalf.  I also was dismayed by the delay in communication from the staff.  Having taken the matter to a higher level more than two months ago, I was assured it would be dealt with.  I received an e-mail from a social worker in early October confirming that they had spoken to the child's father but when I contacted the family that evening, I was told this was not the case and that no contact had been made.  It is of great concern that this could happen.  On contacting the area manager about this matter, he confirmed that the facts in the e-mail sent to me by the social worker were not correct.  I again requested that a call be made to the father to allay his concerns, as I felt a simple telephone call by the appropriate person in the service would calm the situation and prevent the matter from blowing out of all proportion.  Unfortunately, that was more than four weeks ago and to date no contact has been made between a social worker and the father.  I contacted the area manager again this week and received no communication at all.  It is worrying that excuses such as lower staff numbers and cutbacks are given when a telephone call lasting only a few minutes could resolve this issue.  It raises a bigger issue regarding services for children.  We had the children's referendum and we all said we wanted to ensure the rights of children were addressed and upheld.  We continually say children are our most precious possession.</p><p>If this is happening in my area, will the Minister investigate whether this is being replicated nationally?  I seek an immediate intervention by her in this case on behalf of a father who is trying to do his best for his daughter.  Will the Minister examine the bigger picture to ensure adequate children and family services are provided in order that families in need receive the support they require?</p></speech>

With regard to the specific case raised by the Senator, officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contacted the children and family services of the HSE prior to this debate for the most up-to-date position.  The HSE has indicated it will endeavour to contact the father involved during next week, that is, the week commencing 11 November 2013, and I will ask my officials to speak to staff in the service to highlight the urgency of the response the Senator believes this case warrants.</p><p>It is regrettable that there has been a delay in addressing this request but it brings into focus the serious pressures facing our child welfare and protection services and social work teams.</p> <p>That is the reality of the situation.  Child protection and welfare referrals to the HSE have nearly doubled since 2007, from 23,618 in 2007 to 40,187 in 2012.  There is often focus on individual cases in the media and elsewhere, but the overall number of neglect and child abuse cases of concern being referred to the services stands at more than 40,000 in 2012.  That will probably marginally increase to nearly 42,000 in 2013.  There was a particularly sharp increase in referrals during 2012, from 31,626 in 2011 to 40,187 in 2012.  I welcome that people are referring because they are concerned about children, but it puts pressure on the system and services.  It means that people need to prioritise responses in terms of the more serious cases and make judgments all the time at the assessment point about what level of response they can give.</p><p>We re-launched the Children First guidelines in July 2011, and as a society we are working to create greater awareness of children who should be referred.  Owing to the age and gender profile among staff, social work staff numbers are constantly in flux.  There are 250 whole-time equivalent social work vacancies, including approximately 110 arising from maternity leave.  That clearly creates pressures.  There is considerable ongoing reform as well.  Considerable work is being done within teams locally and nationally to manage the very assessments the Senator mentioned in this case to try to ensure a more timely response to child protection referrals or other issues the Senator raised about access and custody.</p><p>We have introduced, for the first time, new national standards for child protection services.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is now involved in examining what is happening.  We have extremely good reports from some areas.  In other areas improvements remain to be made, but timely inspections are taking place for the first time.</p><p>I reassure the Senator about social work staffing.  Clearly in the office she mentioned there is an issue with the number of staff available to deal with these kinds of cases.  The current number of child and family social workers in post is 1,385 whole-time equivalents.  This includes all 270 posts recommended by the Ryan report.  Some 114 vacancies have recently been filled with a further 136 posts being filled, of which 51 have been accepted by candidates.  We obtained a budget increase of &euro;6.7 million to support child protection teams in the Estimate for 2014, rising to &euro;12 million in a full year, which will allow for additional recruitment.</p><p>We will also publish the Children First Bill in the near future.  I thank the Senator for raising this case and my staff have been following up on the details of it.</p></speech>

She mentioned extra funding and I ask her to consider the area of which I speak.  I know they do a fantastic job despite being under serious pressure owing to cutbacks.  When the families are at the other end of it, they feel they need some additional support.  If extra posts are available, I ask the Minister to consider placing them in that area.</p></speech>

My experience with the Department of Education and Skills, however, is that I will not.  Premises used by a post-primary school on an interim basis are about to become vacant.  Those premises are being made available to a primary school whose facilities are in very poor condition.  To my dismay, the board of management advised me that, after the initial offer was made, it was made conditional on St. Joseph's CBS changing its status from an all-boys school to a co-educational school.  I wish to know if that is the case.  If so, it represents interference by the Department of Education and Skills with the patrons of that school.  It is a decision that should have been made by the board of management without coercion and without undue interference by the Department.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides the opportunity to clarify to this House the future use of the school building which is currently used to accommodate the newly established post-primary school in Gorey, pending the provision of permanent accommodation for that school.</p><p>The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018, with more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary.  It will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level.  It is vital therefore that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.</p><p>To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department of Education and Skills must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p><p>The new permanent post-primary school building for Gorey is under construction.  Owing to the immediate demand for additional post-primary school places in Gorey, it was necessary to establish the new school in a temporary location pending the construction of the permanent building.  The new school concerned, now Creagh College, opened in September 2011.  The design of the building lends itself to conversion to a permanent primary school in future if required.</p><p>The most recent projections produced by the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the Gorey area forecast an increase in the projected demand at primary level in the coming years.  The future use of the Creagh building will, therefore, meet the co-educational pupil demand identified.</p><p>In June of this year, following a request by the school management, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, together with Department officials, met a delegation from St. Joseph's national school.  The delegation sought to relocate St. Joseph's to the Creagh building when it is vacated.  The Deputy will be aware that St. Joseph's is a senior boys' school catering for children from second to sixth class.  The neighbouring Loreto convent school, which caters for boys and girls up to first class, acts as its main feeder school.  The Department advised the delegation of the co-educational demand that must be met and that the proposal from the school must be considered in this context.</p> <p>The delegation undertook to consider the Department's position in conjunction with stakeholders and the patron, whereby the premises could potentially address the school's accommodation needs as well as the demographic needs of the area.  A formal response from the school authorities is awaited.</p><p>I thank the Senator for allowing the Minister for Education and Skills the opportunity to outline the position.  I was pleased to take this Adjournment matter on the Minister's behalf.</p></speech>

She stated, "The Department advised the delegation of the co-educational demand".  This does not suggest that it gave a direction, but that it is coercing those who met the Minister on behalf of the school management.  My question was clear - is the offer conditional?  It has not been answered as comprehensively as the Minister is able to answer for her own Department.  This is my criticism when the Minister for Education and Skills does not appear.  I still need to have my question answered.  If the Minister present is able to do so, I will gladly accept it, but I doubt that she can, as it does not relate to her Department.  This is the ridiculous nature of these debates.  I suggest to the Acting Chairman that when an answer is not forthcoming from a Department, the matter should be sent back for an immediate response.  It is unfair to and demeaning for the Chamber.  Is the term "The Department advised the delegation" a conditional response from the Department to the management, which met the Minister?  I would appreciate an answer.</p></speech>

It will probably not come as a surprise to the Senator to hear that similar concerns have been raised directly with the Minister by a wide variety of organisations and individuals.  I want to be clear, in that the Minister takes these concerns seriously.</p><p>  Perhaps it would be worthwhile my explaining the background to the proposed changes to income tax pay and file dates, as these are just one aspect of a much wider development.  Under the regulations known as the two-pack, which were formally adopted on 30 May 2013, a common budgetary timeline is being introduced for all euro area member states.  Specifically, the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all of the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year, draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all euro area member states not in a programme of assistance, and the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year.</p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government decided to bring budget day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on.  Accordingly, the Minister for Finance presented budget 2014 on Tuesday, 15 October.  The Government also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by 31 December each year.</p><p>  One of the most critical elements of the budgetary process is the accuracy of systems for forecasting potential revenue yield in the year in question prior to the budget actually taking place.  This is why pay and file dates have become important.  In the context of a December budget day, the availability prior to the budget of information on cumulative tax yields to the end of November gave a high degree of certainty to the estimation of potential outturn for the year.  For example, cumulative tax yield to the end of November 2012 was &euro;33.8 billion, which represented 92% of the full year outturn of &euro;36.6 billion.  On the other hand, the cumulative yield to the end of September, at &euro;26.1 billion, represented only 71.3% of the eventual outturn.</p><p>  The scope for unanticipated events that would lead to either a higher or lower than projected outturn is considerably increased in the context of an October budget.  Such occurrences could result in the highly undesirable need for countervailing measures to bring the budget back on track within a period of only a month or two of having been introduced in October, the new date resulting from the adoption of the two-pack.  In addition, the ability to project future yield is compromised.  Consequently, measures that would result in improvements in the availability of information or increases in the proportion of total yield already available prior to the budget must be considered.</p><p>  It is clear that the main areas where scope exists to introduce such improvements relate to the income tax pay and file arrangements.  However, it is critical that any change made here be implemented in a manner that will not cause problems for the State, industry or practitioners.  Therefore, on 11 October the Minister initiated a consultation process on a revision of the existing arrangements.  This process remains open until close of business tomorrow, Friday, 8 November, but I am sure that there could be some flexibility in respect of late submissions.  I encourage all those who hold views on the proposed changes to engage with the Department via this process.  Full details are available on the tax policy website, <i>www.taxpolicy.gov.ie</i>.</p></speech>

What level of engagement was there from the Department in highlighting our concerns with, for example, practitioners to make them aware of the possibility of a change to the filing deadlines?

Since it relates to her Department, I am delighted that she is present.</p><p>A number of houses on the affordable housing scheme have been lying idle in Killarney since 2009.  As the Minister of State knows, that scheme has been discontinued for some time, but the houses have remained empty.</p> <p>The houses were originally only available to applicants under the affordable housing scheme but despite a considerably reduced sale price those concerned still could not access mortgages and made alternative arrangements in respect of their housing needs.  The houses were then advertised on the open market at the reduced price but there was no great interest in them.  </p><p>The Minister of State will be aware, owing to the fact that no new social house building has taken place this year, that the number of people on the social housing list is huge.  While I acknowledge announcement of the construction of 500 new houses this year, taken in a countrywide context that is very little construction per county.  However, it is a step in the right direction.</p><p>The four houses about which I am speaking are ready for occupation and are located in a social housing complex.  People on the social housing list in Killarney are angered that they remain unoccupied while so many are in need of houses.  They cannot understand the reason they cannot be used for social housing purposes.  </p><p>I understand that Killarney Town Council has applied to have them redesignated as social housing.

Unsold affordable housing is often included in the social housing mix.  I am not aware of any proposal having been submitted by Killarney Town Council.  However, should one be submitted, it will be considered.</p><p>On the general issue of affordable housing schemes, the Government announced in its housing policy statement published in June 2011 the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, while clearly identifying that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p><p>Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, will be made in the context of both pieces of work.  We expect to make announcements in this regard in the near future.  These schemes were originally introduced to bridge the affordability gap of the boom years which prevented middle income households from realising their home ownership aspirations.  However, affordable housing did nothing to address the underlying problem, namely, market overheating with an unsustainable gap between prices and incomes.  As the Senator will be aware, there is currently little or no demand for affordable housing.  In recent years the challenge has been to deploy existing affordable stock productively rather than deliver new affordable housing.  This includes, where appropriate, its use as social housing stock.</p><p>The financial parameters within which we will continue to operate rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  None the less, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2011, I announced a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  A further &euro;50 million provided in the most recent budget for 2014 will be used to fund infrastructural investment, primarily in the housing area and includes &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme, &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project and additional funding for housing adaptation grants.  Almost 70% of the budget for my Department will go directly to support housing in 2014.</p><p>The total housing allocation for 2014 will result in an investment of over half a billion on a range of programmes, which means that funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs, one of which includes the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</p><p>More than 26,000 units of accommodation are currently managed by approved housing bodies.  The Government places approved housing bodies at the heart of social housing provision in the years ahead as Exchequer-funded large-scale capital building programmes are no longer financially possible.  I re-emphasise that such programmes have commenced and the Government intends to ramp them up as the finances of the country improve.  New social housing provision will rely to a significant extent on revenue-funded housing options such as leasing and on private investment into the sector.  We are utilising the approved housing body sector because it can attract external financial investment and will also engage with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p><p>With regard to affordable housing specifically the review of Part V is now almost concluded and any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, will be made in the context of this review.  I expect to make announcements in this regard in the near future.  I am not aware that any proposal has been received from Killarney Town Council but will seek clarification in that regard.  If not, the local authority should make a case to the Department or alternatively seek leasing through a voluntary housing body, which option has been used in respect of affordable housing in other parts of the country.</p></speech>

I understood it had submitted an application.  However, perhaps I am wrong.  It is regrettable that these houses have remained unoccupied since 2009.  We need to move a little quicker than that given the number of people in need of housing.  These houses are large enough to accommodate four families.  I acknowledge the volume of resources being made available in respect of RAS and the leasing schemes.  However, that is a matter for another day.</p><p>As I said, I will endeavour to find out from the council if it has submitted an application and, if so, will communicate with the Minister of State at a later stage. </p></speech>
