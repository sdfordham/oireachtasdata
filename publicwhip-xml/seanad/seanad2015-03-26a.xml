He was lamenting the fact that rural Ireland was dying on its feet.  In recent years we have seen 100 banks, around 214 post offices and 1,290 pubs in rural Ireland close.  However, what affects rural Ireland more than any of that is the loss of schools and the loss of teachers in rural schools.  The previous Minister for Education and Skills stated quite clearly that two-teacher and three-teacher schools should consider their future and consider amalgamation.  If a community or parish loses its school, no more houses are built and no more families move into the area.  Then one sees the fruition of what John Healy wrote about in 1968, namely, the death of Irish parishes, towns and communities.</p> <p>The case I raise today is that of a school in west Kerry in a Gaeltacht area.  The loss of a teacher and the subsequent loss of resources will mean that schools in the area will be forced to amalgamate.  As a result, we will see the very embodiment of what John Healy wrote about in 1968, namely, schools amalgamating and communities dying.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills would review the case of the school in west Kerry which is due to lose a teacher and to consider the impact that will have on both the school and the wider community.  I ask if there is any possibility that this decision will be reversed.</p></speech>

It is a very beautiful and scenic part of the country and is doing exceptionally well from a tourism perspective.  Its employment figures are going in the right direction, as per recent announcements.</p> <p>To deal with the matter in hand, the Senator will know that the Minister for Education and Skills has outlined the new pupil teacher ratios for small schools.  That information is available on the Department's website and I will not rehearse it in the House now.  The school to which Senator Daly refers went to the primary staffing appeals board and outlined that its future enrolment would be approximately 93 pupils in September.  If the school achieves and maintains an enrolment of 83, it will retain the teacher.  The school board has been notified of the decision.  The entire process is independent of the Minister and the issue should not have been raised as a Commencement matter because a decision was made some time ago.  In that context, I am not too sure why I am here this morning.</p></speech>

I am asking for a review of this case, on the basis of the criteria that was sent out to the school.  The previous Minister for Education and Skills was implementing a system which would have ensured that small rural schools would be closed.  The particular school to which I refer would have been affected but this is not just an issue for that school.  This is about rural schools not just in Kerry but also in the Taoiseach's home county of Mayo.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Almost 50 years ago, John Healy spoke about the loss of services.  Over the past number of years, we have seen the loss of services, such as post offices and banks, and of social facilities, such as pubs, but in particular schools.  The Minister's stated policy is for the amalgamation of schools in rural areas.  By implementing the requirement in regard to the pupil teacher ratio, the Minister was effectively closing schools by stealth over time.</p><p>Handing over this decision to an independent body, as was done by previous Governments, is washing one's hands of the process in a Pontius Pilate fashion.  The Minister is in charge of education but she is saying she has nothing to do this, the board has been informed and the decision is independent.  Many of the decisions in regard to how this country is run have been taken away from Members of this House and of the other one.  Education is the most important factor in improving our society.  Decisions in regard to schools in rural areas cannot be abdicated to third parties and must rest with the Minister.</p></speech>

I was asked to respond to a particular matter, which I did.  I would be quite happy to come back for a Commencement matter to discuss rural Ireland, as would the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Ann Phelan.  When the Minister changed the criteria for two, three and four teacher schools, it was widely welcomed.  A positive decision has been made and it has been communicated to the school but it is of no use to anybody to generate fear among people about the possible loss of a teacher.  The school meets the criteria.  It has a projected enrolment of approximately 93 pupils but the criteria is 83.</p> <p>The Minister sets out policy, as she or he should, and an independent body should decide on appeals.  For far too long things were done in a backhanded way in this country and we should not go down that route.  The criteria should be laid down by the Government and there should be an independent appeals body.  Whether one gets a school, a classroom or an extra teacher should not be because one knows the local Senator, Deputy or councillor.  It is the role of the Government to lay down the policy and the criteria and there should be an independent appeals body.  That was not always the case but it is under this Government.  I am happy that an independent body adjudicates on any appeals, as it should.  </p></speech>

I return to that theme to point out that the Government has been forced to admit that Leader funding has been slashed by some 43% under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  In real terms the funding has dropped from &euro;376 million to &euro;220 million.  Some 36 Leader companies will have to reduce dramatically their community projects such as child care, rural transport and business start-ups.  In a Private Members' motion in the D&aacute;il last year, Fianna F&aacute;il stated our commitment to maintaining the independence and partnership core of the Leader companies, which have been emasculated to a large degree and are being integrated into local government structures, generating a great deal of hostility.</p> <p>We tabled a Private Members' motion calling on the Government to fully review its approach to the delivery of community services and programmes by these companies.  We argued that far from being emasculated, these companies should be used as a one-stop shop to deliver rural services, including rural transport and community schemes, and continue to play a central part in sustaining the fabric of communities across Ireland.  We have repeatedly raised the issue of the erosion of democratically-run services in rural Ireland.  I will not repeat the litany but this is yet another massive blow for rural Ireland.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, come to the House and outline his plans for the development of the programmes that have been run so effectively and efficiently by the partnership programmes during the previous term of the Leader programme which has proved to be hugely successful.  Ireland has been a benchmark and a model for other European nations in this regard.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to explain what he intends to do to address this issue and whether there is any hope of restoration of funding.</p> <p>May I raise another issue which has appeared in the national media?  Special needs assistants represented by the IMPACT trade union have voted for industrial action.  The union represents some 6,000 special needs assistants.  It appears that the problem of reduced hours was becoming worse each year to the point where many jobs were no longer viable, according to the union.  In some cases individual SNAs have been reduced to as little as ten hours of work over a week and as many as seven children with special needs were being dealt with by one SNA, thereby impacting on the quality of care.  When contacted, the Department kicked the can down the road stating out that the finger of blame should be pointed at the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which oversees the annual allocation of the SNA service.</p> <p>As everybody in public life who has had to deal with the issues of SNAs around the country is aware, many of us from rural Ireland have had to do this, the Department always kicks it over to the NCSE.  That is not good enough.  The Department should take responsibility in this regard.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Government under the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who introduced the concept of special needs assistant.  It is a credit to that system that it has worked so well and so effectively and now it appears it will be dismantled yet again.  Can one imagine one SNA having to deal with seven special needs children in one classroom or one school?  It is not fair.  It is not equitable.  It is totally unacceptable.  I fully support the union on this matter and seek a response from the Acting Leader as to what measures she believes should be taken to address this very serious issue. </p></speech>

I refer specifically to the Bord Bia sponsored Irish food event at the convention centre today, following three days of visits to more than 100 Irish farms, factories and food producers nationwide.  Almost 400 international food buyers from around the world are gathering today for this event at the convention centre.  The international buyers and 450 Irish food and drink buyers and food service operators will meet 185 Irish food and drink companies.  More than 5,000 pre-scheduled speed-dating style meetings are taking place throughout the day and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, are speaking with the participants and further boosting the business.</p> <p>Bord Bia is targeting at least &euro;30 million worth of new business which is tremendous.  However, there is further huge potential in building more than 500 new trade relationships for the Irish food and drink industry which will greatly enhance our exports valued at &euro;10.5 billion in 2014 with exports destined for 175 markets around the world.  In addition to the strong representation of UK and European buyers, 106 Asian buyers have travelled to attend the event compared with just 14 in 2012 when the last marketplace event was held.  Meanwhile 38 buyers will attend from the Middle East, 24 from North America, 15 from Africa and 12 from Russia.  All international markets show a renewed growth reflected in a 16% increase in trade which stands at &euro;3 billion or 29% of Ireland's total food and drink exports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The key point is this is a major event for the country.

It is instructive that there is a sprinkling of people - maybe half a dozen - from the two Government parties, two Opposition Senators and two Independents here.  There are considerably more people in the Gallery.  I have always said that it does not really matter when legislation is being discussed whether there are Members present because Members are in their offices preparing amendments, reading material, etc., and they are watching the television monitor to see when their time to come in is approaching.  However, for the Order of Business to be so very thinly attended is regrettable.  For most of my time here - I am here nearly 30 years - it was always the most heavily attended part of the day's business and it was lively.  We now commence business in this House in a ragged way.  I would not like to see the business disintegrate and I would urge that we would rethink this system.</p> <p>The only other point I would make is-----</p></speech>

It was seen as an accident.  It now transpires it was not an accident, that the co-pilot locked the door of the cabin using the anti-terrorist devices and deliberately crashed the plane.  On the black box recorder, one can plainly hear the pilot desperately trying to smash the door in and the terrified screams of the passengers.  This is very shocking news and it makes it all the worse for the relatives, who know that it was not an accident but an act of appalling air piracy.  I join in the expression of sympathy to those relatives.</p></speech>

The Galway Technology Centre is currently home to 41 start-ups and growing companies and SMEs.  The centre has supported more than 140 companies and 1,200 jobs since it commenced in 1994.  This week, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, visited the Galway Technology Centre where they announced &euro;360,000 worth of investment in the facility.  This investment comes on the back of hugely impressive growth for the centre, which has had a 33% increase in revenue and the occupancy rate of which has increased by 30% to 90% since 2014.  This is most impressive.  It is a clear sign of the resurgence in the economy.  These centres are supported by the State and they are in need of further funding right throughout the country.  I would ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in due course to discuss this matter.</p></speech>

Slowly but surely, we have watched the education system being run down to a point where zero-hour contracts and contracts by the minute are almost the order of the day, and I would support IMPACT.</p> <p>I rise this morning in support of the call by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland which has been excluded from the support scheme of national organisations by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government administered through Pobal.  Dyslexia destroyed the educational opportunities of thousands and thousands of those of my vintage who passed through the education system and who have not been recognised until much later in life.  We are now in a situation where temporary funding was provided until June of this year but, despite numerous appeals and submissions by the dyslexia association, and promises of a review of the decision, to date there has been no reply.  I understand that the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland have called for an extension of the current temporary funding arrangements up until December 2006.  These organisations are also seeking a commitment to be included in funding up to 2017.</p> <p>As an educator, my concern here today is the potential damage being done to children of this country by limiting funding for the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.  Despite improvements over the past decade, the Irish education system is still not meeting the needs of children and young people with dyslexia, as evidenced by the following information.  Some 28% of children receive public assessment by NEPS and the HSE and 72% must seek private assessment.  Even after dyslexia is identified, 56% of parents report difficulty in gaining access to help for their children.  The average annual family cost associated with dyslexia is running at some &euro;1,100.  This is way above what many families can afford.  Some 68% of families report that these costs have created significant financial stress.  Some 60% of parents report being unable to access appropriate supports for their children due to the lack of funds.</p> <p>The situation with dyslexia for anybody who has been involved for any period of time in the education world is really serious.  Highly intelligent persons are being denied access to proper education.  The dyslexia association does a significant job around this country and by cutting off funding, we are cutting off its ability to fund branches which provide services and information locally.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to whom I refer, Deputy Kelly, if he will review this funding and report back to this House as quickly as possible.  If it is all right, at some stage in the not too distant future I will also table a Commencement debate matter on this with the Minister for Education and Skills.  In this particular instance, it is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government I wish to review the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, funding.</p></speech>

I congratulate Bord Bia, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on this initiative.  This means we will have 100 food companies from Ireland displaying their goods and 150 buyers from all over the world.  Over the past number of months, we have seen food exports to the United States, China, right across Asia and all over the world increase year on year.  Over the number of difficult years that we have had, farming has brought us through the recession.  This is positive news.  It indicates further that any investment we make in farming and in the farming community is well worthwhile.  I look forward to an exciting year, in 2015 and in the years to come, for the agrifood sector.</p></speech>

Previously, we addressed the issue of the elderly.  This week, we have addressed the issue of farm safety.  Unfortunately, I could not be in attendance for that debate but it was a worthwhile exercise.  We should grab hold of the issue of housing.  We should invite in those in the sector who plan such strategies.  I refer to the non-governmental agencies involved in housing, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the groups, such as Threshold, that Senator Hayden is in charge of.  This is a crisis like no other.  It is a crisis that is having a significant effect at present.  While there is a plan for housing, not a penny has been spent or allocated to any local authority to do anything about it.  The Seanad needs to look at that.  I would include social housing and voluntary sector housing.  I would also include the private sector because they all have a role to play.</p> <p>This is a crisis, by the way, that was predicted by the former Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, here in this House just after he was appointed.  Even then it could be seen that there would be a shortage of housing in the Dublin area.  He was right.  It is one of the few matters that the Government got right.  It predicted that almost four years ago.  We could play a role here.  We could show the people that we are relevant and that we are addressing something that is of considerable concern.  I would include the issue of repossessions and the housing of those whose houses are repossessed because these factors are contributing to the crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is also a major issue about the order of repossessions at the moment.  It seems to be the case that there are many unoccupied, abandoned houses that are still sitting there, not having been repossessed, while banks are happy to go after families.  All of these issues could be debated in a worthwhile fashion by this House.</p><p>I formally request the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate soon on the potato and horticulture industry in Ireland.  It is a major industry but parts of it are under severe pressure, despite all the good news that comes out from that sector.  The potato industry, in particular, is under pressure not just from changing eating habits, but also from imports.  Believe it or not, we import many potato products into this country, particularly processed products.  We could have a good debate here on that sector.  It is of major importance in Meath, North Dublin, Louth and nationally.  It is our national vegetable.</p></speech>

She cited the very successful one in Ballybane in Galway.  In my own town of Ballinasloe, we have an enterprise centre that has 170 people working in it currently.  It has great potential to develop further, provided that additional funding could be made available.</p> <p>I welcome the publication in the past hour of a very significant document by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, of which I am happy to be a member.  The chair of that committee is Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy and I want to acknowledge the good work done by the rapporteur to the committee, Deputy John Lyons.  It sets out a number of policy options to support business growth, job creation and job retention in towns and village centres.  The committee invited and received submissions from many interested bodies and business organisations in the course of the preparation of this significant document.</p> <p>Among the recommendations are that Government would look to support local authorities to introduce grant relief schemes similar to that being piloted in Limerick to incentivise new businesses to take up vacant properties on high streets and town and village centres.  Another recommendation was that local authorities would consider rate reductions for small independent businesses in city and town centres to ensure a retail and hospitality blend is offered to consumers.  The committee further recommends that action be taken to relieve businesses of the burden of upward-only rent revision, which is suffocating many struggling businesses at present.  There is a recommendation, which was very strongly supported by all members of the committee, that local enterprise offices would work closely with local chambers of commerce and other industry bodies to further develop online training for online sales and the benefits of social media in promoting businesses.  There is also the issue of banking charges and the need for dialogue between Government and the pillar banks on the level of charges being levied on small businesses for banking services.  There was much discussion at the committee of the need to give consideration to free parking periods for several hours during the day in town and village centres, as a measure that should be considered by local authorities.  Finally, the committee recommends that Tourism Ireland and other bodies strongly market towns and cities as shopping destinations in the course of their work.  This is a very significant piece of work, so I would like the Seanad to have an opportunity at some future date, perhaps in the coming month, to discuss this publication by the joint committee on jobs and enterprise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-26a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032600002#M00300"><p>I would like clarification from the Deputy Leader on a few issues.  They are really the same issue, but they have different ramifications.  As Members may remember, I introduced legislation earlier in this term which would have prevented Government agencies suing anybody, presumably including each other, in defence of their good name.  My own belief is that in a democracy, where they are answerable to the public, the reputation of Government agencies, public bodies, quangos, Departments and so on depends entirely on their effectiveness and the quality of the service they provide.  It should not be something that hides behind either legal challenges or public relations companies.  There should be no public relations professionals employed anywhere in the public service other than in technical areas where advertising is required.  Public officials should be required, perhaps in rotation in their own Departments, to take the rostrum, as it were, and to answer questions from the public, through their representatives in the press, about their activities.</p> <p>I was very disappointed to see the discussions which have come into the public domain between the HSE and HIQA on the issue of Portlaoise and other obstretrics services in the country.  This was commented on earlier in the week, but unfortunately I could not be here at the time.  I feel strongly on this issue.  This is an area where a clear directive needs to be given by the Government to all public employees.  I would like the Government to support my Bill and get it through its next couple of Stages.  That would be the simplest thing to do, but we all know how difficult that can be with independent backbench legislation originating in the Seanad.  However, an executive order could be given, certainly in the Department of Health, by the Minister, to all Department employees and agencies, the HSE, and all bodies funded by the Department that they simply are not to fall back on any kind of legal threat in an attempt to silence any kind of dissent, either from outside the State or from within it.  I understand that people who work in State bodies have personal reputations that can be and need to be defended and they have a right to defend them.  However, the entities themselves do not.</p> <p>Two of the charges raised by the HSE in its correspondence with HIQA were that HIQA was suggesting that the HSE was guilty of reckless endangerment when it came to the provision of obstetrical services.  I would like to ask the questions that would help me decide whether the HSE is guilty of reckless endangerment in maternity services right now.  Could the Deputy Leader find out for us from the Minister, or the Minister himself could come in if he wishes, and answer the following questions?  How many consultant obstetricians are there in this country?  How many posts are there?  How many of these posts are filled and how many are filled by locums, as opposed to people who are on permanent contracts?  What is the typical tenure of a locum contract?  How rapidly are locum staff actually rotating through?  Similarly, what percentage of the deliveries that require some degree of medical assistance are being attended by consultants and how many by NCHDs?  I mean no disrespect to any normal deliveries which are supervised very competently by a fine cohort of midwives, but sometimes a doctor needs to intervene and a doctor needs to assess everybody who is pregnant at some stage.  What percentage of the NCHD jobs in obstetrics are currently occupied by locums?  I believe we are right at the bottom of the international league tables for the number of obstetricians per head of population.  If that is the case and if throughout the country people are experiencing sometimes adverse events in a service that generally provides very safe care to pregnant women and their children, is there any link between that and understaffing and not only understaffing, but also poor staffing, through a lack of appropriate forward planning and sufficient people in permanent posts?</p> <p>Is that bell to warn me I have 30 seconds left?</p></speech>

I certainly require a little reassurance on the competence of the HSE to deliver services.</p></speech>

Many of the counties surrounding Dublin are also experiencing very significant rent increases.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has indicated his willingness and intention to introduce a model of rent certainty, in other words, a model that will limit the extent of rent increases in the rental sector.  We already know that people are losing their homes because they cannot afford to pay rent increases.  We are now seeing a new category of people, namely, the one third of those in the market who believed they would be buying their own homes but who, because of Central Bank rules, now face renting for a very long time to come and may never have the option of moving into their own homes.  May we have the Minister in the House to talk about the future of rented housing?  This is a very important debate that we need to have.  Some 20% of the nation are living in the rental sector and have little or no security.  They are subjected to very significant rent increases.  I would like to expand the debate to talk about the future of home ownership.  Historically, Ireland has had a very high level of home ownership, but it has dropped dramatically.  We have Generation Rent but possibly Generation Lost, a generation for whom the option of home ownership may be lost for the entirely of their lives.  We need a broad debate on housing and home ownership and to focus specifically on a strategy for rented housing.</p></speech>

I support Senator Thomas Byrne's request that we use this Chamber, in so far as possible, to activate, rather than reactivate, a very genuine holistic debate on the housing crisis.  It is a matter on which I have spoken frequently in recent months.  We were promised that the Minister would attend, but we need much more than a once-off session.  We in the Seanad are perhaps best placed politically to have this urgent debate.  Society and the Administration seem fixated on the importance of the construction industry, developers and bringing them in to meet Ministers and Taoisigh.  We seem fixated on the traditional model of home ownership, but we must consider what is happening all around us and in Europe.  There was a very interesting radio documentary recently on rental arrangements in Germany and France, where tenants have very secure and absolute rights of tenancy.  Many people make a very happy choice to remain in rented accommodation for five to 20 years.  Therefore, we need to start thinking holistically about this area.  The Seanad Chamber, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee or a variation thereof could provide the ideal mechanism for having that debate.  The issue certainly needs to be brought to the top of the political agenda.</p> <p>I referred during the week to the confusion about the number of available housing units and the availability of land.  I had a specific question, but there was absolutely no clarity from the Minister.  We are hearing statistics about millions of euro ready to be invested and a new social housing programme, but there are many tens of thousands of people looking for houses simultaneously.  There are tens of thousands of vacant units across the country and it is an absolute shame socially and a political disgrace that we cannot marry these problems into a solution.  Therefore, since nothing is happening in the other House on this issue, I suggest to the Deputy Leader that we try to run with the ball and begin a very comprehensive debate on it.  There is no better expert than the Deputy Leader's colleague, Senator Aideen Hayden.  Many of us would like to join her and add our views.  We should wait no longer.</p></speech>

We sometimes get lost in making global statements on special needs assistants and refer to cases where one is minding or helping to mind seven children.  One might be all that is needed as there is a teacher in the class also.  I can talk from experience because I was in this position with my daughter.  There was one teacher with two special needs assistants and seven children of varying ability and with varying difficulties in the class.  There is a raft of issues to be considered.  I heard RTE interview a school principal one night.  On being asked whether she had a special needs assistant, she said she did not but would love one.  There actually has to be a child in the school with special needs before it can get a special needs assistant.  I know of schools where the special needs assistants are minding classes and running the shop part-time and have functions that are not theirs.  A school might require 40 to 60 hours of special needs assistance, but next year the children might have moved.  There is an absolute need for a debate and an understanding of what is occurring in this area.</p> <p>There is a much more serious problem in preschools, where there is no support, other than for six hours per week.  There is a double-barrelled problem in that in many cases it is the person running the preschool who identifies that a child has a special need.  She sends the child to early service providers and then he or she is sent back to the general practitioner, etc.  By the time he or she goes through this process, it may be time to leave preschool.  It should be an issue for the Department of Education and Skills right from the time the child is born, rather than having part of the responsibility lie with HSE and the other with the Department.</p> <p>Recently there was a case in which a child needed an educational aid.  A report was written by a clinically qualified educational psychologist, but that, in turn, was overruled by the special educational needs officer from the NCSE because she decided he did not need the aid.  I rang the Department and asked whether there was a cut in funding and the exact words used in response were that there was a bucket of money in the Department for educational aids and supports.  Despite this, the officer made the decision that the child should not receive the aid.  I rang her boss and the decision was overturned.  Four paragraphs were written by the educational psychologist on why the child should have what effectively turned out to be an iPad and how it would benefit them in the future.  The parent should not have had to contact me to get what the child was absolutely entitled to and what would have been available had the special educational needs officer not overruled the decision.  I do not know why we need the NCSE and certainly do not know why we need the special educational needs officers because they are overruling decisions.  I do not see any reason the principal cannot deal directly with the Department of Education and Skills on foot of a report from an educational psychologist.  That would solve many of our problems.  We would take out all of the people in the middle who were put in place to give jobs to the boys.  When we talk about special needs assistants, we must be careful to quantify exactly what we are talking about and what is needed.  Many children in school need a special needs assistant for four or five hours per week; they do not need one for 40 hours per week.  However, as there are those who do need somebody for the full school term, we cannot make global statements.  I certainly would welcome an open and frank debate in the Chamber on this issue.</p></speech>

The public benefit associated with this is obvious.  Many older people living in rural areas face substantial difficulties in accessing health care resources, as other Members know better than I.  The rural practice allowance is designed to offset costs which a doctor faces associated with a rural practice.  The HSE has reduced this payment by approximately &euro;5,000 since 2005, with the result that it is increasingly difficult to attract doctors to establish a practice in a rural area.  I have been contacted by a doctor in a rural part of east Galway who told me that, in his view, the HSE has adopted a deliberate policy of delaying the payment to doctors.  He has spoken to his colleagues and they report similar difficulties in being paid the allowance.</p> <p>We often speak about decline in rural areas and small towns.  Let me be very clear here.  The chief evil complained about by rural dwellers is the withdrawal of services and the chief agent responsible for the withdrawal of services is Government.  Post offices, rural schools, Garda stations, health services have been closed.  Again and again, Government policy has been responsible for eroding the quality of life in rural Ireland.  It is increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible, to convince young doctors to situate in rural areas and rural dwellers suffer the obvious consequence of that by not having access to a GP service.  </p> <p>I call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to direct the HSE to promptly pay the rural practice allowance to GPs in rural communities.  I would also like the Minister to investigate whether there is a deliberate policy of delaying payments as some kind of money saving scheme.</p></speech>

The two main changes involve reducing the higher rate of USC paid by business owners and allowing self-employed people to claim unemployment benefit should they find themselves unemployed, which is long overdue.  There will also be a return of tax rebates towards redundancy costs for businesses forced to lay off staff, which was the case before the recession when businesses were assisted with up to 60% of redundancy costs.  These measures are most welcome as self-employed workers have been forced to bear a greater burden of the austerity taxes introduced after the collapse of the economy.  I hope this standing up for small businesses campaign will deliver on its stated mission to level the playing field between self-employed and PAYE workers as it is clear that self-employed people are paying more tax yet if they get into trouble, they receive fewer supports and that needs to change.</p> <p>Currently, self-employed workers whose businesses go to the wall are forced to endure an arduous means test process to receive social welfare payments.  For many tradesmen, small business owners or taxi drivers, this often means they are deprived of supports they would receive if they were regular PAYE workers.  This situation is wrong and I hope this policy will remedy that inequity.</p></speech>

I agree entirely with him about the success of the Leader programme.  He asked for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House for a debate on the future of the Leader programme and I will certainly ask for that debate.  To be fair, both the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, have been very regular visitors to this House to debate a range of issues many of them related to-----</p></speech>

As many colleagues have said, it was very welcome to hear the Minister for Education and Skills announce this week the allocation of additional resources to support children with Down's syndrome in schools in terms of access to special needs assistants.  Senator Mulcahy also spoke very strongly on this issue and on the varying abilities and different needs of children in terms of SNA allocation.  We would all be very conscious of that and the National Council for Special Education take that into account in allocating.  Not all children require special needs assistants for the same number of hours per week, which is a very obvious point to make.  We will certainly invite the Minister to House to discuss that issue.</p> <p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the Bord Bia Irish food showcasing event in the Dublin Convention Centre today.  I think it is being referred to as speed marketing but it is modelled on speed dating.  Irish companies are being matched with international buyers and clients to boost the food industry here.  As the Senator said, many millions of euro worth of new business is being targeted and it is a really welcome initiative.  I listened to some of the reports on it this morning and it sounds like a very exciting initiative.  There is no doubt the food industry has been a major success in recent years in Ireland.  A number of other colleagues supported the idea of a debate on the food industry, which would be worth having in this House. </p> <p>Senator Norris referred to attendance at the Order of Business and I entirely agree with him.  He raised two related issues, one of which Senator Cummins, the Leader of the Seanad, referred to earlier this week, namely, Members appearing at the start of the Order of Business and leaving or appearing right at the end and intervening then.  There is a matter of common courtesy of people staying in the Chamber for the response, having sought one.</p> <p>The second issue the Senator raised was the timing of the Order of Business.  Only today I put in a request that we have a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to address this issue and to bring back the starting time of the Order of Business on Wednesday and Thursday mornings to 11.30 a.m. rather than 12 p.m.  That would be a sensible move but it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  </p> <p>Senator Norris also raised the very tragic German aeroplane crash.  As others have done, I have expressed sympathy to the families of 150 tragic victims.  The Senator referred to recent reports that this may not have been an accident but at the moment, it is not yet clear what caused that terrible crash.  There are new reports this morning about the cause but it may be too soon to express a settled view on that.  However, it is an utter tragedy for all concerned.</p> <p>Senator Naughton referred to the community enterprise centres, in particular the enterprise centre in Galway which has 41 new start-ups and the increased funding for that, which she welcomed.  She sought a debate with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on jobs creation generally, for which we will certainly look.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, comes to the House on a fairly regular basis on this important issue.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland and support for it from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's Pobal scheme.  Last year when he was appointed, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, intervened to restore funding to a number of different groups facing loss of funding.  That was dealt with at that point.  In terms of the specific association to which he referred, it might be best dealt with by way of a Commencement debate.  The Senator said he will look for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House but perhaps he should ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to do so specifically on that issue relating to one organisation.  There is a broader issue of funding generally through the same scheme which the Minister might come to the House to deal with because many organisations are affected.  </p> <p>I agree entirely with the Senator's comments on dyslexia.  I have taught many law students with dyslexia.  They have graduated with flying colours from law studies in Trinity College, Dublin, but in the past, they would probably not have made it to third level.  The supports at all levels are hugely important and at third level, we have put in very significant supports across colleges for students with dyslexia as it is now well recognised.</p> <p>Senator Comiskey also welcomed the food conference in the convention centre today and referred to 2015 as a very exciting year for the food industry.  Again, we might ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to come to the House to discuss that issue.</p> <p>Senator Byrne referred to the very successful public consultation held in this Chamber on Monday on farm safety.  We will have a debate on the report to be produced as a result of that.  He also made an excellent suggestion that the Seanad Public Consultation Committee might take on a review of housing policy rather than just have a debate in this House.  There is quite a number of different strands.  As we know, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has allocated significant increased funding for the social housing construction programme.  Social housing building effectively ceased in the boom years and we are now playing catch up.  That is a large part of the problem but as Senator Hayden said, there are other issues around the future of home ownership and the rental sector.  The issue of repossessions was also mentioned.  It is an issue which perhaps the Seanad Public Consultation Committee would be better suited to address rather than simply having statements in the House.  The Senator might wish to ask the Seanad Public Consultation Committee to take that on as the next issue, following farm safety.</p> <p>The Senator also called for a debate on the potato and horticulture industry.  Perhaps it would be appropriate to include that in a general debate on the food industry.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Mullins remarked on the publication by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of a report today on policy options to support business growth and job creation and retention in town and village centres.  I have had a quick look at the report, which Senator Mullins gave me.  Certainly, it seems to make some important recommendations.  Perhaps we could have a debate on the report in the House in the context of a more general debate on job creation.  Undoubtedly, focusing on growth in town and village centres is singularly important.  Issues like free parking, rates reduction and so on are vital to ensure more vibrant community development in towns and villages throughout Ireland.</p><p>Senator Crown raised the issue of potential legal challenges between different State bodies.  Other colleagues raised this issue earlier in the week.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has indicated he wants to see the matter between the HSE and HIQA on Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise resolved in particular without recourse to the courts.  I imagine we would all agree on that.</p><p>The Senator also raised a bigger issue concerning the state of obstetric services throughout Ireland and associated data.  There are two issues.  First, some of the specific information the Senator seeks might best be sought through a Commencement matter or a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il.  As the Senator is well aware, there is an issue relating to data in maternity hospitals and data concerning maternity and obstetric services.  I spoke on the matter recently at an Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation midwifery conference.  Midwives and those engaged on the front line of the profession are concerned.  A debate in the House with the Minister for Health on the state of obstetric and maternity services more generally might be appropriate.  It is a matter of trying to get what data are available but there is a more general debate.</p><p>Senator Hayden commented on the housing issue and in particular on the Private Residential Tenancies Board rent index study released today.  It shows dramatically rising rents throughout different areas in Ireland, not only in Dublin.  Senator Hayden was very impressive on the radio this morning on the same topic.  The Senator asked for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to come to the House to speak about the future of rented housing and home ownership.  Perhaps we might look at dealing with those issues as part of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee process because these are far bigger issues than can be dealt with in a once-off session.  Senator Bradford also raised this issue and called for a comprehensive debate.  He noted the expertise we have in the House with Senator Hayden.  We might take that to the SPCC.</p><p>Senator Mulcahy spoke on the special needs assistants issue and called for a debate.  Many colleagues will empathise with the stories Senator Mulcahy has told of parents contacting him concerning SNA allocations.  It is a pressing issue for many people throughout the country.</p><p>Senator Mullen asked about tomorrow's business.  Clearly, that is a matter for tomorrow's Order of Business and a matter for the House to deal with tomorrow.  I cannot deal with it today.  I have suggested the Order of Business for today, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said.</p></speech>

It has been raised.  The Senator also raised the issue of the rural practice allowance and payments to general practitioners.  Again, since it is a specific matter, it might best be raised through a matter on the Commencement debate and a question to the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Noone raised the welcome new policy proposals on provision for self-employed persons and access to social protection payments and so forth.  Again, I believe that will be important as part of a job creation debate.  I realise this is a major issue for self-employed persons in the context of taking risks and initiatives and being entrepreneurs.  It has real implications for job creation as well.  I think I have dealt with all queries raised.</p></speech>

Over the course of the day, we will find ourselves disagreeing a little on some issues and I know the Minister will not infer that I am in any sense disrespectful of the colossal effort that has gone into drafting this incredibly complex legislation which deals with a very complex set of issues which could never have been foreseen by the folks who authored our Constitution.</p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a child who is born as a result of a donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, procedure will be born under the same legal regime as that under which he or she was conceived.  The focus of Parts 2 and 3 is not birth but the DAHR process.  The Bill does not emphasise genetic heritage but consent and, therefore, the intention of the intending parents and donors at the time of conception.  Where women are pregnant as a result of an assisted reproduction procedure and the legal regime changes over the course of the pregnancy, treating the pregnancy as though it were conceived after the Bill has been signed into law would be an Act of<i>ex post facto </i>law and would be contrary to natural justice.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is to specify that a donor-conceived child is a child born as a result of a DAHR procedure carried out after the commencement of section 4.  The existing provision specifies that a donor-conceived child is a child born in the State after the commencement of the section as a result of a DAHR procedure.  The Senator's amendment would see a very clear cut-off.  Where a child is born through a procedure which took place before commencement, the parents can guarantee the assignment of parentage only by means of an application under section 21 or 22.  Where a child is born through a procedure which took place after commencement, parentage is assigned under section 5.</p> <p>The difference in effect between the two provisions is that the current formulation will allow greater flexibility.  It will take some time to prepare all the necessary regulations and forms concerning consent, and this would be done by the Department of Health.  The form is likely to be clear well in advance of the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.  Where a child is born after commencement and if the consent of the intending parents has complied with the requirements set out in sections 9 and 11, it may be possible, therefore, to assign parentage under section 5.  This will provide greater confidence and certainty for couples undertaking or contemplating donor-assisted fertility treatment.  There is extra protection for those families if their child is born after commencement but the donor is unknown or the consent does not comply with the criteria set out in sections 9 and 11 in that the provisions of sections 21 and 22 will still allow them to obtain a court declaration of parentage.</p> <p>Given the lead-in time to commencement and the fact that the treating clinics are already commencing preparations, the extra flexibility provided by the current formulation is both practical and desirable and is to the benefit of the intending parents of the child who may be born as a result of procedures which the prospective parents are already considering.  I hope, on the basis of this explanation, the Senator might withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

Senator Quinn will speak for himself.  Therefore, the approach we have taken with this legislation is to oppose all of those sections but of course we also have other amendments in which, in default of getting the Minister&rsquo;s agreement to remove those sections, we propose certain amendments that would at least mitigate the situation, always from the perspective of trying to secure a child&rsquo;s rights and a child&rsquo;s best interests, which I believe must always flow from a presumption that all things being equal it is better that a child be brought into the world and be brought up by his or her mother and father, except in exceptional circumstances and that where it is not possible for a child to be brought into the world by his or her own mother and father that every child would have a father and a mother.  Notwithstanding the circumstances of life that need to be addressed in justice to children and their families, and the many good things that are in the Bill which seek to address real-life situations, the law should never embrace, facilitate or countenance circumstances where by virtue of the actions of adults or fertility professionals situations are brought about where, by definition, a child will be deprived of the right to be brought up by his or her father or mother.<br/><br/>Very often when Government proposes to do what are, bluntly, bad things, it uses a euphemistic term of &quot;regulation&quot;.  We are told that in order to prevent the free-for-all that might take place now or could take place in the future, the Government is going to regulate a situation.  I do not support that approach in the context of the Bill.  Regulation embraces things that are, by definition, unjust.  In opposing the sections on donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, I am not saying that the <i>status quo </i>is fine.  I am saying that we need laws that would restore to children the right to never be deliberately deprived of the possibility of being brought up by their father and mother.  In order to outline my approach I will borrow an old and perhaps overly used story about the old man in Connemara who is asked for directions to Dublin and who says &ldquo;Well, to be honest with you, I would not start from here at all.&rdquo;  That is my approach.  Starting from here with this highly flawed and unjust legislation is the wrong approach, without in any way denying that a measure of regulation is needed in this area to prevent current injustices and possible future injustices in relation to children&rsquo;s rights to be brought into existence and loved by their genetic parents.<br/><br/>I am not taking the approach of trying to create the perfect law.  I am opposing what I see as being fundamentally unjust within this law.  I am not for a moment denying there are good things in the Bill which address real-life situations such as provisions on guardianship.  The Bill is good wherever it is proposed to regulate the situation in favour of a child&rsquo;s rights.  However, where the Bill proceeds from an assumption that a child must put up with certain things which flow from certain adult aspirations to have children in circumstances where that prevents the child from being brought into existence or from knowing for a considerable period who they are or having the love and society of their genetic parents, to my mind that is most profoundly unjust.  That is the fundamental critique of this legislation.  It is not about the position of same-sex couples <i>per se</i>, it is about the widely held view that marriage is the gold standard for bringing up families while recognising, respecting, appreciating, loving and supporting all of those situations where children are being brought up outside of marriage but never denying what the evidence shows time and time again, which is the proven benefits of marriage.  That was perhaps even more apparent from the initial version of this Bill in relation to certain other sections.  I wish to note in passing that I did not hear the Minister in her Second Stage speech in the Seanad engage with the substance of the critique of this Bill in that I do not think I have heard her deny the assertions that have been made by me and others about the right of children to a father and mother wherever that is possible.  I could be wrong.  Neither have I heard her cite social studies, insight or argument with the fundamentals of the critique.<br/><br/>The DAHR provisions of the Bill are fundamentally misconceived and deeply harmful.  In essence, the effect of introducing these sections in the legislation is to declare that it makes no difference whether one&rsquo;s biological parents raise one or whether two men, two women or a single man or a single women to whom one may or may not be related does so.  It is a complete neutrality.  That is why I have felt it necessary to criticise and express my disappointment with the children&rsquo;s rights fraternity as well.  They seem to proceed from the view that whatever adults impose on children is fine until they are born and then they will start taking an interest in children&rsquo;s welfare.  There is a complete abandonment of responsibility about promoting as socially desirable the idea that a child would have his or her own father and mother in their life, or at least a father and a mother.  All of the children&rsquo;s rights fraternity who are implicated in that should really call themselves aside and ask what is behind this failure to vindicate the rights of children in that particular and very important situation.<br/><br/>It should be clear that being a biological parent is something far different and much more important than being something like a blood donor.  A parent is the person who gives one half one&rsquo;s identity.  He or she does not cease to be simply that because the Bill says so.  The majority, some 90%, of people who use IVF in this country do not use donor eggs or sperm.  We are not talking about that cohort.  The Bill normalises and reinforces the idea that it is fine to use donor eggs and sperm so long as one gives the child some meagre information once they turn 18 and go looking for it.  Indeed, they might not discover it until much later or it might come as a surprise to them, unless their parents have sought to inform them earlier.  What a travesty.  What a pathetic attempt to vindicate a child&rsquo;s rights, to confine their right to know who they are to that, long after the formative years are over, when they are not in a position to have the experience of being loved and cared for by their genetic parent.  How adult-centred it all is.  The use of donor eggs and embryos is banned in Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland unless the law has changed in recent times in those countries.<br/><br/>To reassure you, Acting Chairman, other than these opening comments which address all of the sections, I will not give additional long speeches.  The Minister will have her opportunity to consider these amendments.  I look forward to hearing her reply.  Some of this will be highly relevant to the debate on the referendum, because as I said yesterday and will say again tomorrow, there is an interconnection.  However, we will not be detained by that today.  This is the chance for the Minister to prove without a doubt that she does indeed put children at the centre of the legislation.  What this country is proposing in the legislation is deeply radical in contrast with many countries.  I admit that Britain has very radical laws in this regard, but what we propose is radical when one compares us with Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland.  In those countries only married males and females or stable unmarried male and female couples may access assisted human reproduction.  There must be a reason for that.  I would love to hear the Minister explain to me why she thinks those countries have gone that route.  I would also love to hear whether she considered that approach as a possibility or whether a promise was made to certain interest groups and it is all about the will to power from there on and there will be no real engagement with the different possibilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland, single women and lesbian couples do not and cannot access assisted human reproduction.  I do not think they are in the dark ages.  The use of donor sperm is only exceptionally allowed in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland, and the use of donor eggs is not allowed in Germany, Austria or Switzerland.  It is allowed in Italy and France.  The use of donor embryos is not allowed in Germany, Austria, Italy or Switzerland.  It is allowed in France.  Compared to some of these countries, what is proposed here is a complete free for all.  As I said on Second Stage, how remarkable it is that we had so much more and lengthier debate about animal welfare legislation then we are having about this legislation, which is fundamentally about child welfare.  It is no argument to say we had some measure of pre-legislative scrutiny some months ago at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, but that was fleeting indeed, and a large number of organisations were rushed through like an express train.</p></speech>

I would like to know whether the Minister has actually had a one-on-one meeting with anyone who is concerned about where the Government is going on this.  I would love if she had met Dr. Joanna Rose; perhaps she did.  Dr. Rose has been in Ireland on numerous occasions.  She is a woman who discovered she was donor-conceived.  She took the case to the High Court in London looking to vindicate donor-conceived persons' rights to their genetic identity.  She won, although because of evasive practice it remains a partial victory.  She has a PhD in the area of the human rights of donor-conceived persons.  She has spoken about the heartbreak and difficulty that goes with having discovered she may have hundreds of half-siblings.  I cannot see that this legislation has anything to say to this other than "Go ahead," if that is what one decides, except that it will not allow donors to be anonymous.  Even then, as we will see, the penalties for clinics that fail in their record-keeping are very weak and poor, which suggests that what is really at work is all about facilitating such donation.  I will come to that in due course.  When one considers that a failure to keep proper records in a clinic could prevent a child from ever knowing who he or she is in terms of one of his or her parents, it is remarkable how light the Minister goes on them in the Bill and it is highly revealing.  So much for Ireland following international best practice.</p> <p>Conception and the creation of children involves more than a transfer of genetic material.  The need of a child to be loved and cared for by the man and woman who conceived them and gave them one half each of their genetic and family history is no small matter.  The legislation declares that a donor is not the parent of a child born as a result of that procedure and has no parental rights and duties in respect of the child.</p></speech>

People would be rightly outraged, but through reproductive technology we bring children deliberately into the world in a way that is designed to separate them from ever having a parental relationship with either their genetic father or their genetic mother, or in some cases both, and this is supposed to be just fine for the child.  There is a growing online community of people in the UK conceived through donor-assisted human reproduction who speak of their innate desire, which their situation could not satisfy, for their real parent - the father or mother, known or unknown, who was not there.</p></speech>

This, I say to Senator Power, is why it is relevant.  If one looks at the law in this area in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland, they all require that couples have a legal relationship with each other.  When Senator Power goes back over the transcript she will find that everything I have said connects and makes sense.  That two parents should be married, or at least in a committed relationship, to be able to share the burden of the task of raising a child is common sense.</p> <p>Senator van Turnhout sought to push an issue with regard to the fact that yesterday I quoted Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, and it is absolutely clear that he referred to marriage as the gold standard.  This is the underlying premise in part of what I am proposing, but it is not just him who says this.  It is common sense and is based on the findings of much research.</p></speech>

My one point is that the aim of this Bill is to put children at the centre.  I know the Minister is behind this.  I was impressed on Second Stage by listening to the radio and hearing that man who said he believed that our aim should be that every child should have a father and a mother.  I know that was not agreed and some will say that is old-fashioned and out of date.  Of course there are exceptions, for various reasons, but the ideal is that every child should have a father and a mother to bring him or her up and hopefully on that basis, the effort Senator Mullen is putting in here is to aim at that.</p></speech>

The grounds on which they do so are quite remarkable.  Some 36% of the births in this country are now outside marriage.  What are they doing about them?  Are they all rotten?  Are they all wrong?  Are they all defective in some way?  Are the children of these marriages defective?  Are these children second-class citizens?  Are they properly brought up?  My mother was widowed when I was five and a half.  I was wonderfully brought up by a remarkable and splendid woman.  I did not miss my father at all.  It is rather a calculated insult to people, to the many mothers of Ireland who, like my mother, did a superb job in bringing us up.  That is one situation.</p></speech>

It suits me very well.</p> <p>Single people can adopt at the moment.  That is the law in this country.  Single gay people can adopt at the moment.  With regard to respect, I wonder how respectful it is to say, as one of the contributors said on the radio a couple of years ago when discussing civil marriage, that gay men wanted children as fashion accessories.  I noted with interest Senator Mullen's reference to the fertility "industry" and the AHR "industry".  That is fairly loaded language, I would have thought.  One must be very careful about these things.</p> <p>Senator Mullen speaks for the embryo and he speaks for children.  I do not know who gave him this right.  Then again, of course, he spoke for registrars, as did Senator Walsh.  They spoke for registrars in the civil partnership case, even though the registrars had not asked them to do so and subsequently said they did not want them to.  I wonder about this idea that they are the spokespersons for the embryos.  I would say give the embryos a chance.  Do not let the spokesperson for the embryo be Senator Mullen all the time.</p> <p>With regard to these amendments, I understood, but I could be wrong - perhaps the Minister could indicate to me - that as a result of the legislation, a child will still have two parents.  They may be the biological parents or they may not be, but I think I am right in saying that under this legislation a child will have two parents.  That is the situation.  The amendments are unnecessary and should be withdrawn.  Good night and thank you very much.</p> <p>Amendment No. 26 is astonishingly restrictive.</p></speech>

They would not be allowed to have it.  The Senators are imposing their social views on the majority of the population.  I come back to the fact that 36% of births occur outside marriage.  People are voting with their reproductive organs and they are ignoring what is being said here.  It is about time that Members of this House faced the human reality that is out there and not this theological theorising that is going on all the time.  "A person shall not perform a DAHR procedure other than on the request of intending parents who are legally married to one another."  I am astonished.  When I read that, I could hardly credit what I was seeing, that in order to get access to DAHR, a couple must be married to each other.  These are the same people who oppose marriage equality, "You have to be married in order to have a child, but you can't be married".  Come on.  For God's sake.  Let us have a bit of logic and just a tiny bit of humanity, a tiny bit of understanding of the human realities behind these things and not just this absurd, monotonous theologising about the whole thing.</p> <p>While I am at it, would the Minister be able to look into the Iona Institute?

When one turns to amendment No. 27, they have suddenly had an access of liberalism because they are expanding it and now - goody, goody - it states, "A person shall not perform a DAHR procedure other than on the request of intending parents who are legally married to one another or in a civil partnership [Hooray] with one another or in a cohabiting relationship...".  What happened to all these principles?  Where did all the principles disappear to in the space of less than one page?  Principle has evaporated completely.  I just do not understand it.  This is an attempt to frustrate the Bill's passage.</p><p>Senator Mullen is perfectly right.  This is a cleaning up exercise because people like him and the Iona Institute have deliberately confused the issue and introduced parenting, adoption and so on into the equality legislation.  The equality referendum is about equality and the passage of this legislation will make that is absolutely abundantly clear.  That is why this half baked, confused, muddled, unprincipled series of amendments has been tabled and I am against every single bloody one of them.  I regret that Senator Mullen was not present to hear my words.</p></speech>

Senator Norris has spoken most eloquently and I share his views.  I absolutely oppose these amendments.  The effect of the five amendments taken together, which contain serious contradictions, would seriously undermine the careful framework set out in sections 5 and 25 concerning donor-assisted human reproduction and, in particular, the issue of parentage.  Section 5 clearly sets out the procedure for ensuring a child born through DAHR will have a second parent.  A mother's spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner will be the second parent through the process described in the provision.  It is an important provision for children born in this way.  I reject Senator Mullen's comments on DAHR.  He seems to be opposed to DAHR altogether, although I am not clear what is his view because he seemed to suggest he would support AHR once no donor egg or sperm is involved.</p> <p>He also seriously misrepresented law in other jurisdictions.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction conducted a review of a range of jurisdictions and found that, in general, they permitted the donation of both sperm and eggs subject to particular conditions within a regulatory framework.  The amendments undermine the careful framework in sections 5 and 25 and elsewhere in the Bill concerning regulation of DAHR.  Currently, it is unregulated in the State and, therefore, the Senator appears to favour a free for all and a scenario where this issue is unregulated.  This is a denial of reality because many thousands of couples, most of whom are straight and married, have turned to AHR or DAHR because they have struggled with the human tragedy of infertility.  All of us know people who have struggled with this and it is a tragedy for them.  AHR and, in some cases, DAHR offer to them the prospect of becoming parents.</p> <p>I cannot see how people who are proponents of children's rights can oppose, in principle, AHR or DAHR within a carefully regulated framework such as that set out in sensible fashion in this Bill.  It is disrespectful, distasteful and objectionable not only for those parents, but also for the many children and adults living in Ireland who were born through AHR and DAHR and who are alive and well.  It is a denial of reality to suggest that we should not legislate on this issue.  This legislation is sensible and careful.  It recognises human reality and the reality mentioned by Senator Norris whereby 36% of births are outside marriage and it is child centred because it recognises the rights of children.  We will come to the amendments on the issue of identity but that is also very important in terms of prospectively legislating against anonymous donations.</p> <p>There has been a careful genesis to this legislation to which Senator Mullen also referred.  I was part of the justice committee consultation process.  We held a careful consultation and we had hearings with people for and against the Bill, although mostly for the Bill, because there is a general welcome for it across society.  Most people who share a common sense of humanity and a sense of reality support this Bill and its sensible measures.  We heard from them before the justice committee.  We had the consultation period mentioned by the Minister yesterday and the lead-in period to the legislation.  I refute Senator Mullen's comments on behalf of Government colleagues.</p></speech>

Commissioning parents here will become legal parents.  There is an unacceptable blurring of biological lines to enable legal definitions to fit.  This distortion of family will inevitably only serve to complicate matters for children as they grow up and we must remember at the end of this process the purpose of AHR, which I support for married and stable cohabiting couples.  We also must be careful about carefully regulating situations that we may now legislate for.</p> <p>I refer to where Ireland stands in comparison to other countries.  Only married male-female or stable unmarried male-female couples may access AHR in Germany,  Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland.  Single women and lesbian couples can access AHR only in Ireland.

It states: "A person shall not perform a DAHR procedure other than on the request of intending parents who are legally married to one another or in a civil partnership with one another or in a cohabiting relationship with one another."  Regulation of cases where the donor of sperm, eggs or even an embryo is a relative of one of the intending parents is missing.  This is critical.

If this information is put on the record now, it may change how the debate continues.  I would like my concerns to be put on the record.  I have three questions.</p> <p>The Bill will introduce the same problem as that which exists under English law.  This boy's father, as a matter of nature and genetics, is his uncle in the eyes of the law.  His mother, in the eyes of the law, is in fact his aunt.  It is clear that there are issues for the child who results from donor-assisted reproduction using relatives as donors.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter.  There is a deliberate blurring and entangling of the legal and biological family.  The child's personal and family identity becomes confused and complicated by such procedures.  We must think of that child.  All babies-----</p></speech>

That occurs, for example, where a mother donates an egg for use by her daughter or a daughter donates an egg for her mother.  In the former case, we know how they will be related.  From the child's perspective, his half sister will be treated by the law as his mother.  The people whom the Bill will treat as his maternal uncles and aunts will in fact be his half siblings.  Their children, whom the Bill will treat as his first cousins, will in fact be nieces or nephews.  How will the child feel about this in the future?  One may laugh, but this is how ridiculous it can get unless we regulate for this.  I am asking the Minister, between now and Report Stage, to regulate very carefully in the Bill for this situation.  It is a very fair request.  Does the Minister accept there are issues in respect of donors who are related to the intending parents?</p></speech>

Given that this is an issue which was not addressed in the 2005 report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, will the Minister please elaborate on the Government's position on this matter?  Will she come back to us on this?  This is a matter of ethics, human rights and the child's rights.  We can say all we want.  I have had a lot of personal experience in this area and when one wants to have a child, one is often thinking of oneself as a adult, but we are legislators and must think of the child and his or her future.  Babies are beautiful, but all babies grow up to be children, young adults and adults.  We do not want to legislate for a situation today which will haunt them into the future.</p></speech>

I want to speak to the principles behind them.  I do not plan to use up much of the time today, but I feel I need to clarify certain things for the record.  The first is the citing of a quote from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection.  I have verified the quote with him personally over the past 24 hours.  I am taking the quote directly from the Official Report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children meeting on 29 January 2015.  It states:<blockquote><br /><br />Senator van Turnhout also asked about my views on marriage, which have been grossly misrepresented.  A number of years ago I put together a piece in which I had described marriage as the gold standard but I mentioned it in the context of that institution as being available to all citizens.  I see it as being manipulated by some people and I do not intend to include it in today&rsquo;s discussion.  However, it is important to clarify that point for the record.</blockquote>That says it all.</p></speech>

We are evolving in our understanding and are furthering children's rights in Ireland.  However, I am concerned about the references made today and on Tuesday to the convention.  There has been an interpretation that I cannot find.</p> <p>I reread the convention last night.  I want to be absolutely clear.  The word "mother" is mentioned once in the convention, in article 24, regarding pre and post-natal health.  The word "father" is mentioned zero times.  The word "parent" is mentioned 36 times and the word "family" 19 times.  There is no definition of any of those terms in the convention.  Article 5, for example, clearly states there is a wide interpretation of who may be involved in a child's life and states that state parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child.  Article 9 concerns care orders, custody and access where parents are living separately.  Article 8 refers to the right to identity.  I do not agree with the interpretation that has been given of the convention by some Members of the House.</p> <p>I would like the convention to be binding in Ireland, but it is not.  What is binding in Ireland is the European Convention on Human Rights.  I examined its laws.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In all of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, the overriding consideration of the court is on the substance of the relationship between the social or biological parent and the child, not the biological link.  This is clear.  Nowhere in that case law does the court place biological parents over social parents.  There is no such ruling.  It is firmly established in jurisprudence around the European convention's Article 8 on the right to respect for private and family life and Article 14 on the prohibition of discrimination.  The European convention forms part of our domestic law through the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  We comply with these laws.</p><p>Without knowing it, maybe the ECHR is in on the groupthink in which we are all supposed to share.  I believed that I was thinking independently.  It is difficult to understand how people can claim that the Ombudsman for Children and the Children's Rights Alliance and its member organisations are acting against the best interests of the child.  When explaining the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to someone, my understanding of its importance is that it gives paramount consideration to the best interests of the child.  It also addresses continuity of care, a child's security, his or her right to an identity and voice, and non-discrimination.  These are the principles within the convention.  I have listened carefully to all of the debate.  When we state matters as fact, I ask that they really be fact and that we not misrepresent the UN convention.</p></speech>

Like the Minister, I attended a recent conference on this Bill at which Dr. Geoffrey Shannon spoke.  He was clear on the issue.  He made the point that it was doubtful that the shape of families mattered and that what was important was the stability of the relationship.  He stated that this was what the research said.  He criticised those who sought to misrepresent it to suit an agenda instead of respecting it.  From the point of view of a child's development, the most important factor is that he or she should grow up in a loving, supportive and stable family unit, be it headed by a single parent, grandparents, step-parents, a married heterosexual couple, a female-female couple or two gay men.</p> <p>I take issue with some of the language that has been used in this debate.  Senator van Turnhout rightly debunked the misrepresentation of Dr. Shannon's remarks on the gold standard.  Opponents of the Bill often refer to ideal families and so forth.  That is unfair and stigmatising and has been used for too long to deny rights, not just to parents, but also to children.  It is the type of language around matters like illegitimacy that was used against children like me who were born to unmarried mothers.  It is the type of stigma that led to women being forced to give up their children for adoption and to tens of thousands of people being taken away from their biological parents because of the social prejudice to the effect that one was better off with any married mother and father than with one's own parents.  A modern iteration of this is now being used against same-sex couples.  It is time that we put all of that prejudice and discrimination in the past and base our views on research and on understanding what matters in families.</p></speech>

It is not regulated.  I have concerns about DAHR in particular.  I have tabled amendments on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group to ensure greater rights to identity for people conceived through that process, to try to improve the Bill as much as possible and to address the issues.  By voting down the legislation, all that the Senators will achieve is to have no regulation of assisted or donor-assisted human reproduction.  I do not see how that will address their concerns.  Opposing every section of the Bill as some amendments do will have the same effect.  Yes, try to improve it.  I will engage in that process because I have an open mind on many of the issues.  Senators van Turnhout and Healy Eames and I co-sponsored a Bill on adoption.  Identity is an important issue for me.  It is critical that we get these matters right.  I urge colleagues not to try to ignore the social realities of life and pretend that these kids do not exist.  There are children born through AHR who do not know what is their legal situation.  The House has a long-overdue responsibility to correct that.  Senators cannot ignore this fact because they disapprove on the grounds that it does not fit with their social view.  Those kids exist and deserve rights and legal clarity.  It is important that we do this job properly.</p> <p>I ask Senators to engage genuinely with the spirit of the Bill instead of rejecting all of it.  That is my only concern when I ask them to stick to the amendments.  I want us to have enough time to go through the Bill in its entirety.  We have been debating it for nearly an hour and a half, but we are still on the first set of amendments.  I will be brief and conclude because I want us to get through the amendments.  This is not meant to disrespect anyone's opinions.  I want to hear those.</p></speech>

I will make a number of points.  On Second Stage, I explained that, in this Bill, we were dealing with some of the parentage aspects in respect of AHR.  There is no doubt that broader legislation on AHR and DAHR is necessary.  A vast range of relevant issues require it.  I have worked closely with the Department of Health to ensure that the Bill's measures are congruent with its policy approach to the forthcoming legislation on AHR.</p> <p>In terms of the treatment process rather than the parentage issues, access to treatments, consent and counselling, gamete and embryo donations, surrogacy, posthumous assisted reproduction, and genetic screening of embryos for medical purposes and associated research are complicated matters.  This is why, following permission received from the Government a couple of weeks ago to develop a scheme on AHR, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has stated that there will be a consultation period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The heads of that Bill will be developed in the course of this year, and there will be a very significant consultation process.  The point is there are certain aspects of assisted human reproduction and donor-assisted human reproduction that are dealt with in this legislation with respect to parentage, but I am not saying to the House that this is the entire range of issues relating to assisted human reproduction, many of which have been raised by Senators absolutely legitimately.  They are areas that need legislation.</p><p>With this legislation, we are moving from a position where there is no regulation.  There are currently clinics operating in this country where practitioners are working according to medical guidelines and ethics, making some reports to Europe.  Not all the clinics are reporting.  There is effectively an unregulated sector, which raises many issues.  There is no question about that.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction indicated in 2005 that the area was in need of regulation.  As I was developing the Children and Family Relationships Bill, I felt it appropriate to deal with certain aspects of parentage relating to assisted human reproduction and donor-assisted human reproduction.  I indicated on Second Stage yesterday, and indicated repeatedly on previous occasions, that we have considered how to improve the system so that children born as a result of assisted human reproduction and donor-assisted human reproduction can have access to identity and there are very clear consents from those who make donations.  I indicated that we will move from anonymous to identifiable donations, which is a critical child-centred approach.  The legislation is child-centred and protects those children's rights.  That is what we are doing in the legislation.  We are making it very clear what the clinics must do with regard to consents and information.  We have suggested keeping a national register of donor-conceived persons so a child can have the information as he or she grows older.  Of course, the parents can at any point give the information they have, as clinics provide much information to anybody who uses their services about the donor.  Just as with a child who is adopted, the parent is in a position on an ongoing basis to give information to the child from the very beginning.  That would be best practice and the right course of action.</p><p>The reality is this area has been shrouded in secrecy.  There has been stigma in this area, in the same way as there has been stigma attached to adoption.  It is clear from discussions with various groups and my research in the area that there is work to be done culturally, socially and practically in this area so that couples who use fertility treatments understand issues around the best interests of the child.  As parents, I am sure most of them do that anyway, as they care about their children and want to do their best.  From a public policy perspective, we are now making it clear that consent issues are important, as well as access to genetic information.  We are putting that as a central provision.</p><p>The approach being put forward is in line with that in many jurisdictions, including certain Australian states, Sweden, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain.  They all have legislation very similar to what is being proposed here.  This is not legislation that has been plucked from obscurity without serious consideration.  The policy issues have been thought through carefully by the Department of Health's bioethics section, as I accept there are serious ethical issues relating to the area we are discussing today.  I have outlined the policy position of the Department of Health on assisted human reproduction and donor-assisted human reproduction, and this will be further developed in the broader assisted human reproduction legislation.</p><p>I will discuss the amendments in detail, but there is an important context to speak about.  There are 300,000 people affected by infertility or sub-fertility matters in this country.  Some of these people are in married families, some are single and some are cohabiting.  It is a very serious issue of our time, and we need to consider the myriad of issues that go with access to the variety of treatments and technologies that are increasingly available.  We must examine the realities of what we know from census data about Irish family life, as we are not making constitutional change but giving legal protection to diverse family types, particularly the children in those family types.  There were 215,000 lone-parent households in Ireland in 2011, with 4,000 same-sex couples living together.  Of the 115,000 divorced or separated women, 66% were living with their children on their own.  There were 49,000 households of cohabiting couples with children under 15.  A relevant statistic in terms of a changing family culture in Ireland is that the number of children living in households headed by cohabiting couples increased by 41% between 2006 and 2011.</p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to confine the assignment of parentage in donor-assisted human reproduction to the birth mother and her husband.  It would not be possible to assign parentage to the civil partner or the cohabiting partner of the mother.  This is a very restrictive amendment that would ensure that only married couples could jointly be the parents of a child born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  It would specifically deprive cohabiting couples or civil partners from joint legal parentage of a child.  This goes much further even than establishing a hierarchy of families, as it sets out that the only family we are prepared to recognise of a donor-conceived child is the constitutionally recognised marital family.  I have already spoken in this House about the hierarchy of family types and how in 1987 we stated that we would do away with the concept of illegitimacy.  This would seek to reverse the policy behind that, in effect, and it would discriminate once again between certain family types.  That is utterly against the spirit of this Bill, which is intended to protect and support a range of families and their children.  It is not just problematic in terms of public policy; it has serious implications in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights in that it would completely fail to recognise the rights of non-marital couples to private and family life.  If we examine case law relating to children's rights to family life as well, it would also cut across that; the amendment indicates that the reality of children in varying family types cannot be recognised.</p><p>The evidence does not support a contention that only a married couple can provide for the welfare and best interests of a child born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  The evidence indicates that a range of family types, including single women, can look after children extremely well.  There is some very detailed and interesting research relating to the experiences of children in same-sex families.  Senator Power commented that what matters is the stability of families and the quality of relationships, which will have an impact on how well a child does.  The amendment is not supported by the evidence and I cannot accept it.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 would specify that a child born as a result of a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure would have two parents.  Again, this involves a hierarchy of family types and would deprive single women of the possibility of fulfilling what might be a much-desired wish to become a mother.  As I have already stated, it would stigmatise lone parents again to suggest that lone parenting is unacceptable from a public policy perspective.  This is not the type of attitude we should be reflecting in legislation.  Amendments Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive, propose restrictions which would prevent people other than married couples, in the case of amendments Nos. 26 and 28, or couples, in the case of amendment No. 27, from accessing donor-assisted human reproduction.  The evidence does not support such an approach to public policy.</p><p>I would like to make a number of other points.  The Bill does not change the parentage of the vast majority of children in Ireland.  The child's birth mother will continue to be the child's mother, except where the child is adopted, just as at present.  There are a small number of children who are donor-conceived and who are in an insecure position in terms of their second parent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of them are born to married couples.  The Bill enables these children to have the chance of a second parent, which is in line with what is desired by some of the Senators who are putting down these amendments.  It is giving a right to certainty to that donor-conceived child in respect of his or her parents.  Obviously, all donor-conceived children have mothers.  The Bill will also give them the chance to have a second parent and it safeguards the parentage rights of the husband who is not biologically linked to a child as the presumption of paternity of a married husband can be overturned.  </p><p>I believe we must legislate for the realities.  These children are here in Ireland and this technology is being used.  I have the figures regarding the number of children.  I have already said that there are hundreds of thousands of men and women who are affected by fertility issues in this country and who are seeking to resolve them.  The vision in this Bill is that a child has loving parents and can grow up in love and security.  I do not want to depart from the amendments but I believe the legislation is helping children in these situations to move to a position of greater certainty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-26a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032600002#BB00200"><p>I thank the Minister for her response.  At the outset, I acknowledge that it is a very complex area.  I drafted a Bill relating to it about three years ago and tried to tease it out as best I could.  Ultimately, I was not satisfied.  I met with Dr. Joanna Rose, who the Minister probably knows.  I suggested to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that she be one of the invitees when this was considered but it did not happen.  This is a pity because she would have given an informed view from somebody who has been working and fighting this and who has gone through the courts in Great Britain with some success.  She knows exactly what the effects on people produced through AHR are.</p> <p>I put down an amendment opposing this section so that it can be looked at and I will talk about that later when we come to the section.  I will concentrate on amendment No. 28.  I accept the point the Minister makes, which I think was made by Senator Bacik as well, that there are many families, particularly married couples, who are challenged with infertility.  It is a problem.  I know how much they desired to have a child and that they have taken steps to achieve that aim.  We should use science in a positive way to assist the natural process as far as we possibly can.</p> <p>The purpose of putting down this amendment was to confine the donor-assisted human reproduction to married mother-and-father couples and to facilitate only assigning parentage of a child conceived through AHR to a married man and woman, thus providing for a child having a mother and father who are married to each other.  It is done in the best interests of the child.  My rationale is that assigning parentage to a married man and woman is something several European countries do and would give maximum protection to the welfare rights, needs and interests of donor-conceived children.  Marriage is the ultimate and most binding relationship commitment.  Insisting that the intending parents be married would ensure that they are able to provide a child with a stable environment and are legally committed to each other as mother and father.  </p> <p>Natural human reproduction provides children with an identifiable mother and father.  In regulating AHR, we should try to ensure that the children who result are not denied the rights other children enjoy, including the right to know and as far as possible, be raised by their parents - mother and father.  If Irish AHR laws do not protect the child's natural presumptive right to a mother and father, they discriminate against children conceived using AHR.  This is a serious discriminatory step we are taking.  Marriage is the best guarantee of a child growing up in a stable mother-and-father family.</p> <p>The Minister is probably aware of the Evans case in Great Britain which shows the importance of requiring that only married couples be allowed access AHR.  Natalie Evans started IVF treatment with her cohabiting partner who was not her husband.  Following the creation of embryos and prior to their implementation, the couple split and her partner requested that the embryos be destroyed.  Ms Evans wanted to continue with the implementation.  She had, unfortunately, been diagnosed with ovarian cancer so the embryos represented her only chance of having biologically related children.  The case became a bitter legal battle that ultimately found its way to European Court of Human Rights, so clarity is essential and the best interests of the child are paramount.</p> <p>I have listened carefully and respect what the Minister had to say.  She said that she is looking at reality.  She mentioned single mothers and the numbers who are involved, which are remarkable.  I think 36% of children are born outside of marriage.  I spoke on Second Stage about my own experience and the experience I have in dealing with mothers who find it extremely difficult.  A recent CSO report showed the poverty that exists among children reared in one-parent families.  They are seriously financially challenged.  The mother makes enormous personal sacrifices in the interests of her child or children and this needs to be respected and supported.  </p> <p>However, we also need to recognise that there is a requirement to ensure that the State does not stand back.  This is why I have to disagree greatly with the approach the Minister is taking.  The State should not be neutral about the best interests of children.  Any mother who is a single parent will admit without hesitation that if she had a supportive husband or partner, her situation and that of her child would be far better.  I pointed out how the cost of this is enormous.  I pointed out the US figures.  No research has been done on it here but Great Britain has carried out exercises.  I think $112 billion per year is spent in the US and it is a minimum of &pound;15 billion in Great Britain so it is very significant.  Even from an Exchequer point of view, leaving aside the interests of the people themselves, there should be a huge compunction on the State not to stand back and be a spectator on the sideline but to actively support what is in the best interests of the child, which is couples working together.  </p> <p>The Minister mentioned diverse family types.  There have been a lot of studies on various forms of families.  On Second Stage, I pointed out the fragmentation of families in Great Britain but fragmentation of families is not a good thing.  It is a reality, as the Minister noted, but that does not mean it is a good thing and I think throwing a legislative umbrella over everything that exists and hoping it will go away is not the right answer.  We need to steer society in a way that is in the interests of everybody, particularly those unfortunate people who end up rearing children on their own.  I have no hesitation in fighting for the rights of fathers to have access to their children but I am equally as strong about ensuring that those fathers have a responsibility to support the mother of those children and the children themselves.  That should be the reality.  </p> <p>I have looked at other countries.  I took an interest in the list of countries the Minister gave.  She mentioned that if we accepted the amendments I have put down, the European Court of Human Rights would have a problem.  In Germany, assisted human reproduction is only utilised for married couples and only the sperm of the husband should be used.  If donor sperm is used, additional requirements must be met.  Germany also allows an unmarried woman to access it if she has a stable relationship with an unmarried man who acknowledges paternity.  Donor insemination may not be performed on women who are not in a stable relationship or who are in a homosexual relationship.</p></speech>

I could go on and say that Austria is similar and only permits it for stable heterosexual couples living together.  Sperm donation for single women or lesbian couples is forbidden.  Egg donation and the use of donor eggs are forbidden.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jim Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand that, even in France, that is the situation, and Switzerland and Italy are quite interesting as well.  Without going into the detail, they all have forms of this.  Admittedly, the amendment I have put down is perhaps a little more restricted than some of those because I have this applying just to married couples.  However, in Switzerland, for example, donor sperm can be used only by married couples and egg donation is forbidden.  The aim is to enable a couple to overcome infertility where other treatment methods have failed or offered no prospect of success, and there is no other way of avoiding the risk of transmitting a serious or incurable disease.  Apart from that, there are restrictions, even on married couples.</p><p>I think what is in this Bill is premature.  Not near enough thought and consideration has been given to the overall situation.  I know what the Minister said and I take note of it, namely, that in the later Bill, which is often referred to as the surrogacy Bill, serious outstanding issues will be addressed, and I certainly hope that is the case.  However, we have no regulation.  We are the only country out of those countries I mentioned that has no regulation in place.  That is not good enough.</p><p>To be honest, I was caught in two minds as to whether to go with this amendment or just oppose donor-assisted human reproduction altogether until such time as it was fully fleshed out and all aspects were considered, and until the complexity was ironed out in a way that would be satisfactory and would be to the welfare of society, in particular the welfare of children.  I certainly do not think allowing the broad span that is contained in this Bill is the way to go, given it would be one of the most liberal that occurs.  I believe this is driven by a political imperative, and I have said that.  I was surprised, when I went through the Bill, to discover the number of times "civil partnership" and "same-sex" was mentioned - 196 times, and I have had them counted.  This comes about because of the Bill we are discussing tomorrow, and that is not the right way to approach it.  In fact, I do not think it even helps the Minister's position in regard to the Bill we are discussing tomorrow because it leaves a whole plethora of outstanding issues about which the citizens have no certainty, in particular how those issues are going to pan out in regard to the fallout from endorsing that Bill on 22 May.</p><p>At this stage, the Minister should make some refinement of where she is going.  While diversity is there, I do not accept the Minister would just throw a legislative veil over it without having some direct policy input into it.  We are not spectators in this whole area.  There are, of course, advances in science but this is now leading into areas of social re-engineering.  We need to be acutely conscious of the effect it may have on youngsters and other people in the future.  I have seen evidence of this from some people who have engaged with it, or who have been the product of assisted human reproduction.  We need to be cautious.  Other countries are cautious, and I would wish that, equally, we would show the same caution and that the best interests of children would be absolutely paramount.  To me, that should be the prime consideration.  Everything else is secondary to that, including the interests of adults.</p></speech>

To be fair, I completely agree with her and am happy to hear her say this Bill does not cover a wide range of issues.  Can I presume, in that, she is referring to donor-assisted human reproduction with regard to related persons or intergenerational donation?</p> <p>I was very disappointed the justice committee hearing on this Bill was so short.  It was one I attended because I have a great interest in this area, so I know it was less than a full day.  I did not think it was open enough.  All of us, across the House, have an interest in this issue because of how serious it is.  We are talking about creating human beings.  It is a phenomenal gift; it is the gift of life.  Nonetheless, there is the question of how we manage that.  We have a duty to take into account people's experiences.  Maybe we will do things a little differently.  I regret the justice committee did not, for example, listen to Dr. Joanna Rose, and I believe there was a lady talking to George Hook this week, Elizabeth Howard, who had great concerns about having been donor-conceived.  We are now beginning to hear of the fallout from this process.  What we should be doing is learning from it in order to create the right regulation.</p> <p>There is potential for great debate on this issue.  I am grateful the Minister has indicated there will be hearings.  Am I correct there will be a broader consultative process?</p></speech>

I completely agree that 36% of our children are now born to single parents and that it is a social reality.  I really do not know how they do it.  I take my hat off to them, because it is so difficult sometimes to rear a child with two parents, never mind with just one.  However, we cannot compare that situation, which occurs through natural circumstances, to donor-assisted human reproduction, which is by design and is where we are deliberately creating a child.  It is different from adoption as well because, in that case, the child is already there and we are trying to make the best decisions around the placement in the best interests of the child.  I would ask respectfully that all of us would stop comparing what we are talking about here, namely, parentage as a result of donor-assisted human reproduction, to naturally occurring children through single parents or in the case of widowed persons as well.</p> <p>I agree that information is good and healthy.  Again, however, according to people who are now the product of donor-assisted human reproduction, waiting until they are 18 to find out, for example, there was a hereditary illness in the family is not good enough.  The Minister should clarify whether there is a way of that being put on the record earlier, given I have read that this might be the case in the Bill.  I again thank the Minister.</p></speech>

Senator Walsh has also spoken on this point.  My understanding from the work we have done in this regard is that it is certainly an area that will need to be spelled out in future legislation - there is no question of that.  From an Irish perspective, and for the purpose of information for the Senators, I would point out that we have the Punishment of Incest Act 1908, as amended, with its provisions on that issue.  We also have the rules and legislation in regard to marriage not being permitted between individuals within prohibited degrees of relationships on the basis of consanguinity, for example, parents, grandchildren, brothers or sisters, including half-siblings, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces.  There is a whole issue in that regard.</p> <p>At the moment, we do not have regulation in regard to assisted human reproduction but what we have, and what I understand the professionals work to because there is no legislation, is the Medical Council's guide to professional conduct and ethics.  In regard to assisted human reproduction, that guide states that where a registered medical practitioner offers a donor programme to patients, he or she must consider the biological difficulties involved and pay particular attention to the source of the donated material.  The practice in the clinics, of course, is that there are very clear rules in this regard but there is no statutory legislation underpinning it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we were having a debate on the broader AHR legislation, we would be discussing that matter.  I reiterate that we are dealing with certain aspects of AHR in the context of the parentage provisions contained in the Bill.  I am not for one moment saying that this legislation covers the wide range of issues to which I refer.  The discussion of those issues is a matter for another debate.  The provisions contained in the Children and Family Relationships Bill in respect of identity and consent represent a move in the right direction.  In the context of any issues which might arise in court, the Bill makes provision for that which is in the best interests of the child - whether in respect of guardianship or access - to be the deciding principle.</p><p>It is clear there is a need for rules and regulations.  In the absence of legislation at present, what holds sway at present is the best practice in which the clinics are engaged.  I absolutely accept that this is not enough.  The issues of consanguinity, etc., to which the Senator refers would really be proper to broader legislation relating to AHR.</p></speech>

I will deal with it when we reach the relevant amendment.</p> <p>I was particularly taken by something the Minister said during her contribution.  Any use of the comparison with illegitimacy or with the concept thereof is completely misconceived.  To suggest that restricting DAHR to married couples is tantamount to calling donor-assisted children illegitimate, comes perilously close to insulting such children and the Senators who are making certain arguments in this debate.  The Minister should reconsider the position in respect of this matter and I will tell her why.  The Bill provides for guardianship arrangements in circumstances where children are outside the marital family and for non-marital fathers to be recognised as guardians where they have been cohabiting with the mother for a period, including for three months after the birth of the child.  Nobody is suggesting that those children would be deemed illegitimate by virtue of the Minister restricting the recognition of the status of such fathers.  It would be much better if we did not make such highly emotive, inaccurate and vague comparisons that are really designed not to address the argument rather to create an aura of odium around what is being proposed.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to reconsider the comment she made in respect of illegitimacy.  It is a loathsome idea and I do not believe she should make a comparison or suggest that we are in any way revisiting the concept in question.  The logic of what she is saying is that unless one acknowledges everything adults do, one is calling the children involved illegitimate.  That really implies complete recklessness on the part of the Minister, as both a legislator and a member of the Government.  Basically, she is stating that the Government is going to allow everything lest it be seen as being judgmental not to.  She should remember that what we are proposing relates to restoring to all children the right not to be brought into the world in a way that intentionally deprives them of the opportunity of being brought up by their own biological father or mother or both.  What we are about is vindicating children's rights, not stigmatising them.  I really wish the Minister has not used the word "illegitimate".

I was referring to establishing a hierarchy of family types whereby some family types would be entitled to access to the procedures, which is what the amendment does.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-26a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032600002#DD00400"><p>I do not accept what the Minister said.  It is not about establishing a hierarch of family types.  Rather, what is involved here is an attempt to establish a hierarchy for children.  As Minister for Justice and Equality and as a former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, that is what Deputy Fitzgerald should be seeking to do.  Earlier, I provided some information in respect of different family types.  I will cite one example.  I prepared a paper for the World Meeting of Families in 2012.  I spent a considerable amount of time researching the paper in question because I wanted to get it right.  Every bit of the research I carried out showed that, in general, not all family types give rise to the same outcomes for children.  I have seen very good examples of children being well cared for.  I wish to refer to a study carried out in Britain which indicates that a child whose biological mother cohabits with someone is 33 times more likely to suffer serious abuse when compared to a children with married parents.  I have compiled charts in respect of various family types.  Robert Whelan's "Broken Homes &amp;amp; Battered Children: A Study of the Relationship Between Child Abuse and Family Type", which was published in Britain the 1990s, indicates that a child whose biological mother cohabits is 73 times more likely to suffer fatal abuse than a child with married parents.</p> <p>It is not right to put forward the very simplistic notion that diversity is grand and that all children will enjoy the same outcomes.  The latter is not the case.  We know from statistics available here that single mothers experience serious financial difficulties in terms of raising their children unless they receive support from the fathers of their children and their own families.  We know that those kinds of outcomes affect them from the point of view of education and employment, and in many other ways.  It is not good enough for the Minister or the Government to state that it really does not matter.  I am of the view that the State has a responsibility to ensure that children get the best opportunities in life.  Everything we do in this area is so problematic for children.  As a result, we should be absolutely certain that whatever action we take will give them the best prospects going forward.  We must take a much more cautious approach.</p> <p>It is evident from what the Minister stated that we are ill prepared as a result of the bits and pieces approach taken in the Bill.  What we are doing is being done for one reason and one reason only.  That is wrong.  I would have preferred it had a much more measured approach been taken and if, perhaps, either a Green Paper or a White Paper had been compiled.  This would have ensured that when we reached this stage of passing the legislation, we would have been certain with regard to what we intend to do.  I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider adopting such an approach.  This matters to children and the Minister is aware of that.  She should not let any ideology - regardless of its source, of how well it is funded or of how professionally it is framed - get in the way of what is right for children.</p></speech>

The subtext to his contribution is that said reason relates to the marriage equality referendum.  The legislation before the House has been in the offing for ten years.  As previously stated, many children who have been born through assisted human reproduction - mainly to heterosexual couples - do not know who are their legal parents.  Regardless of how anyone intends to vote, these are legal issues and they have nothing whatsoever to do with the referendum.  Earlier, the Minister provided statistics in respect of different family types in Ireland.  She indicated that approximately 200,000 households are headed by single parents and that 230 are headed by same-sex parents.  The proportion of gay and lesbian people to which the Bill relates is minute.  It is a deliberate misrepresentation to claim that the Bill is being rushed through.</p></speech>

In broad terms, I accept the principle that intending parents receiving fertility treatment should receive counselling.  That is correct.  From my discussion with clinics, I understand they regard counselling as vital and will not provide treatments unless their clients first undergo counselling.  I have had one meeting with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which represents a variety of professionals working in the area, and one meeting and with one of the clinics, the Sims IVF clinic, at its request.  That is the extent of my discussion with the clinics.  From those discussions, clinics regard counselling as vital and will not provide treatment unless their clients first undergo counselling.  This is one of the wider issues of assisted reproduction, which remains fully within the remit of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  In parallel, he is advancing his policy proposals on broader regulation of assisted human reproduction.  His proposals will address issues ranging from who may access treatment to measuring long-term outcomes.  Counselling of individuals or couples considering or planning treatment is clearly within his area of policy responsibility.  His proposals in that regard were recently approved by the Government and include requirements that people availing of all forms of assisted human reproduction, not just donor assisted fertility treatment, undergo counselling in advance of treatment.  To the extent that the Bill regulates aspects of donor-assisted human reproduction, it is confined to what I am advised is reasonably necessary to allow the assignment of parentage while protecting the identity and rights of the child.  The Bill does not purport to regulate the many related issues, such as access to treatment prohibitable procedures etc.  I am in sympathy with the general spirit of the amendment but I hope the Senator will understand the reasons I am not accepting it today.</p> <p>The same issue arises with amendment No. 6, proposed by Senators Mullen and Quinn, which proposes that prospective donors should provide certification that they received appropriate counselling.  Counselling is part of the donor recruitment process and the proposals of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, will ultimately address this.  Counselling takes place on the basis that it is best practice.  We know many donations are imported from other jurisdictions and I am advised that donors are counselled there but importation is part and parcel of the current situation.  One cannot legislate in an extrajudicial fashion.</p> <p>As with the counselling of the intended parents, the requirement for counselling is not one that is essential and intrinsic to the assignment of parentage.  The proposals in the Bill are not the totality of legislation, which will apply to donor assisted human reproduction and we have those transition issues in the Bill.  They are a smaller part of the approach to AHR and are limited to the requirements that must be in place to allow the assignment of parentage in a robust and clear manner while respecting the identity rights of the child.  I have sympathy with the amendments but I see it as part of the broader approach to AHR.  It is taking place currently because it is considered by all of the clinics to be best practice.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment requires the provision of appropriate documentation whereby the donor of the gametes certifies having received independent counselling.  The Minister sought to address it but not in a satisfactory way.  There is a sense in which we cannot legislate in an extrajudicial fashion but we can certainly legislate to require certain things of foreign donors.  I think it essential that we do.  The purposes of the amendment is that people receive counselling prior to donating gametes so that they are fully aware that at some indeterminate future date they may be contacted by adults who are their biological children.  A separate section rightly requires the Minister to refrain from recording or releasing relevant donor conceived personal information "unless the Minister is satisfied that the person has received counselling on the implications of his or her recording such a statement or, as the case may be, receiving such information."  This is information that relates to the donor conceived person providing information on the register intended either for the donor or for a donor conceived sibling.</p> <p>I have a separate proposed amendment on the age at which it is legitimate to make a donation.  Donating gametes is not the same as donating blood and is a serious thing.  In some cases, people donate gametes and get the price of a few drinks for doing so.  It does not have to be commercialised for it to become a very casual transaction engaged in by people who are not yet mentally or emotionally mature for a longer term commitment of the type society wants to encourage, yet we do not require certification that they have received the necessary counselling.  Our duty of care to such people, at a minimum, requires us to seek certification that people have received independent counselling about donating gametes and have not been browbeaten or encouraged in a casual or self-serving way by the industry or others to donate their gametes.</p></speech>

The potential exists for people who are really not at a mature stage of their lives to donate gametes.  If they do so, it could come back to haunt them, as they will see it, at a future date.  In my view, this is something socially destructive because it contributes to the separation of a child from the love and society of one of his or her natural parents.  At the very least, we should require independent counselling and certification.  We could certainly insist that we would not tolerate the use of such gametes unless the donor, even if he were a foreigner, could show that he had received independent counselling.  I should say, before Senator Norris jumps up and cackles at me, that I do not use the word "foreigner" in any pejorative sense.</p></speech>

In light of his frequently expressed desire for a respectful debate and all the rest of it, I ask Senator Mullen to avoid words like "industry" and all this rubbish about "a few drinks".  That suggests that the next thing he will be looking for is a certificate for a one-night stand.  I do not see why the Minister cannot accept amendment No. 4, in the name of the Sinn F&eacute;in representatives.  She indicated that she agrees with it.  She said that clinics do this at the moment.  We should not be acting at the behest of the clinics.  I understand the difficulties she mentioned.  She said they are being examined by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Can we have a timescale for that?  When is this going to be produced?  I do not see why amendment No. 4 should not be accepted.  I would be very much inclined to accept it.  I am not sure how the proposal set out in amendment No. 6 could be regulated in an extra-territorial jurisdiction.  How on earth can we demand that people in Denmark go for counselling because they make a sperm donation?  That is in the realms of fantasy.</p></speech>

Part of the problem here is that there is a complete mentality of contract around how donor gametes are being viewed in this legislation.  We need to consider the ramifications of donating one's gametes without knowing with whose other gametes they will be used to bring a child into being in the future.  I think we have got it all wrong here.  A socially responsible approach would be to say that when one is bringing a child into the world, one should respect that child's right to be in the company of his or her father and mother.  From a public policy point of view, we should be insisting that the donor is an older person and is in a position, or perhaps a better position, to fully engage with the implications of what he is doing.</p></speech>

That is what I thought.  I am talking about donations made here.  I do not know if there are other people in this House who have sons aged 18 or 19.  I certainly think it would be very wise to let them be as old as possible before they make such a far-reaching decision.  It is very little to ask that the age limit be extended from 18 to 21.  I will set out what I have learned about how young men are encouraged to donate in other countries.  According to what I have heard, they are told they are saving the human race and doing good for their country.  I think this is a little disingenuous, to say the least, given that the people in question are just 18 years of age.  I assure the House that most 18 year old boys probably have the maturity of a 15 or 16 year old girl.  It is interesting that we are saying in this Bill that the woman has to be at least 21.  We are allowing sperm to be donated by a really immature boy while providing that the woman has to be at least 21.  I think it would be very reasonable to move the age limit for the donation of sperm to 21.  This is a massive responsibility for young lads of 18.  Of course they are going to be encouraged by money.  They have to be aware of the commitment involved.  I agree with Senator Cullinane that counselling is vital here.  Senator Mullen made the reasonable point that there should be proof that the counselling is independent.  The truth is that the donor-assisted reproduction facility has a vested interest.  It cannot continue unless it can continue to get people to give the sperm.  There will be a comeback in years to come.  I would say the greatest comeback might not be for the child who is conceived.  It could be for the young lad who gave the sperm when his child reaches the age of 18.  If he was 18 when he donated the sperm, he will be just 36 years of age when he realises that his sperm was used to create a young person who is now 18.  We need to be really careful about how we proceed here.  As I have said previously, life is precious.  We should be careful when we are legislating for the conditions in which life is created.  I will conclude by asking a question.  What types of advertising and information will be allowed to be used by the donor-assisted human reproduction facilities to attract donors?</p></speech>

I understand that people in this country get married at the age of 18.  Is that incorrect?  If one can get married at 18, there seems to be a perfectly good argument to say it should be 18 right across the board.  I understand that Senator Crown has tabled amendments concerning this.  I will strongly support them.  It seems to me that if one can get married and have a child at a certain age, one should be allowed to use the mechanical means of reproduction at the same age.</p></speech>

I note the Senator's concerns and the points that have been made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, the area is completely unregulated at present and we are beginning to put legislation around certain aspects of AHR and DAHR.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to raise the minimum age of a donor to 21 years.  This appears to be to match the minimum age of intending parents, although we do have the opposite amendment later on.  The basis for setting different ages, however, is not arbitrary.  The age of 18 is set for a prospective donor on the grounds that he or she is of full age and has the capacity to consent to any necessary medical treatment and to give full legal consent in relation to the assignment of parentage.  That said, I am advised that it takes quite a while to recruit suitable donors, given the clinical requirements for medical screening and counselling and, in the case of women, the medical interventions which are required.  The age is unlikely to actually be 18 because of all those factors and the fact that, for the most part, donors will be somewhat older than the minimum age established.  I do not think it is necessary or appropriate to set a higher minimum age and it potentially creates a barrier to the donor recruitment process.</p><p>Senators raised questions about the implications of a donation, but consent is key, and that is in the legislation.  The donor has to give detailed consent and this should alert him to the implications of his actions.  He has to consent to the information being put on the register, to being contacted and to the implications around parentage.  We discussed counselling earlier, and there is counselling, albeit on a voluntary basis.  Senator Healy Eames makes a very relevant point about the objectivity of counselling, and it will be for the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, to consider the precise form that counselling should take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-03-26a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015032600002#GG00200"><p>In light of Senator Healy Eames's very pertinent point, I am very disappointed about that response from the Minister.  The Senator is absolutely right in making the point about equality and the fact that an intending mother must be at least 21 years of age.  The difference between the two minimum age requirements is perhaps explained by the emphasis the industry places on getting students to donate their gametes.  That is a very troubling thing, because the exploitation of students is an issue.  Concerns that it could not be provided for because the donors might be abroad are absolute nonsense.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine knows all about issues of traceability, creatures crossing boundaries and the massive bureaucracy involved in tracing the identity of other creatures.  It would not be beyond human ingenuity for the law to require that a donor abroad would have to show evidence that they had received independent counselling.</p> <p>In common law, people try to set contracts aside because of a particular relationship between the parties and questions of undue influence, but the idea that one can show independent legal advice is one of the great defences.  It is such a well established concept in our law that it should be obvious to the Minister, but everything she says seems designed to give the clinics whatever they want and to facilitate the industry.  That is why our proposals are getting no traction.</p></speech>

We should not put something into law that is not good practice.  She says the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, will bring a provision forward in the future, but let us do it now.  The Minister has time before Report Stage to bring forward an amendment to clarify this.  She says that a declaration under subsection (1)(c) shall be made before the donation is made and shall be in writing, dated and signed by the person in the presence of a person authorised in that behalf by the operator of the donation facility where the gamete is provided.  That seems awfully basic to me.  It is basically saying that if the consent is given and signed over to the donor facility or clinic then that is good enough.  The Minister agrees with me that independent counselling is vital.  We are talking about the maturity of a person as young as 18 who is making this decision, so let us fix the Bill now.  Will she bring forward an amendment to this end?</p></speech>

They are part of a bigger issue I see in other areas of our legislation.  I am always troubled by the idea that we have differential adulthoods, whereby some adults have some rights that others do not based on how far into adulthood they are.  There is some paternalism implicit in a decision to let some adults have access to donor-assisted human reproduction while others do not.  I believe the State should view people as either adults or not, and discriminating against some adults by saying they are old enough to bear the consequences of donating gametes but not old enough to become a parent through donation, when one's more fertile peers are physically, biologically and legally capable of becoming parents, is a bit ludicrous.  It is a bizarre and illogical situation.  Perhaps we think a 20-year old is not capable of making a decision that can impact on their life or save the lives of others, but they can serve in the Army, they can die and be prosecuted for war crimes or donate kidneys.  The Bill may let them contact their genetic parents or siblings but regards them as being at such a tender year that they cannot make a decision to become a parent themselves in the very manner which brought them into the world.  </p> <p>Perhaps it might be argued that donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, as a process, would be unnecessary for someone so young.  In most cases that would be the case, but not in all, so let that be a medical decision, not a legal one.  We are putting an unnecessary restriction into a Bill and formulating two different categories of adult, which I do not think is in accordance with the principles of natural justice.</p></speech>

This was arrived at in consultation with the Department of Health following policy work and research it had carried out in this area.  The Department of Health advised that, while it would vary a bit depending on the cause, it takes approximately three years to arrive at a diagnosis of infertility.  There may be other factors in the area in which Senator Crown specialises, but if an adult is seeking to become a parent in the earliest stage of adulthood it would take at least three years to have a diagnosis of infertility which would indicate donor-assisted human reproduction.  It is for that reason, rather than any presumption of a greater level of maturity, physical or emotional, that 21 is set as the minimum age for intending parents.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 11 and 15 seek to reduce the minimum age to intending parents to 18, but the age has been set in close consultation with the Department of Health in order to dovetail with the period of adulthood it would take for the intending parent to have a diagnosis of infertility.  The Department of Health has taken a clear policy line that the minimum age for donor-assisted human reproduction should be 21 to take account of the general rule that infertility cannot be diagnosed until a couple has failed to achieve a pregnancy over a period of three years.  I am conscious that the infertility rule will not generally apply to same-sex couples and that infertility may in particular circumstances be clear at an earlier age.  However, the significant majority of couples undertaking donor-assisted human reproduction procedures are opposite-sex couples, often with unexplained fertility, and the rule has sufficiently broad application to justify putting it on a statutory basis.  That is the advice I have, and I hope Senators understand the reasoning behind the different ages.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not an assumption about maturity in respect of males or females.

I am sorry to always cite extreme cases but a person who has become infertile in childhood as a result of treatment for childhood cancer or leukaemia or has had his testicles removed or her ovaries removed does not have to wait three years after the age of 18 years to know that he or she is infertile.</p></speech>

I have a particular perspective on anonymity, as I indicated in the Chamber on another day and in another context, because I occasionally cause infertility.  While we are conscious that the rights of the child are paramount, an existential right comes into play here.  Someone who cannot be conceived or born is losing a certain set of rights as well.  I have a great fear that access to a large swath of treatments currently available to people who suffer from infertility, namely, gamete donation, will decrease as a result of the loss of anonymity.  </p><p>Combined, these amendments would allow an intending mother, the woman who desires to become pregnant, to request an anonymous donor and permit someone to donate anonymously.  Someone who has created an embryo through donor-assisted human reproduction would be able to donate anonymously and a couple who have created an embryo through whatever means would be able to donate that embryo anonymously to another couple who do not have the biological capacity to create an embryo of their own.  </p><p>I am well aware of the trickiness of this issue.  The data suggest when anonymous donation ended in England donation ended with it.  While it has been argued that we will still have access to imported sperm from Denmark, which is apparently much the largest source of sperm for donation in this country, I am worried that, as people fully understand all the implications arising from the end of anonymity, sperm donation will, in time, also decrease. </p><p>This may sound a little extreme but another issue that is also slightly troubling is the question of what will happen if the total number of donations available from Denmark does not decline, whereas the total number of donors who provide these donations declines.  Let us imagine that 90% of those who are happy to donate anonymously decide they will no longer donate if they can be traced, while the remaining 10% decide to continue to donate.  This would mean a much smaller number of people will act as the biological parents of a much larger number of children in this country and other countries, with all the questions that would arise as a result of consanguinity, etc.  </p><p>I am conscious that there is a significant ethical problem with this amendment and I do not dismiss the right of people to know their biological origins.  However, I ask people to remember that if this Bill is passed without the amendments, many people who would otherwise have existed will simply not be born.</p></speech>

The adoption laws have done untold damage to many Irish people because they have operated under a veil of secrecy that has resulted in people being denied the right to any information about who they are and where they come from.  It is difficult to describe the importance of having this information.  Knowing who one's parents are is an important part of a person's identity as it allows him or her to find out where their personality, looks and different aspects of themselves come from.  Those who are denied this information lose a part of themselves and this will cause them great pain.  For this reason, I cannot support amendments which propose anonymous donation.</p> <p>Having said that, I have sympathy with the patients to whom Senator Crown refers, those who desperately want to have children, would make amazing parents and would find it easier to access anonymous donations if the restrictions applied in the Bill were not in place.  The legislation does not outlaw donation but simply provides that certain information should be collected and made available to those who have been conceived through the donation process.  While this makes the process more restrictive, it is also appropriate.  I have great sympathy with people who wish to conceive but conception must not come at all costs and not at the cost of bringing people into the world who will never have an opportunity to find out anything about their genetic history.  This country's experience of adoption shows that this causes permanent loss for people because they are never able to find out about a piece of themselves and their origins.  </p> <p>I will propose an amendment later to provide that people conceived by donor-assisted human reproduction have access to basic information about their family's medical and genetic history.  We must strike a balance between our sympathy for the reasons people use donor-assisted human reproduction and the need to respect the rights of those who are conceived through that process.  As an adoptee, I have many misgivings in this area.  These are connected to my experience of not growing up with a genetic parent and not having access to information.</p> <p>I have sympathy with Senator Crown's position and my party's position is to support assisted human reproduction in a controlled and regulated environment.  I support the Bill because it at least provides for greater regulation than is currently in place.  It is important, however, that those who are conceived through this process have access to as much information as possible. </p></speech>

Why would we do anything that conflicts with this view, which is supported by the recent legislation introduced by the Oireachtas?  It is very important that people have certainty that they will be able to trace their genealogy.</p> <p>That the identity of the donor will be revealed in the register is likely to make donors think twice, which is a good thing because this process places on the donor a responsibility and commitment towards his or her genetic children.</p> <p>The Minister did not respond to my question on whether she will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to provide for independent counselling in order that we have the best possible legislation.  I have many misgivings in this regard.  The amendment highlights the benefit to the child when the donor is not anonymous.</p></speech>

I am thinking of the child because from the moment of conception using this system, the parents will be the mother and father, couple or mother to whom the child is born.

The alleged father or egg donor will have no tie to the child who is born.  They will never see him or her.  Professionals in this area, including gynaecologists and obstetricians, are also opposed to this proposal.</p></speech>

The question arises of somebody with cancer who may be unable to have a child due to radiation treatment.  However, I should be concentrating on the question of anonymity.  There is a difference between adopting a child who has been already born as a result of the activity of two separate people and deliberately setting out to create an embryo.  There is no doubt that the absence of anonymity will seriously decrease the number of donations available.  It is worrying when one thinks that a very small number of donors will provide all this material.  Issues may arise in regard to consanguinity.  It also may be the case that married couples, or whoever they are, would not welcome the intrusion of a third party into their relationship.</p></speech>

This would run counter to the careful provisions we have made to safeguard the identity rights of a child born through donor assisted human reproduction.  These provisions are aimed at securing the child's genetic identity and to ensure he or she has an opportunity to find out the identity of the donor and, potentially, to contact him or her.  If we allow continued anonymity, we will be ensuring that generations of children yet to be born have no knowledge of their genetic identity.  We have heard very different views on that issue today.</p></speech>

If we took Senator Crown's proposed route, we would fly in the face of the recommendations made by the joint committee after it examined the public policy aspects of this issue.  We would also be ignoring emerging international best practice and the spirit of the provisions in the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child on the right to identity.  The golden thread running through this Bill is the best interest of the child.  We would be putting that principle to one side.</p> <p>There is growing consensus internationally regarding non-anonymous gamete donation that identifying information about donors should be released to donor conceived children on request, once they have reached a specific age or stage of maturity.  This increased focus on transparency and openness in donations stems from the argument that individuals have a fundamental interest in their biological and genetic origins.  It has been argued that the ability of individuals to know their genetic origin is at the core of self-identity.  A number of comments and reviews of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child have been invoked in support of the child's right to know his or her genetic parents.  Many would say, for example, that relevant provisions include Article 3, which posits the best interest of the child as a primary consideration, Article 7, which provides that children have a right to a name and a nationality, and Article 8, which provides that State parties should undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as recognised by law without unlawful interference and that where a child is illegally deprived of some or all elements of his or her identity that State parties should provide appropriate assistance and protection with a view to re-establishing his or her identity.  It is very much in the spirit of the UN convention to provide for identifiable donations.</p> <p>A number of jurisdictions have prohibited anonymous donations, including anonymous gamete donation.  These include Austria; New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia in Australia; Finland; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Switzerland; and the UK.  In other Australian states and territories which lack specific legislation, AHR providers can voluntarily seek accreditation from the appropriation accreditation committee in their area.  Such accreditation requires that they uphold national guidelines providing that they only use gametes donated non-anonymously.  There is a move towards this internationally.  Sweden moved to this model some 30 years ago.  The UK changed its legislation in 2005 to enable donor conceived children to request the identity of their donor from the authority established there.  We do not have an authority yet but we will proceed towards establishing one once the broader AHR legislation is in place.  Ideally there also will be a centralised register in which information can be stored and accessed.  Most countries which have moved in this direction have developed registers.</p> <p>I acknowledge Senator Craughwell's point that parents are often reluctant to inform their children that they were conceived with donor gametes due to concerns about the possible psychological impact this could have on the children and the family structure.  However, the professional bodies working in this area, including the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, support disclosure and there is a growing professional movement in the direction of encouraging disclosure.  There is an increasing tendency to openness and transparency on gamete donation and non-anonymity.</p> <p>Senator Power has spoken on several occasions about the comparisons with adoption.  I realise there are also differences but our approach to adoption was formerly secretive and there was a lack of basic information.  We have almost moved to a situation of open adoption, whereby everything is known and there is ongoing contact.  I accept the issues arising are different but there are some parallels.</p> <p>Research suggests that the age of disclosure is important in determining the child's response to being donor conceived.  Like adoption, those told at an earlier age have a less negative experience and families benefit from openness about the child's genetic origins.  There is an interesting debate in this regard but I do not doubt that a Bill dealing with children and family relationships should observe the basic principle of upholding the best interest of the child.  I feel strongly that the right of access to genetic information is a key part of this.  For these reasons, I will not be accepting the amendments.</p> <p>Non-anonymous identifiable donations are already available.  From my discussions with the clinics, it is clear that they can request identifiable donations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That will take time, because up to now Irish clinics have not been asking for that and have used anonymous donations.  There would need to be a transition period and clinics abroad would need to be informed by clinics here of the standards we are including in our legislation and the kind of information that would need to be available.  I appreciate the concerns raised, but I am told that even when the legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom, there was a change initially, but then donations increased again.</p></speech>

What I am going to say is not about the Minister, but it may sound harsh.  We have effectively largely eliminated adoption as a option for people who are not capable of having children.  The right to adoption has dwindled to almost nothing in the past few years as a result of the collateral effect of well-intentioned legislation and regulation designed to ensure unregulated, irresponsible adoption does not take place.  I fear yet another shutter is coming down for people who face the tragedy of infertility and I am concerned about that.</p> <p>I have also spoken to people from assisted reproduction facilities and clinics and have, perhaps, taken a slightly different nuance from what they were saying.  They expressed great concerns to me that for people for whom the only fertility options involve some type of gamete donation, this would become more difficult and perhaps end completely.  They also felt that the proposals would inevitably result in an increase in fertility tourism.  They also made an interesting point.  I do not mean to use the hard exceptions to prove a case, but they made the point that among people who come from more traditional family structures, it is sometimes unappreciated how often there is divergent genetic origin compared to what they feel is the case.  In those circumstances, a sort of constitutional conundrum arises, that some people will have a right to get biological confirmation of who their genetic parents are, but others at the moment do not.</p> <p>In respect of amendments Nos. 32 and 33, amendment No. 32 would allow for the situation where gametes that were harvested in advance of enactment of the Bill and in advance of the current regulations, to be used without regard to the restrictions that would apply following enactment of the Bill.  I understand from discussion with the Minister that for the purposes of the law, assisted reproduction does not exist in Ireland until the Bill is enacted, whereas, of course, it does.  Perhaps, therefore, we are understanding this nuance a little differently.</p> <p>In regard to amendment No. 33, will the Minister assist my understanding?  Where a donor assisted human reproduction facility knows the identity of the donor, and the donor contributed a gamete to an embryo which was created under the current legal regime and if this embryo is used in a procedure which occurs after the new legal regime is signed into law, will the Act require the donor assisted human reproduction facility to send the donor details to the registry, even where the donor has not consented to that information being used?  Our amendment would permit this to occur only where the donor has given consent for that transfer of information.</p></speech>

Therefore, that is the situation currently.  Also, I understand that in places like the Czech Republic, this would require legislation, but the legislation has not yet been prepared that would bring the Czech Republic into line with our legislation.</p></speech>

Those details will not be sent to the registry.  In response to Senator Norris, the information the clinics have varies quite significantly.  Some of the donations they receive are anonymous, so the clinics do not have much information on them.  What we are doing is moving to a situation where information on donations will be available.</p></speech>

There is no clear method to enforce this and there is a risk that if we make it mandatory, a later failure of a donor to update his or her contact details could somehow affect the legal parentage of the child.  In this day and age it is relatively easy to trace people, based on the level of information required.  We know the name, date of birth, address at the time of donation and the nationality.  I agree it is desirable that a donor should update his or her information, but I cannot see a justification for making that mandatory or see a way to enforce that.  This is the difficulty.  In terms of initial consents, ongoing updating of information would be helpful.  Nevertheless, the child on becoming an adult has the opportunity to get significant information because the name and contact details are available from when the person is 18.</p></speech>

It should be mandatory.  Having regard to the child's rights to his or her identity, it should be mandatory that he or she be kept updated.  I believe this is necessary and that we should make this mandatory.</p></speech>
