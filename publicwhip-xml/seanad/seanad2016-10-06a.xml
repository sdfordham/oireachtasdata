Since the roll-out of the new Garda vetting forms, there has been a disconnect between the legislation and the reality on the ground.  A serious problem has arisen.  Michael Ryan, the principal of a school in Waterford, has raised a valid query.  At present, he wants to take on some temporary staff.  He would have the same issue if he wanted to take on a new teacher to work in the school.  He and the school board of management can be held personally liable under the new legislation if they do not get the Garda vetting in order.  For someone looking to work on a temporary basis, it is taking five or six weeks to get Garda vetting for that particular school.  If a teacher was already working in a school and had Garda vetting certificate, that would not apply to Mr. Ryan's school.  Under the new legislation, a principal such as Mr. Ryan has to apply to the Garda to get a certificate pertaining to his school.  There seems to be a real disconnect.</p> <p>The same applies to social clubs and other bodies.  For argument&rsquo;s sake, if the Minister of State wanted to be a coach with a GAA club, the club would need to apply and get the certificate back from the Garda.  If he then wanted to coach the soccer team or work with the scouts, those bodies need to apply individually which is duplication in paperwork.  There has to be a simpler system.</p> <p>I know for new teachers starting now there is an electronic certificate.  If the Garda approves a person for one body, it should apply to all.  We need a more streamlined system to make this work.  There is considerably more onus under the new legislation with the possibility of imprisonment, fines and everything else.  People are taking it very seriously.  While I welcome the legislation in principle, and it is good legislation, it might have been imposed slightly too quickly without having done some of the ground work behind it.  Perhaps the certificate that applies to the new teachers should be given to existing teachers, so that they could move more freely between schools.  It is a serious problem and we should address it.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity for me to inform the House that there is currently no particular or undue delay in the Garda employment vetting process.  There has been a very significant improvement in the timeframe for processing vetting applications over recent months.</p> <p>The Garda authorities, which operate the National Vetting Bureau, inform the T&aacute;naiste that, at present, in the order of 80% of vetting applications are processed by the vetting bureau within five working days.  The current processing times represent a dramatic improvement in turnaround times, which have fallen from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda authorities in providing this service, including an increase of more than 80% in staffing levels in the past couple of years and the roll-out earlier this year of an e-vetting system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In April this year, the T&aacute;naiste commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016, and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-vetting system.</p><p>E-vetting facilitates the on-line processing of application and this has significantly streamlined the process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for applications.  A key feature of the e-vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of his or her vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when his or her application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has been informed that at present 85% of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-vetting system.  The Garda authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  The Senator may be able to help in that regard by letting people know about that.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in the old paper format, the average turnaround time is around four weeks from the receipt of the application by the vetting bureau and this represents a minimum timeframe given the administrative input required.  The Senator is correct about the paperwork involved.  The e-vetting system is a lot faster.</p><p>In some individual cases, it can take longer to process an application where, for example, additional inquiries are necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p><p>In summary, the overwhelming majority of vetting applications are processed within five working days and that is not at all unreasonable in the circumstances.  Delays can arise, mainly in aspects of the process that are outside of the control of the Garda vetting bureau.</p><p>I also heard what the Senator had to say with respect to certificates.  A joint committee examined this issue a number of years ago and the advice was that was not advisable given the serious nature of what is involved, namely, children and vulnerable adults.  The system is working pretty well.  I again thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  It is to be hoped that the new system will meet the concerns he has raised.</p></speech>

He referred to the new e-certification but I may not have understood him.  Is it correct that if one receives a new e-certificate, it will be valid for different bodies or does one still have to apply individually for every body of which one wants to be a member, employed by or whatever else?</p></speech>

The vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and maintain the highest levels of confidence in among from the public and organisations availing of the service.  The answer to the question is that the vetting has to be done on an individual basis.</p> <p>Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, given the importance of this service, the T&aacute;naiste does not consider that a processing time of five days is at all unreasonable.  E-vetting has significantly contributed to improving the vetting service and the Government and Garda authorities are committed to sustaining that level of service in the future.  Most organisations have signed up to e-vetting and there are great benefits for them and vetting applicants.  </p> <p>As previously indicated, individuals can track their applications on the system.  The Garda Vetting Bureau works with registered organisations on an ongoing basis to maintain quality and standards in respect of the process.  The Garda authorities continue to work with other registered organisations to bring them on board.  There have been significant improvements and many resources have been put into the system.  The report we have received from the Garda authorities shows that the system is working.  I thank the Senator for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important matter today.</p></speech>

Once again, I am raising the matter of the upgrading and building of the M20 motorway between Limerick and Cork.  I am a public representative, representing Limerick city and a portion of the county.  It is the single biggest item of infrastructure that needs to be completed in the State.  I have raised this issue with the Minister on numerous occasions, including on 16 June last, and I know he has an interest in the matter.</p><p>There will be a mid-term review of the capital plan next year but before that happens, I hope the project will have received the go-ahead.  It is a large and important project and I ask that the planning process be restarted before the review.  When the project was suspended in November 2011, the planning process had, in the main, been completed as far as An Bord Plean&aacute;la level.  This project can be reactivated.  A lot of the work can be done prior to the mid-term review in 2017 and no time would be lost.</p><p>The planning process will involve Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, recruiting engineers and consultants to review the project.  Under public procurement rules, that will take a number of months.  There would be no cost to the State until they are in place.  I seek a practical measure to restart the project and move it forward.  </p><p>The mid-term review will consider giving the full green light to the building of the project but what I propose would provide us with, dare I say it, a flashing amber light.  It would allow us to proceed, get the work done in preparation for the mid-term review and lose no time.</p><p>There are a number of reasons the M20 motorway is important.  The first is that the most recent environmental impact study done by TII states that the benefits will outweigh the costs by more than two to one.  Second, there are significant benefits in terms of time.  At the moment, it takes well over 1.5 hours, or longer at peak times, to commute between Limerick and Cork - there is no certainty.  The M20 would take 40 minutes off the journey time at peak times and would provide certainty.  The third issue is safety.  There have been fatalities along the existing N20 over the past number of years.  Recently, on the small section of the M20 that has been built outside Limerick towards Patrickswell, there have, unfortunately, been fatalities.</p><p>The damage this delay is doing to connectivity and competitiveness in the region makes it imperative that the project goes ahead.  In terms of balanced regional development, Dublin is doing very well but for Ireland to progress as a country, we must have balance around the regions.  We need a counterpole to Dublin.  The Galway to Tuam route is being completed.  People will be able to commute between Galway and Limerick in a relatively short period of time.  We need to ensure that people can do likewise from Limerick to Cork.</p><p>Synergies would be provided for Ireland internationally in terms of attracting foreign direct investment.  People in my area are commuting daily to Cork and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are a small country and need connectivity.  I ask the Minister to restart the planning process and allow consultants to be recruited by TII in advance of the normal mid-term review of the capital plan in mid-2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016100600002#B00700"><p>I would like to thank the Senator for once again raising this issue.  I agree with him and he continuously makes a strong case.  The only argument against the project is one with which he will be familiar, namely, that we do not have the money.  The case for the road, which he has made on grounds not just of safety but also benefits to the economy of the region, is one with which I am sympathetic.  It would be compelling if we could write a cheque for &euro;800 million.  The problem is that we cannot.  Perhaps I could explain a few things to the Senator about the current situation and then address the particular issue he raised about planning.</p> <p>I would like to thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this matter again.  I note that the Senator was given a briefing by my Department on the current position regarding the M20 yesterday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is not a criticism but an indication of the persistence with which he is pursuing this project, which is fair enough.</p><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects are matters for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly known as the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts, 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects are matters, in the first instance, for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  Ireland has just under 100,000 kms of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads place a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure in recent years.  For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes such as the M20 project.</p><p>The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in the Department's strategic investment framework for land transport.  This report highlighted the importance of the maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure, together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the road network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.  Allowing for the commitments relating to public private partnership projects, the balance available for new projects in the available capital envelope was limited.</p><p>The transport element of the capital plan did provide for some targeted investment in a number of new projects in the Munster region, including the N8 and N25 Dunkettle interchange and the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom schemes.  In addition, a number of other schemes, targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence, subject to development consent.  They include the Mallow relief road, the Adare bypass and the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road projects.  It was not possible to include the M20 project in the capital plan as the scale of investment required to deliver it as originally proposed, estimated at &euro;800 million, was not affordable.  That investment could take up almost all of the moneys provided for new roads projects in the capital plan period.</p><p>We are all conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the Government system, including in meeting capital investment needs.  As part of A Programme for a Partnership Government, there is an increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services, but the Government still has to operate within EU fiscal rules, which does constrain options.  As the Senator pointed out, there will be a mid-term review of the capital plan which will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment, depending on economic growth.</p><p>Since the capital plan was published, there has been significant interest, led by the Senator, in finding a means to at least restart planning work on the M20 project.  I understand from the Senator there was recent press coverage on the issue.  I am aware that the Cork to Limerick motorway represents a significant section of the Atlantic corridor, which was intended to promote development of the region.  As matters stand, however, I do not have the funding available to progress this scheme to restart the planning process.  I do expect though that the M20 Cork to Limerick motorway project will be looked at in the planned mid-term review of the capital plan.</p></speech>

In November 2011 the project was suspended.  From discussions with officials, I understand that at that stage the bulk of the planning process, if not the entire process, had been completed and that the project was just about to be referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Will the Minister allow the planning process to re-engage, which would amount to nothing more than TII recruiting engineers and consultants to engage in an overall review of the project?  An economic benefit analysis could be incorporated into the review which would be good value for money for the taxpayer.  Will the Minister consider this rather than look at the planning and building of the project in the mid-term review?  There should be due diligence as part of an economic cost benefit analysis.  I accept that this is an enormous project, but it would also yield enormous benefits.  The Minister has a background in seeking value for taxpayers' money.

I am not aware of the stage in the planning process the project had reached at the time, but I accept what the Senator says that it was near completion.  I do not want him to have a forlorn hope that the project will go ahead, if that is not true.  That would be dishonest and unhelpful.  If what he has said is correct - I have no reason not to believe him - I could contact TII to ask what the position was and to ask it to look at the matter and report back to me.  I can give the Senator a commitment that I will do this, on condition that he does not take any such approach to the TII as a green light for the project to go ahead.</p></speech>

I have not spoken to him about this issue in the Seanad, but the Minister of State has been here.  </p> <p>The issue I am raising is the transfer of lands for the redevelopment of the national rehabilitation service facility on Rochestown Avenue in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, in respect of which there is huge expectation, as there have been three false starts.  There appear, however, to be a number of complications.  I am a former member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council which was involved in rezoning a substantial strip of land to facilitate the development of neighbouring facilities and the hospital.  This increased the value of the land and there was an expectation that some of it would be sold and part of the money ring-fenced for the facility.  There now appears to be a suggestion there were difficulties with the religious order in question - the Sisters of Mercy.  I acknowledge the enormous work done by the Sisters of Mercy, the board of management of the hospital and the doctors and staff at every level who face enormous difficulties in their work.  The place I took the time to visit two weeks ago is unfit for purpose.  It is a disgrace and an indictment of the health service.</p> <p>I am reliably advised that more than 200 patients in acute beds throughout the country are waiting to get into the hospital.  I also understand there is a waiting list of in excess of 80 patients to access day services in the facility.  This is the national rehabilitation hospital.  The service is stretched, but the new facility will not be what it was originally meant to be.  It was announced with great fanfare by the previous Government.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was present, as was former Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to announce great plans for the place.  I understand, however, that there were setbacks and financial considerations which limited the scope of the development.</p> <p>We need to go back in time slightly.  I do not want to give a history lesson, but we know from documents that in 1961 a trust was set up with the then health authorities, the Sisters of Mercy and the facility.  The facility was to be used entirely to provide rehabilitation services.  Will the Minister look at the conditions under which the trust was established to see how they affected the lands?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Has there been any progress since the previous Minister was in here in sorting out the land issue?

I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p></speech>

I know he has a long-standing interest in, and knowledge of, it from his time on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  This is a project of major importance.  It is one of the reasons I wanted to be here myself to deal with this matter.  We need to see the development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH.  I welcome the opportunity Senator Boyhan has provided me with to outline the current position with regard to this major capital development.  I agree with his analysis of the situation that while there is currently incredible care, attention and amazing patient outcomes in that hospital that are really benefitting people, the current building is simply not fit for purpose.  It is not fair to patients or to the staff.</p> <p>I am pleased to advise the Senator that the HSE has informed me that it has instructed its solicitors on the transfer of lands at the NRH campus.  The HSE has indicated to me that the transfer of lands could be completed by year end.  The current status of the project is as follows.  Procurement of the works contractor has commenced.  Submissions have been received from interested contractors and these are currently being evaluated.  The selected contractors will be invited to tender next month, November 2016, and it would be expected that the completed tenders should be returned in January 2017.  Following evaluation of these tenders it is projected that construction will commence in quarter 1 of next year.  Some enabling works, as the Senator will probably be aware from his visit there, have been contracted separately and will commence in quarter four of this year.</p></speech>

I really think it would be helpful.  It would add impetus if he could visit in the next few months, although I know that he is a busy Minister.  I have two issues.  We know that the congregation that owns this property is a signatory to an indemnity scheme under the Residential Institutions Redress Board and has offered lands.  It is one of a number of religious orders that made offers of lands under the Conference of Religious of Ireland and an agreement was signed by its superior general, of which I have a copy on my desk.  I ask the Minister to raise with this congregation its moral obligations to surrender or hand over lands to the State as per an agreement with the State.  This is a very important issue.</p> <p>I do not believe it is right or proper that any land surrounding this hospital is sold.  The Minister clearly identified in his own report to us that all we are talking about is a new 120 replacement bed ward.  There is no additional capacity being provided.  There is a suggestion locally that some of this land may be up for sale.  That leads me to my final point.  I ask the Minister to investigate a trust that was established in the early 1960s, under this religious congregation and the health authorities, in terms of its commitment.  Within the kernel of that trust and the commitments under the Residential Institutions Redress Board, I think the Minister will find that there are opportunities for the State and for the hospital and, ultimately, to have a state-of-the-facility that will not cost the State as much as the Minister might think.</p></speech>

It is something I have wanted to do for a while.  I have been there in a personal rather than an official capacity on a number of occasions but I would welcome the opportunity to officially visit and meet with staff, management and patients there.  I will arrange for that to happen in the coming weeks.  Until I have established the facts, it is not something on which I wish to comment on the record but the point the Senator made about the offer of lands and the trust is a very important one.  To be very clear, I expect any organisation that has signed an agreement to provide lands to absolutely fulfil that agreement to the letter and the spirit of it.  I will ask the HSE to examine it and I will revert to the Senator on that.</p> <p>The point the Senator makes is fair.  What we are doing is progressing the development of the NRH.  However, this should not be the end of the plans to develop.  There is significant potential and scope to do more.  My priority is to get on with the process of putting in place a 120 replacement bed ward block which will provide much better facilities for the staff and the patients.  It will lead to better patient outcomes and further dignity for patients who spend an awful lot of time there and deserve a much more modern fit-for-purpose building.  It will also provide a sports hall, a hydrotherapy unit and an ability to provide support therapies from a paediatric rehabilitation position that are not currently supplied.</p> <p>I agree with the Deputy that this is a major capital project and we need to get it under way.  I have outlined to the House the timeline for that.  We then need to be more ambitious as well and ask, "What next?".  This hospital carries out work that transforms lives and gives people back their lives.  It is a project that we should constantly be adding to.  I see this capital project as a very important step but not the finality in terms of the potential of the hospital.</p></speech>

I know that the Leader will address the issues we have raised, including corporate manslaughter, the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 which he has placed on the Order Paper for debate on 19 October and the Bill tabled by my colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, dealing with the registration of wills.  We have tabled quite a number of Bills, as have other parties, which could be taken in the House.  I know that statements are valuable but legislation is also important.</p> <p>Next week we will discuss the budget.  The very disturbing case of Kifca McNamee from County Meath who has a neurodegenerative disorder was mentioned on the news last night and is in the public domain.  She had received assistance for 30 hours, but this figure was cut to 19 hours.  She works for the local authorithy in County Meath local and while at work she had received assistance for three hours, but this was cut to 30 minutes, a drop of 83%.  She can no longer go out socially and no longer receives physiotherapy.  She lives at home with her father, sister and niece.  She is not the only one who has been affected, but she is a clear example of how the system works.  If Kifca does not receive the assistance she used to receive-----</p></speech>

I ask that Kifca and all those who are seeing the number of hours being cut receive assistance instead of facing the grim alternative of being placed in care for the rest of their lives.  That is not how we should treat citizens in this day and age.</p> <p>The issue of insurance has arisen again.  The State Claims Agency has exposed the insurance companies and the lies they have been telling us about the cost of claims and the level of compensation increasing, as a result of which they are charging more.  Since the beginning of year, the cost of insurance has increased by 28%.  In the past 12 months it has increased by 34% and since 2014 by 60%.  In 2014, according to the records we have available, the amount paid out in compensation to claimants decreased by 36%.  We have price gouging by the insurance companies which are profiteering in hiking up insurance premiums.  People are going out of business as a result.  It is highly unacceptable that the insurance companies seem to be acting as a collective in pushing up premiums.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There have also been cases of insurance companies suspending and eliminating life cover or cover for critical illnesses.  Critical illness cover refers to five illnesses, including cancer.  In one case highlighted yesterday people who had been paying premiums for critical illness cover for ten years were told by a company that cover was being discontinued from November and that they should contact other companies.  This is another form of price gouging and profiteering by the insurance industry.  People who need cover for peace of mind are having it withdrawn by insurance companies.</p><p>We also have the sudden disappearance from the market of insurance companies established in other jurisdictions, for example, Setanta Insurance, which disappeared overnight, leaving 14,000 people without insurance and policyholders left to pick up the tab.  </p><p>Banking is another financial sector which is subject to regulation and appears to be doing its own thing and profiteering.  Ultimately, citizens are losing out and businesses are being affected.  People are driving without insurance.  By law, the 2.2 million drivers in the State must have insurance.  We force them to have it and they should have it, but we are not giving them the protection they require.  The Leader has organised debates on this issue before.  The State Claims Agency has exposed the fact that insurance companies are not paying out nearly as much as they claim to be.  The Government must take action on this issue.</p></speech>

There are more than 40,000 volunteers in youth work agencies and organisations which do tremendous work with young people.  Given the improvements in the economy, this area should receive particular attention, although I accept that money is not available for everything.  I would appreciate it, however, if the Minister were to make provision to increase funding for youth work because the value for money received transcends the ratio of return on each euro invested.  Youth work has an immeasurable value in communities.</p> <p>Elderly people more than shared the burden during the economic downturn and must pay many charges.  The elimination of the telephone allowance has caused considerable difficulty for them, especially those who live alone.  The Government should listen to the request to have the allowance restored, even if it is done in two budgets.  One is reminded of the great posters put up by Age Action Ireland with the message that old age is not a problem but loneliness is.  It is critically important for people's mental and social well-being that they have the ability to make a telephone call without worrying about the cost and  stay in touch with their family who are often far-flung and, in the case of those do not have many surviving family members, their neighbours.  </p> <p>I plead to the Minister for Health to reduce the prescription charge and ensure sufficient funding is made available for mental health services, an issue which affects people across the country. </p></speech>

I was elected to the Seanad on the Agriculture Panel.  The horticultural and food sector is in crisis.  Two major mushroom growers have closed in recent weeks.  The programme for Government features only four sentences on horticulture.  It includes a commitment to the Origin Green initiative and refers, on page 113, to the Food Wise 2025 policy and, more importantly, Bord Bia's excellent strategy for the period 2016 to 2018.  The strategy covers only a short period, however, given that we are approaching the end of 2016.</p> <p>I recently took time to visit north County Dublin, an area with great potential where a large amount of organic produce is grown.  Bord Bia has been very successful in the area of organic produce and the Origin Green initiative.  This is, however, becoming more and more difficult, with the mushroom trade crumbling in recent weeks and months.  I will not take up Senators' time by speaking about all of the factors involved.  However, there is a crisis in organics and horticulture.  Surely this area has potential for employment creation and we should provide more training in horticulture.  I use the word "horticulture" because it tends to be lumped into the broader remit of agriculture with meat, poultry production and other sectors.  The horticulture sector offers enormous potential, particularly given the demand for organic produce.  We must tie it in with the strategy and principles of Origin Green.  We must look at this and support sustainable development on the land.  We must support farmers who may be interested in moving from livestock to organics.</p> <p>I agree with the former Minister and chairman of the Fine Gael Party, Senator James Reilly, on the restoration of the telephone allowance.  The Senator carries much weight in his party and I would be terribly disappointed if the change proposed is not made in the budget.  It must be made because people in urban and rural areas are living in isolation.  The simple measure of giving them back a telephone is a very practical, reasonable, fair and appropriate response.  I ask that this issue be raised and look forward to-----</p></speech>

I draw attention to comments made by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, at the Tory Party conference yesterday.  It is ironic that at the time the Seanad was discussing the implications of Brexit for Ireland, the leader of the UK party that had created the crisis was dictating how the process would be managed.  I emphasise the lack of action taken by the Government on some of the issues that are coming to light.  The Prime Minister's speech took a sinister turn when she claimed that she would no longer allow members of the British army to be hounded by left-wing lawyers.  This is a chilling and veiled threat, given that the British state murdered Pat Finucane, a human rights lawyer in Belfast.  All Senators will agree that the work of lawyers, especially those dedicated to the protection of human rights, must remain independent and free from harassment and threats from those who are ideologically opposed to fundamental human rights.  I hope the Government will make it clear to the Prime Minister that whatever plan she has for England's exit from the European Union, there can be no rowing back on human rights legislation that was hard fought for over many years and in negotiations.</p><p>I note an article on<i>thejournal.ie </i>this morning which draws attention to comments made by the Home Secretary, Ms Amber Rudd, in which she proposed that UK companies hand the government a list of all foreign workers employed by them in a plan designed to ensure British workers would be given preference in creating new jobs.  While the full details of the plan have yet to be published, the measures are believed to be designed to include all non-British workers, including citizens of European Union member states such as the Republic of Ireland.  This flies in the face of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, described last night as our special relationship with Britain.  It will certainly be of concern to Irish people working in Britain. </p><p>On the issue of whistleblowers, the Protected Disclosures Act was hard fought for.  As well as protecting those who make protected disclosures, there was a general expectation that there would be a change in culture towards those who made such disclosures.  Thankfully, most people believe those who make disclosures are performing a civic and patriotic duty.  I hope others in authority will allow due process and not hinder or harass those who have made disclosures in a perfectly legal manner.  Those who would discredit or harass people who make disclosures are the law-breakers and it is their actions that are repugnant to the laws of the State.  It is noticeable that the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, appears to have run for cover on the issues that have come to light in recent days.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should come to the House to debate the implementation of whistleblower legislation and the manner in which whistleblowers are being treated.  The purpose of the Act is to protect them rather than those who may seek to quieten their voices.  I hope we will have such a debate in short order.</p></speech>

Friedreich's ataxia is called a progressive condition, but really what it does is weasel its way into every fibre of a person's body and takes him or her down.  As a young person in her teens, she had expectations, like anyone would, even if they were only the ones her parents would want for her, but they were expectations of a half-decent life.  She has had to deal with all those compromises and she and her family have had to take it on the chin.  What is absolutely unacceptable is, as has already been said, a cut of almost half in what was already an inadequate amount of personal support hours.  The three hours she had to help her stay at work were cut to 30 minutes.  She talked about the consequential pain and anxiety she has regarding personal hygiene and toileting issues when she is at work, when she does not have that support.  None of us need to come into this House or go on television to talk about our toileting needs, our ebbs and flows or our movements, but that is what someone felt she had to do in public last night.</p> <p>There is no recovery for people with disabilities or their families.  There is a continuation of the many cuts, and that, I am sad to say, is the fact and the reality.  Last week I made comments to the Taoiseach here.  I asked for confirmation that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, would be ratified by the end of this year.  I asked - not as a special plea - that the budget prioritise something to make sure that Ireland has a decent infrastructure for all of us and all our loved ones.  I said that, of the modest amount of money available to him, &euro;300 million would be a decent start to that.  The Taoiseach said he will meet me, and that meeting will take place.  He did not confirm that that legislation would be passed by the end of this year.  That needs to be dealt with, as does the fact that he suggested to me afterwards that the &euro;300 million will not be there.  If it is, it is; if it is not, it is not.  We will know on Tuesday.  However, the bottom line is that people with disabilities - 600,000 people and their families - will continue to be on the wrong side of the recovery.</p></speech>

In that budget the Labour Party sets out its desire to invest in public services, support families and clearly stamp out our ground regarding child care: the provision of child care at a maximum cost of &euro;4.25 per hour for children up to 12 years of age.  Our budget also seeks to index link all social welfare payments and to raise wages for working people to a living wage.</p> <p>That brings me on to my second point.  I call on the Leader to request that the Minister for agriculture come to the House for a debate on the horse racing industry.  The future of the industry is in crisis.  In saying that, I congratulate another Tipperary man - at least, we adopted him - Aidan O'Brien, for training the first three runners home in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe last Sunday in Paris.  However, the reality is that trainers such as David Wachman, Colm Murphy and other small trainers cannot compete and are leaving the industry.</p> <p>On the other side of the coin is the reappointment of the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, which is totally in breach of public policy.  In addition, the Irish Stable Staff Association, headed up by general secretary, Bernard Caldwell, is trying to fight a cause for staff who are expected to work for &euro;9.75 per hour.  If they go away to a race meeting, for example, from Tipperary to Ballinrobe, from which they may get home at 1 a.m., they will get &euro;40 extra.  This is unsustainable.  People are leaving the industry and we need a debate on the issue urgently.  I ask the Leader to organise such a debate.</p> <p>I also raise a flag on behalf of one of the submission groups for the budget, namely, the Irish Wheelchair Association, representatives of which we met last week in this House.  I will raise just one issue that struck me very deeply.  One of the people who was with us was wheelchair-bound, and in order for her to get a train from Mayo to Dublin, she must inform Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann a week in advance, otherwise she cannot get on or off the train.  I ask that in this budget that single issue be addressed on behalf of the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p> <p>Finally, I support wholeheartedly Senator O'Reilly regarding the restoration of the telephone allowance.</p></speech>

The date on which farmers will no longer be allowed to spread slurry, 15 October, is fast approaching, but I am receiving increasing communications from farmers and agricultural contractors who have not had an opportunity to spread slurry at all this year on account of waterlogged lands.  It is no secret that we in the west have been particularly afflicted.  Faced with the prospect of trying to do so between now and 15 October, it is neither feasible nor tenable, and unless an extension is provided, we face the possibility of overflowing slurry tanks, which would pose their own environmental hazard.  I call on the Minister for the environment to take the necessary steps in this regard.</p><p>I ask that the sports capital grant be introduced and that it be weighted in favour of rural areas.  In these rural areas people find it very hard to raise matching funds - or indeed to raise funds at all.  There have been great benefits under the previous rounds of sports capital funds that really allow rural communities to thrive and, in particular, to have young people participate in sports and youth development.  I was particularly struck by an item published on <i>balls.ie</i>in which the serious disparity in expenditure of the GAA's development money was highlighted, with most of it going towards the development of sports in Dublin.  While this is an internal matter for the GAA, it shows that in the more rural areas and other counties, this investment is not taking place, notwithstanding the fact that the Sports Council puts &euro;1 million of taxpayers' money into the GAA every year.</p><p>I have worked with a number of the GAA groups in my county and have helped them secure sports capital funding.  They are very committed and they do a fantastic job as volunteers in every parish in this country, but along with other sporting organisations, especially in rural Ireland, they need that extra help to make sports facilities a reality.  I ask that the sports capital grant be reopened and weighted in favour of rural areas.</p></speech>

RTE, as a public service broadcaster, has a responsibility to cover and report on issues of national significance.  Last night in this Chamber we had an excellent debate on CETA and TTIP, two international trade agreements whose terms were negotiated secretly.  The public of Europe were kept away from the negotiations and their view was not entertained.  Under these proposed agreements the direction of policy will largely be handed over to multinational corporations and this is a matter of concern.  I put two items on the record yesterday.  One was about Argentina, where they secured a subsidiary of Enron to provide water services.  The company, however, provided filthy, undrinkable water at outrageous prices.  When the Argentinian Government took action to reduce the price and produce drinkable water for its citizens, the court held against it and fined it millions of pounds.  In the case of Slovakia, public interest and public good were held to be less significant than the profits of a company.  What kind of standards or morality is this?  The motion was tabled by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins and it was a very passionate debate.</p></speech>

It is an interesting report that raises a large number of relevant points.  Poor communication is central and fundamental to SMEs.  When SMEs were asked what the main barriers were to their getting online, 21% said poor connection was one.  In recent months business owners have brought to my attention the fact that the greatest obstacle to doing business is not having a proper mobile phone signal.  During the Seanad election we would all have seen that, in certain areas of the country, there were no mobile signals whatsoever.  In my own constituency, which is really a suburb of Dublin with towns such as Kildalkey, Kilmessan, Longwood, Clonard, Ballivor, Enfield and Oldcastle, there are no mobile phone signals whatsoever.  The bigger cities may not be affected but business is not confined to the bigger cities.  I call on the Minister to call to task the mobile phone operators who, month after month, take the hard-earned money of the people and businesses of Ireland for what can only be described as a disgraceful service.</p> <p>I ask for clarity on what mobile phone operators mean by "unlimited"?  We all sign up to contracts and pay &euro;50 or &euro;75 per month and, with a population of 4.5 million, that is a lot of payments of &euro;50 or &euro;75 per month but the bill can go up after six, nine or 12 months.  We want legislation on what "unlimited" means in terms of mobile and broadband services because it is a rip-off as compared to other countries.  We should bring in legislation to provide that if mobile phone service providers do not provide country-wide services their licences should not be granted or renewed.</p></speech>

This issue is not about party political lines and is certainly not an issue for scoring political points.  Our families and communities cannot wait for this service any longer.  We have spoken and spoken and spoken <i>ad nauseam</i>on this issue and for far too long.  The stark reality of the non-provision of this service is that our citizens, in every town, village and city across the State, are taking their lives and there simply is not an adequate 24/7 support service to help these people, who present at all times of the day or night, to deal with their suicidal thoughts and with the unbearable mental anguish they suffer.  Both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il put forward amendments to Sinn F&eacute;in's motion.  The Fine Gael amendment notes the need for a 24-hour service but provides no meaningful commitment.  It also commits to increasing investment.</p></speech>

The timeline for seven-day services is far too long and the non-committal of Government is deeply worrying.  Members of this House and the D&aacute;il should not stand back and allow this to continue.  Our citizens are dying and are crying and begging for help.</p> <p>I welcome the Green Party initiative on mental well-being in our schools.  Young people and the new generation will see the stigma removed with mental well-being a top priority.  I am appealing to all Senators to talk to colleagues and urge them to vote "Yes" to the motion, without amendments, in the D&aacute;il debate at lunch time.

Unfortunately, the facility in the hospital is not yet built.  While it is due in 2017, it still at construction phase.  What happened in respect of reconfiguration in the middle of the last decade involved putting the cart before the horse.  It was announced in Clare this morning that Shannondoc, which is the out-of-hours GP service, is being dramatically scaled back.  The out-of-hours service in Ennistymon and Kilrush will be amalgamated into one facility in Milltown Malbay.  While services will continue in Ennistymon and Kilrush at weekends, this is certainly a significant blow in terms of providing doctor cover at weekends.  </p><p>I call on the Minister for Health to make a statement setting out his views regarding the reduction in Shannondoc services.  What does he propose to do about it?  I also call on him to carry out a review of the service provided by Shannondoc in Clare over the past number of years.  It is my contention that it provides a very important service and its presence in County Clare is extremely important.  If people from Loop Head find themselves in difficulty, are they now expected to go to Milltown Malbay to see a doctor when until now, they could have gone to Kilrush?  It is not appropriate or acceptable and the Minister needs to intervene.  My understanding is that there is an issue with retaining doctors, particularly to do the red-eye shifts.  I want the Minister to give his views on this and to review it urgently.</p></speech>

There are many competing priorities and everyone, including economists and lobbyists, will have different opinions.  One area that was referred to today should be the first port of call for attention in next week's budget, namely, people with disabilities.  Senators John Dolan and Mark Daly raised the issue.  We heard about the situation in County Meath yesterday but that is only one case.  People living with disabilities who are challenged on an hourly basis, some of whom are in chronic pain, should be the first point of any additional support from the recovery in our economy.  There is a commitment on the programme for a partnership Government.  The Minister of State for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has given a commitment that legislation to give to effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be passed before the end of the year and I hope that this happens.  In addition to that, funding is required to give effect to the legislation and to support the convention.</p> <p>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in agus an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh ag Buan-choiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.

I wanted to welcome that but, unfortunately, I became involved in a local issue in the Seanad.  This agreement is of huge significance and is something for which we must congratulate all the parties involved.  I know the work that is being done on the ground, which is incredible.  When issues arise, we have cameras and television crews highlighting all that is negative but this is very positive.  One man I want to thank is Fr. Gary Donegan from Holy Cross Church.  He has worked every evening for many years to ensure that outbreaks of hostility do not occur.  It was very depressing to see how he was verbally attacked by people who were very upset, which I can understand.  I see now that a man has been arrested for making threats to a journalist and that the matter has gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We must ensure that nobody can threaten journalists in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  I will not comment further but I think this is a hugely significant moment and I thank all the people, organisations and political parties involved in reaching this agreement.</p> <p>We are very concerned about flooding on the River Shannon.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Canney, will today announce confirmations of water levels with the various bodies.  A lot of work has been done behind the scenes by various groups, including the local authorities, Bord na M&oacute;na and many local groups with small remedial schemes.  I believe they will be very helpful.  I am not sure about one area.  I need to be convinced that the ESB is fully living up to its responsibilities.  The ESB needs to come on board with regard to Lough Allen and outline exactly what it intends to do because there has been far too much subterfuge and it has not worked effectively with the local community.  I have already spoken to the Minister of State.  He must meet with it and local communities to address this issue.  </p></speech>

When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was here yesterday, I referenced Modeling Irish Reunification, a major piece of research commissioned by the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, into the economics of Irish unity.  That report has had some limited coverage in this State over recent months since its publication.  The author, Dr. Karl Hubner, is in the city today and will be briefing members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement at 2.30 p.m., so I would encourage Members who are available to come and avail of the opportunity to engage with Dr. Hubner and his research, particularly in light of the issues that have been consistently raised here since the Brexit vote.  We must actively pursue and explore every option open to us.  I think everybody in this House agrees that, ultimately, the best option for our people both North and South is the reunification of our country and this paper has identified the very tangible economic and income benefits that would come from that.</p> <p>Ba mhaith liom fosta tr&aacute;cht iontach gasta a dh&eacute;anamh ar an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill.

They were told unceremoniously yesterday afternoon that their jobs were gone.  I am concerned about the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland funding invested in the company.  What are the implications?  Is that funding lost?  I am also concerned about the number of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland visits to County Longford, which is suffering quite badly at the moment.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, would come to the House to address the issue of what happens to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland funding if a company pulls out.  This company has pulled out its manufacturing and taken it elsewhere because it can get it cheaper.  It is devastating for County Longford.</p> <p>I support what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said about Conradh na Gaeilge and the c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge, which are very important.

I will be proud to share a platform with Jeremy Corbyn who has always been a friend to Ireland and a friend to the peace process in particular.</p> <p>This week something very strange happened.  Shannonwatch, which has done amazing work in detailing what is happening in Shannon Airport, had been planning a conference to mark 15 years of the US military occupation of the airport.  Three hotels accepted the booking and then subsequently cancelled the booking, leaving it without a venue on Saturday.  This speaks to the issue of silence regarding Shannon Airport.  There is awkward silence.  It is as if the Government knows it is complicit and completely wrong to support the US military adventures in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, which have caused so many deaths, but it just does not want to talk about it.  We need to talk about it.  It is an absolute disgrace that our neutrality has been shamed in this way for 15 years.</p></speech>

I understand that the overwhelming majority of homes in the south west of Haiti have been affected with tens of thousands of people in shelters.  Hospitals are overflowing.

Requests continue for government help in transporting those whose homes have been devastated, many of whom live in poverty-stricken conditions.</p> <p>In February, my colleague asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make a statement on the growing unrest following demonstrations and protests in Haiti after the postponement of the presidential election.

It is 7.20 a.m. there as we speak and the hurricane continues to gain strength after being somewhat weakened by mountainous terrain in Cuba.</p> <p>I am sure I speak for all sides of the House when I send condolences to and express solidarity with those injured, and the loved ones and the communities of those killed.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, should urgently assess the situation and determine if Ireland can play a part in assisting in the humanitarian crisis.  We urgently need to provide for that.</p></speech>

He was a Member of the other House and, as a senior Minister, held many portfolios.  I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his wife, Phyllis, and their family.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism to come to the House.  Our tourism industry is very important to the country.  Much has been said about agriculture and tourism.  The weaker sterling is having a severe effect on tourism, regardless of the Brexit outcome.  The Minister of State with responsibility for tourism should come to the House to explain the plans Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have.  The tourism market in Northern Ireland and the UK is very important to this country.  They represent the biggest group of visitors to Ireland and we appreciate that business.  It would be important to hear their plans for the tourism industry.</p></speech>

They presented their pre-budget submission yesterday.  They are governed by the Family Resource Centre National Forum, their representative body.  As somebody who managed a community development project, I know at first hand the valuable work done by these centres to combat disadvantage, and strengthen and empower children, families and communities.  It is vital that this work is underpinned and given the appropriate resources.</p> <p>They are operating on a budget of &euro;12.2 million, but to do the work they need to do, they need &euro;16 million, which is not much more.  The funding body is Tusla.  The budget for the family resource centres represents only 2% of the entire Tusla budget.  Some 20% of these projects are at risk of closing and many staff across the family resource centres have been put on notice.  That is not good either for the staff involved or for the people they serve.  The issue needs to be addressed immediately.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Health to come to the House to have a discussion around the excellent value for money these family resource centres deliver on the ground in their communities in the areas of domestic violence and mental health, and on many other issues which help families and communities which have suffered as a result of the under-resourcing of the mental health budget and the non-implementation of A Vision for Change.  These centres are at the coal-face and need to be funded and resourced.  We cannot have staff in family resource centres who are operating on their own.  There are real health and safety issues involved and I would appreciate it if the Minister would come in to discuss this.</p></speech>

It has been flagged for the past month and my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, had raised the issue of these jobs, which was also covered in the local newspapers in recent weeks.  We have talked about Brexit ad nauseam but this shows one of the repercussions.  While the 170 jobs lost might not be directly linked to Brexit, it played a very influential part in their loss.</p> <p>I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to address the issue.  It is another blow for the midlands.  We discussed the Imperial Tobacco factory in Mullingar only recently.  There seem to be continual blows to general manufacturing in the midlands.  I appreciate having the time to raise this issue in the House.  We all have to pull together to try to sustain what jobs we can, and this is particularly important in areas outside the M50 belt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-06a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016100600002#N00300"><p>I thank Senators for raising many important issues.  Obviously, the area of health and disability has dominated this morning, with Senators Mark Daly, James Reilly, Victor Boyhan, John Dolan, M&aacute;ire Devine, Rose Conway-Walsh, Martin Conway, Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Colm Burke raising the matter.</p> <p>With regard to the news item last night, those of us who were involved in the disability sector will recognise that what is happening in this case is incorrect, wrong, morally reprehensible and should not be happening.  I have asked the Minister to come back to Senator John Dolan and Mark Daly on the matter.</p> <p>The issue of home care packages is important, as are the points made by Senator Colm Burke on the fact we have an aging population.  In the area of disability, particularly in terms of congregated settings, there are profound emerging needs and, as people get older, those needs become more complex.  That needs to be reflected in the overall health budget.  Equally, as we would all agree and as Senator M&aacute;ire Devine said, it is not a political issue; it is about ensuring there is a sequence and a continuation of policy through a cross-departmental approach, whether in terms of social protection, housing, health or education.  This means we can ensure, as we move towards congregated settings, that there is support in the community and that people are looked after and receive home care, respite care and personal support hours.  It is important, as we move into the community, that we recognise the health budget is about ensuring there is a continuum.</p> <p>This is something we might look at again.  As I said to Senator Dolan in regard to the Seanad consultative forum, this is perhaps an issue we can deal with in that we can bring in people and put the pressure on the Government, no matter who is in government, to ensure policy has an overarching emphasis.  The HSE service plan sets aside &euro;330 million for issues like home care packages, including intensive home care packages.  Whether it is in regard to the elderly or the disabled, it is important provision is made for home care packages.  Equally, the issue of respite care also needs to be addressed in the budget.</p> <p>With regard to legislation, the Bill is on the Government's A-list for publication and has gone to Committee on Justice and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is critical that it is signed by the end of the year.  We have asked the Department to initiate the Bill in this House and I have already met Senator Dolan in this regard.  With regard to the other comment on legislation, it is my hope we will have time slots for two Private Members' Bills this session; it is a matter for the CPP and I hope it will be done.</p> <p>The issue of the insurance sector is very important.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is chairing the task force and Deputy John McGuinness is chair of the finance committee.  I hope they will take on board the views Senator Mark Daly has raised regarding the State Claims Agency because that is an interesting revelation, if I can put it like that.</p> <p>Senator James Reilly raised the issue of youth work.  It is important we have the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to the House along with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I agree with the Senator that the value we get from youth work can be seen not only in monetary terms but also in terms of the tangible benefits for young people.  I commend all those involved in the youth work sector, who do huge work.</p> <p>Senators Victor Boyhan and Michelle Mulherin raised the issue of agriculture.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will come to the House on 25 October, when we can discuss the matters raised.  The matter raised by Senator Mulherin regarding the deadline for slurry spreading has been raised by other Senators, and I hope the Minister will take those points on board.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of human rights and linked it to the Pat Finucane case.  The Senator is right that this was hard fought for and should not be diluted in any shape or form, and I do not think any of us would stand for that.</p> <p>With regard to the issue of the remarks at the Tory conference this week, some of them are extraordinary.  If we are talking about Brexit, that is fine, but as the country that will suffer the most profound impact from that decision, it is important that we have that special relationship and that the British Government recognises we are the people who will be most affected.  However, when we hear Ministers say the NHS will be run by English people only, we must wonder what planet we are living on.  It cannot happen and it should not happen.</p></speech>

We have seen the NHS people coming over here to run advertising campaigns.  Our nurses and doctors go over to England and are then able to come back here, having benefited from the experience.  To be fair to the Taoiseach and Ministers, there is a very strong Brexit team and operation across the whole of the Government.  As part of a rolling debate in this House, I hope we will continue to keep that emphasis going.</p> <p>With regard to the Senator's comment on the Garda whistleblower and the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner in her statement yesterday said she was not privy to any attempt or was not aware of anyone targeting the whistleblower.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Taoiseach have been very strong on this.  There is no derogation or dilution of Government in terms of its approach being that the allegations are serious and should be listened to.  The Minister is proactive in the matter and has said she will apply the rule of law and that it should be applied, and that a just and real procedure should be put in place.  It is important that we listen to the remarks she made yesterday in the justice committee and the Taoiseach's remarks in the D&aacute;il, and that whatever allegations are made are followed up.</p></speech>

I do not listen to the programme or watch it every night.  I will get somebody to watch the programme.  It is important.  The point the Senator made is relevant.  We are the Upper House and the second Chamber of the Oireachtas.  If the programme covers committees and the D&aacute;il, it should also cover proceedings here.  I have said before that we need to give programmes a reason to cover us.  The problem is that the programme is broadcast late at night but the recording is done early in the day.  Perhaps RTE could examine how it covers the Oireachtas and we will take the matter up with it.</p> <p>Senator Butler raised the issue of small and medium enterprises, connectivity and broadband.  He is correct.  It is equally important that mobile phone providers are taken to task because phone coverage is appalling.  At a time when we have invested significant amounts of money in connectivity and broadband, I am baffled as to how there has been a deterioration in mobile phone coverage in the past number of years.  Mobile phone providers have an obligation to explain the situation.</p> <p>Senator Devine referenced the mental health issue, which was debated in the D&aacute;il.  She made a good comment.  She is correct.  It is an important issue and mental health is a priority for the Government.  Weekend cover is something that needs to be examined and discussed.  The vote in the other House is beyond our gift and remit.  </p> <p>If it is the case that Sinn F&eacute;in is not supporting the appointment of Senators to the all-party committee, I hope Senators will ask their party colleagues for us to be included.  Many Senators have expertise in health and should be part of the strategy.  They bring a body of experience and work to this issue.  I am not sure of the Sinn F&eacute;in position.</p></speech>

It is disappointing to hear what he said.  It is linked to the issue of GP retention.

Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and McFadden also referred to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  I was not able to get to Conradh na Gaeilge yesterday.  The Minister has committed to coming to the House.  I mentioned it to him today.  We need to get a date so we can synchronise his diary with the House.</p> <p>Senator Feighan again raised the issue of the agreement in Ardoyne.  We discussed it and condemned the attack on Fr. Gary Donegan.  He mentioned flooding and the work being done in Lough Allen.  I hope the ESB will address the issue.  I am sure it is watching proceedings and has its public affairs people dealing with the situation.  They might revert to the Senator.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of research in Vancouver on the economic benefit of reunification.  I did not read the report, but we should have a debate in the House about post-Brexit and so on.  It is critical that we consider the benefits and positive aspects of Brexit.</p> <p>Senators McFadden and Davitt raised the issue of the job losses in Longford.  Senator McFadden asked a very good question about the money being allocated by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, where that money will now go and the need for an explanation from them about Longford.  On a number of occasions Senators McFadden and Davitt have raised the need for job creation in Longford.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to come to the House to address the issue.  </p> <p>I wish Senator Gavan well in his conference at the weekend.

It is an issue about which we have spoken.  The important point is that the airport is at the gateway to Europe.</p> <p>Senator Burke raised the issue of home care packages, the importance of training people and the ten-year health strategy.  I have emphasised that it is key that Members of the House are part of that strategy.  I hope we can all support it.</p> <p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of Hurricane Matthew which has killed 26 people and is trundling its way up the east coast of America.   I have spoken to friends of mine in Florida who were getting ready for it yesterday.  Haiti is of humanitarian concern and I will take up the point with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke referred to the importance of tourism, Brexit and the linkage with sterling.  I would be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy Donovan, or the Minister, Deputy Ross, come before the House.  Senator Conway-Walsh raised the matter of family resource centres and their important work, and the need for the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to come to the House.

As they can imagine, I am very keen to put forward the case that education is absolutely pivotal to our future challenges.  This Government has set two main challenges.  I think we all see two main challenges.  One is how to sustain the progress to reach full employment, which is very important if we are to be able to say that every person who wants to work will be able to have access to a job that will support his or her ambition.  The second is our desire to ensure that we have a fair society, in particular that we break cycles of disadvantage.  If one thinks about those two goals for any length of time and steps back from them, one will see that education is pivotal to both.  We cannot have a sustainable full-employment economy without massive investment in the talent that will support it.  I previously had the job of Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and if one talks to any employer about the challenges they face now, it is, as they would describe it, a war for talent.  They must also be drivers of innovation within their businesses.  They must do things in a different way if they are to succeed in entering new markets.  This is particularly so after the decision of the British people to exit the European Union, when we are now faced with the need to diversify and be innovative in our markets.  We also need to be able to fill skills gaps as they emerge.  We need to be able to support entrepreneurship.  Two out of every three jobs come from companies within the first five years of their lives.</p> <p>At the heart of an awful lot of the talent drive that fuels enterprise is the education system.  Equally, if one considers the challenge of creating a fair society, anyone will see that the key to resolving cycles of disadvantage will be built around education.  We have so often seen that in some schools, a teacher can predict that a certain child will not progress, that instead of progressing to higher education, a good job or an apprenticeship, he or she is destined for something different and will face into difficulties in his or her life.  Education is the key that can break down those barriers and open up new opportunities.  Education is the key that can help young people develop the personal resilience to deal with many of the stresses faced in later life.  Education is the key to setting out pathways that allow people who perhaps did not succeed the first time around in their education to find their way back and through to traineeships, apprenticeships and so on.</p> <p>Therefore, on both core objectives that we have set, education is the key.  The challenge for me and others is to set out a strategic vision for the country that can win the support of our community for investment in education.  That is exactly what the Action Plan for Education is all about.  It has a strategic vision that, within ten years, we would become the best education service in Europe.  That is a bold ambition but it is a realistic one, in my view, because across many areas, we are already very strong performers.  Many rank our education system as it is among the first five or six in Europe.  In areas such as literacy, we do very well but not quite so well in mathematics or science.  We have the highest rate in Europe of enrolment in the so-called STEM subjects in our universities.  We have the highest rate in Europe of participation in third level.  We have one of the best performances in research and the capacity to turn our investment in research into genuine innovation that changes things.  We are, therefore, strong in many dimensions but we are weak in many others.  For example, lifelong learning is an area which we need to consider and in which we are weak.  We are one of the laggards in Europe for making sure that people who are in work continually renew their skills.</p> <p>We need to close the gap between disadvantaged schools and other schools but it is fair to say that the DEIS scheme has been very successful.  The drop-out rate has fallen sharply.  It was 32% just a few years ago, in 2001.  It has now come down very significantly, despite all the difficulties, to just 18% and we need to sustain that progress.  That is why we have created an Action Plan for Education.  We also built on my experience in the enterprise.  Education is a complex Department.  It has many individual strategies, and it is very important to integrate those series of strategies around some shared goals that would apply at all levels - first, second, third and fourth levels - and would integrate the strategies to make sure we are implementing them appropriately, setting the right priorities to achieve the high goals.</p> <p>The goals are ones that I hope will lend themselves to the Seanad.  They are built around firstly reducing the level of disadvantage and making sure those who come to the education system with a disadvantage progress.  That is measured in progression to third level or apprenticeship or traineeship, in a lower still drop-out rate and in improved relative standards in literacy and other tests compared to mainstream schools that are not in the disadvantaged programme.</p> <p>The second goal concerns the enrichment of the learning experience for every pupil.  Undoubtedly, everyone can recognise that as our environment becomes more complex, we need to respond with wider subject choice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we introduce coding in schools and adopt digital technology, not only to expose young people to its power but also to integrate it into teaching methodologies in order that it enlivens and enriches education and teaching methods.  This is at the core of the junior certificate cycle.</p><p>We need to see a broadening of the types of skills that are recognised and valued in our education system to take the shackles off teaching and learning.  We are too concentrated on the terminal examination which has been a deadening influence, particularly in some of the subjects that are important for the future, such as science.  This is, appropriately, a very important second theme.</p><p>A third theme is focused on schools and ensuring we provide the supports to allow them to continuously improve.  There is no doubt the key to success lies in the leadership and teaching methodologies that are applied by staff in schools and the culture that is developed.  We need to invest more in building strong leadership.  Initiatives are already emerging to strengthen the leadership capability of schools.  This was part of the recent agreement reached between the Department and the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, to deliver improvements.  There are many other ways in which we can support innovation in schools, including in terms of a capacity for self-evaluation and peer learning and mainstreaming what is working elsewhere.</p><p>The fourth stream we have set out is the need to build stronger links between education and the wider community.  Visiting the north inner city of Dublin with the Taoiseach recently, it was clear that while children have a good and safe environment until 4 p.m., success within schools very much depends on what happens after school and what supports are available in the wider community when children go home from school.  We need to find ways of building bridges with community supports such as clubs.</p><p>With regard to our desire to provide the skills and talent of the future, there is evidence to show that if students are given the opportunity to participate in a work placement during their study, they have 24% better outcomes in terms of employment and income.  We must build much stronger bridges with employers.  Some colleges make this a core element but it must be extended. </p><p>The relationship or partnership, if one likes, between parents and schools must be valued more.  We are committed to developing a parents charter to allow this relationship to become more of a genuine partnership involving mutual respect on both sides.  </p><p>As to the final element, as a national Department with a number of national agencies, we must also aspire to best international practice.  We must examine whether the continuous professional development we offer teachers and our methods of inspection, support and innovation reflect international best practice.  The national agencies face the challenge of ensuring they are creating the framework within which schools can achieve high levels of performance.</p><p>Criticisms have been made of the Department's approach, with some arguing that we should not set such high ambitions and that we should be content to be just good.  I do not agree with that view.  By saying we want to be the best in Europe, we change the conversation, the questions we ask of ourselves and our performance, whether in terms of children with a disadvantage or the range and richness of the learning environment we offer.  We need to ask these questions if we are to be determined to be the stand-out, excellent choice.</p><p>The other question people have asked is what is the investment implication of the strategy.  It is important to note that the strategy takes a three-year and ten-year perspective.  It is not a budget plan, nor was it intended as such.  It is a statement of ambition and direction.  The pace with which we can implement some of the changes will depend on the additional incremental resources we can secure from year to year.  However, it is equally important that our current allocation of &euro;8.5 billion is spent to the best effect.  We must examine many issues to ensure we are using all the resources allocated to us by the Houses of the Oireachtas to best effect as well as making the unanswerable case for new investment in various challenging areas, for example, special educational needs, educational disadvantage, higher education and apprenticeships.  We have set out strong ambitions for the future in all these areas.  </p><p>I thank Senators for initiating this debate.  It is important that those of us who are interested in education - most of the Senators present have a particular knowledge, background or expertise in this field - spread the message more widely that if we want to fulfil the ambitions we have as a nation, be they economic, cultural or scientific in nature or an ambition to create a fair society, the decisions we make about our education service will be at the heart of achieving them.  For these reasons, it is important to integrate this into a simple plan that one can see.  This is a feature that will apply in this respect of the action plan, as it did when I had responsibilities elsewhere.  There will be a fresh plan for 2017 and it will be built on the feedback from and experience of what we do in 2016.  Similarly, the new plan in 2018 will be built on the experience in 2017.  This approach will provide a vehicle for continually seeking to improve the instruments and policy choices we make, bearing in mind the views of the Oireachtas and education stakeholders.</p><p>I hope we, as a community, can get behind the effort to set education as one of our national priorities and ensure we make the right choices across all education sectors.  We must have clear goals and commit to outcome reporting in order that the Oireachtas, as the funder of the strategy, will be able to determine whether we are living up to the outcomes we hoped to achieve in literacy progression and the roll-out of different programmes.  We are happy to be held accountable against objective standards.  Any investment in education, provided it is done right, will deliver the returns Members of the Oireachtas have a right to expect.</p></speech>

While many of the measures to improve quality and innovational learning in education in this plan are welcome, the education sector in general is somewhat underwhelmed by its contents.  The three-year strategy, while worthy in some respects, is not strong enough in many of the areas of education policy that require substantial reform.  An action plan requires clear objectives, goals, dates and measures but also resources, as the Minister indicated.  Many of the education proposals in the Fine Gael Party's election manifesto feature strongly in this plan, including linking funding to performance.  Some measures will have regressive effects on schools with a higher intake of students from low income backgrounds.  Many argue that they will also have regressive effects on schools and the education system in general.</p> <p>The action plan practically omits mention of the higher education funding crisis or concrete measures for improving access to third level education.  The plan has five level goals covering learners, educators, the community, planning and support.  While it is full of fine aspirations, concrete proposals for achieving them are absent.  </p> <p>Time constraints do not allow me the luxury of discussing each of the goals but I will briefly address several of them.  While one of the stated objectives is to address educational disadvantage and improve outcomes for all students, there are few tangible commitments in the action plan to achieve this goal.  One of the areas in need of attention is foreign languages.  Only 7% of ten year olds learn a foreign language compared to 75% in the United Kingdom.  Physical education across the education system is another area in need of attention.  Ireland is rated third worst among European Union member states for physical education at primary level and seventh worst at second level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Right now we are rated third worst among all EU countries for primary level physical education and seventh worst for second level PE.  </p><p>The objective should be to improve overall learning outcomes and wellbeing for children.  We have serious concerns about the new, revised models being proposed for resources for children with special educational needs.  Many believe that this reorganisation of the special educational resource model is really a further cut to special education.  While it is welcome that the Government has come to realise the importance of speech and language therapy in education, this document really only pays lip service to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed a new model that would radically change early intervention services by putting early intervention teams on-site in preschools and primary schools, including speech and language therapy teams.  The model proposed is based on the successful model that is already in existence, albeit on a pilot basis, in Tallaght.  </p><p>The current situation and attitude to leadership in schools is deeply unfair.  Principals of schools with fewer than 179 pupils teach on average 169 days per year, with only 20 days for fulfilling their administrative responsibilities, whereas principals in schools with more than 179 pupils do not teach at all.  This is unfair on all schools, their principals and pupils.  Just across the Border from County Monaghan principals get at least one day per week off for administrative duties.  How can principals be expected to engage in strategic planning for their schools, while also carrying out their administrative responsibilities in just 20 days?  The action plan does not reverse this situation.</p><p>Reducing class sizes at primary level, especially for children under nine, is a key issue.  Approximately 125,000 or one in five primary school pupils are taught in super-sized classes of over 30 students.  The proposals included in the plan would introduce punishing performance targets, remove teacher autonomy and further penalise schools in less advantaged areas.  The system of standardised testing proposed displays a complete disregard for teachers and the public school system.  The country deemed to have the most successful education system in the world is Finland but it is certainly not obsessed with testing.  In fact, the complete opposite is the case but Finland trains all of its teachers to master's level.  </p><p>The Government's approach to school divestment has simply not worked, with only six schools transferring patronage to date.  Our policy approach has been to bring the issue forward in a constructive way.  Divestment and increasing diversity in school patronage is essential and we will engage with all educational partners to energise this process rather than setting unrealistic goals and targets.  </p><p>We must be more ambitious on apprenticeships and ask if 50,000 is enough.  Gender balance in this area is abysmal and pitiful.  While there has been an increase in the scope of skills and trades covered by apprenticeships, there are no new incentives for non-traditional businesses to get involved in new apprenticeships.  </p><p>The plan to provide 50,000 new higher education places by 2021 is just not possible without significant increases in funding.  Capital investment in higher education has been cut by a staggering 50% since 2011.  Universities and institutes of technology, as we all know, are on the brink of financial collapse.  In the entirety of this action plan I can only find two lines devoted to the crisis in higher level funding and the Cassells report.  </p><p>The plan is far from perfect, but at least there is a plan.  However, its lack of concrete proposals for attaining its goals is of concern.  Certainly, its aim to provide the best education and training system in Europe is one to which we would all aspire.  </p><p>I thank the Minister for his presence and for his attention.  I would like to raise one issue with him, on which I would welcome his comments.  I refer to the position of junior certificate students in ASTI-staffed schools who may lose 10% of the marks in their English exam this year, through no fault of their own.  This threat needs to be withdrawn because it is causing stress for those students and their families.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to the Seanad today that he will ensure that this threat of punishment is withdrawn.</p></speech>

This action plan activates the commitments contained in the programme for a partnership Government.  I welcome the fact that the action plan contains commitments to the monitoring of actions, with published timelines.  Progress will be assessed each year.</p> <p>Ireland is among the top five countries in Europe in several important spheres of education, including post-primary literacy, third level participation and the taking up of science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, subjects at third level.  I was delighted to attend the launch of a STEM programme recently, which involves a partnership between the University of Limerick, UL, and Johnson and Johnson, which is a major employer in the county.  The programme aims to encourage more students to study STEM subjects and particularly to encourage female entrepreneurs to study engineering.  Under the programme, students are guaranteed a work placement on graduation.  The more we see of such initiatives, the better.  </p> <p>The OECD has found that education not only enables people to perform better in the labour market, but also helps to improve their overall health, promote active citizenship and contain violence.  I welcome the inclusion of very important goals in the action plan.  The focus is on breaking the cycle of disadvantage and ensuring that every person has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  This also leads to creating sustainable, well-paid jobs and strong economic growth.</p> <p>The action plan commits to the further rolling out of several initiatives which are already in place in a number of higher level institutes in Ireland.  It aims, for example, to increase by one quarter the number of students undertaking a work placement or work project as part of their third-level qualification by 2021.  I have served on the governing bodies of both UL and the Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and have seen first-hand the experience students attained during work placements, which helped them at college and in the workplace.  Such placements are of benefit to both students and employers.  </p> <p>I welcome the emphasis in the plan on increasing the take up of gateway subjects such as physics, chemistry and higher level maths.  This year's leaving certificate results show that almost 28%, or more than 15,000 students, opted to take the higher level maths paper and failure rates fell from 5% to 4.6%.  The plan also aims to increase the opportunities for learning coding and computer science.  In that regard, my local IT started a pilot scheme for primary school students on a Saturday morning which has proved very successful and very beneficial for the students.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has included coding and computer science in this plan because these are two of the subjects of the future.  </p> <p>The implementation of a national access programme for higher education is pivotal to this plan.  Its objective is to increase by seven points, or the equivalent of 30%, the proportion of students at risk of disadvantage who proceed to higher education.  </p> <p>A mandatory area of learning, entitled "Wellbeing", will be introduced in the junior cycle in 2017.  Increasing subject choice for students is important for student motivation and engagement and for ensuring that curriculum development continues to respond to the changing needs of learners, society and the economy.  The fact that the action plan will be reviewed each year means that stakeholders will have the opportunity to submit comments and recommendations.  </p> <p>An important goal is to improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage and learners with special educational needs.  While there has been a significant improvement in the number of students from DEIS schools remaining at school until leaving certificate and in literacy and numeracy outcomes, achievement data shows that outcomes in such schools are still below the national norm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Since 2009, no school has been designated DEIS.  Will the Minister consider this as part of the review he is taking?  As part of the Europe 2020 strategy, Ireland aimed to reduce to 8% the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds with secondary education but not in further education or training.  This target has now been exceeded with a current rate of 6.9%.  The Department is due to publish and implement a new Action Plan for Education inclusion which will include a schools support programme, an assessment framework for resources allocation, as well as a monitoring and evaluation framework.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills will pilot a new model for the allocation of teaching resources to support children with special educational needs in schools, an important measure.  A new inclusion support service for schools will be developed, and there are continual improvements in the aims to help those delivering education services.  Ireland is fortunate to attract high calibre people to the teaching profession and our teaching framework has a strong reputation internationally.  From my local knowledge of Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, I am aware of the high standards which are in place.  The Department of Education and Skills will increase investment in the professional development of teachers across the board.  The fact professional development is encouraged at all levels is important.  School leadership supports will be expanded with the new mentoring programme for newly appointed principals and a professional coaching service for serving principals.  A new postgraduate qualification will be rolled out for aspiring school leaders.</p><p>Continual improvement in schools will be supported through a new quality framework for external inspection and school self-improvement.  A planned programme of external evaluation will be rolled out across the schools sector with a range of new inspection models.  Support is to be given to improving the quality of early years provision.  The implementation of Aistear and S&iacute;olta, the Early Years curriculum and quality frameworks will be supported with training for mentors and trainers and upskilling for the workforce.  I have witnessed the value of the Early Years programme in a pilot project run in a primary school in my local electoral area.  I fully support the work of and the teachers in this programme.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills will develop a partners and learners charter to give parents and students a strong voice at school level.  The Government will legislate for school admissions to make enrolment easier for children and their parents.  The Department will also establish 400 multidenominational and non-denominational schools to give greater choice.  It has established a National Skills Council to drive the development of the regional skills fora for key infrastructure developments to address skills needs both nationally and regionally.  More than 60,000 additional school places will be delivered by 2021 and in excess of 300 extensions to existing schools and 14 schools will be completed.</p><p>I welcome the Action Plan for Education.  We have an excellent education system of which we can be proud.  Current strategies, such as the 20-year strategy for the Irish language and the national skills strategy, help underpin our overall system of education.  The programme recognises the need to adapt to changing needs and to increase skills in several key areas.

However, this statement is meaningless without adequate investment.  Before we talk about where we want our education system to be, we first need to talk about where the system is right now and how the Government has managed it so far.</p> <p>The education system is a public service which Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have decimated with severe cuts to vital services.  Since 2012, there has been a 15% cut in resource hours allocated to children with special needs as well a 27.6% reduction in guidance counselling provision.  Since 2008, we have seen a &euro;13 million cut in the school transport budget while up to 2,000 staff have been taken out of third level education.  Today, two thirds of primary school pupils are taught in classrooms of 25 pupils or more.  More than 200 schools are using prefab classrooms to accommodate students.  Fine Gael has left our education system in a complete mess.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party made the decision to take away resources from the most disadvantaged in our society in respect of special needs and guidance counsellors.  They even cut funding for school transport.  What kind of equal education system is that?</p> <p>We have read the Action Plan for Education.  While the Minister talks of aspiring to having a world class education system, we do not see any evidence in the plan to rectify these injustices.  There is a complete lack of ambition or vision in Fine Gael.  For example, it has delayed the investment in ICT infrastructure for Wi-Fi, broadband, equipment and learning resources until 2018.  What is the reason for this?  It has set a target to increase access to third level in the lowest socioeconomic group to 30% by 2019.  Does the Minister realise this is lower than the target set in 2008, which was 31%?  Where is the political will in Fine Gael to deal with inequality in education?  Why has it failed so far in six years to deal with the issue?  Why has it not yet carried out a review of barriers facing lone parents in accessing education?</p> <p>The review of the school transport system will not be available until 2018.  The Minister said he will not have developed a policy on science, technology, engineering and maths until 2017.  He also said he will not have started or completed a review on barriers to further education and training for disadvantaged students until next year.  Up to 89% of schools are under the direct patronage of the Catholic Church.  That is not good enough for a State which aspires to be a republic.  We would like to see a departmental roadmap to achieve the goal of 400 multidenominational schools by 2030.  We would like to see the Department of Education and Skills issue guidelines for all schools to follow to ensure children can opt out of faith formation, if that is their wish.  We would like to see the end of the baptism barrier in school admissions.</p> <p>These are serious inequalities in our society and the Minister has put all of them on the long finger.  I do not understand his vision for the education system.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il have implemented successive budgets which continue to decimate and underinvest in education.  I do not believe their policies will ever produce a world class education system that provides for every citizen in this Republic.  Ireland is at a significant crossroads right now.  We need to start thinking about creating a discourse around public investment.  Education is a vital public service.  The State has a responsibility to provide the best possible service it can, and it needs to be an equal service.</p></speech>

The debate is changing and it needs to be presented clearly.  Neoliberal right-wing politics has failed and bankrupted this country.  While we on the left argue for progressive taxation to fund public services which will be universal for everyone, the parties on the right argue for cuts in taxes and further privatisation of essential services.  Sinn F&eacute;in has published its alternative budget and in that document is our vision for the education system.  This includes a total capital and current expenditure investment of &euro;480 million.  That would see a complete restoration of guidance counselling hours.  It would also see an increase in resource teaching hours, the creation of 1,000 additional apprenticeship places.  It would provide a &euro;10 million fund for the replacement of prefabs and &euro;30 million for investment in Wi-Fi networks for schools.  That is our vision for our education system.</p> <p>Next week, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il will publish their budget which will contain their vision for the education system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In that budget will be their vision for the education system.

To cut to the chase, I do not see in the strategy statement the ambition, commitment or passion for the full inclusion of children and people with disabilities or special needs.  That is my assessment of it.  The authors have chosen not to reference people with disabilities as a key priority, in spite of a commitment in the programme for Government to ratify the UN convention, or to reference or footnote Article 24 of that convention.  The Minister is talking about having a high ambition but I do not know whether he could have a much higher ambition regarding children and young people with disabilities and special needs than to refer to Article 44 of the convention and use it as a standard bearer.</p> <p>There is no setting out of the level of disadvantage among the children and families in order to underline the work and generate a sense of urgency in respect of it.  Let me give some examples.  A quarter of the children of Ireland have some form of disability.  Children with disabilities are more likely to come from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  This creates a double disadvantage because those with disabilities, based on their lower socio-economic status, are more likely to be at the bottom rung, to be placed in special schools settings or to be outside the mainstream setting.</p> <p>In the first quarter of 2015, just 39% of the applications for an assessment of need were completed within the required timeframe.  Many parents are forced to pay for private assessments to support applications for additional resources.  Children of parents who cannot afford to pay for a private diagnosis are receiving fewer resource hours in their schools.  Some 43% of people with disabilities have not progressed beyond primary education.  That compares with 90% among others.  This is an outline of some of the very hard facts.  I am not making these up; they are coming from a range of reputable reports.</p> <p>The strategy acknowledges that there are significant measures in the EPSEN Act, passed by these two Houses in 2004, that still have not been enacted or in respect of which the hold button has been pressed.  Full implementation of the Act is necessary.  Technology has fascinating potential to support students with disabilities in overcoming barriers.  There are still key challenges to be addressed in this regard.</p> <p>Bizarrely and surprisingly, there are repeated references in the report to children in one area of disability, an area that needs support.  Why is this the case when there are no references to children with autism, Asperger's syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, muscular dystrophy, epidermolysis bullosa, arthritis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental health issues, deafness or other such conditions.  If there is to be ambition, it ought to encompass all the children.  The plan seems to have been to run down the road of picking one group.  That really shows the flaws that are in the statement.  I have no doubt that it is well meaning but it is flawed.</p> <p>At the commencement of the debate, it was heartening to hear the Minister talk about the twin objectives, or Government challenges.  One concerns employment.  The Minister will certainly know from his last posting, in which he had responsibility in this area, that he did not hear too much about disabled people becoming redundant, for the very simple reason they were never in jobs.  Therefore, education is an absolute pillar in allowing people to advance.  Employment is key to that.  It is critical that the education authorities get on with the job smartly.  I refer to the question of having a fair society and breaking the cycle of disadvantage.</p> <p>Why did the Minister not reference Article 24 the UN convention given that it is implied in the programme for Government?  Did the Minister's officials take the opportunity to read and study it?  Will the Department continually dance to that tune now?  The Minister said he will be updating the strategy annually, so he has an opportunity to do as I propose.</p></speech>

The plan makes for very interesting reading.  I will try to confine my remarks to the specific goals.  I hope the Minister will respond on a couple of points under each goal.  With regard to goals 1 and 2, on the questions of the learning experience and the progress of learners at risk, reference was made previously to the teacher-pupil ratio and the progress towards the European target of having 20 students per teacher.  That is essential if we are serious about the learning experience in our schools and giving teachers the capacity to deliver fully.</p> <p>The review of DEIS-designated schools is overdue.  It is crucial.  I regret, in the context of some of the inclusion issues talked about in the House, the discontinuation of the healthy-foods-for-all initiative.  This was important in providing the additional supports that allowed some students to benefit fully from an educational experience.</p> <p>I wish to highlight the case of a particular group of learners at risk, lone parents.  Lone parents seeking to re-enter education face particular challenges, one being that our system is not designed to ensure their full participation and progression.</p> <p>I would like the Minister to address the question of the education and training boards and their need to provide high-quality, part-time courses at suitable hours that allow for full inclusion.  That the SUSI grant is not available for those in part-time education also disadvantages women and those who are parenting alone, be they men or women.</p> <p>On goal 3, on helping those delivering education services to improve continually, I wish to highlight two areas.  The first concerns the higher education report in respect of gender equality.  How will we make sure the recommendations are really mainstreamed and that those in education are not only progressing but also given an opportunity to progress?  It is vital that this be followed through and that the recommendations be reflected in the plan.  We must see real links, for example, to funding and the Athena SWAN achievement.</p> <p>Progression is crucial where younger teachers are concerned.  If we are asking teachers, including younger teachers, to improve continuously, we need to ensure they are given the opportunity to do so by looking to the INTO recommendations on the restoration of pay and ensuring middle-management positions and recognition for post-holders are high on the agenda.  Pay and progression must go hand in hand and there should be two-way progress.</p> <p>The key issue of concern for me is goal 4.  Under goal 4, it is important that we assert ourselves very clearly.  The UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child have spoken previously about the problem of baptism as a barrier to admissions.  I would welcome a clear ministerial assertion that schools are not religious institutions but educational establishments, funded by the State in order to fulfil its obligation.</p></speech>

Schools should not be property to be transferred to trusts to be administered.  They are, in fact, an administration of a duty of the State.  That has to take primacy.  In that regard, I call for a roadmap on the delivery of the 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools and also the inclusion of Gaelscoileanna.  Those who choose to be educated in Irish must also have the right to be educated in a place that reflects their-----</p></speech>

If we want a vibrant research community, we need to invest in public research and higher education funding must be restored.  We need to make sure we are taking full advantage of the Brexit opportunities by investing in higher education, including community focused public research.</p></speech>

In his previous ministry, he pioneered the concept of the action plan and its constant monitoring.  It achieved a great outcome in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the rate of unemployment currently stands at under 8%, down from a high of 15.2%.  It was a phenomenal success there and I have no doubt the same model, with a different set of criteria and a different methodology, will also work in this instance.  To use the biblical adage, "By their fruits you shall know them".  The Minister has a record of delivery and I have no doubt he will deliver again.</p> <p>The Minister was correct in stating that education is critical to creating a fair society, giving people quality of life and creating a vibrant economy.  We all understand that, so I do not propose to spend five minutes going through how it works.</p> <p>It is not specifically under the remit of the Minister's Department, but the recent announcement of the second year of free early childhood education is very critical to childhood development because such development begins at a very young age.  That is a great help to creating equality and will assist in the context of what happens in primary school.  It is a welcome development.  I am a greater believer in early childhood education.</p> <p>It is important in the upcoming budget that we continue to reduce class sizes.  I have no doubt the Minister will fight for this.  The reduction of class size at primary level is critical to good outcomes.  All research suggests that there is a link between class size and performance.  Research also suggests that interventions are needed at a younger age to create equality of opportunity.  Reducing class sizes is critical.</p> <p>Continuous professional development of our excellent and outstanding, professional teachers is necessary.  They are the first to say they need continuous professional development and because they are good and committed, they benefit from it.  There was a loss to schools during the recession.  We are not here today to analyse the causes of that recession or its history, only to say there was a loss of positions of leadership and responsibility in schools.  They need to be rebalanced as do the capitation fees for students, which were cut by 30% during the recession.  That needs readjustment.  They are practical areas that will serve to achieve the Minister's higher objective.  </p> <p>The Minister is correct that a key priority is to reduce disadvantage.  He is also correct to cite the DEIS school programme as having achieved a lower dropout rate, down to 18% from 32%.</p> <p>I wish to refer to a matter which falls outside the Minister's remit but in respect of which he will have a moral authority in Cabinet.  It is the simple, basic and practical thing of the school meals programme.  As a former teacher, a parent and somebody who lives and interacts with people on a daily basis, practical common sense tells me that the school meals programme is very important in many areas.  It is very important that children get a wholesome diet.  The Acting Chairman, Senator O'Mahony, was an educator for many years.  He might agree that it is critical for children to have a proper diet and good food.  One of the best teachers I ever taught with said to me one time that if a child has a good night's sleep and proper food they will learn.  It is a basic common-sense thing but it is necessary.  The school meals programme should be maintained and extended to include a lunch as well as a breakfast because sadly children do not always have a proper diet.  I mentioned sleep and there should be potential for the home-school liaison teachers to look at that and work with parents.  Proper sleep is critical to the development of children and young adults.  That is an issue which could be examined.</p> <p>I wish to address one matter of which the Minister is acutely aware.  It is an issue that affects males and females, but predominantly males, between the ages of 15 and 18.  A cohort of those tends to opt out of academia, underperform and lose interest.  If they are in school under duress from their parents and because of societal pressure, they are only physically present.  More could be done there and perhaps apprenticeship will come into play.  Will the Minister respond to that?  I am thinking of the concept of apprenticeships extending into other areas such as insurance.  Wider links with industry might achieve something.  Will the Minister respond to my point on those young men?  Academia does not seem to work for them and yet they have every right to be in school.  They have great potential and they lose heart.</p> <p>I agree with the Minister that lifelong learning should be a privilege and opportunity for all of us.  It is an exciting thing to do so we should do it.  In that context, post-leaving certificate institutions have a potential to be used for lifelong learning opportunities.  I will strike a parochial note with my final point.  We did much in the capital area under the previous administration and a lot was achieved in my constituency in terms of capital.  We have one particular capital need for the new education campus in Cavan town; the excellent post-leaving certificate institute there is included in the capital programme.

It is incredibly apt that just before I rose to my feet students from a primary school arrived into the Gallery.  I presume they are from a primary school so I wish them a very happy trip to the Houses of the Oireachtas and hope they learn loads.  If they have any questions for the Minister they should be sure to pass them along to me and I will get them in before the end.  The Minister is here to make sure the students get their homework done properly every night.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister's presence here.  I want to be as constructive as possible.  The Minister has published an action plan for education which is to be commended.  We need to have a roadmap for where we want to be and what we want to achieve.  Education is something that many people in Ireland feel very strongly about.  When one travels around the world and visits other jurisdictions to see what they are doing in education, sometimes the statements they make or the ambition they have can strike a chord because perhaps such ambition is missing in Ireland.  I spent some time in West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow visiting a very disadvantaged community.  They speak of wanting the absolute eradication of illiteracy.   The total eradication of illiteracy is their motivation and ambition.  Would it not be wonderful if in Ireland the national obsession in our education system was the total eradication of illiteracy?  One in three children leaving disadvantaged schools has basic reading problems and about 17.9% of our adult population is functionally illiterate.  We have an issue with literacy.  The previous Government did a huge amount to try to address that.  The people of Finland will state that the thing which underpins their education philosophy is equality.  It is not a principle of one party or another or of the left or the right, it is what they have collectively agreed.  They have decided that equality in the education system is what is best for all children.  They all accept it.  The problem with Ireland is that we do not really have a word or phrase that underpins our education philosophy.  I do not believe we do.  In Ireland we have a publicly funded education system that is not a State education system because we outsource it to schools, boards of management and patron bodies.  What inevitably happens is that competition gets into the mix and the system perpetuates inequality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We separate children on the basis of religion.  We separate children on the basis of gender.  Where else in society do we believe it is acceptable to separate children on the basis of gender at the age of four years?  Is it any surprise that gender stereotypes evolve in society when children in so many schools are separated on the basis of gender?  It is probably more of an urban than a rural phenomenon.  The construct of our education system allows this to happen.</p><p>Only last week, the Ombudsman for Children asked for the relationship between the State and the education system to be re-evaluated.  It is time for us to set out a roadmap, in conjunction with the Minister's Action Plan for Education, to lance the boil of the constitutional impediment to a genuine State education system.  When we try to engage in issues relating to school books or transport or trying to bring about an education system like that of Northern Ireland, representatives of the Department of Education and Skills almost faint at the suggestion that we would have actual day-to-day engagement and a role in managing the day-to-day affairs of schools.  They are horrified by the idea.  The Action Plan for Education is unlike any other action plan for education in Europe because we have a constitutional impediment to a day-to-day involvement in the running of schools.  This goes back to religious and baptism issues and all the rest of it.  In the full light of day in a modern republic, this set-up appears to be absolutely crazy.  I tried successfully to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  What was that about?  It was about trying to ensure that LGBT teachers, divorced teachers or unmarried and cohabiting teachers would not be discriminated against by their schools.  I could only amend the legislation.  I could not get it repealed completely because of the constitutional reality in terms of where we stand in the education system.</p><p>The 1995 Hart and Risley study proved how a three year old from a welfare-dependent family had one third of the oral language capacity of a three year old from a professional family.  The Minister was in the north inner city recently.  He quite rightly said that the relationship between the school and wider community is paramount and he is correct.  We cannot achieve everything in the school system.  Children do not live in schools.  However, the reality is that we need far more certainty around the ABC programme.  The Minister was in Darndale recently celebrating the programme.  It was great to see him there.  We have rolled out 13 such programmes throughout the State.  They work with schools and the wider community to tackle acute areas of disadvantage.  We need more certainty from the Minister in this regard.  Obviously, he has a role in working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in that regard.</p><p>The issue of special needs assistants, SNAs, in the education system is central.  A report was compiled by Senator Mary Moran last year relating to the role of SNAs.  It highlighted the uncertainty they face, the nature of their career path and the fact they should be an essential part of the education system, rather than their role being chopped and changed from year to year as budgetary priorities go up and down.</p><p>The issue of teacher diversity must be addressed.  A teacher is capable of being a powerful role model.  How are we addressing the issue of getting more working class children into teaching roles?  How are we addressing the issue of getting more Traveller children into teaching roles?  How are we working on the issue of getting more children from ethnically diverse backgrounds into teaching roles?  How powerful would it be for the average Irish primary school to have a teacher from the Traveller community, a disadvantaged background or an eastern European background?  This does not happen often and there are many and varied reasons for this, but can we engage with the teacher training colleges to determine how we can improve the situation given that it is such a powerful role?</p><p>It is a question of the ambition we have for the society we are trying to construct.  It is not simply about producing economic units.  I realise the Minister has come from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I appreciate the Minister's mindset has had to be recast over the summer months.  The purpose is not simply to become an economic unit.  That is not the point of education.  The point of education is to believe and understand the beauty of poetry, language, music, dance, sport and the whole basis for why we are alive.  That is what education is all about.  These things are more profound than simply becoming an economic unit.  I wish that type of ambition was written throughout the Action Plan for Education with a view towards the goal of empowering young people to be the best that they can possibly be.  We need to focus more on equality as being fundamental to our educational vision and try harder to lance the boil within the Constitution.  This is something we have to grasp.  Why not say that we want to eradicate illiteracy totally in society?  If the Minister does that, the Labour Party will support him in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank him for this positive report.  The Minister has set out his five key goals.  He has set out his objectives.  He has set out timelines, a brave thing for any Minister to do.  I was talking to the Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney, about the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter.  I put it to him that we were heading into the fourth quarter but 32 objectives from the third quarter were not yet delivered by the Minister.  It is a brave Minister who sets out his stall and timelines for delivery, but the Minister has done so and that is to be commended.  I have no doubt about the Minister's extraordinary commitment to education.  Moreover, I like the that he has an enterprising mind and is someone who has always promoted enterprise.  I am pleased to see the greater synergy between enterprise and education and the effects of good education in terms of enterprise, people being better educated, participating in the workforce and the economic benefits of all of that.  I see that peppered through the sentences and objectives of the document and I commend the Minister on that.</p> <p>We are a republic.  We need an education system that respects the true principles of a republic.  I say that as someone who comes from the Church of Ireland tradition.  I am critical of the Church of Ireland - I have no difficulty in saying as much - and the anomalies in this regard.  I have seen too many Church of Ireland churches throughout Ireland who have fought tooth and nail to resist anyone outside their denomination coming to their schools on the basis of the Church of Ireland ethos.  We have seen it in health but we still have it in education.  This is something that I expected the Minister to address.  Many people expected the Minister to crack this kernel.  We cannot have an education system that segregates people.  We had too much of it in Northern Ireland.  No religion or faith or faith-based consideration should be relevant when it comes to entrance to a State school.  I draw a distinction between a State school and a paying school.  There are other issues about finance and how the State finances a private or fee-paying school.  There should be no grounds for any discrimination relating to religion or absence of religion in State primary schools.  This is the greatest single challenge for any Minister and for the State.</p> <p>There is a Gaelscoil down the road from where I live.  I am horrified even to share this with the House but someone told me recently that he put his children in the Gaelscoil because there would be no Nigerian children there.  Many of these immigrants who have come to the country are struggling to learn English.  That is a shocking, horrific and horrible statement for anyone to make.  There are no catchment areas.  There are people who live next door to the Gaelscoil near me but who cannot get access to it.  They are told there is no catchment for Gaelscoileanna.  This is a community school, but people living next door cannot get access, yet people from ten and 15 miles away can come to this school for various reasons.  That is unacceptable on the watch of any Minister for Education and Skills.</p> <p>We should not insist on segregation on the basis of gender for people in our State primary school system.  It should not be tolerated.  It should be a clear objective that it cannot happen any longer.  We have to untangle the State system.  We spoken about patronage and how in excess of 80% of patronage is under the Catholic Church.  I have nothing against the Catholic Church.  No religious group should be dominant.  I want Muslims, believers, non-believers, Catholics, Anglicans and whoever to be able to go to their community school, local school or State school.  I want us to allow them to nourish, grow and befriend each other in their communities.  That is a major task.  I will leave that thought with the Minister.</p> <p>I wish to discuss education in prisons.  I have been on the board of a number of prisons and I am familiar with the educational process.  Traditionally, the vocational education committees operated schools in prisons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the summer holidays come, suddenly the education programme stops.  We are told the VECs cannot work in the summer yet the prisoners are there for three or four years.  That is an unsatisfactory situation and I would like the Minister to look at the issue of the education of young people in prisons.  This is about their futures but they are spending two or three years incarcerated in prison without the benefit of any education for three months in the summer.</p><p>The plans for apprenticeships and training are very good but to tie them into the rebuilding Ireland programme we will need to plan from now into the future in those areas.  Many people leave school at 14 or 15 and are marginalised through no fault of their own.  They cannot engage in education and emotionally cannot connect because they have been damaged by circumstances beyond their control.  What are we doing for these people?  We need to accommodate them and offer them other forms of training.  Many do not even have the academic qualifications to get onto apprenticeships.  They have the barest numeracy and literacy skills but they come to my office saying they want training.  Surely they are entitled to training and should be assisted in finding it.  I want more emphasis on training and assisting people.  We are all learning and education is an ongoing process.</p><p>This is a good policy and I am not here to knock it.  The Minister has set down his plan, vision, objectives and timelines and I hope they go well for him.  As politicians, our job is to review them next year and the year after and ask the Minister how he has delivered.  If he has not delivered we have to ask why.  It is a two-way process and I agree with him about scripts.  I am not in the business of writing scripts but I passionately believe in education and in giving people opportunities.</p><p>I urge the Minister to support those in prison and those who feel left alone.  It is not that they do not have any capacity or ability but they need assistance and support in the form of really imaginative training and apprenticeship schemes.  We need to bring everyone along so that they can also enjoy success because everyone has a right to develop and maximise their potential.  I do not doubt the Minister's commitment but I would like him to focus on the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

Like Senator Boyhan, I have no script but I have been a passionate educator for 16 years, like the Acting Chairman.  The Minister has come into the Department with a clear roadmap and plan.</p> <p>Let us look at from where we have come.  As this debate is taking place today, our live register has fallen below 300,000 and unemployment is falling to below 8%.  There are 2 million people working, for the first time in eight years.  That gives this Minister the opportunity to work on retraining, upskilling and educating people, something in which I passionately believe.  One of the greatest joys of my teaching career was when I saw people going back to education or into further education, or those who did not sit the leaving certificate doing the applied leaving certificate and being able to have a career.  </p> <p>Let us have a real debate about education.  If we follow the mantra of some, we will throw all the money in the world into it and will end up with nothing.  We have an action plan for education which prioritises earlier intervention and deals with how we can change our curriculum to invest in the child.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that education is not about leaving certificate results or whether one gets into college.  It is not about the bullet points in the Minister's action plan.  It is about the ability of a person to become immersed in drama, music or sport or to do a job-shadow programme in which they work with people with disabilities.  We have come through huge cuts in funding for education but, in the North, Sinn F&eacute;in is closing schools down and cutting their budgets.  They should not come down to lecture us about what is happening here while, in the North, they do the opposite. </p></speech>

As Maslow said, it is about reaching self-actualisation, whether it is the student who gets into Trinity College with full marks or students who complete the leaving certificate applied and goes back to an apprenticeship so that they can do the job of a mechanic, the job they love.  Education is about us being held to account.  I welcome the ambition in the plan and I know from the Minister's previous roles that the targets, goals and milestones are there so that he can meet them.  I also welcome the fact that it is a living document.  It is open to change.  We have heard some very good ideas today and I wish to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Michael Barron, who is involved in Equate Ireland, the equality in education group which campaigns for reconfiguring our schools to deliver diversity in education.</p><p>There are questions about the ethos of schools and there have been controversies about who can get in and who cannot.  We recently had an unedifying situation of students from the Traveller community being refused entry to schools.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  We must make our education accessible and remove the barriers to education.  Recently, I was in St. Paul's special needs school in Cork, which is trying to make life better for children with disability and another in Greenmount in Cork, where they have a plan to change how they deliver music and maths.  We need to get the fundamentals right.  If we get the fundamentals right and encourage and reward enterprising schools, we will have an education system that is better for all of us.</p><p>I wish to appeal to the Minister regarding the ASTI.  As a former member and shop steward I hope we can reach an accommodation.  It is imperative for the sake of the children, the teachers and our school system.  I know he has made a huge effort but I ask the Minister, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to make one final effort to reach a compromise.  Our education system and the plans the Minister has for it will go nowhere without all partners being involved.  I appeal to the ASTI to enter into negotiations in a meaningful way.  Let us put the megaphone diplomacy to one side and get down to talking again because our education system needs it.  This is a plan with ambition, and it is a vision.  It needs resources and money but let us make the child the centre of education and give our professionals due reward in terms of the pay, remuneration and conditions, in the form of the pupil-teacher ratio, that they need.</p><p>To say the Minister is doing nothing and has no plan or vision is unfair.  Anyone reading Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently would believe the plan was conceived out of thin air but it is a good plan and needs to be supported.</p></speech>

Not unlike the previous speaker, I am glad there is a plan.  I could stand up here and tear the plan to shreds, as others might tear it in a different way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Daly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are all passionate about education and all by-products of the education system.  It is the one sector of the community in which every individual in society will take part.  I do not want to talk about funding and will not get involved in the blame game, but there is a necessity for funding and investment in the education sector.  The problems therein and the process to achieve the best outcomes are investment related.  I take the philosophical route.  When we talk about funding for the health service, we say the money should follow the patient.  In education the money should follow the student.  One glove does not fit all in meeting the needs of this or any other society.</p><p>We get carried away on the positioning of the education system on international league tables.  Equally, we get carried away in trying to position schools and educational institutions on internal league tables.  The part of the plan about which I would be fearful is the angle towards providing monetary compensation based on performance.  That is a dangerous route to take in any education system.  In medium-sized and larger towns with more than one school it will result in cherry-picking where certain schools will opt for the students who will get the best results to move up the league tables.  We will then end up with the opposite scenario in the other schools at the bottom of the line.</p><p>I want to mention a sector of students who tend to be left out; in the debate on the budget they will be called the squeezed middle.  There is always a major push for students with special needs, but when it comes to performance, results and league tables, the emphasis is on the high achievers.  Those in the squeezed middle who may not have special needs and not do as well academically as those at the top do not get a mention; sometimes they are the also-rans.  It is important that we consider everybody within the education system.  For a particular student to get 250 points can be an enormous achievement, but there will not be a word about it.  All the talk will be about the student who got 600 or 650 points.  On the points system, we talk about employment and progression to third level.  We take the personal aspect out of it.  We talk about producing students to fill jobs available, but there is too much emphasis on this aspect.  We have to think about the person.  Education is about the development of self, irrespective of where one ends up when one leaves the education system.  One will still be a human being and a member of society.  We get carried away in talking about economics and employment prospects and forget about the individual.</p><p>I welcome the relationship between SOLAS and the education and training boards as there was a disconnect between training and education.  I am glad that gap has been bridged because it will help in meeting employment prospects in the future.</p><p>This may sound philosophical, but all of the changes and proposals are necessary.  Some may need tweaking; therefore, it is welcome that they will be reviewed on an annual basis.  However, I would like somebody to grasp the nettle and come back with a model that will start at national school, or even in preschool, with a view to bringing a generation to third level.  We should make the necessary changes, with an input from all sectors of society, to the second and third level sectors as we move along, but we appear to want to change everything at once.  That does not work when teachers and students are half way through a system, a problem arises and we try to change it mid-stream.  It may be a ten to 15 year project, but it is worth considering that we start at foundation level with a model to take someone through all the levels without trying to tweak it on a daily basis while they are still in the process of their education.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss education issues.  We spoke to the Minister at the committee meeting the other day and received a very good briefing from departmental officials yesterday.  My colleague has given a broad overview of Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to the action plan, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to a number of specific issues on which I would like to receive a response.</p> <p>I have said on a number of occasions that I welcome the work which has been done on an Irish language policy.  We are just waiting for the policy to be published and implemented.  I understand this is imminent, but how imminent is imminent?  We have a serious issue in that regard.  It may be clear from the discussions we had yesterday that one of the issues concerning the Irish language is the quality of teaching and the fact that the standard of teachers teaching Irish is diminishing rapidly.  That goes back to the language being taught in schools and at third level.  The 20-year Irish language strategy states there should be a full-time Irish language teacher training college, which might help to deal with some of the issues.  That matter must be re-examined in the context of the strategy, but we have an issue with the standard of Irish being taught by teachers.</p> <p>I commend the work of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp;amp; Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COG.  It is doing fantastic work, but it is under-funded and under-resourced.  Anything that could be done to support its work would be a great help.</p> <p>When I teased out the issue of Irish language teachers, I stated the problem was not specific to them.  I understand there is an issue with science and home economics teachers, as well as the teachers of some other subjects.  There are issues to do with teacher training and the capacity of teachers to teach a subject.  The Minister might outline in more detail his plans to address these issues.</p> <p>I take issue with the point made by Senator Victor Boylan about Gaelscoileanna.  The Gaelscoileanna of which I am aware are diverse and, in many cases, multi-lingual.  There may be a specific example here and there of a school that is being exclusive and I agree with the Senator that this should not happen.  I am sure Gaelscoileanna would agree also.  However, the broader issue is that the demand for places in Gaelscoileanna is not being met by the number of Gaelscoileanna being established.  My understanding from the statistics provided is that approximately 23% of parents wish to send their children to a Gaelscoil but because of the current patronage model, only 6% are being granted their wish.  To a certain extent, there is a need for a decoupling of the Gaelscoil issue from the patronage issue because there is no reason an Educate Together or a multi-denominational school could not also be a Gaelscoil.  It could have a dual function and might address some of the issues validly raised by Members such as Senator Victor Boylan.</p> <p>The other issue about which all of us were asked during the summer was school transport.  There is a real need to build more flexibility into the school transport scheme.  We have seen ludicrous examples of rules being implemented which resulted in children being sent from their own parishes, away from where they play football, to attend a school outside it because the bus stop was 200 metres closer.  I am sure the Minister is aware of many other examples and it points to the need for a review of the scheme.</p> <p>On third level education, I am told by practitioners, specifically teachers of practical subjects, that they are so strapped for funds they do not have money to buy materials to teach students.  I understand this is happening in the institutes of technology, in particular.  They would have had an advantage initially in teaching practical subjects in training students for industry to a certain extent, but I am told the students now coming through are not gaining the practical experience they need.  Also, overcrowding is chronic in some colleges and institutes of technology.</p> <p>Senator Jerry Buttimer talked about the unemployment rate decreasing, but one of the issues, particularly at third level, is the precarious contracts offered.  It is also an issue at second level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are going from school to school and from contract to contract-----</p></speech>

That is something that has to be addressed.</p> <p>What is the Minister&rsquo;s vision for rural schools?  We need to have a plan.  At a recent committee meeting, we heard that the Department does not have figures for how many schools in rural areas do not have multipurpose or PE rooms.  If the Department does not have the numbers for how many schools do not have a PE hall, how can it have a plan for how many it will build and when it will address the issues.  It is easy to bring in a curriculum but without the facilities, it is impossible to deliver on that curriculum.</p> <p>We need to address the issue of island schools and particularly primary schools with one teacher.  It is not possible to have a one-size-fits-all scenario when it comes to island schools.</p> <p>DEIS needs to be reviewed and expanded.  We find more areas where there are issues of social isolation, etc., and DEIS needs to be re-evaluated, so that more children who need to be in a DEIS school get there.</p> <p>I have done a lot of work on gender equality in third level in NUIG.  It is a problem and is not getting any better.  It is not just in the teaching grades but also in the administration and other grades.  We need to address it.  As Michael Barron is in the Gallery, I want to support the comments and policy of Equate Ireland.</p> <p>I look forward to further engagement with the Minister through the committee and other fora.</p></speech>

He pioneered the action plan with the Action Plan for Jobs.  As a way of a Department doing business, it was revolutionary at the time.  He is bringing that same methodology to the Department of Education and Skills.  It is slightly different in that the Action Plan for Jobs in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was very much commercially driven.  Education is driven on the basis of education and social issues but nevertheless the mechanics are still worthwhile.</p> <p>In my area of Limerick, parents have two issues at primary level.  The first is class size, particularly at the lower end.  Many school principals effectively factor in that junior infants, senior infants and first class are of a lower number.  That would be very worthwhile and it is something we need to look at.</p> <p>The second element that is coming up is the issue of physical education and obesity at a very young age.  We need to seriously consider having PE as a subject at primary level.  We need to plan for it.  It would yield major benefits.  It needs to be considered alongside diet.  A growing number of children have diabetes, which is a modern feature that is alarming.</p> <p>At secondary level, there are issues with the school transport system in Limerick.  Much of the system is based on out-dated structures and locations of schools.  People are qualifying for school transport based on a school that people in that area might have attended 20 years ago.  That has evolved over time and, in some cases, the schools have closed.  I know a review is under way.  We need to consider the dynamic of the parishes where people are living, the schools they normally attend and the clubs they play for.  We need to have an integrated model.  I very much welcome that.</p> <p>On third level, I attended UL, which pioneered work experience and co-operative education.  The then president, Ed Walsh, modelled it on the Northeastern University in Boston that had pioneered co-operative education.  It made students very employable.  In most third level institutions, work experience and co-operative education is factored into most courses but not in all.  We need to look at the issue.  All third level courses should have some element of work experience or other practical input - be that for a BA in English or for accountancy.  It would yield benefit.</p> <p>We looked at apprenticeship schemes again here.  They became unfashionable.  People here need to see it as an educational career route, as it is regarded in Germany.</p> <p>I raise a local issue that I have already discussed with the Minister - the two new secondary schools for Mungret and the greater Castletroy area.  The process to appoint a patron is under way.  When does the Minister expect decisions to be made?  The school in Mungret is to be opened in September 2017 and the school is already holding open nights.  The school in the greater Castletroy area is to be opened in September 2018.  What is the status of that process?  When will announcements be made?  It is of huge concern to students and their parents living in the Mungret area and the greater Castletroy area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-10-06a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016100600002#FF00500"><p>I thank the 12 Senators who took part in the debate.  They made some very interesting contributions.  I was somewhat puzzled by Senator Gallagher saying he saw some regressive effect on disadvantaged learners.  One of our objectives in the plan was to increase the performance and the focus on disadvantaged learners.  One of the features of the resource model, with which he seems to be uneasy, is that it puts a much greater emphasis on disadvantaged children because it ties the provision of teaching much more closely with the educational need of the individual child.  That is one of the features of the resource model.  While people can argue about it, it has been piloted with considerable success.</p> <p>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point about not having languages in primary schools.  A pilot carried out a few years ago was not extended owing to financial pressure and other reasons.  In secondary schools, there is a high participation and approximately 80% of students take a language at leaving certificate but we do not achieve high language competence, which indicates that something is falling through the cracks.  Many students do languages at third level and do the Erasmus programme but we still do not achieve.  We are working on a language strategy to try to address some of those issues.</p> <p>It is not true to say that we have ignored higher level.  We have the same ambition for higher level as we do for the others - to improve the learning and teaching, to see more disadvantaged children coming through higher education and to see better connections into the community and into enterprises.  We are bringing the Cassels report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills where we hope everyone will take a view as to how we fund third level education.  It puts up the fundamental choices there.  Peter Cassels has taken a 15-year perspective.  We need an honest debate on how we fund it.  Some people might say they do not like any of his proposals but if we do not have any of them, we cannot fulfil our ambition.  I am interested in engaging in that debate and hopefully together we can frame a longer-term perspective.</p> <p>I do not agree with the Senator that we should abandon the junior certificate award model that has been the basis of teaching in recent years in English and now moving into science and business.  It has three strands.  It has the conventional exam, to which 90% is allocated; a student written project, again tested independently by the examination board for which there is 10%; and a junior certificate achievement certification of the range of things the pupil did within the different curricula headings.  That is a very good model.  Unfortunately, the ASTI has decided it will not engage with it but that is the model of the junior certificate that is in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Senators as well as others to appeal to the ASTI.  We have asked it to suspend its directive in respect of English and to allow that to go ahead and for the pupils to be able to do that.  The new junior certificate is the way to go.  I went out to Adamstown to see the new science, business and coding.  That is happening in schools which are adopting the new junior certificate and it is revolutionary.  It is a much better model for teaching and learning.  It has been good for the teachers and for the students.  We need to stick with the approach that has been put in place and not seek to unravel it simply because there has been some pressure.  I do not agree with that.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of new schools coming into the DEIS programme.  That will be a feature of the plan that we hope to produce by the end of the year.  It will introduce a metric model that is much more independent and based on statistical rather than on random returns that principals had to put together.  This will be based on Central Statistics Office data from the census.  It will be a robust model and will give those that have not been able to participate since 2009 a chance to do so.  I welcome Senator's emphasis on preschool level.  We are trying, through Aistear and S&iacute;olta, to bring forward a good curriculum and standards.  Returning to what Senator Paul Daly said, it is very much at that earlier point that we have to intervene if we want to shape our education system.</p><p>Senator Gavan started off excellently and I thought we were going to have a real engagement about where our education system could go but he seemed to then turn to a prepared script that went back into a very partisan model of discussion.  I like a good debate in this House and I would give the following advice.  I am a former Member of this House and there is much more open debate in it and, to some degree, Members leave their party tags behind them and try to engage.  That is one of the reasons I like coming to the Seanad because it engages at that level in terms of identifying what the problems are and how they can be solved.  Some of the what the Senator's scriptwriter wrote for him is simply untrue.  We have increased the number of resource teachers by 41% since 2011, which represents a huge investment.  We have also increased the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, by 22%, which represents huge investment going into special education.  We are making a big effort to meet what Senator Dolan called for in terms of improving the outcomes for and investment in children with special educational needs.</p><p>We have already increased the number of apprenticeships by 2,000 and our plan is to have another 4,000.  We want not only to work in the traditional apprenticeships area but to move from the existing 27 up to 100, bringing in, as we did last week in Sligo, the first of the new model in insurance.  There is a huge role for apprenticeships and I am very committed to it.  We have lacked in our model in Ireland a stream for training and apprenticeship that would be of equal status with higher education.  That has been a huge gap in our model.  Germany and other European countries have a much stronger stream of apprenticeships with routes into further education in that if one wants to do a degree afterwards, one can.  I visited Liebherr, a German company, in Killarney and it made the point, which I thought was very revealing, that more of its intake as apprentices reach high executive positions and high pay than their intake of graduates.  It is an interesting revelation.  If we get the model right, it has a very fulfilling outcome and very often will bring in people who otherwise would not have got to third level.</p><p>I do not agree with Senator Dolan that there is not an ambition in the strategy for special education.  The second goal outlined in it refers to children with special educational needs and children at a disadvantage.  Addressing provision for that area is a core goal of this strategy.  We are investing in this area.  I will be looking to see better indicators of outcomes for children with a disability to see that we are doing it in the best possible way.  As we move to roll out the new resource teaching model, it will involve more investment but I believe it is a better model.  It is the whole school model, it does not solely focus on a special need assessment of a child and is not time-resourced.  It puts an obligation on the whole school to accommodate the child with special educational needs and it also gets away from the point the Senator rightly made in his comments, that some parents do not have the same access to get an assessment.  We have become too reliant on these assessments and we need to move to a different model.  That is what this new model, designed under the leadership of Mr. Eamon Stack of the National Council for Special Education, will do, and it is being piloted.  The pilot project has had widespread support, notwithstanding some of the concerns that Senator Gallagher expressed.  Change will not always be welcomed by everyone but this new model is the right way to go and I hope we can do that.  I would like to see more capacity to understand the impact in this area and progression to jobs and other ways to progress, as the Senator mentioned.  We need to put more work into understanding that impact.</p><p>I take the point the Senator raised regarding whether there is an omission with respect to the UN convention, to which we are committed.  I was looked at it online and I do not believe there is anything we are seeking to do that in any way would be in contradiction of it, or that we have missed out on something, but we will look at it to make sure that there is not.</p><p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins raised the DEIS review.  We hope to have that by the end of the year.  As Senator Maria Byrne said, it will examine schools that have been excluded.  It will also consider if there are better models, if we can have different approaches, if we can support leadership within the DEIS schools, if we can look at clusters working together to do things and if we can build greater links into the wider community.  We may have to pursue it by way of pilot projects and testing to see what works and what does not work, rather than taking a big bang approach and everything being resolved.  The DEIS programme is very much like a cliff, one is either on it or one falls off the edge and is completely out.  We want to soften that cliff relating to need.  The resource model, if it goes through, will be a very significant player in terms of helping children in disadvantaged schools and children who are in the education system.</p><p>A report on lone parents is in preparation.  It is recognised that there is an issue there.  The publication of that report has been delayed through extra work that has to be done but it is progressing.  I take the Senator Higgins's point that gender progression should be a key part of our higher education strategy.  I thought it was and I have to check that but I thought in the context of the framework of performance we have that one of elements is progression and gender progression in particular, as well as the areas of disadvantage and disabilities are a part of that.  If it is not, we will certainly look at that.  Only this morning I launched an initiative with I Wish, a Cork based organisation originally, which is now going to be run nationwide.  Cork always teaches us things.  It is an initiative to encourage transition year, TY, girls to take up science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, opportunities, which is a huge issue if we want to see more women crack the global challenges that we face.  There is encouragement to participate.</p><p>Senator Higgins raised the pay for newly qualified teachers.  I am delighted that we secured an agreement with the INTO and TUI on that front.  It is a progressive move.  Senator Buttimer asked if we can reach an agreement with the ASTI.  My door is open for its members to get a similar deal that would resolve these issues but they have unilaterally decided to withdraw Croke Park hours and they have also now decided to ballot for industrial action.  I would like to see it set aside that withdrawal of Croke Park hours and get what are real genuine improvements for its members, namely, the substitution payment, the payment for newly qualified teachers, flexibility on Croke Park hours and greater flexibility on getting permanency, which is something all young teachers have rightly felt need for progress on.</p><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly and others raised the importance of leadership and middle management, which was a big victim in the crash years.  I would like to see that rebuilt, and it is part of the agreement with the TUI and the INTO, but we need to look at a middle management structure for a decade's time, what it would look like, what skills it would involve, what functions would be done and what leadership model should occur in the schools.  It is not simply about returning to the posts and so on that we had in the past but designing a good quality leadership structure within our schools.</p><p>School meals are important.  Senator O'Reilly raised the issue of young people at risk who may become alienated from the school culture and if we can we bring them back to it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the junior certificate will engender less alienation because it is more practical but I also believe, as does Senator Reilly, that we need a bigger range of options to give people a second chance and to allow them to come back in.  There are a number of programmes out there like Youthreach, VTOS and the community training centres and they can merge into traineeships and apprenticeships, but we must be very alert.  It is not a case of one chance and all the doors close, which has been too big a part of our model for many years.  There is a greater understanding of that.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has very big ambitions.  I am criticised for having the modest ambition to be the best in Europe.  The Senator has big ambitions to eliminate illiteracy.  From my time in education in the past, I know that this has proved very difficult.  Every country in the world struggles with people with low levels of literacy but we need to steadily improve and that is what I am doing.  It is a bit like the Kerry man - if one wants to achieve some of these things, one would not start out from here.  Unfortunately, in practical terms, I must start with what I find.  </p><p>The same is true of his ambition in respect of patronage.  One could argue that a republic should have no patrons, be they denominational or non-denominational, but the reality is that we have a patronage model.  Not only that, but we have a Constitution that protects the rights of those patrons to run those schools and disallows the State from discriminating between them.  </p></speech>

The Labour Party has introduced a Bill that would look at the possibility of confining a denomination's right to its own catchment area, which would mean that while a denominational school could favour children within a parish - one would have to define what that is - it could not go outside the parish.  That Bill has passed Second Stage and will go to Committee Stage.  There will be issues about whether it is compatible with constitutional provisions.</p> <p>There is a broad sense that this would be fair even among people who value faith-based education.  It is a complicated area.  Senator Boyhan is admirably passionate about what an education system should look like in a republic but we have a Constitution that must be respected, particularly by a Minister who is responsible for upholding it.  There are issues about how we expand choice while respecting the constitutional provisions and the many patrons who put a huge amount of work into managing their schools in a fair way.  I know there are real problems in over-subscribed schools but many schools have a legal obligation to take everyone and do so.  A school that is not over-subscribed cannot reject anyone.  That will be in the law as we pass the admissions Bill.  There is a genuine problem with some over-subscribed schools.</p> <p>I take Senator Boyhan's point about education in prison.  I confess I do not know enough about that to be able to respond to him.  I share his passion for the expansion of apprenticeships and traineeships.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the possibility that perhaps we should look afresh at the Gaelscoil model and that they do lose out too much in terms of patronage.  He hinted at units within schools that would offer all-Irish instruction.  I know that has been acceptable in some areas, but not all.  </p> <p>In response to Senator Buttimer, one never comes to the Seanad without learning something.  Self-actualisation is a new theme but I am sure I will use it again and without attribution to its source.  Senator Paul Daly made an interesting contribution.  I certainly do not believe in turning out people who can make widgets.  People may say I am neoliberal or that I have been working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for too long, but that is certainly not my view of the world.  Increasingly, enterprise does not value widget makers.  It values creativity, the ability to challenge and work in teams and innovation.  Ironically, there is a convergence of what employers and the education system want to produce but I do not think they will ever coincide.  We must value an education that provides people with much broader values, skills and appreciation.  Nonetheless, one of the things we must do is equip young people to progress and do useful work, be it in public, private or whatever sector they choose to end up in.  This must be a part of it.  </p> <p>I also take the point that we should not just focus on the high performers.  That is not my intention and I would be very keen to look at low performers in particular because that is an important part of confronting disadvantage.  I also wish to look at the median or mean - I should know the difference.  We need to not just look at top performance.  To be fair, I do not think that is the approach.  </p> <p>The Senator is right to highlight a concern about reliance on league tables.  At the same time, we must have evidence-based policy.  We must benchmark ourselves against something.  While I agree that everything that gets measured is not always everything we want to achieve, at the same time, we must do our best to see whether investment in a particular area is delivering and making us better than other countries that are doing similar things in similar areas and possibly getting better results.  That is why setting ourselves against the benchmark of best practice is important in any area.  However, we should not become obsessed with league tables, particularly league tables that are often very narrow and that are, let us be blunt about it, put together for commercial reasons.  The people who put together league tables are often selling services.  They can make people at the bottom feel that they need to get a consultant in.  </p> <p>I take the point that we need to start earlier if we want to break the cycle of disadvantage.  That is what was important about that ABC programme in Darndale, Tallaght and a number of other places.  It deals with the mother of the child before the child is even born and looks at things like nutrition, discipline, homework, attitudes to education and books in the home.  It deals with the fact that at the age of three, a child might already be way behind and tries to address that.  </p> <p>In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, hopefully, the Irish language policy will be out within a reasonable period.  I think it is coming to a conclusion.  I have already dealt with the issue of patronage.  In response to Senator O'Donnell, nine schools have gone out.  We are very conscious that September 2017 is the start date so a decision will be made within weeks.  PE will be a leaving certificate subject.  Well-being in the junior cycle will involve encouraging people to look after themselves.  I would love to be in a position to builds more PE halls but they have definitely been squeezed given the shortage of resources.  We are catering for 20,000 additional pupils every year so it is very important that we have school places and they have been the priority.  I agree with the Senator regarding work experience as part of degrees.  It has a huge impact and is at the core of the apprenticeship model.  UL and DCU, which came out of the same stable, value that and others need to catch up with them.</p> <p>School transport is difficult.  The trouble is that one rule book is all we have and we must apply it in 5,000 or 6,000 different parishes and villages.  No matter how we design it, we will have people who are discommoded.  Nearness to school is the criteria and I suppose it is fair and objective.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is under review.

This is not a perfect document.  It cannot be because it does not have all the resources.  I would love to be able to tell my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to give me all of this money.  I hope that in a year's time I will have a stronger case to obtain more money than we received this year and keep aggressively moving on.  If we deliver the ambition we have for this, it will be seen that the investment made in our education system is realising results through delivering a fairer, more equal and balanced society and allowing entrepreneurship and enterprise success in many walks of life to be delivered.  I hope I am putting myself in a position to win the argument for more resources for the education system, but to win it we must do this type of very systematic planning and delivery.
