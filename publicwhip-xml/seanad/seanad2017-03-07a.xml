    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#B00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome the Minister of State.</p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of the proposed Milltown group sewerage scheme.  Milltown is located north west of Monaghan town and is typical of the outskirts of Monaghan, where ribbon development and unseweraged housing clusters have developed on the periphery of the town.  Residents in Milltown recently formed a group sewerage scheme.  They employed a consultant engineer and concluded that the most viable and economic option for the group sewerage scheme was to connect to the main sewer by connecting to a nearby existing housing development called Telaydan Heights.  Milltown group sewerage scheme consists of approximately 30 domestic members and 32 commercial members.  Funding was approved by the Department under the rural water programme for the scheme 2014 to 2015.  There were some outstanding legal matters that needed to be addressed and as a result the scheme did not proceed.  However, agreement has since been obtained by the group to connect to a local sewer pump in Telaydan Heights.</p> <p>The Blackwater, which is the largest river in County Monaghan, and one of the most substantial catchments of Ulster, is close by.  The houses in the Milltown area of Monaghan are serviced by domestic on-site wastewater treatment systems.  The risk of environmental pollution to the Blackwater from these septic tanks is very high due to the age, construction, subsoil conditions, vulnerability and close proximity to the Blackwater River and its catchment streams.  Monaghan town and its environs are constructed directly over a regionally important limestone mass which means, in layman's terms, that the Monaghan public water supply comes from that area.  It is alarming that the septic tanks, which cause pollution, could be interfering with the water supply there.  The Milltown group sewerage scheme's primary aim is to extend the wastewater collection infrastructure, to serve the ribbon developments and unseweraged housing clusters within the area.  It is a matter of connecting 32 septic tanks, which are problematic, into the main sewer.</p> <p>Milltown group sewerage scheme proceeded to tender in 2016 with an estimated cost for the full scheme of &euro;358,000.  The Department, assisted by an expert panel, reviewed and prioritised group schemes throughout the country under the multi-annual programme for 2016 to 2018.  Milltown was a scheme prioritised for funding along with six others throughout the country.  It is estimated that 90% funding would be required for this scheme to proceed, as the minimum contribution per household would be &euro;2,250.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is estimated that they would need 90% funding, as the minimum contribution per household would be &euro;2,250.  There is another scheme where the funding is 75% but that would leave the cost to the householder too expensive and would thus make the whole scheme unviable.  That scheme, therefore, requires 90% funding in order that it can proceed to construction stage.</p><p>Monaghan County Council's environmental section has done great work on this scheme and fully supports it.  It is vitally important that the funding will be allocated, hopefully this year, to this scheme so that the 30 septic tanks can be connected to the main sewer and pollution can cease.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to provide a date for the commencement of this funding.  When will the 90% funding be allocated in order to make that happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue in order to bring some clarity to it.  My Department&rsquo;s new multi-annual rural water programme 2016-2018 includes funding of group sewerage schemes, through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.</p> <p>In December 2015, my Department received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the maximum grant per house to &euro;6,750 - up from &euro;6,500 - to cover a limited number of new demonstration group sewerage schemes, namely, two per year.  In addition, sanction was also given for these new demonstration group sewerage schemes, in exceptional circumstances, to avail of a supplemental grant, subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval, where the project represents the most economically advantageous option.  Where a supplemental grant is approved, the overall level of funding from the rural water programme is limited to 90% of the cost per house subject to a minimum contribution of &euro;2,250 per house.</p> <p>Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids for consideration by my Department under the new multi-annual rural water programme 2016-2018, as Senator Gallagher mentioned.  A proposed Milltown group sewerage scheme was included by Monaghan County Council under measure 4(d).  The proposed scheme, with an estimated cost of &euro;280,000, would cover 32 houses and have a unit cost of &euro;8,750 per house.</p> <p>In total, 83 bids were received from 17 local authorities requesting funding under this measure.  Under the new multi-annual funding framework, an expert panel was convened by my Department to examine the 2016 bids from local authorities for projects under a number of the programme&rsquo;s measures, including measure 4(d), and to make recommendations to the Department on funding.  The panel recommended a priority list under this measure, including the Milltown scheme at priority five, and my Department accepted the panel&rsquo;s recommendations in full when approving the rural water allocations for 2016.</p> <p>As only two demonstration group sewerage schemes can be advanced in any given year, funding will not be available to Monaghan County Council for the Milltown scheme until 2018, unless a scheme prioritised higher than Milltown by the council is not in a position to be advanced this year, whereby in which case the Milltown scheme would be given a higher priority.  It is intended to make interim funding allocations under the programme to the local authorities by the end of March 2017 and any re-prioritisation of the Milltown scheme would be notified to Monaghan County Council at that time.  Therefore, it will be the end of the month before we have an update. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He said that no funding will be allocated for the scheme in 2017 and that it would be 2018 at the earliest.  I appeal to the Minister of State to re-examine that to see if it is at all possible to issue funding this year.  Many local people have gone to a lot of trouble by way of forming companies and employing consultants to make this happen.  It will be disappointing for them if it does not proceed in 2017.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider allocating funding for it this year rather than next year.</p></speech>

They are independent of the Minister and have made recommendations for priority five, which would lead to funding for 2018.  If one of the projects before that drops out, or is re-prioritised in the coming months, there is a chance that it could come into 2017.  As it stands today, however, it looks like 2018.  If so, most people will be happy that it is coming down the track.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand the Senator's request for us to deal with it as urgently as we can, and I will feed that back to our officials, but it is listed as priority five.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for taking the time to deal with this matter, which concerns the local employment service.  My understanding is that over 300 people are employed in the service.  Their role was to assist people to find employment but the one good complaint now is that the number of people who are back at work has increased dramatically.  Unemployment has come down from 15.1% to 6.6% and, as a result, they are now complaining that they do not have work and they are concerned about their future role.  Those people are anxious to have their role clarified in terms of the workload.  My understanding is that as a result of the JobPath programme we are having huge success getting people into employment but the question is about the future for those employed in the service.  Where does the Minister see their position in the next two to three years?  It is in that context that I raise this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#D00500"><p>My Department has contracts with 22 local employment service providers for 2017, the same number as 2016.  Local employment services, LES, form part of the State&rsquo;s employment service and funding for the provision of the LES service has been maintained for 2017 at the 2016 levels of &euro;20 million.</p> <p>The LES is one element of the overall activation service being delivered by my Department, which also includes our own Intreo service and the contracted JobPath service.  They each provide unemployed jobseekers with advice and assistance to identify, pursue and secure employment.  In addition, local employment services provide activation supports to six other target groups most distant from the labour market including refugees, people with disabilities and Travellers.</p> <p>Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath, my Department had approximately 300 case officers, which included LES contracted staff, to  serve over 460,000 people on the live register.  That was equivalent to a case load of over 1,500 jobseekers per case officer as against  international benchmarks for best practice in the delivery of such  services of less than 200 per case officer.</p> <p>In developing the Intreo service and introducing JobPath, the total  number of case officers has increased to approximately 1,200.  Combined with the very welcome reduction in the number of people on the  live register - from a peak of over 460,000 in July 2012 to about 275,000  today - the average caseload is now around 230:1.</p> <p>This reduction in unemployment has also allowed my Department to  increase the quality of case officer support to people who face the most  difficult challenges in finding employment.  These jobseekers are typically long-term unemployed and are dealt with either by the local  employment service or by JobPath.  In line with international norms, my Department is seeking to maintain the case load for this cohort at no  more than 125 per case officer.</p> <p>In order to achieve this level of case officer support, my Department has reduced the number of people referred to local employment services but has asked the providers to increase the time they allocate to work  with each individual jobseeker to provide a more enhanced and higher quality service.  This should result in reduced pressure on the service and also an improved level of service for jobseekers, which focuses on quality outcomes.</p> <p>A customer may be referred to the LES where, following a 12 month engagement with Intreo or JobPath, they are not pursuing an education or training  programme or have not secured sustainable employment.  As I have indicated, the future role of the local employment service and its employees will have a sharper focus on qualitative outcomes for clients referred by my Department.</p></speech>

I note that he is now talking about a lower caseload per person employed in the local employment service.  That is welcome.  I hope we will continue to get a reduction in unemployment and that by early this year the rate of unemployment will be down to 6%.</p> <p>Again, I thank the Minister of State for his response which the people employed in the local employment service will be happy with.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis as teacht isteach inniu.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, for taking the time on 21 February to meet with the residents in Portrane, an area where I was a GP for many years.  Councillor Tom O'Leary, who represented me on the day, was very impressed with the practical advice offered by the Minister of State and his stated commitment on camera to fund works at this location under the minor works programme.  I understand applications of up to &euro;500,000 can be considered.  However, this issue has been ongoing for too long.  The local residents are extremely worried, frustrated and angry that no action has been taken to deal with their plight, namely, the real risk to their homes from flooding by the nearby sea.  The residents have been responding proactively to try to defend their homes from the sea and feel abandoned by the authorities.  They installed many temporary one tonne sandbags in order to protect the boardwalk, which has now washed away.</p> <p>When I was a Deputy and Minister for Health I met with residents and the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Brian Hayes.  Following on from the meeting an allocation of &euro;200,000 was approved for The Burrow in Portrane under a national plan to deal with flood risk and damage.  Nothing practical or real has happened since then.  Reports have been written but real action to deal with the serious threats seems to be at a stalemate.  I regret to say the only wall that cannot seem to be breached at The Burrow in Portrane is the wall of red tape stopping local residents from getting fair treatment and works to protect their homes.</p> <p>The local residents' committee hears of flood defence works being approved at other locations and cannot understand why The Burrow in Portrane cannot get similar funding and works carried out to deal with the threat to their homes from the sea.  Ray Brett, who the Minister of State met recently on his visit to The Burrow, explained to him that &euro;1 million was approved and spent in Lahinch on a similar sensitive habitat area and is asking that such a scheme would be considered for The Burrow in Portrane.  The installation of a membrane dug down 6 m and backfilled to protect the toe and sand dunes seems an environmentally practical solution, which was approved and has been proven in Lahinch.</p> <p>In 2015 Fingal County Council advised a local Portrane family to evacuate their home.  I am sure the Minister of State would acknowledge that is a very serious matter.  I ask him, in a positive manner, to try to progress a solution.  I know the Minister of State wants to do that.  The issue requires a permanent solution.  Has Fingal County Council contacted him or the Department since his visit to The Burrow in Portrane on 21 February, two weeks ago?  In order to bring some sort of finality or deadline to the issue could I suggest or encourage the Minister of State to write to the council CEO, Paul Reid, and ask Fingal County Council to produce a plan for consideration by his officials within four weeks.  I suggest that in one week or two weeks following that, the Department would facilitate a round-table meeting with officials from the OPW, the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council and three members of the Fingal coastal erosion committee in order to agree an acceptable plan that could be considered for approval by the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW.</p> <p>If action is not taken homes will be flooded and under threat, roads will be flooded and the natural habitat and dunes we all want to protect will be gone.  It is time to knock heads together, which I know the Minister of State wants to do.  As a practical man who has dealt with such issues as a public representative, I hope he will agree to setting up this process and arrive at a solution, which I am told he is anxious to fund.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Can I plead that the residents not be subjected to another winter of inaction and uncertainty in regard to the safety of their homes? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#F00200"><p>I thank Senator Reilly for raising this important issue.  I am familiar with the case.  As the Senator said, I visited Burrow Beach and Portrane on 21 February to view at first hand the impact that coastal erosion is having on the area.  As I stated at the time, my office has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline, as part of the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study, ICPSS.  This information has been published and is available to all local authorities.</p> <p>The study enables local authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties, including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works of a structural and non-structural nature.  My office supports and assists intervention management options which are economically justified on cost-benefit grounds and are environmentally sound. </p> <p>Fingal County Council is working hard to identify viable solutions to the erosion problem at Portrane and I look forward to receiving proposals from the council in due course.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, operates the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria, including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.</p> <p>Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of &euro;57,800 under this scheme in 2012 to carry out a coastal erosion risk management study of Portrane to Rush which included Burrow Beach.  The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study.  Following the severe storms of winter 2013-14, funding of  &euro;200,000 was provided by the OPW to Fingal County Council under the Government decision on repair works to damaged coastal protection infrastructure which included projects at Burrow Beach.  </p> <p>Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process which takes place around the entire coastline.  Coastal erosion may threaten human life, infrastructure such as roads and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it should be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects on the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and a supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  </p> <p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by local authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are  economically justified on cost-benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources. </p> <p>Local authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources.  If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.  As intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options.  The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the minor works scheme are available.  I assure the Senator that the OPW will continue to work with Fingal County Council to address coastal erosion issues in the county over coming years, having regard to availability of resources and in the context of the framework for State investment in this area that I have outlined.</p></speech>

I am sure he shares my frustration and that of the residents that funding of &euro;67,000 has been drawn down in order to have a study completed. The study has been done, but no action has been taken.  People are living in fear of their homes.  There is a risk that if flooding occurs and defences are breached, it will affect low-lying land, cut off a large area of recreation and separate 20 or 30 houses from the rest of the peninsula.</p> <p>I am glad the Minister of State mentioned Rush because there is erosion on that beach.  I live in the area and I see the changes on a daily basis.  I plead with the Minister of State to help me to put pressure on to make sure we get a result.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator James Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have spent the money on the studies.  There is no more time now for further vacillation; we need action.  While I accept there is a need for an overall approach to coastal erosion, it is not going to be sufficient to say to the people in Portrane and, to a lesser extent, those in Rush, that we should wait for a country-wide coastal study before any action is taken.  The members of one family, in particular, are in fear that their house will fall into the sea.  We do not want that on our conscience.</p></speech>

The national protection strategy is in place.  When I met the residents in Portrane I said to them that the local authority is best placed to make an application.  If the local authority needs assistance from the Office of Public Works in dealing with that application or the issues that may arise, then, by all means, my office is available to assist it.  On 22 February representatives from Fingal County Council were to meet local residents and local authority members to discuss the options available or to set up what might be an implementation committee.</p> <p>Our door is open.  When I came into office, I wrote to all the chief executives in the local authorities to invite them to make applications for minor works schemes.  We have money and we want to be able to spend it on works that we can get done as quickly as possible, as in the case of this particular issue.  I have seen the damage to the walkway and the debris strewn around the beach.  It is not the way things should be left.  The Office of Public Works will work closely with the Fingal County Council in that regard.</p></speech>

Up to 1.2 million people across Dublin depend on the Dublin Fire Brigade emergency medical services.  Dubliners proudly support Dublin Fire Brigade.  This is evident from the rally that took place last night outside City Hall, Dublin.  Those at the rally were supported by each grouping on the council, including the group of the Minister's party, Fine Gael.</p> <p>In fact, Dubliners have proudly supported Dublin Fire Brigade since its inception.  It is the oldest uniformed organisation in the country.  In 1705, for the first time, four mechanical units were given to fight fire in the city.  In 1898, what we know today as the Dublin fire rescue and emergency ambulance service was established in Winetavern Street in the Liberties in Dublin 8.  It has continued unbroken service to the people of Dublin since then.</p> <p>Senior management at Dublin City Council, led by the chief executive, Mr. Owen Keegan, have decided to change this.  They have decided to fix what is not broken.  They are going to break it up and they want to remove the ambulance call and dispatch function.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Why would this be the case?  Why disrupt an incredible, efficient and necessary service?</p> <p>Members of the fire brigade are present today.  The rest of them are out fighting and saving lives.  They are first responders.  They have come because they are so incensed by what is going on and how they are being treated, especially by Dublin City Council.  They are highly-trained paramedics.  They use emergency vehicles and operate a highly-efficient and dedicated call and dispatch centre that consolidates all fire and emergency calls.  The linkage of the call and dispatch centre with paramedics and emergency vehicles means that both ambulances and fire and rescue vehicles can be sent simultaneously to situations where they are required.  We have car crashes daily from early morning to late at night.  The current set-up means that fire operations can also act as emergency cover if the ambulance is not available.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maire Devine:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When we make or receive 999 calls as nurses, the fire brigade comes to the rescue of people in need 90% of the time.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides a world-class service and has the second fastest response time in Europe.  Its gold standard model has been adopted in Berlin, Tokyo and Paris.  The fire service in London sent staff to Dublin to conduct research on this model and is about to implement the same service.  Lo and behold, on a whim, the CEO of Dublin City Council, Mr. Owen Keegan, using a reserved function has decided to take this away.</p><p>The Minister of State will refer to the HIQA report and its findings regarding the improvement in ambulance response times throughout the city and county, but he must recognise that the expert report dealt adequately with all of the queries, difficulties, scenarios and nuances with which HIQA came up and that there is no need for HIQA to implement its report.  That could be recognised by HIQA, but it certainly needs to be recognised by the Minister of State and the senior Minister.  It is imperative that this service be retained.  I ask the Minister to address the dispute and avert the final option of two days of strike action.  The industrial action would spread nationwide.  First responders are respected, as are all 24-hour emergency service staff, including nurses, doctors and garda&iacute;.  They are the essential fabric of this society and Dubliners are proud to support the fire officers who will be supported by every last man, woman and child in the city if they choose to take industrial action.</p></speech>

I welcome the fire service staff who are present and commend them for their work.</p> <p>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of Health who offers his apologies, to provide an update for the House on the current discussions about ambulance services in Dublin.  The HIQA report on ambulance services which was published in December 2014 highlighted significant public safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  The report identified concerns about the existence of two separate control and dispatch processes and also highlighted the need for greater clinical governance of both services.  It pointed clearly to the need for enhanced integration of service provision in the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>The capacity review published last year examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  It identified deficits in ambulance capacity, including in the Dublin area.  It also identified the requirement for the migration of all call taking and the dispatch of ambulances in Dublin to the National Emergency Operations Centre to ensure a safer and more responsive service.  We all agree that we want such a service.  Implementation of the recommendations made in the capacity review requires a multi-annual programme of phased investment in ambulance manpower, vehicles and technology.  To this end, increased funding has been made available for ambulance services in the HSE national service plan 2017.  New resources will go into the services this year.</p> <p>The  Dublin ambulance services review which was jointly commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council is focused on identifying a service model for the optimal provision of emergency ambulance services and patient care in the Dublin region, including service quality, patient safety, capacity and value for money.  Late last week a copy of the final review, as well as a joint HSE and Dublin City Council implementation plan, was submitted to the Department's Secretary General.  The report and implementation plan are under consideration.  Departmental officials are engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the report and implementation plan, with a view to agreeing a position on the appropriate way forward prior to the submission of the report and a proposed approach to their respective Ministers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> With regard to the expert panel referred to by the Senator, my information is that following publication of the HIQA report in 2014, Dublin City Council established a trade union consultative forum to work towards securing agreement on a model of operation to address the recommendations made in the report.  The forum established an expert panel which prepared a report that provided an alternative proposal on call taking and dispatch functions.  It is understood the expert panel proposed a technical solution to link the Dublin Fire Brigade call centre with the National Emergency Operations Centre.  The Department of Health has been advised that the various options for call taking and dispatch were examined by the Health Service Executive and Dublin City Council in the context of preparation of the implementation plan.</p><p>I am disappointed at media reports this morning that strike notice has been served on Dublin City Council.  The action proposed is not in the best interests of patients who would be better served through engagement to reach agreement on a way forward.  I urge everyone involved in the process to do so.</p></speech>

It is similar to what occurred when nurses voted to strike.  The only interest shown at the time was in who had died.  The Minister of State takes a similar line in arguing that only patients will suffer.  Firefighters do not take industrial action lightly.  They have been forced into doing so and the Minister of State should not use emotional language when discussing the dispute.  His response contained many anomalies.</p></speech>

He indicated that departmental officials had engaged with Dublin City Council and the HSE on the back of the HIQA report.  Why are they not engaging with the experts and professionals working at the coalface who know about value for money?  They also know what response is needed for patients and their families in this city.  Why did Dublin City Council use its reserved function to collapse the negotiations that had been taking place for two years?  No explanation was given for the collapse of the talks in January.  Trade unions cannot be prevented from using their strength and taking industrial action.  The Minister of State has indicated that the expert panel report was examined.  It is obvious that the expert panel was not listened to and that we are coasting along in the hope the issue will not be raised in this Chamber or resolved for the good of Dublin and society as a whole.</p></speech>

I am glad that the terms of reference of the investigation were flexible enough to be covered by the current investigation into the Bon Secours home in Tuam, where bodies of children aged between three and a half weeks to two and a half years were discovered during exploratory excavations.  This discovery is deeply saddening and unveils to us the dark underworld of Irish society.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the commission has referred this matter and the relevant files to the Galway coroner.  It shows that the commission was the correct body to have in place and is working to ensure that we get to the truth of the matter.  It is important that the truth comes out and we collectively reflect on our past, not just for ourselves, but for the victims and families concerned.  We must ensure that lessons are learned and that they will dictate current and future policy, not just on providing safeguards for vulnerable children in care, but for all children going through our education system.  Lessons must also be learned about maternity care so as to ensure that it is given the proper resources, and that proper standards are enshrined in it.</p> <p>Last weekend, I met many people who had no connection with Tuam or Galway, but I cannot put into words how upset they were and I have been about this discovery.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister will provide the commission with the necessary resources to deal with this matter and that we do not forget about it next week when "Prime Time" comes up with another news item.

It has been a very bad and distressing week for many people who grew up in Tuam with the heartbreak of mothers and their children.  The State cannot continue to say, "The poor old nuns."  Where was the establishment?  Where were An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the politicians, the health boards, the health authorities, the teachers, the schools, the community nurses and doctors?  Where were all of the institutions of State?  Every time there was a situation involving abuse people cried "Stop" but nothing seemed to happen.  As politicians, we have serious questions to ask of ourselves, as well as of the political establishment and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To hear the horrific stories of children who were literally tossed away and forgotten is an indictment of our society.  Deaths occurred and we do not know whether they occurred in a violent or unnatural manner.  We are told by experts in the national press this morning that it is possible to trace using DNA.  We must also be sensitive of the needs of the people involved and their families.  We should not move hastily or jump in and be satisfied with another inquiry.  Today I made some inquiries with the redress board.  It is closed to new applications because it cannot deal with them.  That is another issue we need to examine.  I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality, to examine whether Forensic Science Ireland or the Office of the State Pathologist can be of assistance.  These are State agencies which are independent and have expertise.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to Ms Catherine Corless for unravelling this story.  She met opposition from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as outlined yesterday in many news bulletins.  She was refused replies to freedom of information requests and told it was not possible.  There has been a betrayal of trust by the greater authorities in the country.  People were judged harshly and oppressively and treated abominably and unfairly.  It is welcome that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to come to the House on Thursday, but let us move slowly and be very sensitive about where we take it from here.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should also come to the House to address the issue.</p></speech>

We are all shocked by the most recent revelations about the discovery of what has been described as a substantial amount of human remains at the site of the mother and baby home in Tuam.  I commend and thank Ms Catherine Corless for her wonderful work and condemn those who tried to stop her and put barriers in her way.  Let us not forget that many of the mothers did not walk into these places of their own free will.  They were put there by the State which licensed the institutions.</p></speech>

In many cases, their babies were robbed from them and sold or left to die.  The heart-rending stories of mothers begging for their babies are inhumane and gut-wrenching.  Make no mistake: what has been revealed is decades of State-facilitated torture of mothers and children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is much we should do to recover the truth and restore dignity to those buried and ensure the circumstances which allowed these horrors to take place will not be repeated.  There are questions to be answered immediately by the Government.  The burial site is now a crime scene.  If the Government is to involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, what measures have been taken to secure the site?  Will the Leader confirm whether the Garda has been informed and asked formally to investigate the deaths?  The United Nations has stated the investigation does not meet international standards.  Will the terms of reference be amended to allow the Murphy commission to carry out a complete investigation?  Will the Leader formally request the Minister for Justice and Equality to publish the second interim report of the commission without delay?  These is no reason this should fail to happen today.  I would also like to hear from Fianna F&aacute;il which was in government for many of the decades when these atrocities took place.  Why was the party so quick to indemnify the religious orders for a total sum of &euro;128 million when multiples of this figure had to be paid out by citizens of the State?  Individuals and families who suffered most because of these atrocities must be provided with every resource to obtain truth and justice.  The resources provided must reflect the level of atrocity, not only in Tuam but also in mother and baby homes throughout the country.</p></speech>

An inquiry is being held into these shocking events.  All of the people who have been impacted on by their dealings with mother and baby homes and other institutions such as the Magdalen laundries need to be listened to.  The Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors state approximately 35,000 women and girls went to nine mother and baby homes between 1904 and 1996 and that their treatment needs to be investigated.  There should not be a hierarchy of women who suffered.  All women who passed through the homes and want their stories told must be listened to.  We must ensure the ill-treatment is brought to light and will never be allowed to happen again.  In a survey of 5,500 people conducted by <i>The Journal</i>87% felt the mother and baby home inquiry should be expanded.  A woman who had a baby at the age of 18 years in the Bessborough home in Cork says justice for her would mean a full and frank acknowledgement from all of the religious orders and facilities involved.  We owe it to the women concerned to give them the closure they request.</p><p>Grace is another horrendous case.  It is an indictment of our society and how the most vulnerable are treated.  Grace, a young woman with intellectual disabilities, could not rely on the State to ensure she was kept safe.  A full investigation is needed into the decision made in 1996 to remove her from the foster home following allegations of sexual abuse and its subsequent reversal to leave her there following representations made by the foster father.  I hope the terms of reference of the commission of investigation will be widened to include the other 46 service users who spent time in the foster home in question.  How many similar cases are there?  Are there other cases where the HSE, Tusla or the Garda were made aware of sexual or physical abuse allegations against a foster parent and the child was not removed from the foster home?  It is important that we know that no other children are living in foster homes that have been the subject of allegations of abuse.  The most vulnerable in society are always marginalised and still do not have a voice.</p></speech>

We all should commend the commission of investigation and, of course, Ms Catherine Corless, the historian who first highlighted the issue.  Clearly, there is a need to expand the terms of reference of Judge Yvonne Murphy's commission.  She carried out the investigation of 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes as a sample, given the extensive number of county homes in which women were incarcerated.  According to Justice for Magdalenes, there may have been as many as 180 institutions across Ireland which had in their care women who were pregnant and their babies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We need to examine ourselves to see the attitudes that prevailed in Irish society right up to the 1990s, when these institutions remained open.  I mention not only these institutions but also the Magdalen laundries and the industrial schools in which children suffered such abuse over so many decades.  We need to question the terrible repressive attitude towards sexuality, towards women and towards children and the deep and silent suffering experienced for so long by so many women and children and their families.</p><p>We need to acknowledge the fact that so many men were responsible for this.  An enormous silence surrounds that.  For every one of those babies and infants, because some were as old as three, who was found, there was not only a mother but also a father and, indeed, siblings, and we have to think of all that.  </p><p>We have to think about what is still going on today where we are exporting thousands of women to England every year because we cannot face up to the reality of crisis pregnancy and of women's reproductive health needs.  That remains the case today and it is shameful that we are still dealing with that issue in such a repressive and oppressive manner and are still oppressing women and refusing to countenance, confront or acknowledge the reality of life in Ireland and of crisis pregnancy.</p><p>I thank the Leader for arranging a debate on this matter on Thursday.  I hope he will be able to tell us in advance of that debate that the terms of reference of the commission have been expanded.  We will also discuss the Grace inquiry, another instance where a child was very badly failed by the State.  We need to debate the wider issues and the wider context and, as others have said, the role of religious institutions and of religious orders, such as the Bon Secours Order, which is currently before the courts in regard to Tuam where it is facing some serious questioning.  We need to have a broader debate.</p><p>On a lighter note, I wish everyone a happy International Women's Day tomorrow.  There will be a series of events.  We look forward to the series of events in the Oireachtas next year that will commemorate and celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote in Ireland.</p></speech>

I do not intend to rehearse the horror of what happened to those babies and their mothers but I share in the disgust that everyone in the House, and outside it, feels today.  It is important we take this opportunity to commend Ms Catherine Corless, as others have done, and also the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes for bringing these issues to light, even though the process has been very difficult at times.  I also compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, for the prompt, open and respectful manner in which she addressed the issue.  Unfortunately, this frankness and respect was not mirrored last week by the response or, indeed, the lack of response from the Bon Secours Order which ran the home at the time.  It is not as if it was blind-sided by the unexpected news.  It had a considerable amount of time to prepare a response for this but the decision not to comment on the findings has to have been a conscious one on its part.  The motto of the Bon Secours Order is: Good Help to Those in Need.  Many of those who spent time in these homes were in need but I do not believe they ever got good help.  Whatever the circumstances, the children whose lives were very short and ended in Tuam did not get the respect of a proper burial.  The lack of response from the Bon Secours Order further compounds this indignity and is both mean-spirited and un-Christian.  I do not believe this approach is reflective of the values of the majority of the serving sisters, if any, and I call on the Bon Secours Order to provide a truly caring response by giving a full apology as soon as possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Leader to urge the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to use whatever powers and resources are at her disposal to ensure that these children are given the dignity of a respectful burial and that their memory is marked in an appropriate way.</p></speech>

As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I was glad to be associated with that appointment.  Bridget has a long history of service in the Civil Service and in these Houses in particular.  She is a close neighbour of mine in north Kerry.  I know her family very well and her brother Patrick is a particular friend of mine.  I am sure Bridget will be very happy and successful in her position.</p><p>The Cathaoirleach and Leader will recall that I have mentioned the importance of the project on the Shannon Estuary for liquefied natural gas, LNG, on numerous occasions.  I raised it quite recently and, at the Leader's request, I submitted a Commencement motion on it.  I received a welcome reply from the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten.  The LNG project will provide a significant guarantee for energy security in the country once it gets the go-ahead, and will be a huge boost for the entire mid-west region, particularly counties Kerry and Limerick.  I welcome the announcement in yesterday's paper, <i>The Independent</i>, that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has selected two particular projects to support to secure our energy needs in the post-Brexit scenario.  One of those is the LNG project.  This is most welcome news, particularly since the Minister has indicated that he hopes to tap into the strategic investment fund to boost these projects.  It shows that we in the Seanad can be instrumental in highlighting important issues in a non-partisan and non-political way.  This has been brought up as a political football for many years.  It is only since it has been raised here in the Seanad that it has been given a cool and reasonable appraisal.  I compliment the Minister and Government for taking on board the suggestions raised in this House.  Hopefully this long-expected project will finally come to fruition.</p></speech>

I am glad that I was on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission when the appointment was made.</p> <p>Many people have already addressed the situation in Tuam.  I was brought up in Galway in the 1960s, under the tyranny of the famous Bishop Browne, where young girls who found themselves pregnant were sent away on holidays and were not pregnant when they came back.  My colleague, Senator Bacik, hit the nail on the head.  There are tens of thousands of fathers wandering around this country who took no responsibility whatsoever for what they delivered.  I wonder how many are hanging their heads in shame today.</p> <p>There are also thousands of mothers who gave up their children or were forced to do so.  Some believed that they were adopted.  I saw an article in the paper yesterday about a woman saying she believed her brother was not buried in Tuam, but might in fact have been adopted in America.  Can we even stop to think about the pain those women are going through today as they wonder whether they had a child buried in Tuam or sent somewhere else for adoption?  There is not a Member of this House, any other House, or any establishment in this country that has not been touched by this dirty little secret.</p> <p>It was a dirty little secret.  I am aware, with regard to my own family, of a farm being taken off a girl because she became pregnant after her husband died.  The children were sent to orphanages.  This is the kind of country that we lived in and it is time that we pull back the covers and have a look at what went on in this dirty little country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

In the period from January 2016 to January 2017 there was a 74% increase in the number of applications for passports.  Some 60,000 applications are pending.  As is well known, the increase stems from Brexit in that people with an entitlement to an Irish passport are applying for one, particularly in Northern Ireland, Britain and the United States.  Without a doubt, staff in the Passport Office are under a lot of pressure.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has appointed additional staff, but I raise a particular issue concerning the Passport Express system.  There was a ten working day turnaround period from the time an application was made through the post office, but this has increased to 15 days.  The reality is, however, that it is taking a lot longer than 15 days to process applications.  People pay the &euro;80 fee and send off their application using the Passport Express system, thinking they will receive a new passport in 15 days, but they will not.  When they monitor their application on-line, they see that nothing is happening and that the date of receipt might be beyond their travel departure date.  There is an obvious issue about resources in the Passport Office, but, apart from this, it should be made clear that the turnaround time is not within 15 days.  As a result, applicants should apply much earlier.  When members of the public are handing over their money in the post office, there should be a sign notifying them of possible delays.  The extended turnaround time is causing chaos for people in making travel plans.  They are turning to politicians for help, but the problem could be alleviated if the position was set out more clearly.  The Minister should examine the matter.  The severe delays in the Passport Office should be communicated more clearly to the general public.</p></speech>

This will cause massive concern for patients.  St. John's Hospital is a step-down facility for patients from Limerick University Hospital and the bed closures show the chaos in the health system.  It was strange that, at the same time, the Minister for Finance could be seen laughing and cavorting as he announced the takeover of a private hospital, Barrington's Hospital, by another private hospital.  The name of the other private hospital is Bon Secours Systems Limited.

Second, it was inappropriate to do so two days after the horrific confirmation that the remains of 800 babies had been found in Tuam.  Let us be clear: Bon Secours Systems Limited is wholly-owned by the Bon Secours order of nuns.  Let us also be clear on how they got their money.  They got their money during decades of torture, neglect and death, yet the Minister for Finance thinks it is fine to stand and smile for photographs with representatives of a company that made a profit of &euro;2.3 million last year and which is wholly-owned by this order.

I look forward to working with her.</p> <p>Others have spoken about what we saw in Tuam.  It was not shocking because it was well signalled but in terms of the idea of hundreds of babies and children buried in septic tanks, and all of the pain that goes with that, I join those who have called for the commission of inquiry's interim report to be published now.  I understand the Government is waiting to have its response in terms of that but we can no longer delay the publication of the interim report.  We need to expand the commission's terms of reference to the 180 or whatever number of other institutions that must be included.  We must look to questions around the Bessborough mother and baby home, where the mortality rates were shocking and need to be followed up and investigated.</p> <p>I want to follow up on what Senator Bacik said, which is that as well as the debate we will have this week on Ireland's appalling history of institutional violence in the case of Grace and in the case of the mother and baby homes as highlighted on Thursday, we need to have a wider debate on the culture of denial, the overall history of institutional abuse in Ireland and how it came about.  We need a "Why" debate that looks to the patterns of denial, obstruction of justice and the inadequacy of redress.</p> <p>People have called for an apology from the Bon Secours sisters.  We also need compensation.  Every order in this country needs to be paying the compensation it should be paying into the funds, which they have neglected.  They also need to recognise the moneys made on the backs of those who worked in the Magdalen laundries, for example.</p> <p>In that same week we had a story that did not get as much coverage.  Marie Collins, an Irish survivor of abuse, resigned from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors because of what she referred to as the shameful resistance she met within the church to acting for the protection of minors and facing up to past abuse.</p> <p>I concur with Senator Gavan.  We need to ask a fundamental question.  Is it appropriate that the institutions which are obstructing justice in these areas and have this legacy of abuse would be in charge of institutions such as our health or education services?  We, as a State, need to step in and ask that bigger question.</p> <p>My last question-----</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is being blamed by all for delays on this matter.  The Minister had a licence issued in regard to one family in west Cork for the use of cannabis for a young child.  That application was supported by the medical consultant.  A second application was received on 31 January but it did not have the support of the consultant who was caring for that child.</p> <p>It is important that we have checks and balances in this matter also.  The Joint Committee on Health dealt with this matter this morning at which the CEO of the Health Products Regulatory Authority made it clear that the authority now wants to introduce a five year cannabis access programme.  She stated, "Such a programme is necessary both to maximise the safe and effective use of cannabis as a medical therapy for an individual patient and to minimise the potential [negative impact of wider access on society]".  She went on to state, "Patients treated with cannabis should be under the care of a medical consultant who has expertise and experience in the treatment of the specified condition, and who is responsible for the monitoring and follow-up of the patient".</p> <p>The Minister is prepared to give a licence where that is available.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we stop making false commitments to people to the effect that a licence can be issued and there will be no monitoring.  That cannot be done and it would be dangerous to do so.  It is extremely dangerous for children.  Let us get the truth out there.  The licence is available.  It is on the basis that suitable monitoring and supervision is available.</p></speech>

That is shocking and people want to get to the bottom of it, but what is also shocking is the current foster care system whereby 5,000 children are awaiting assessment.  At the same time as people are looking at what happened in Tuam and feel helpless and hopeless, there are children who need fostering.  That is what citizens can do now to help.  The situation concerning Grace is a modern day case similar to what happened in Tuam.  Now it is individual cases instead of hundreds but there are hundreds of young people similar to Grace, children who need our help.</p> <p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins mentioned Marie Collins.  She is another example of how institutions do not want to reform, do not want change and do not want people to be brought to account.  If those children were dying in Tuam today, the people in charge would not go to prison.  The Corporate Manslaughter Bill is before the House.  If enacted, people with responsibility who do not take action would go to prison but because that is not the case those at the top do not care, do not have to care and are not made accountable for their inaction.</p> <p>I beg the Leader's indulgence in relation to an anniversary that falls today.  Today is 7 March, the anniversary of the first flying of the Tricolour from 33 The Mall in Waterford.  I ask that we take No. 33, motion No. 19, on the Order Paper, adopting the protocols on the Irish flag that were drawn up by the Taoiseach's Department.  The man who first flew the flag, Thomas Francis Meagher, had an extraordinary life.  Not only did he participate in a rebellion in Ireland in 1848, but he was the last man sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered here.  Prior to sentencing the judge asked him if he had anything to say, to which he replied: "Well your honour, if you do not sentence me to death, I will try again."  The judge obliged and sentenced him to death but it was commuted to transportation for life to Australia and he ended up in the 69th regiment of the Union Army in the American Civil War and became governor of Montana.  For the historical record of the House, the flag that is flying today over Leinster House was first flown from 33 The Mall in Waterford.  The Ceann Comhairle presented it to the Defence Forces and they undertook that today would be the first day they would fly it from Leinster House.</p></speech>

I am seeking a review of the Irish credit rating system because it is one that offers no forgiveness.  In other countries people are given a second chance, but that is not the case in this country.  Credit unions operate under strict rules imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The social protection scheme which is operated by credit unions and which was designed for people on low incomes has not been availed of by all credit unions.  What about the squeezed middle who renegotiated their loans and are paying their way?  They have had a tough five or six years, but after renegotiating their loans and paying their way, there is a black mark against them.  It is very difficult for such persons to get even the smallest of loans from credit unions or banks.  We need a new system in order that they can take out small or medium-sized loans which they will pay back.  Retail sales at Christmas were down significantly because, whether we like it, the retail sector runs on credit and if we are to get the economy running, we have to help people to get credit.  If they want to take out a small or medium-sized loan, they should be given a second chance.  If they have renegotiated their loans, why put a black mark against them?  They are paying their way.  In many cases, their downfall was the result of circumstances connected to the crash which brought them to a position where they had to renegotiate their loans.  We have to move on.  Many people in middle Ireland are going to loan sharks who are charging interest rates of 200% or 300%, something we want to stop.  We need a debate on the Irish Credit Bureau which is past its sell-by date.  We need to examine how we can help the people concerned.  A new system needs to be introduced because the one in place is Victorian.</p></speech>

He spoke with great conviction and compassion.  We have a lot to lament in the way we treated the living and now it seems our dead.  Let us remember and learn from what happened.  The lesson for us all in this and other cases has to be that every child deserves life, respect and, ultimately, love.  That applies whether he or she is from the great or the small in our society, rich or poor or wanted.  That will be the test of us as a modern society and it should apply regardless of whether a person is a citizen of the State.  I ask the relevant Minister to give us a report on the operation of the recently commenced International Protection Act 2015.  There is a fear among people who know and care that a significant number of deportations of asylum seekers may take place in the future as a result of the operation of the Act.  Newly published figures show that in 2016, 428 asylum seekers and illegal migrants were deported from the Republic.  Lawyers in the International Protection Office in Dublin are assessing applications from asylum seekers under the new legislation for the first time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister talks about this streamlining the old system and says that further measures will be introduced to further enhance the protection and security of our borders.</p><p>There is major concern about the fact that errors could be caused by applicants misunderstanding the extensive application for international protection questionnaire that is required, maybe because of inadequate legal advice.  It is a 60-page document that has to be returned within 20 working days.  This is a tight deadline for someone working with few friends and no influence in the country.</p><p>There is a concern that people would not have the legal or other advice they need, thus making it easier for the State to say "No" should early issues of credibility arise.  However, such issues, perhaps, would not be there if proper assistance and a suitable timeline were available for asylum seekers.  I call on the Minister to initiate a review on the operations of this new questionnaire and to come to the House to inform us and reassure us on how it will operate.</p></speech>

Tomorrow is International Women&rsquo;s Day and to gel it all together I was at the Flowers for Magdalenes event on Sunday.  This is the sixth time we have hosted the event.  I listened to the stories of the women.  One woman said: "They took my hair; they took my human rights; they took my clothes; they took my name; but they never took my spirit."  It was shocking.  It was tearful.  The crowds are growing year on year.  People are looking for their children and families.  Their search goes on.  The women from the Magdalen institutions are elderly.  Some are in psychiatric hospitals or what we used to call asylums.  A handful remain there.  They are unable to speak and have different disabilities.  They do not know what is going on and do not know they are entitled to redress.  The HSE needs to act fast.  I have been banging my head against a brick wall in this regard for a long time.</p> <p>I was in court yesterday with the Magdalen women, including the women who lost their children in Tuam and Cork.  It was horrific.  One such woman is 55 years of age.  Therefore, it did not happen in our parents' time; it happened almost in our generation.  She was forced to give her child away.  She found him and they were reunited two years ago.  Each of the 25 women in court yesterday have suffered mental health issues.  They need protection and answers.  We do not need procrastination.  The man bringing the case against the HSE is searching for his baby sister, who was in Tuam.  He does not know whether his baby sister is alive or buried in the graveyard there.</p> <p>The wealth of the Catholic Church in this nation is relevant.  At the inception of this country our souls and spirits were handed over collectively to those in the church so that they could do as they wanted with us.  What they wanted to do with us, they did.  They took us and stripped away, especially in the case of the poor.  They attacked and hated poverty.  They attacked women and children.  We really need equality rather than simply talking about it.</p></speech>

I did not think we could be shocked anymore after the Cloyne report and the Ryan report.  Speaking in the D&aacute;il at the time of the Ryan report, I said that we cannot blame anyone else for this.  We cannot blame Britain or Germany.  We have ourselves to blame.  We are angry and we are reaching out to blame people.</p> <p>However, the State has been set up since 1922.  Under Article 44 in our Constitution, written in 1937, we gave a special relationship to the Catholic Church.  It was taken out in 1973.  It was deleted.  However, we had a special relationship with the Catholic Church.  That was the decision of the people of Ireland.  This was the political system of Ireland that effectively encompassed almost 100%.

We forgot what did not suit us.  However, we must remember that we were the State.  The State invited in the Catholic Church, which set up those institutions, and we are all culpable.  Our parents were culpable as was everyone else.  What happened the poor women and children is absolutely wrong.  I am not churchgoing or religious.  However, the Catholic Church is absolutely wrong.

It is absolutely shocking.  Accountability is needed because this is devastating for families.  To bring it up today is heart wrenching.</p><p>I also wish to speak on rural Ireland.  For the past few weeks, we have been hearing that there is so much extra work available and that is welcome, but it is in the cities.  The House will be aware of today's announcement that the Government has recommended the closure of 80 post offices in rural Ireland.  I read it in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  That the Government has recommended the closure of 80 sites, mainly in rural areas, is a massive blow to rural Ireland and the future of post offices.  At the same time Ulster Bank is expected to shut up to 30 branches, again mainly in rural locations.  I have been fighting for rural Ireland since I came into the Seanad.  Rural Ireland is forgotten by this Government.  The communities there - the shopkeepers, the doctors and the post offices - are forgotten about.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the House to discuss the matter.</p></speech>

Some 4 million tonnes of peat are being stripped from Irish bogs yearly by Bord na M&oacute;na.  Only 60 million tonnes of peat are left in our large bogs, which are controlled by Bord na M&oacute;na.  At the current rate of extraction, which has been capped by the EU in recent years, we have 15 years left before the bogs as we know them will be gone and the Irish landscape will be changed.</p> <p>I was contacted recently by a number of miscanthus growers who had been contracted by Bord na M&oacute;na.  This grass was being grown as part of a dual fuelling system with peat over the past ten years but, overnight, growers got notice that this grass would no longer be burned and would no longer be needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the time, Bord na M&oacute;na with great fanfare encouraged people to embrace renewable energy.  The company said the grass would grow every year and this was the best thing since the sliced pan.  It is incredible that the company could leave them high and dry.  They were given a spurious excuse about chlorine levels.  This was not covered by an EU regulation and, therefore, it was a way out.</p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na is importing palm kernel shells.  They are not certified and there has not been a full explanation about this product.  It is imported from Indonesia.  The shells come from rainforests that have been cut down and harvested.  The company cannot sit idly, do what it wants, and deal with whom it wants.  It is bad enough to pillage our own country without any regulation but importing such products from another country is unacceptable.  Bord na M&oacute;na is on the loose.  I second amendment No. 2 to the Order of Business in the name of Senator Daly.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhgairdeachas a gabh&aacute;il le Bridget Doody as ucht post nua a glachadh.  In congratulating her on her appointment, we are blessed and lucky as a House to have a person of her calibre.  I have had the pleasure of working with her on a number of initiatives in the Oireachtas and I have always found her to be a professional, courteous, efficient and very kind person.  I wish her well in her tenure with us.  I hope this is the beginning of a new partnership and that the Seanad Office will be expanded.  I wish her every success.  It is a pity that Senator O'Sullivan outlined her Kerry heritage, which might be a red mark against her.  I am glad she is wearing a red dress today to represent Cork.  I wish her well nonetheless.</p> <p>I thank the 15 Senators who directly or indirectly raised the awful vista of what is emerging about the Tuam mother and baby home.  It is important to put this tragic story in context.  These were young infants and newborns.  These human beings were let down by the State, the church, society and their families as a result of the culture that prevailed at the time.</p></speech>

It is imperative that as a society we deal with the awful legacies of our past, as the Taoiseach said.  They are an awful blight on the name of Ireland, on our people, on our culture and on ourselves.  It is equally important that we praise Catherine Corless for the work she did.  She pursued it despite barriers and obstructions often being put in her way.  Those of us who are part of a minority recognise there was a repressive culture in our society.  That repression frightened and intimidated people and that is why I am glad we have a separation of church and State.  That is why we, as Oireachtas Members, can govern and bring forward legislation without fear or favour.</p> <p>I reiterate the call I made last week, which was referenced by many Senators earlier, for accountability in our country for once and for all.  The people who were responsible for or party to what went on must be held to account.  We must learn once and for all from the past.  We said this following the Murphy and Cloyne reports.  We must learn for ourselves and the generations coming after us from this and put in place processes where there is accountability and through which those who are responsible are held to account.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with Senator Feighan that our education system, church, garda&iacute; and State in general hid or allowed people to be hidden and held in these homes.</p><p>Senator Devine referenced the Magdalen women and the industrial schools, as did other Members.  Where was the State?  Where was society?  Some of us in society at that time condoned this through our silence and inaction.  There comes a time when we must stand up and I praise all those men and women who did.  I know some of the women and their children who were in Bessborough.  Senator Devine is right that many of our fellow citizens are suffering from mental health issues because they were so callously treated by our society and our State.  There is a duty of care on all of us, no matter who we are or what our political hue is, to look after and treat these people properly and with dignity and respect.  Every day, these people seek justice and truth.  In many cases, they lament the way they were treated; that they were forced to give up their children against their will and were told they must do that or go across the pond to England.  That is no way for a society to function or for a State to act.</p><p>I hope that through the children's referendum, the referendum on divorce, the referendum on marriage equality and the Child and Family Relationships Act we can put things right in terms of how our State governs and legislates for people.  We must ensure that the commission of investigation gets up and running, gets answers and seeks the truth so we can put in place a structure for the women and children who have been let down by our State.  Our society was very quick to judge.  It was very harsh in its sentencing of many women.  That is the legacy we must not obscure or airbrush.  We must make sure we never forget so that the next generation is treated with respect and dignity.</p><p>As the Cathaoirleach said, we will have debates on these matters in the House this week.  As Leader, I was very keen to expedite those debates and not push them out to the week after next.  I apologise to Members for the change in schedules this week.  Some of the changes are because of the importance of the issues raised on the Order of Business today and because some Members will be missing for the statements on defence on Thursday and I wanted to ensure those who requested the debate would be present.  I agree 100% with Senator Devine when she says that those who have to pay, must pay, irrespective of who they are.  The resignation of Marie Collins sends an awful signal to me.  This is a woman of integrity, a woman of decency and a woman who inspires many of us.  If she is speaking about obstruction of justice or about not being able to get to the truth, that sends a wrong message to me.</p><p>I hope we will be able to have an honest debate and that Members of this House will be able to contribute to terms of reference for the commission of investigation, which is important.  It is clear that there is a yearning in society for truth and for justice.  I hope we can achieve that for children, parents and women.</p><p>I hope we can send a signal to the fathers of children that they also have a responsibility and duty of care.  It is not about going to the courts, seeking custody or being asked to pay maintenance.  If one is the father of a child, one has a responsibility and must live up to it.</p><p>Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of the energy security to be provided by the liquefied natural gas, LNG, project.  I very much welcome it.  The Senator is correct that it highlights the importance of this House, where one can get projects and legislation amended or passed.  I congratulate him on raising that particular project.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Mulherin raised the issue of the Passport Office.  The Minister has appointed extra staff but the issue of Passport Express is something that the Senator should perhaps raise as a Commencement matter.  We will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue in respect of the number of days and the delays in terms of Passport Express. </p><p>Senator Gavan raised the issue of St. John's Hospital.  It is important to understand the role of the Bon Secours group today.  We cannot associate the Bon Secours hospital group today with the events of the past.  Many very fine people are working in those hospitals and they provide a very important resource in our health care system.  It is, to be fair, a bit disingenuous to associate the Minister for Health with that.  The issue the Senator raised would be far better served by not being intertwined with the issue he has referenced.  My understanding is that the Minister for Health was opening a new facility there yesterday.  We should all welcome any facility being opened in our health care system.  It is a different matter whether we have a one tier system or a private-public system.  I will have that debate with the Senator again.  </p><p>On the issue in terms of the beds, I have been told that some of them have just been closed temporarily and that extra funding is being sought and is being negotiated with the HSE.  Again, any closure of beds for whatever reason is unacceptable.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House but perhaps the Senator might table a Commencement matter.  It is a matter of importance to have beds open and not closed. </p><p>The issue raised by Senator Colm Burke in respect of cannabis medical treatment is in the news today because of the walk of Vera Twomey on behalf of her daughter, Ava.  All of us who have any decency and compassion want to see this family get access to treatment and to have their daughter looked after in a compassionate and prompt way.  There is a lot of misinformation about this issue.  The Minister, as Senator Burke said, cannot issue the licence.  This is about ensuring that there is expertise and monitoring and that we can get access to treatment for this child, and in general.  As Senator Burke rightly said, the HPRA report, which is out today but which I have not yet seen, makes a recommendation.  The Chief Medical Officer last night issued a very important, comprehensive statement in respect of the process that is under way to establish an access programme for cannabis based treatments, the first of its kind in Ireland.  He also, in his statement, refers to the period for which this access programme is being established and states that is open to the Minister to provide a licence for access to cannabis for medical purposes in individual cases.  It is also about being endorsed by a consultant, who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  In his press statement the Chief Medical Officer says it is crucial that the granting of any such licence takes due care and consideration of the potential unintended consequences associated.  It is also important to recognise the independence and importance of the patient-doctor relationship.  </p><p>The important point is that there is a process under way.  We all want to see, in the case of Vera Twomey and her daughter, Ava, treatment being given and the child's life and quality of life being improved.  I hope we can all work to achieve that. </p><p>I am happy to take Senator Daly's amendment.  As I said to him before today, I was happy to have him place this issue on the Order Paper.  Perhaps it could be a project of the Seanad.  The booklet on the national flag is very important and we should look at it in terms of how we can not just fly our flag, but care for and respect it.  Looking at some of the imagery on television, at soccer, rugby or GAA events, at election counts or wherever, the way we respect our flag should be noted.  I would draw all Members' attention to section 13 regarding respect for our national flag and how we use and fly it.  I commend Senator Daly for his initiative and I would be happy to take the amendment today.</p><p>Senator Norris referred to President Trump and raised the issue of fake news.  Senator Butler last week got a lot of traction on his commentary here in regard to fake news and alternative facts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important, in any political debate, that we do not reach the line of populism and try to curry favour with whomever.  We must present the real facts, as Senator Butler said last week.  Whether they are lies or a misrepresentation of the facts or the truth but whatever they are, it is important that there is a proper adherence to what facts are.</p><p>Senator Butler raised the issue of the Irish credit rating system.  I agree with him that we must examine the system.  In my opinion it is not fit for purpose as presently constituted.  Legislation must be brought in so as to ensure that people are given a second chance.  </p><p>As a former supervisor of my credit union in Bishopstown, I am deeply concerned at the way the Central Bank is working with credit unions.</p></speech>

We all accept that there should be regulation and oversight.  The credit union movement that Nora Herlihy set up was not meant to be considered a bank but to work for people in communities in all parts of Ireland.  I am very concerned at the way the Central Bank has treated credit unions.</p> <p>Senator Mullen asked about the operation of the International Protection Act 2015.  I am happy to invite the Minister to come to the House to debate the matter. </p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of post offices.

The biggest area of job creation in this country was outside Dublin in the past year.  Approximately 1,300 jobs per week have been created.  As much as 70% of the jobs created last year were located outside Dublin.  That proves the recovery is beginning to happen beyond Dublin, which is a fact that we all welcome.</p> <p>Some of the decisions taken by local authorities in the past have led to the decimation of many rural towns due to building taking place on the periphery of such towns.  Senator Murnane O'Connor will know quite well what I mean.  We need to reincentivise urban towns in rural Ireland in terms of the living over the shop scheme, etc.  Last week Senators Butler and Davitt spoke about rates.  We have the Seanad consultative committee.  I hope that the committee, as part of our work, will in time consider rates as a means to help revitalise rural Ireland.  It is an issue that Senator Murnane O'Connor raised as well.</p> <p>Senator Davitt raised the issue of Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am unfamiliar with what the Senator mentioned.  He made a pertinent point that needs to be considered by the Minister in the context of the role of Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of alternative fuel, and how it can continue to create employment in rural Ireland and work with communities.

I thank the Cathaoirleach for using his powers and discretion in moving the motion.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle as well for facilitating and placing a Tricolour flag from 33 The Mall over Leinster House today.  It is an important occasion on this the 150th anniversary of the death of Thomas Francis Meagher this year.  I thank the National Parks Service in the United States for putting a plaque on the Washington monument to commemorate the 1916 Rising and Thomas Francis Meagher, and I thank Ms Nikki Buffa who is Deputy Chief of Staff for her assistance.</p></speech>

These principles are enshrined in Article 12 of EU Directive 97/67/EC, as amended by EU Directive 2008/6/EC, and provide that the tariffs must be,<i>inter alia</i>, affordable and cost orientated.  These directives are transposed into Irish law by the 2011 Act.</p><p>Article 12 of the directive provides that member states will ensure that the tariffs for each of the services forming part of the universal service comply with the tariff principles.  The requirements are clearly intended to apply only to the universal postal service, and it was on this basis that the Act was drafted.  It appears that the intent of the proposed amendment to section 28(1) of the Act is to widen the scope of the tariff principles beyond the universal postal service.  Such action would represent a significant change in policy and require detailed consideration and analysis as well as consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>I advise the House that an identical amendment was tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  It was argued that the extension of regulatory measures in this manner and without detailed consideration of its impacts was not appropriate.  On that basis, the amendment was withdrawn.  The position remains unchanged.</p><p>Regulatory measures are generally introduced to address issues arising in a particular market and should be introduced where necessary and only in line with the principle of proportionality.  There has been no signal from the market of the need for regulatory measures in terms of tariffs outside the universal postal service.  Indeed, the level of competition in the packets and parcels market has already been highlighted by ComReg.  In addition, real competition in the form of alternative delivery solutions can be observed in the significant decline in mail experienced by An Post as a result of e-substitution where some large customers are moving to electronic alternatives.</p><p>The main non-universal service obligation services are parcels, publicity post, PostAim and Express Post.  There is competition in these areas from private operators such as DHL, FedEx, Nightline, Fastway, CityPOST, Lettershop and the Leaflet Company, to name a few.</p><p>For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Senators Boyhan and McDowell to section 28(1) of the 2011 Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Denis Naughten:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Turning to the amendments proposed by the Senator to section 28(5) of the 2011 Act, I must first address the inclusion of the term "may fail".  While I understand the wish to see the powers of the regulator strengthened, widening the scope of the powers to include a determination the universal service provider may fail is too subjective.  It is difficult to see how ComReg should judge that a universal service provider may fail in its obligations to comply with the tariff principles.  In considering this amendment I consulted ComReg, which agrees with this assessment.  I understand and am cognisant of the impact this measure might have on consumers and the SME sector.  In this regard I have issued a policy direction to An Post instructing that the price increases introduced following the repeal of the price cap mechanism must be subject to prior consultation with ComReg and have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the 2011 Act, as well as the interests of personal users of postal services and SMEs.  I have reiterated this in person to the chair and chief executive of An Post.</p><p>With regard to the substitution of the word "shall" for "may" I do not believe it is appropriate to make obligatory the issuing of a direction.  A direction referred to in section 28(5) is an enforcement mechanism which may be used by ComReg, and detailed procedures around the issuing of such directions are provided for in section 51 of the 2011 Act.  There may be some instances under section 28(5) where a formal direction of this nature may not be appropriate or necessary and, therefore, it is important that ComReg retains the discretion provided for at present.  For the reasons I have outlined I am unable to accept the amendments as they have been proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-07a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017030700002#DD00200"><p>I ask the Minister to give the rationale behind the Government's decision to walk away from the question of the pricing of stamps, which is the basic issue.  Will the price of a stamp increase from 72 cent to 92 cent or &euro;1?  I was at the Department a long time ago and something we would never give away was the authority of the ministerial office to decide this because it is a law of diminishing returns.  The more it increases the less is received.  The more competitive it is made the better it is.  There are other options, such as an increase for express post.</p> <p>I do not particularly like Ministers giving away power.  I am dealing with Coillte at present, which is not under the control of anybody.  It is a commercial semi-State body and it can do what it likes.  My colleague discussed Bord na M&oacute;na earlier today.  The commercial semi-State bodies have a loose hand in dealing with the public, and the Minister knows what is going on in our area because he was at the meeting.  This is an example of the removal of ministerial power from semi-State bodies.  They can walk into our area and try to destroy it with wind turbines and they do not care a damn.  They do not care about the Minister or me and they do not care about the public.  They are only interested in getting maximum subsidy through their work.</p> <p>I will not second the amendment because I have not dealt with it and I do not know what its implications would be.  I accept the Minister's response.  I was away in London last week dealing with Brexit issues when this matter came up.  On principle, there should be control over the cost of stamps.  The Minister knows when the price of stamps increase the number of people who use them decreases.  It is the law of diminishing returns.  What is the Minister's rationale for this decision?</p> <p>It is proposed to close 80 post offices and there is a lack of business in post offices.  When the price of stamps increases the post offices' cut decreases because they rely on a percentage of sales to keep them in business.  This is a very concerning time.  I cannot understand why sub-post offices are not the responsibility of the Minister.  Why are they under the aegis of the Department with responsibility for rural development?  When I was at the Department, all post offices were the responsibility of the Minister at the time and we ran the whole show.  We ran it without An Post and we made money, but that is another day's work.  We were trying to be innovative, but we were not competing to the same extent with the Internet as it was just about to start.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An Post made bad decisions on many communications issues.

These powers are contained in section 30 of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 which the Bill seeks to repeal. </p> <p>Having listened to the Minister's contribution, I do not propose to speak in detail about the problems in An Post, including post office closures.  We will discuss these matters on another occasion.  I am advised by Senator McDowell that he wishes to put this amendment to a vote, although that decision is one for the House.  There were few Senators present to hear the Minister set out his stall but perhaps more will come later.  I respect the views expressed by the Minister and I have little to add to them.  Senator McDowell has given this matter some consideration.  There has been substantial correspondence on this issue, on which people take different views.  I await the Minister's response.</p></speech>

I welcome him back to discuss this important and urgent legislation.  Given the position of the postal service, I hope the Bill will go some way towards resolving An Post's problems in the short term.  Any delay in passing it would not be appropriate.</p> <p>The amendment proposes to change the universal social obligation with regard to parcel post, express post and other issues.  As the Minister explained, it would be inappropriate to do so.  When the amendments were introduced in the D&aacute;il their proposers withdrew them in response to the arguments made by the Minister.  It would be helpful if the House were to compromise on these issues to allow the Bill to pass and place An Post on a good footing for a short period.  We all know radical changes will be made to An Post's structure in future.  That is the real issue.  We are fighting over minor issues such as the universal social obligation that applies to parcel delivery and express post.  These are areas where the market is highly competitive.  It is logical to change the legislation regarding this matter. </p> <p>I request that the amendment be withdrawn.  This would send out a signal that Members of the Oireachtas are putting their shoulders to the wheel on this important issue.  We need to firm up An Post and the Chamber must send out the right vibe because An Post faces serious issues.  I am greatly concerned about the organisation and wish the Minister the best of luck in this matter.  In some senses, we should save the debate for the bigger issues coming down the line because they will present significant challenges to everyone in the Chamber.  </p></speech>

I will deal with the most significant one first, which was raised by Senator Boyhan.  I echo what Senator Lombard said.  There is no realisation here of the issue with which we are actually dealing.  Senator Leyden also raised a number of issues, which I will come to in a minute.  If these amendments are accepted here today, our debate is pointless.  We have explained to the spokespersons how significant and imperative it is that this legislation goes through.  If these amendments, which were withdrawn in the Lower House on the basis of the arguments I have put forward, were to be accepted, I would have to go back to Government because there would be a significant policy change involved.</p><p>We are talking about introducing a universal service obligation in the parcel sector, which is a very competitive sector.  It is the most competitive and growing sector in the postal division in the country and right across the world.  It is extremely competitive so I do not see why we should regulate a system that is working quite well.  I have not seen the failure or heard an argument from anyone in the Lower House or here about how the system is failing at the moment.  I do not see the logic behind putting forward an amendment to interfere in a system that is already working.  Let me be crystal clear.  It is up to the House to decide on this amendment but if it is carried, I will be asking each one of the Senators to go back to their communities and explain why the five-day postal service is no longer available to them as a result of the delay in this legislation.  This is about protecting the service we have at the moment.  I made it crystal clear when I brought this issue to the attention of Government at the time of the publication of the legislation, on Second Stage in the Lower House and here, the reason it is of critical importance that it is enacted swiftly.  That is why I have taken the step I have taken to remove ComReg from this process.</p><p>Coming back to Senator Leyden's question, the decision to have ComReg regulate this was taken in 2011.  That is when the power over pricing was taken away from the Minister.  ComReg has been involved in it and it has increased the price of the stamp.  The difficulty is that those price increases do not reflect the current financial situation the company.  It requires a significant increase in the price of the stamp.  I do not know what that figure is at this stage.  Senator Leyden was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so he knows that part of the reason the company did not take the opportunities it should have taken in the past was ministerial interference.  The Minister<font color="#FF22FF"> </font>has the power to appoint members to the board of all of these semi-State companies and we now have a system in place through PAS so we can have people of ability appointed to those boards who can actually add to them.  We had some very good people and we had some mediocre people on boards in the past.  Since the new system was introduced, we have had excellent applications from people.  I say in particular to my county colleague, Senator Leyden, that we want people of ability who are willing to serve on State boards, in particular people from outside the Dublin region and very capable women.  There are many of them out there who are well able to sit on and contribute to boards.  I want to see far more women actively participating on boards.  I appeal to anyone who has any interest in this area to make an application through the PAS system to sit on State boards under my jurisdiction or that of other Ministers.</p><p>Senator Leyden is right that increasing the price of the stamp will have an impact on the number of stamps that are purchased.  There is an issue of elasticity there.  It is something I am very conscious of and I have asked the company specific questions about it.  I am satisfied that the income and moneys required by the company can be brought in even with this change in the legislation.  </p><p>I also read the article about the 80 post offices this morning.  Discussions are ongoing between the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post on a way forward for the post office network.  The post office network as a whole is making a profit.  There may be aspects of it that need to be improved but, as a whole, it is making a profit.  The difficulty is that the mail service is haemorrhaging funds at the moment and we need to take immediate action on it.  That is why this legislation is so urgent.  The company hoped this legislation would have been enacted at this stage and it has expressed concerns regarding it.  I hope that with the co-operation of the House, we can pass this legislation today.  If there are amendments to it, we will have to go back to the drawing board and it will be the responsibility of Members of the House to explain to the staff and communities around the country why there is a significant threat to the five-day postal service.</p></speech>

It is all very well people coming in and having views, but there is nothing wrong with putting down an amendment.</p> <p>A number of issues are involved.  I take on board that the Minister wishes to see the postal service really succeed.  We also have a responsibility.  I admire anyone who takes the trouble and time to prepare amendments.

I have come to the House as the Minister.  I have answered the questions and given my justification.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, gave the justification on Second Stage and Committee Stage in the House because I was physically not able to attend.  My difficulty is that I have set out logically the reason this does not make sense.  There is not market failure.  I have had this argument with Deputy Ryan, who drafted and tabled the amendments in the D&aacute;il.  He understood the point I was making and withdrew the amendments on that basis.  The difficulty is that the Senator is saying he has been given an instruction to press these amendments without hearing the argument I have made.  No one has given me a reason for the market failure in the parcel service.  Senator Boyhan has not given me an example of the market failure and yet he is pressing the amendment that has serious financial implications for the company.  If the Senator wants to press the amendment, he should show me the justification for pressing it.  He should not come to the House and ask me to respond, which I am quite willing to do, but not listen to my response.  I have responded to any question that has been asked by colleagues here.  I could stay here all evening answering questions that people want to ask about this.  I have no difficulty with that, but there is not much point, with due respect, in me, as Minister, coming in here answering questions and for the Senator to ignore the answers I have given because he is under instruction to press the amendment.

I like to be responsible.  Rather than waste people's time, I will accept the decision.  I thank the Minister for taking the time and trouble to deal with this.  Perhaps the next time he is here, we might actually have a copy of the response.  We could only listen to the Minister today.  He made a very valid point on engagement and teasing out the issues.  Rather than waste time and play politics with this, I will accept the democratic decision on the amendment.</p></speech>

The normal process on Committee and Report Stages is to move the amendment, have the argument and hear the response of the Minister.  The Senator is not the person who has drafted these amendments, which I accept.  I am quite willing to give him the reason I cannot accept the amendment and let him respond to that.  I have no difficulty with that at all.  I am here to try to answer as many questions as I can.  That is the reason I came in here as Minister, and I have tried to come into the Seanad at every opportunity.  I believe I will be here tomorrow morning for two Commencement matters.  It is my intention as Minister to engage with both Houses as much as I can.</p></speech>

Further such reviews shall be undertaken at least every two years, thereafter,&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</blockquote></speech>

Terminal dues are rates paid for delivery of international inbound mail items.</p> <p>I was mindful of the concerns expressed in regard to the impact of terminal dues on An Post.  In this regard, during the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il I had instructed my officials to liaise with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft an amendment along the lines proposed by Senator Michael McDowell.  As was outlined on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, the clear advice of the Office of the Attorney General was that an amendment of the nature proposed would create legal uncertainty and likely impact upon ComReg's existing powers under the 2002 Act.  More worryingly, it could potentially leave previous actions undertaken by ComReg on terminal dues open to challenge.  Nonetheless, my officials continue to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to develop a provision that would go some way towards addressing the issues raised in regard to the issue of terminal dues.  Consequently, a Government amendment was accepted on Report Stage that requires ComReg to consider any consequential impact of the repeal of the price cap on terminal dues as part of the review of the repeal of the price cap provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  ComReg has advised that it will continue to review terminal dues agreements against the provisions of section 29 of the 2011 Act.  Having regard to the Attorney General's advice, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Senator Michael McDowell and trust that the Government amendment accepted on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il clarifies the issue. </p> <p>It has always been my intention as Minister to try to facilitate amendments coming from the Opposition whenever I can.  I have done so in respect of any Bill I have brought through the Houses, and I will continue to do so.  I will put my officials under pressure to accept amendments or to justify why they cannot be accepted.</p> <p>I accept an issue arises over terminal dues.  I listened to the arguments put forward by the Opposition on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  On foot of my doing so, we drafted an amendment for Report Stage to address the issue.  As a result of that, I ask Senator Boyhan to withdraw amendment No. 2 in favour of the provision we have already made on Report Stage in the Lower House.</p></speech>
