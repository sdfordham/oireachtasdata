I know that in the past he was unable to attend here due to work reasons and I thank him very much for coming here this morning.</p> <p>I rise today to raise the issue of the 50 m swimming pool in the University of Limerick and the fact that the Munster swimming team has no place to practice at the moment.  The team is being disenfranchised when compared with the Connacht, Ulster and Leinster teams.  The Leinster team practices at the National Aquatic Centre and the other teams have access to 50 m pools.  In fact, there are only two other 50 m pools in the country, one is located at UCD and the other is located at the National Aquatic Centre.</p> <p>The pool at the University of Limerick caters to the Munster swimming squad.  I know one small part of the pool is missing but other parts must be replaced in order to solve the original problem.  There is also quite a cost involved to replace the missing part.  It is all about moving the floor.  Unfortunately, no competitions could be held in the pool since around October and no repairs have happened to date.  I ask the Minister of State to release funding and to take the case on board.  A number of teams covering all ages have been disenfranchised by the closure.  Recently the Munster national swimming competition had to be cancelled because the pool was not in working order.  </p> <p>I again thank the Minister of State for coming here and I look forward to hearing what he has to say. </p></speech>

The programme provides for a maximum grant aid of &euro;3.8 million per project.</p> <p>Four principal stages must be undertaken to develop a swimming pool project.  They are as follows:  A preliminary report, including a feasibility study; contract documents; tender stage; and, finally, construction stage.  The Department's technical adviser evaluates each stage.  Projects may not proceed to the next stage until prior approval has been issued by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>I understand that the 50 m pool at the University of Limerick was opened in January 2002 with the majority of funding being provided by the then Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The facility included a pool boom that allows the swimming pool to be segregated into different sizes thus allowing it to be used in multiple formats at the same time. </p> <p>Swim Ireland has a pool usage agreement with the UL Sport Arena.  The agreement gives access to the pool for training and competition.  The agency established a full-time performance centre at the facility that ensures swimmers receive 50 m pool access, specialist coaching, gym access and additional support services to help them reach their sporting potential.</p> <p>I am aware that Swim Ireland first started to highlight the need to upgrade the pool boom some years ago.  In 2015, the facility was inspected by engineers who agreed that the best overall solution was to replace the existing boom with a new one.  Accordingly, in 2016, UL wrote to Sport Ireland and my Department seeking assistance towards the replacement cost of the boom.  Swim Ireland supported the request.  It highlighted the fact that the lack of a boom was having an impact on training and competition opportunities for swimmers in the region.  The request was considered within my Department.  Earlier this year my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, and the Minister approved a once-off allocation towards the cost of the replacement of the moveable boom in UL's swimming pool.  The necessary administrative work has continued in the interim.</p> <p>Last month, my Department gave approval to UL to proceed to seek tenders for the replacement boom.  I understand that it is hoped to have the necessary work completed next year during the summer academic recess thus allowing the continued use of the facility for high-performance swimming and competition.</p> <p>The sport sector is recognised as having positive social, cultural and health benefits for individuals and broader society.  It is an integral part of Government policy to provide funding for such infrastructure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Griffin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will check if that timeline can be moved forward, particularly, as the Senator outlined, in light of the impact the lack of a pool boom is having on the facility, on competition, on performance and on activity in the area.  I will check if anything can be done with in terms of the timeline.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he can discover whether the timeline can be moved forward.  Children of all ages, from the young to the not so young, have been disenfranchised as a result of the delay.  The Department sanctioned the funding.  That probably happened around the same time that I originally submitted this Commencement matter because I have heard from a number of the swimmers.  However, the problem was, perhaps, that there was silence about it and none of the people involved on the swimming side were informed about what was happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#B00300"><p>F&aacute;ilte.  I welcome the Minister of State.  My request is simple in many ways.  I ask that the local property tax, LPT, exemption that exists in Leinster in respect of homes affected by pyrite be extended to cover homes in Mayo that are similarly affected and those in Donegal affected by problems with mica.  An expert report on concrete blockwork in homes in Mayo and Donegal was published in June.  This was commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This is the first official recognition that there is a serious problem with the deterioration of blockwork in houses in Mayo and Donegal such that it can cause major structural problems and even structural collapse of houses in due course.  This is a serious problem.  When the report was issued, realisation dawned on many people about the seriousness of the problem of having pyrite or mica in homes, the devastation that both can cause to properties and the cost involved in respect of remedial work.</p> <p>The report estimates that approximately 345 private houses and 17 social houses in Mayo are affected.  The estimate for Donegal is that between 1,200 and 4,000 properties are affected by mica.  I think many more houses in Mayo are affected because even since the publication of the report, I have had people approached me about this matter.  I also believe there is a significant problem with commercial properties.  This problem is widespread and we need to get to the bottom of it.  The property tax exemption that obtains in Leinster in respect of houses affected by pyrite is designed to give tax relief to people whose houses have pyrite-heave - an issue relating to pyrite in foundations.  The problem with pyrite in Mayo and mica in Donegal relates to the blockwork.  It is described differently.  The redress board that deals with the owners of houses with pyrite problems in Leinster does not cover those affected in Mayo because a different type of pyrite issue occurs and different remedial works are required.  It is only right that the exemption in question be extended to the affected home owners in Mayo and Donegal.  These houses are probably worth nothing at the moment other than for the site value.  Who would buy a site affected by pyrite or mica?  People cannot do anything with their houses right now, which is a massive headache.</p> <p>I ask that common sense prevail.  There is official recognition of the problem on the part of the State by virtue of the report.  Can we now have what, to me, should logically follow, namely, an exemption?  Will provision be made for this in the Finance Bill, by means of regulation or in whatever way the Minister of State and Minister for Finance see fit?  The issue of a redress scheme relates to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Money is required in order that people might be given financial assistance to enable them to fix their houses.  Such assistance has already been provided in Dublin.  How are the negotiations between the Departments going?  When might there be an answer to my request, which I have made on a couple of occasions, to have a redress scheme set up?  It would be nice, going into Christmas, if we could give people some positive news because it is a depressing vista for those affected by this serious problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#B00400"><p>I have heard the Senator discuss the issue relating to mica in homes in Mayo and Donegal on numerous occasions.  I know she is determined to have something done about it.  I acknowledge the stressful situation individuals can face when building defects manifest themselves after completion of construction and the significant impact this can have on those affected.</p> <p>There is an LPT exemption which is intended to apply to those properties that have a significant level of pyrite damage.  The qualifying criteria for this LPT exemption were modified by the Finance Act 2015.  The changes made were significant.  Where a property has been included in the pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, without testing, or a property has been remedied by a guarantee company or by a builder or developer or where a party is compensated in lieu of remediation, without testing, Revenue will now accept confirmation of remediation or compensation from either the PRB or the relevant party for the purposes of LPT exemption without testing or National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, certification.</p> <p>The mica issue has been examined by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I am informed that an expert panel on concrete blocks was established by that Department in 2016 to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of some dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo.  I will not read the terms of reference because I am sure the Senator is aware of them.  I understand that the report of the expert panel, which includes eight recommendations, was published in June.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has already taken action to implement recommendations 1 and 2 as a matter of priority.  On recommendation 1, the NSAI technical committee, established to scope and fast track the development of a standardised protocol, held its inaugural meeting on 11 September 2017 and has held several further meetings in recent weeks.  The standardised protocol will inform the course of action regarding remedial works for all affected properties.  In the context of recommendation 2, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has been in contact with Engineers Ireland about the establishment of a register of competent engineers for home owners' and affected parties' reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that it will collaborate with the Department and the NSAI on measures to establish such a register.</p> <p>I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, visited Donegal and Mayo during the summer and met with key stakeholders, including affected home owners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties.  In light of the information contained in the report, the Minister of State, Deputy English, is considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in Donegal and Mayo.  The legislation governing the administration of LPT provides for a limited number of exemptions from LPT.  There is no specific exemption for properties affected by mica and there are no plans to do so at the moment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->LPT operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner in the first instance to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  When making an assessment, issues such as the presence of pyrite or mica would be one of the factors that a property owner should take into account in valuing their property.  On that basis, where a property was affected with pyrite on the LPT valuation date of 1 May 2013, it can be reflected in the selected valuation band.  This can be done retrospectively if the presence of pyrite was not taken into account in the 1 May 2013 valuation. </p><p>On the specific question the Senator put to me, the Finance Bill 2017 is at a very advanced stage.  As the Senator is aware, Report Stage is due to be concluded today.  I doubt anything can be done in this year's Finance Bill as we are coming to the end of the process of passing it.  We expect Report Stage to be concluded today and I assume the Bill will come to the Seanad next week.  It is a matter for Members of this House to present amendments or considerations as they see fit.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  I know he is aware of it.  As the Senator knows, I am certainly not someone to ignore the impact this issue would have on people.  I will discuss it with the Minister.  I do not have knowledge of the interactions with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but, again, I will speak with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I will try to get back to the Senator with an updated position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I know that he has answered as best he can.  The reality is that I have been in contact with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of two distinct occurrences of pyrite, one in the foundation and another in the blockwork.  I have been told that the exemption as described in the legislation does not cover blockwork.  The reply the Minister of State has given to me does not seem to allude to that distinction.  What am I to tell the home owners, based on the Minister of State's response?  It is disappointing that it does not speak to the distinction and the problems in Mayo and Donegal.  Will the Minister of State contact the home owners and revert to me?  We need to give clarity to the public affected by Revenue policy on this issue.  Revenue needs to establish what needs to be done.  There is the Finance Bill, an amendment to it and regulations, so it is obviously a complex issue of legislative drafting.  People need to know where they stand.</p></speech>

I do not like ambiguity or positions being unclear.  The note I have says one thing but the Senator is telling me something contrary to it.  I will contact Revenue directly and I will have officials try to conclude the matter in order to determine the correct position.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; faighte ag an Seanad&oacute;ir ansin.<br/><br/>There are currently approximately 600 active minerals prospecting licences in lreland.  Prospecting licence PL 934 was granted in 2005 and renewed in 2012 by the Minister in the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The licence is due for renewal at the end of this year.  The licence gives the licence holder, MOAG Copper Gold Resources Inc., the right to explore for silver and base metals in Mace Head, Carna, County Galway.  This prospecting licence area covers an area of approximately 45 sq. km.<br/><br/>It is my understanding that exploration is being managed on behalf of MOAG by SLR Environmental Consulting (Ireland) Ltd., a consulting firm based in Dublin with extensive mineral exploration experience.  I also understand that landowner and community liaison has continued throughout the exploration programme and that the project has generated employment locally.  In this regard, three local people have been employed on a part-time basis at the core storage facility located in Carna to assist in sampling, transport and core management.  Additionally, local contractors have been used for transporting the core samples, all samples have been analysed at ALS Global Laboratories in Loughrea, County Galway, and drilling has been carried out by Irish Drilling Limited, which is also based in Loughrea.<br/><br/>The Mace molybdenite-copper deposit currently being explored was initially identified in the late 1960s by mapping, geochemistry, geophysics and shallow drilling.  It is my understanding that MOAG has sought to build on the early work mainly by carrying out additional structural geological mapping and surveying.  Following the grant of drilling permission by the exploration and mining division of my Department, a follow-up six-hole drill programme began in 2014.  The results of that programme were extremely encouraging.  A more comprehensive drill programme was undertaken in 2015.  This drilling programme confirmed the existence of the mineralisation.  However, further exploration and evaluation of the information collected is required.<br/><br/>Under the terms and conditions of the prospecting licence, my Department is required to keep all information confidential for six years from the submission of the data.  However, I understand that MOAG has made the results of the drilling programme from 2015, and additional information, available on its website at <i>wwwmoag.ca.en</i>.  My understanding is that the results of the exploration programme which has been carried out are still being evaluated by the company.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the prospecting licence PL 934 is due to expire at the end of this year and, based on current information, it is expected that the company will apply for it to be renewed.  As part of this process, the company will be required to submit an exploration programme which will be screened by the exploration and mining division of my Department to ensure that there are no significant effects on the environment.  In respect of environmental matters, I emphasise that, prior to deciding to grant any prospecting licence, officials in the exploration and mining division screen the proposed prospecting activities submitted in relation to the prospecting licence area and make a determination as to whether the activities may have a significant effect on the environment.  This is done in compliance with relevant European directives and regulations.  It is a condition of the grant of a prospecting licence that, in the event that the relevant prospecting area contains or is in close proximity to an SAC or SPA, before any exploration activity can take place the company is required to seek the prior permission of the exploration and mining division.  Such permission is only granted once further screening for significant environmental effects specific to the objectives of the SAC or SPA is undertaken.  This further screening is undertaken in compliance with the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, SI 477 of 2011.  If drilling is proposed for anywhere within a prospecting licence area, a separate prior permission must be obtained from the exploration and mining division, which undertakes further screening for significant effects to the environment before such permission is granted.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said, "As part of this process, the company will be required to submit an exploration programme which will be screened by the exploration and mining division of my Department to ensure that there are no significant effects on the environment."  Has this been submitted?  Is it available for public view?  If not, can the Minister make it available?  Were any specific environmental issues raised as part of the report?</p></speech>

I will get back to the Senator on whether it has been received and whether it can be published.  Where we can, we put information on natural resources up on the relevant section of the Department's website.  If it is available, we will send a copy to the Senator.  It is at the prospecting licence stage at the moment and if it is to go to the next stage, a full planning permission application will have to be submitted to Galway County Council.  The next steps from there would be public consultation, possible appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, etc.  It is at an early stage but it follows on from work done in the 1960s.  It is right and proper that the community be kept informed of any necessary work.  I will get an update for the Senator on whether an application has been received by the Department.</p></speech>

It was a pleasure to work with him on the justice committee on the important reform we introduced in 2017 to change our focus as regards prostitution and to criminalise or the purchaser.  The question I am asking relates to the previous law.  I am asking the Minister to provide statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions for prostitution-related offences on an annualised basis from 2013 to 2016, inclusive.</p> <p>I have a long-standing interest in this, both from an academic point of view and as a legislator, and we brought in an important and positive reform in 2017 but I am keen to complete the statistical picture of the way prostitution offences were prosecuted under the 1993 law, which the justice committee found to be flawed and in need of reform when we reported on this in 2013.  The report, which paved the way for the 2017 Act, provided a snapshot of prostitution-related offences and of prosecutions and convictions for prostitution offences in 2012.  In the previous year, the Department of Justice and Equality had produced a discussion document with a table of CSO-derived statistics on recorded prostitution offences from 2004 to 2011.  I am asking the Minister of State to complete the picture by bringing us up to date with details of offences between 2013 and 2016.  I have contacted the CSO and I am very grateful to it for its help.  It took over the statistical recording of crime in 2005 and it is doing a very important and meticulous job, but it has only been able to send me statistics up to 2014.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Bacik for highlighting this issue and for her work on this matter over many years, which I know she will continue to do.</p> <p>The statistics sought by the Senator in this Commencement matter were compiled by the Central Statistics Office, which is responsible for the publication of the official  recorded crime statistics.  In this context, I assure the Senator that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to monitor all new and emerging crime trends on an ongoing basis, including those related to prostitution offences, so that optimum use is made of Garda resources and help is provided to tackle this form of crime.  First, I take this opportunity to explain that there are two sets of statistics provided with this text, of which Members should all have received a copy.  The information provided in the first table by the CSO refers to incidents of prostitution.  These are situations where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made an arrest under one of the headings set out below.  Figures relating to prosecutions and convictions for prostitution-related offences have been provided by the Courts Service and are also appended to the text.  The Minister hopes that the Senator finds these statistics useful.</p> <p>Senator Bacik will be aware that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted on 22 February 2017 and I take this opportunity to remind the House of the provisions of that Act as they relate to prostitution-related offences.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  This part also removes those who provide sexual services through prostitution from the existing offences of soliciting and loitering for the purpose of prostitution.  Part 4 of the Act was commenced on 28 March 2017.</p><p>The Act itself, and the provisions referred to in particular, recognise the exploitation experienced by those involved in prostitution and decriminalises them.  Its enactment marked the culmination of a long campaign aimed at tackling the abuse and exploitation which is so widely associated with prostitution.  The Minister and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the big role of Senator Bacik in that campaign, and all members of the House who recognise the vulnerability to exploitation and abuse of those involved in prostitution.</p><p>The new offences under the Act are a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1,000 for a second or subsequent offence, and the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person in the context of prostitution, an offence which carries a potential penalty of up to five years imprisonment and-or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling or, in the case of a trafficked or exploited person, being forced to sell the sexual service will not commit an offence.</p><p>Section 27 of Part 4 requires a report after three years on the number of arrests during that period in respect of the new offences as well as an assessment of the impact of the offences on those who provide sexual services for payment.  The Minister believes that three years is the minimum period in which systems and practices can be effectively bedded down and operated so that reliable conclusions can be drawn from the information gathered for the review.  That report, of course, relates to the effect of legislation from the date of its commencement on 27 March 2017, and as such is not of immediate relevance to the matter before the House but will be an important milestone in terms of measuring the effectiveness of a new approach to dealing with prostitution and the exploitation linked to it.  The two tables provide the information sought by the Senator and there is no need for me to go through the figures as they speak for themselves.</p></speech>

I also thank him for his kind comments.  I note, as the Minister of State said, this is an ongoing issue and I thank him in particular for speaking in a little more detail about the requirement in the 2017 Act for a report after a three year period on the number of arrests during the period in respect of the new offences and an assessment of the impact of the offences.  I look forward to that report, and I certainly look forward to working with the Minister of State in the interim to ensure the Act is working well and is effectively tackling the demand for prostitution, which was our aim in putting forward the legislation.  I should have said one of the most important aspects of the reform, which the Minister of State rightly pointed out, is not only that it has criminalised the purchase of sexual services but, of course, that it has decriminalised those engaged in selling sexual services.  It is explicitly, therefore, recognising the exploitation experienced by those engaged in prostitution.  That, of course, was a hugely important part of our report and of the legislation.  I thank the Minister of State for this and I look forward to working with him.</p></speech>

Returning to Part 4 of the Act, and specifically section 27, I must advise the House the exact nature of the report mandated under the new Act has yet to be decided.  Related to this, I am aware that officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have been engaged in discussions as part of a civil society-led working group to support the implementation of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, together with other stakeholders including representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.</p> <p>At the weekend, I was in Brussels and I had an informal engagement where I was informed on what is happening in France in this regard.  I want to draw the Senator's attention to this because it has enacted legislation in this regard which has been quite successful, but it has a slightly nuanced approach to it and I was quite interested to learn about it.  I might speak to the Senator about it at another time.</p></speech>

It is curious and extraordinary that it was withheld from the Taoiseach until 16 November, one week later.  Furthermore we still do not have the full contents of the email.  We do not have a screenshot, that one would expect in this day and age.  We cannot see if it was part of a thread, or if there were other recipients on the email.  We cannot see whether it was a response to a previous email and if it was actually replied to.</p> <p>The Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il also criticised the management of the Department of Justice and Equality for its failings to provide complete information.  This begs the question whether the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan was aware of this email, and why he did not tell the Taoiseach about it.  Why did two Ministers in the Cabinet allow the Taoiseach to mislead the D&aacute;il?  The Taoiseach must be absolutely furious about this matter.  We still do not know whether the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald read the emails and understood the contents, the gravity and the seriousness of them and why she failed to act on them or even more why she failed to question the contents of these emails.  Why did she continue, ever after May 2016, to express her full confidence in the then Garda Commissioner?  Surely her confidence failed back in 2015.  </p> <p>There are many more questions arising from her presence in this Chamber and by yesterday's revelations.  We need to see the T&aacute;naiste return to this House to address some of the matters.</p> <p>I wish to raise the flash flooding in Mountmellick.  I commend the fire brigade, the Army and the local authority on their efforts last night to ensure there was no loss of life.  I heard on the radio many of the residents commended their efforts.  Will the Government ensure that the humanitarian access fund is put in place and that residents and businesses whose property was seriously damaged are allowed to access these funds in a smooth and easy manner so that they can get on with their lives and start rebuilding their life?  Flash floods like this episode are becoming more frequent and more common and we need to put in place a proper flood prevention strategy to ensure that lives are not harmed in the future.</p></speech>

I know that RT&Eacute; is faced with many challenges and it would be very good for this House to have a debate on the public service broadcaster and where it is at, the direction it is taking and its strategy to reach that point.  Some 4.2 million streamers stream into RT&Eacute; on a monthly basis.  The online feed is very important.  RT&Eacute; is actually key as a public broadcaster to the future of democracy in Ireland for example.  RT&Eacute; has 1 million listeners to its radio programmes on a weekly basis.  Having said that, RT&Eacute; faces significant competition in the market.  The landscape is changing.  RT&Eacute; has roughly 30% to 33% of the overall marketplace, which has diminished significantly in the past number of years.  The cost of operating RT&Eacute; is roughly &euro;350 million a year, an increase of 7% on the 2015 figure.  The main reasons for that were the European football championship, UEFA EURO 2016, the Olympics in Rio in 2016 and the celebrations and special programmes for the centenary commemorative events.  RT&Eacute; is funded as follows - &euro;160 million comes from commercial revenue and approximately &euro;180 million comes from the licence fees.  The problem with the licence fees is that it is not all collected.  RT&Eacute; does not get all of the revenue from the licence fee.  There is a significant gap of an estimated &euro;15 million plus a year in the licence fees that remain unpaid.  RT&Eacute; is key to small firms that are involved in television and radio productions and the allocation for expenditure to buy in home produced programmes has dropped by 40% since the year 2008.  I am keen to hear the Minister's view on the Irish language broadcasting on TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.</p> <p>C&eacute;ard &eacute; an plean at&aacute; ag RT&Eacute; &oacute; thaobh TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta?  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach ach n&iacute; dh&eacute;antar aon phl&eacute; air, beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r.  Dar liomsa agus go leor daoine eile, t&aacute; TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach agus f&iacute;orl&aacute;rnach &oacute; thaobh chraolach&aacute;n na t&iacute;re seo.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom tuairim&iacute; an Aire agus tuairm&iacute; RT&Eacute; a fh&aacute;il mar gheall air sin agus ba bhre&aacute; liom d&aacute; bhf&eacute;adfaimis ceisteanna a chur le soil&eacute;ireacht a fh&aacute;il ar an strait&eacute;is agus an fh&iacute;s do TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.</p> <p>RT&Eacute; is deeply involved in discussions on the sale of some of the property in Donnybrook for approximately &euro;100 million.

Aont&aacute;im cuid mhaith leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Ardagh ar maidin maidir leis an Aire, Teachta Frances Fitzgerald.  S&iacute;lim gur f&aacute;gadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; ceisteanna n&aacute; freagra&iacute; tar &eacute;is an seisi&uacute;n a bh&iacute; againn ar&eacute;ir.  We unfortunately have to return to the issue of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald.  It is quite clear that there are a number of issues that still have to be addressed concerning the debacle that has emerged.</p><p>I spoke to somebody with a legal background this morning who raised a couple of interesting points with me which I would like to put on the record here in the hope of getting answers to them.  Has the confidentiality of the tribunal itself been breached?  Our understanding is that on the second day of oral hearings there was a meeting at Garda HQ regarding its strategy.  We understand that there was an email that afternoon to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Section 11 of the Commission of Investigation Act makes it an offence to disclose evidence given at a commission of investigation.  All proceedings in a commission of investigation are private except in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, as it is an offence under section 11 to disclose evidence, has an offence been committed?  Surely the Garda, a Minister for Justice and Equality and officials from Department of Justice and Equality should be aware that is an offence.</p><p>A number of parties were connected to the emails that have gone over and back.  It is very important to know who those officials were.  Who was party to the emails, and why?  If an offence was committed, was it reported?  Did the Minister, officials or any member of the Garda report it?  That leads to the question of where the information came from.  Was there a leak in the commission itself?  Was the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, herself not shocked by all of this?  If somebody divulged information to any of us from a family court hearing, we would be concerned.  Why would an <i>in camera </i>meeting of the commission not cause the same concern in a Minister for Justice and Equality, particularly when it was such a high profile issue at the time?  So far the story just does not stack up.  From speaking to political colleagues across the Houses, I do not think that many people in these Houses believe the story we are being given.  </p><p>The potential offence gives rise to questions about the judgment of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, at the time.  Does the Leader have confidence that we are getting the full story?  From our perspective on this side of the House, we are not sure, and we are certainly not confident that we are getting the full story.</p></speech>

If a breach has happened, was it reported, and, if not, why not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1410" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#H00500"><p>I wish to raise two issues.  The first relates to the T&aacute;naiste's contribution to the Seanad last night.  I believe it is time we invited the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to the House.  His Department seems to be completely incapable of giving factual information to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will have to correct the record of the House for a third time because of information that was given to him by the Department of Justice and Equality.  It also appears that an email that was discovered, which was the centre of the controversy, was not communicated to the T&aacute;naiste for a full week.</p> <p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, made a bizarre outburst in the D&aacute;il last week when he accused my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, of conducting a smear campaign against him.  As we are trying to get the bottom of this situation, all the while remembering that Sergeant Maurice McCabe is the person we should be most concerned about in terms of a smear campaign, I respectfully ask again that the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, be invited to this House to account for his Department's handling of the current situation.</p> <p>I ask for a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who currently has responsibility for the national drugs strategy.  When the new strategy was launched in July, a commitment was given that a 12 month working group would be established on the issue of the decriminalisation of drug use.  That was a welcome development, and as the Leader and the Members of the Seanad will know, myself and Senator Lynne Ruane have a piece of legislation which would give effect to the decriminalisation of addiction and drug use.  We were willing to go with the new strategy and to give it the time and space it needed to bed itself down although we did not necessarily believe in having a separate strategy towards the end goal of decriminalisation of drug use.  It is now November, almost December, however, and there is no sign of this working group being established.  I respectfully ask that we invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to the House to discuss the establishment of the working group on the decriminalisation of drug use.  It is a very serious issue.</p> <p>I believe there is broad agreement around the House as to how we could look at this issue, and there is great humanity in this House when it comes to the issue of drug use and addiction.  We are determined that this working group will be set up, that it will do its work efficiently, and that at the end of a 12 month period it will come to conclusions that would hopefully lead us to adopt a drugs strategy such as that in existence in Portugal.  However, four months on, we are no closer to having that working group established.  I would like the Minister of State to come in so that we can work with her to ensure that we get that working group established and to work for those in our country who are suffering from the effects of addiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#H00600"><p>Yesterday, we had a visit from the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy English, and a surprise visit from the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to Fingal to look at a particular type of pre-made construction.  These are very fine steel structure houses where most of the work is done in factories, under cover.  These houses are currently retailing at &euro;450,000.  I am not suggesting that is the sort of house that ultimately would be used, but it shows the quality that is available.</p> <p>The issue I wish to raise today is housing and planning not just in Fingal, but country wide.  We currently have no proper register of planners in this country.  Anyone can call himself or herself a planner - I could do it.  We need a register, and the Institute of Planners in Ireland, IPI, want it.  They want the situation which pertains to other professions put in place whereby people must have a minimum level of qualification to be able to provide the services they say they can provide, a proper code of conduct, and, most importantly, a code of ethics.  We have seen far too much development in this country.  I am not here to score political points but to address an issue.  Estates have been built all over the country in places where nobody wants to live.  Proper planning would not allow that and we need a proper register for IPI.  We need to be able to assure people that if they go to someone describing himself or herself as a planner, they will be dealing with somebody who is properly qualified and has the skill to deliver proper planning to that person or that company which will result in quality outcomes for those who live and work in the area where that planning will apply.  </p> <p>I would like the Minister to come to the House and to tell us how he can progress this issue, because it is critical.  I do not need to talk through all of the problems we have suffered in the past because of bad planning.  We have an opportunity now, particularly when we are looking at building so many houses.  I mention Fingal because it is an area that is growing, has the youngest population in the country, and will be the site of many new houses, offices and new industry.  Let us take the opportunity to put a proper register of planners in place so that we can all feel protected and get the service we require.</p></speech>

It was stated on the radio programme to which I was listening that many people who intend to purchase items online are not aware of the VAT and import duty laws.  If one purchases an item from outside the EU online to the value of &euro;22 or more, one is liable for VAT in Ireland.  If the cost of the item exceeds &euro;150, one is also required to pay import duty plus VAT.  I do not believe many people are aware of that.  They are buying items online at what seem to be exorbitantly low prices but when, on delivery, they are hit with these VAT bills, the price differential may not be as inviting as it originally appeared.  All the while, these purchases are being made at the expense of local traders.  We are duty bound to encourage citizens, where possible, to shop locally, particularly in rural Ireland in order to try to keep the small shops and businesses open.</p> <p>I would also like to highlight the phenomenal number of fictitious sites that will be set up especially for this weekend only because those behind them know that their potential clients and customers are at their most vulnerable as a result of all the advertising that has been taking place.  Apparently, an astronomical number of sites selling fictitious goods will be set up.  Those who operate the sites in question will get the bank details of many vulnerable customers.  We cannot do enough to highlight this issue.  I encourage the Government and the relevant Ministers to issue press releases to warn people about that to which I refer.  An unbelievable number of scams will occur over the weekend on the basis of the Black Friday myth, which is what I would call it.</p></speech>

Many of the those involved with the emergency services are volunteers and they are never found wanting when there is a crisis.  My former colleagues in the Defence Forces are out again doing their job.</p> <p>There is a bit of a frenzy going on in politics at present.  I am not here to speak for the T&aacute;naiste, although I have some sympathy for her in the context of the difficulty in which she finds herself.  Nor am I here to condemn Deputy Kelly, who placed information that was brought to him in the public domain.  There is a sinister undercurrent to what is going on.  Clearly, there are people who work for this State who are prepared to withhold information of which they are aware until an opportunity arises.  What is their agenda?  What are they trying to do?  This is something that can destabilise an entire democracy.  We have whistleblower legislation in place.  Why are they not using that?  The McCabe family has gone through hell.  When they were going through the worst of what they experienced, why, if it was known about, was the information that has now been leaked not brought forward?  We need to be very careful about what is happening in this State.  It is possible for people in public jobs to destabilise or undermine a Minister.  I am not speaking for the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I want to make that very clear.  She is well able to speak for herself.  </p> <p>If there has been wrongdoing, the facts about it will eventually become clear.  We need to look at the deeper issues that are involved.  It concerns me greatly that there may be disgruntled employees in Departments who would work in the morning to destabilise a Minister and, in so doing, perhaps destabilise the entire Government.  Democracy deserves better from its public servants .  When information is brought to the attention of or leaked to those of us in public life, the first thing we should do is consult the whistleblower legislation and examine the position regarding protected disclosures.  Perhaps that is the way we should proceed.</p></speech>

This is a very important step.  The station in Ballinspittle is one of a number that were closed in 2012 and 2013.  In many ways, the reopening is about trying to tackle rural crime.  Having Garda stations in villages such as Ballinspittle is very important.  It is an extremely positive that the Minister, as part of a pilot programme, examined the position with regard to reopening this station.  It is now reported that the station will reopen.  That is very positive for the local community, particularly the people who live in Ballinsplittle.  The entire peninsula on which the village is located requires a Garda station.  It is on the periphery.  The recent campaign by the community to achieve this reopening must be acknowledged.  I hope similar communities can be supported in their battle against rural crime, which is a major problem for them.  This Garda station will hopefully do its best to ensure that crime in the area will be tackled.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts was told by the assistant Garda Commissioner that he would not prioritise Stepaside Garda station but would put the resources into the north and south inner city of Dublin, where the crime rate needs much more focus and attention.</p> <p>I want to bring to the Leader's attention a report, Opportunity Lost, by the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, which has been just been published.  The report criticises aspects of the Department of Justice and Equality's administration of the Magdalen restorative justice scheme.  Mr. Tyndall indicates that the Department of Justice and Equality would have been aware of links between the units where women lived and the Magdalenes.  The Department gave undue weight to evidence supplied by the religious congregations involved.  It was manifestly unfair of the Department to exclude women on the basis that they might not have been able to apply for inclusion on redress schemes.  The eligibility criteria were not disclosed to the women when their applications were denied and no interview or information process was established.  Mr. Tyndall has called for the matter to be investigated further.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to come before the House in order that he might indicate how we will ensure that no woman is left behind as a result of this latest traumatic development?  I would like the Minister to outline the steps that will now be taken.</p></speech>

Europe will tell us how much it is doing for us, that it is standing both behind and shoulder to shoulder with us, that it will help us over this and that we will not be at a loss due to our closest neighbour leaving the EU.  The first tangible thing that the EU could have done for us in this regard. would have been to relocate the headquarters of the European Banking Authority from London to Dublin.  I would have thought that out of all the different organisations that will be obliged to relocate from London, the European Banking Authority would have been perfect for Dublin.  If the EU is intent on cushioning the blow, assisting Ireland and living up to all of the great talk coming out of Brussels, then relocating the authority's headquarters to Dublin would have been a logical step.  This is, of course, a great story because Dublin was judged to be a better location than Frankfurt and Berlin and to be on an equal footing with Paris.  What did those responsible for relocating the authority's headquarters do?  They put the names of Dublin and Paris into a hat and then drew one out.  I cannot believe that Paris was favoured over Dublin at a time when Ireland is going to be more disenfranchised than any other member state as a result of Brexit.  Given the fact that we have the International Financial Services Centre, at which many American financial institutions have operations, one would have thought that Dublin would have been the logical choice when it came to relocating the headquarters of the European Banking Authority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aidan Davitt:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am extremely disappointed.

I do not think I need to go into it any further.  It raises a very serious issue.  I believe there is accountability but I am very concerned about the way this issue has developed.  The T&aacute;naiste has given a full explanation and everything she has done in respect of this matter has been above board.</p> <p>On another matter, I am frequently contacted by people who have had serious accidents, who are in hospital and who need to be transferred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is quite a long waiting list for that facility.  I know there is work under way to replace the facility.  It is, however, the only real rehabilitation centre in the country.  I am aware that other hospitals have rehabilitation facilities, but the services they offer are not as comprehensive as those available in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Over 20 years ago, it was proposed that a unit be built in Cork.  For some reason, that was taken off the agenda.  The last major hospital facility to be built in this country opened in 1998.  Three are now being built in different areas of Dublin - the national children's hospital, the maternity hospital and the facility in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is, however, a need for a new rehabilitation centre to cover all of the Munster region.  There would be a huge long-term cost saving to the health service because, while a person is waiting to be admitted to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire facility, he or she is occupying a hospital bed.  That results in a huge cost to the State.  The only way forward is to ensure that we have rehabilitation facilities available once a person has been stabilised in a hospital and once the hospital can do nothing further for the person other than wait for him or her to get into a rehabilitation facility.  We need to draw the Minister's attention to this issue and we need to have it on the agenda in respect of the future planning of health services.  In particular, it should form part of the ten-year plan.</p></speech>

Involvement in PESCO is the biggest policy decision relating to the Defence Forces since Irish soldiers were first sent on UN duties in the 1960s.  Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Irish Constitution specifically states that the State will not adopt a common EU defence where such a defence would include the participation of the State.  The Government's decision to join PESCO runs totally contrary to that article.  The clear aim of PESCO is to jointly develop the EU's military capabilities and to make them available for EU military operations.  These missions are not confined to peacekeeping missions and would allow the EU to intervene in conflicts such as those in Libya and Syria, outside of UN and NATO structures.  PESCO is being driven by France and Germany, which are both key members of NATO.  In reality, the strategic aims of PESCO are inseparable from those of NATO.  By signing up to this and in addition to committing to providing troops to PESCO missions, the Government would also be committing to trebling current spending on defence at a huge cost to the Irish people.  Despite having been at odds with what is now being proposed and committed to during debates on the Lisbon Treaty, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is hell-bent on rushing this through the Oireachtas with little debate over the next fortnight.

I thank the 12 Senators who made contributions to the Order of Business.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Craughwell and Colm Burke raised issues in respect of the Department of Justice and Equality, Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the T&aacute;naiste.  It is important that we understand that this is about a parallel process, as Senator Boyhan put it last night.  We established a tribunal of inquiry, the task and aim of which is to ascertain the full facts and to present a report.  We will then deal with the contents of that report and any recommendations or ramifications.  I reiterate that there is no obfuscation from this side of the House.  All the facts are out there.  All we want to see is justice for Sergeant McCabe and his family - pure and simple.  It really amuses me to hear some people at times coming in here talking about protection of whistleblowers when their own legacies and their own parties' protections of whistleblowers are quite appalling.  In this House last night, in the D&aacute;il yesterday and again during Leader's Questions in the D&aacute;il today, the T&aacute;naiste answered the questions.  She had no role in respect of the strategy.  The advice of the Attorney General last night, which was read out in the House, was quite clear.  It would have been illegal to get involved or to interfere.  If that happened the drums would be beating in a different way this morning.  That is the reality.  Let us make it clear, the email referred to this morning had no implications because the T&aacute;naiste did not get it until 15 May.</p> <p>I agree with Senators.  That is why the Taoiseach has asked the Department of Justice and Equality to see how the Toland review is being implemented in the context of what has happened.  I was never a Minister - Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was a Minister of State in the Department of Justice and Equality - but there is something radically wrong when one sees misinformation being given to the Taoiseach three times.  That beggars belief and is not acceptable.  If one listened to "The Late Debate" last night, the former Minister, Alan Dukes, spoke about his difficulties in the Department of Justice back in the 1980s.  This is 2017.  I do not want to get involved in a blame game but something is radically wrong in the operation of the Department.  However, if the Minister was involved in day-to-day activities she would be accused of political interference and there would be no independence.</p> <p>We on this side of the House have nothing to hide.  This is about ensuring that the full facts emerge, that the tribunal is left to do its work, that the Toland review which is being carried out is implemented in full and that we put in place robust strategies in all Departments to ensure accountability.  As politicians, we are the only people who are actually accountable.  We get voted in and we get voted out.  There needs to be real accountability.  We cannot continue to have debates about who did what and who did not, who knew when and who knew what.  It is about time the Chinese walls were taken down.</p></speech>

It is something the Senator's party has sometimes done in the North but has not done in the South.  It might start to do so.  That lack of responsibility was illustrated by the remarks of some of the Senator's colleagues last week about passing budgets in local authorities.  The T&aacute;naiste made matters quite clear in her contribution last evening.  The email states, quite clearly, "neither the Attorney nor the Minister has a function relating to the evidence a party to a Commission of Investigation may adduce."  It is there in black and white.  There must be accountability.  The T&aacute;naiste is accountable to the House.</p></speech>

The yellow warning given by Met &Eacute;ireann certainly was correct, given the volume of rain and blockages in the road network.  Laois County Council is to be commended on its activation, in particular the fire service, civil defence, the engineering staff and the outdoor crews.  As Senator Craughwell said, the Defence Forces also deserve a mention.  The Minister, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, is on his way to Mountmellick and he is also to be commended.  The Government is aware of the situation and works with local authorities and other agencies to ensure there is a plan and an ongoing review of the situation.  It is important that people who are discommoded are back in their houses as quickly as possible.  I sympathise with all the people who are affected as it is unpleasant to spend a Wednesday afternoon having one's house evacuated.  I hope all arms of the State support them in the course of the clean-up.</p> <p>Maidir leis an c&uacute;pla focal &oacute;n Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, aonta&iacute;m leis go bhfuil obair agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; RT&Eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach, go h&aacute;irithe i leith Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta agus TG4.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom an tAire a thabhairt chuig an Teach chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; RT&Eacute; a phl&eacute;.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to RT&Eacute; and the Irish language, and to TG4 and Raidio na Gaeltachta, and I would be very happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.  It is an important service and it is important that people are informed through Irish.  Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked about the national drugs strategy.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, was in the House to discuss the strategy but I would be happy for her to come back.  It is an important issue and decriminalisation has received wide support from across the House.  It is important we continue to bring the issue to the fore and we can do that through the legislation about which the Senator spoke.  The public mindset has changed, through education and the debates we have had in this House.  It might be best if the Senator put down a Commencement matter as we have a lot of legislation to deal with in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Senator Reilly mentioned the visit of the Ministers, Deputy Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Damien English, to Fingal yesterday.  I welcome the announcement of 200 permanent emergency beds and we will ask the Minister to come to the House to debate the issues raised by the Senator on planning and planners.  I commend Senator Paul Daly on raising the important and topical issue of Black Friday.  It is an Americanism that has crossed the ocean to us.  It is frightening to see so many people being duped by fictitious websites which take all their details.  It costs them lots of money and their details get into the public domain.  Dermott Jewell spoke about Black Friday on the radio this week and I commend him on his work.  The Senator is right that there is an implication for VAT and import taxes and it is important to have a debate on it.  It will not take place today but we need to do something on it because it is an issue that is not going away.  More and more people are buying online and there are implications of which they are not aware.</p> <p>Senator Lombard and Senator Devine mentioned the six Garda stations that are being reopened and I welcome that fact, and Senator Lombard asked specifically about Ballinspittle.  I did not hear the remarks from the Committee of Public Accounts this morning but I remind Senator Devine that the acting Garda Commissioner Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, signed off on the six stations, which include Stepaside, being reopened.  I do not know the name of the garda who was before the Committee of Public Accounts this morning but it is important that there is no political interference in policing.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator on the issue of restorative justice for the women in the report Opportunity Lost.  I have not read the report but I note the comments attributed to Mr. Peter Tyndall, the Ombudsman.  The Secretary General in the Department of Justice has a different viewpoint and the Minister has said it needs careful and considered reflection.  It is important that the women get redress and that the State supports them.  I would be happy to have a debate on it.  The Minister has made it clear it needs careful and considered reflection because there is a disagreement between the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice which has to be worked out.</p> <p>Senator Davitt asked about the banks and we will have statements on the decision relating to the European Banking Authority.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy is going to come to the House.  I wish to praise him, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, for their work.  It was disappointing that it was decided by the drawing of lots as this was not the way the result should have been arrived at.  We overcame Frankfurt and I am confident we would have secured it on the basis of a marking regime.  We will debate it next week.</p></speech>

The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, did trojan work to pursue the issue across Europe.  We were very unlucky.  Everybody thought Frankfurt would be the victor.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the need for future planning on health to include national rehabilitation and I fully agree with him  There is a need in the Munster region for a national rehabilitation unit similar to the one in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, because it would take some pressure off.  We need to see this issue in future health care planning.  We have already had a debate on the Order of Business this week on the issue around PESCO, raised by Senator Warfield, and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins had a Commencement matter debate with the Minister on the subject.  Rather than rehash the debate, the Minister's reply was quite clear to the effect that we would not breach any of our agreements.  This was in the Lisbon treaty which was passed by the Irish people.  I would be happy for the Minister to come back to the House on the issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-11-23a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017112300002#P00300"><p>I am delighted to be invited to Seanad &Eacute;ireann today to speak on the report on the eligibility of maintenance grants to students - Wake-up SUSI.  I welcome the report from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills, which adds to the debate on the future funding of the higher education sector.  The report makes five recommendations and I will deal with each of these in turn before discussing the statutory provisions regarding approved institutions, future funding options for the higher sector and the Government&rsquo;s response to these funding challenges.</p> <p>The first recommendation is that the eligibility reckoner on the SUSI website should clearly indicate to applicants if their preferred college is eligible for grant support.  The eligibility reckoner on the SUSI website is a tool designed to give students an indication of their likely eligibility for a grant.  It is not a definitive determination of an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for grant support.  This determination can only be made by SUSI upon receipt of all relevant documents that form part of a grant application.  The recommendation regarding the eligibility reckoner on the SUSI website has been brought to the attention of SUSI and will be considered in the context of the annual review of the scheme for 2018.</p> <p>The second recommendation is for the Department to undertake a review of the CAO application process to clearly identify the college courses and colleges that qualify for a SUSI grant.  Higher education institutions are autonomous and academically independent and they set the entry criteria for admissions to their courses.  While higher education institutions have delegated the task of processing course applications to the Central Applications Office, they retain the function of making decisions on their entry requirements.  The Department does not have a role in relation to the operation of the CAO or the admission of students to third level institutions.  I understand that it would be technically possible for the CAO to identify colleges which are not eligible for SUSI grants but any decision to identify colleges in this way is likely to meet with resistance from the private colleges.</p> <p>The third recommendation proposes that, subject to a course and college being Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, approved, eligibility for a maintenance grant should be based on the means of the student rather than on the choice of college.  QQI validation is valued by higher education institutions, as it indicates to potential students that the validated programmes have met the quality assurance requirements of the State regulator.  The fact that a programme has been validated by QQI does not confer any status on the provider or programme with regard to eligibility for public funding.</p> <p>The fourth recommendation suggests that students enrolled at private colleges should, if eligible under the relevant SUSI criteria, be entitled to the same value of SUSI funding for payment of annual degree course fees that they would receive at an equivalent course in a State-funded higher education institution.  The criteria that a higher education institution has to meet in order to be considered an approved institution for student grant funding purposes are outlined in section 7 of the Student Support Act of 2011.  No additional institutions have been added to the scheme since the passing of the 2011 Act.  Any consideration to extend the list of approved institutions would not only have to consider the potential impact on existing approved institutions but also other institutions both in Ireland and across the EU.  To extend the student grant scheme to all Higher Education Colleges Association, HECA, colleges is estimated to cost approximately &euro;17 million per annum.  This is a rolling figure which is likely to rise to &euro;34 million in year 2 and so on.</p> <p>Can I ask the Acting Chairman if I will be told if there is a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?</p></speech>

These costs are not factored into the estimated &euro;17 million figure.  This is an estimate of the likely cost of extending the student support scheme but there is a difficulty in accurately estimating the costs involved.  The Higher Education Authority does not collate data from private colleges.  The Department is, therefore, reliant on information provided by the colleges themselves, or by HECA.</p> <p>The fifth recommendation proposes that students enrolled in private colleges should be entitled to access the student assistance fund.  The student assistance fund, SAF, was established in 1994 and is part funded by the European Social Fund.  It provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level education.  Students can be assisted towards their rent, child care costs, transports costs and books or class materials.  The SAF is open to full-time registered students on courses of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification, with &euro;1 million of this funding ring-fenced for part-time students from the target groups from 2018.  There were some 15,700 students who benefitted from the SAF in 2015-16 at a cost of &euro;7.84 million.  The purpose of the SAF is to support full-time higher education students who are experiencing financial hardship while they study in publicly funded institutions.  It is important to note that if the SAF was to be extended to private colleges without student grants also being made available there is the potential for considerably higher demand for it than is the case in existing institutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In effect the student assistance fund, SAF, would become a proxy student grant scheme, which it is not resourced for.</p><p>The policy of providing free fees and grant aid to students in publicly-funded colleges and tax relief on fees paid in both public and approved private colleges is a long-established feature in Ireland.  The criteria that a higher education institution has to meet to be considered an approved institution for student grant funding purposes are outlined in section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011.  The student grant scheme has a statutory basis.  To qualify for student supports under the scheme, students must be attending an approved programme at an approved institution.  The list of institutions is outlined each year in the student support regulations which provide the necessary detail about a number of issues that are provided for in the Act.  In 2017, the Department of Education and Skills will spend approximately &euro;450 million on a range of access measures for further and higher education students.  This includes approximately &euro;390 million on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 80,000 students.</p><p>Further funding for the higher education sector is a key concern of Government.  The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which had to be made in recent years presented challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education.  In recognition of the resulting funding pressures in the higher education sector, an expert group chaired by Peter Cassells was established to examine funding arrangements for higher education and to identify a range of approaches that, combined, will achieve a sustainable funding base.  The Cassells report was published in July 2016 and clearly outlines the funding challenges being experienced in the sector, across capital, current and student support expenditure.  The report highlighted the need for additional funding of &euro;600 million per annum by 2021 and &euro;1 billion per annum by 2030 to both keep pace with rising student demographics and to improve quality through reducing the staff to student ratio from the current 20:1 to 14:1.</p></speech>

One is a predominantly State-funded system.  This involves a significantly increased core grant to institutions and the abolition of the student contribution.  Higher education would be free at the point of entry for all first-time EU students and for part-time learners with the possibility of extending free tuition to postgraduate students.  The second option is increased State funding with continuing student fees.  This would involve a considerable increase in State funding with retention of the current up-front student contribution and continuing fees for postgraduate students.  The third option is increased State funding with deferred payment of fees through income-contingent loans.  This option allows for the abolition of the student contribution to be replaced by a system of income-contingent loans provided by the State.  Increased State funding will still be required.  As committed to in the programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector.  The recommendation from the joint committee will inform future decisions in this policy area.</p> <p>While the Cassells report deals with the medium and long-term funding needs of higher education, the Government has been cognisant of the immediate funding challenges in the sector.  It was in this context in budget 2017 that the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, secured additional funding for the sector.  This involved an additional &euro;36.5 million which was made available to higher education for 2017 and &euro;160 million of additional funding over three years.  The additional funding of &euro;36.5 million included &euro;8.5 million for various access measures targeted at the most disadvantaged postgraduate students, lone parents, a new 1916 bursary scheme, and targeted funding to incentivise higher education institutions to attract more students from disadvantaged communities.  The Government's commitment to continuing investment in higher education was further evidenced in the recent budget 2018 in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total investment package of &euro;60 million in additional funding in 2018.  This funding is on top of the &euro;36.5 million that was secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018.  The &euro;60 million funding package includes &euro;4 million for the continued roll-out of the postgraduate measure and the 1916 bursary scheme, announced in budget 2017.  In total, the Government will invest &euro;100 million more in higher and further education in 2018 than in 2016.</p> <p>The number of students seeking a place in higher education is increasing and is scheduled to continue to rise up to 2030 which poses a significant financial challenge.  A need is clearly outlined in the Cassells report to appropriately resource the State's higher education institutions to cater for the projected increase in student numbers and to provide a quality learning experience for those students.  The additional funding provided over 2017 and 2018 will allow for the continued provision for higher education programmes and services for the existing student cohort as well as providing an additional 2,100 student places in 2018.  With limited public resources available to the Department overall and the number of competing priorities across the sector, to extend access to the student grant scheme and student assistance fund, and by extension the free fees funding and the fund for disabilities, to other institutions or cohorts of students that are not currently covered under these initiatives without significant additional investment would involve reducing the level of funding for existing institutions and students.</p></speech>

The concluding statement from the SUSI group sums up what it is looking for.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Wake-up SUSI is looking for equality of treatment for students from low-income and single-parent families who want to attend the higher education college of their choice.  They want fairness for all.</p><p>That basically sums up why we are here this afternoon and what we are attempting to do.  In common with others present, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and we had the pleasure of having the SUSI group appear before us.  I compliment them on the way they organised themselves and on the presentation they gave to the committee.  All members of the committee were impressed by their work and by the recommendations made by that group.  All members of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills were in agreement with them.  </p><p>All agree that education is the single big game changer, especially for those who come from a disadvantaged areas or single-parent families.  It is imperative that no obstacle is put in their way in accessing third level education if that is the path that they decide to do down.  The group has made recommendations, many of which have been comprehensively addressed by the Minister.  In a general sense, the points they make, all of which are fairly reasonable, reflect their experience of dealing with this particular aspect of education.  They talk about the rigidity and ruthlessness of the SUSI eligibility guidelines.  I will give an example.  I encountered a case recently in which two of a family with 11 children were going to college.  They were slightly over the threshold and hoped that some consideration would be given to the size of the family to enable the two children to go to college.  Unfortunately, that flexibility was not in the system.  That might be something we should bring on board, that is, in such special circumstances some flexibility should be given.  Members can imagine the cost of bringing up 11 children and trying to pay a mortgage.  The disposable income they had was limited and neither spouse was on an exorbitant salary.  This should be borne in mind.  </p><p>The lack of clarity as to which courses would or would not qualify for SUSI grants also was mentioned.  Again, I imagine a simple housekeeping exercise could be undertaken to make clear what courses qualify or do not qualify for grants.  The other issue concerns private colleges as some people have no choice but to go to a private college.  The numbers, however, are quite small and consideration could be given to making eligible for a grant those who attend and undertake courses at private colleges.  </p><p>The role of education in the recovery of this economy cannot be overstated.  We would not be where we are today if we did not have a successful third level reputation, which is something we should continue to hold dear.  We are at something of a crossroads at present, in that everybody agrees there is a lack of funding in the third level sector.  I compliment Mr. Cassells and his people on the work they did in producing the Cassells report, which laid out in stark reality what options face us in future on the funding of third level education.  Any funding going into third level is money well spent and we get our money back time and time again when people gain employment and so on.  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills is undertaking a huge volume of work at present by listening to the views of all the different stakeholders involved and may come up with a recommendation shortly with its views on the future funding of third level education.  The one common theme for all its members is the last thing they want to do is to create any obstacles to the ability of young people to access third level education.  That is vitally important.  </p><p>Fees are one thing and the lack of fees is a big issue.  We also must not lose contact with the fact that those from outside the major cities in which the universities are located have the added cost of trying to seek and find accommodation and then trying to fund it.  It is a huge issue and in Dublin in particular, many families simply cannot afford at present to pay the rent landlords are seek or even the rents for which some third level organisations with own accommodation on campus are asking.  That is sad because it is the difference between a child being able to go to third level or not.  Clearly this must be looked at, especially for those students from outside the capital who must travel from rural Ireland on a weekly basis to attend college.</p><p>I mentioned the Cassells report and the Minister of State also should be cognisant of the point that third level is not for everyone.  While some work is being done with regard to apprenticeships, it may be an area in which we could be doing a lot more work.  The issue of trades might not be as sexy, if the expression can be excused, as going to third level college but it is vitally important-----</p></speech>

The Wake-up SUSI campaign was started by a group of students from my own native Limerick who attend Griffith College and some of them are in Dublin, as well as in the business college in Castletroy.   Approximately 140 students are affected by this at present.  They met the Minister of State recently and have met the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the past.  They certainly have run a successful campaign.  All of the points they have made are valid.  A number of them are from low-income families.  The same course may be on offer in Dublin or in Cork but the problem for a lot of them is they cannot afford to travel.  It keeps down the cost for them to be able to stay at home.  Some of them are single parents who have applied for the course.  What has added to their confusion is that some colleges that offer courses have advertised on the CAO form but did not make it clear that such courses were not eligible under the SUSI grant.  That has caused a layer of confusion for students.</p> <p>Some other private colleges are accredited by the institutes of technology and because of that are eligible for SUSI grants.  I am aware of a music course, for example, and a number of other courses that fall into this category.  Some people have learning difficulties and find that attending private colleges with smaller class sizes is easier for them than sitting in a big group of maybe 200 people at a lecture.  Some valid cases are being made by the students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Approximately 140 have been affected and some are afraid they will have to drop out if they are not eligible for the grant because they will not be able to afford the fees.  Many have had to get part-time jobs.  However, I compliment the Department on providing increased funding.</p><p>We want to encourage people to go to third level but also to pursue training and apprenticeships.  Many of the people who participate in these courses are in education for the second time.  They might not have been encouraged to go to third level when they left school so they go back as young adults .  They have families - who they do not want to leave at home - so they cannot afford to go to accredited colleges.  If a number of students are given the SUSI grant, I am sure others will apply for it.  However, our long-term aim is to encourage people into education and bigger classes do not suit everybody's needs.  It is important that we examine the circumstances behind why people apply to go to private colleges.  In many cases it is because the college is on their doorstep and they cannot afford to go to the universities or the institutes of technology in other cities.  They offer the same courses and they get the same accreditation as those who go to the universities and the institutes but who can avail of the SUSI grant.</p><p>Students made their case to the Minister and I support their case.

There are recommendations in the report which we welcome and there are some about which we hold some reservations.  We agree that there needs to be a review of the SUSI website to ensure that students are clear as to whether they are eligible and whether their third-level institution of choice is eligible in the context of SUSI grants.</p> <p>The testimony of students who have gone through the process of applying through the CAO, completing their examinations and being accepted into a college only to discover they are not eligible to obtain the maintenance grant makes it clear that the system is flawed.  The ambiguity and confusion relating to the system is unfair to students and their parents.  Other major reforms not included in this report are required in the context of SUSI.  A large number of students do not qualify for many grants based on the fact that gross income is used to calculate the rates.  We need to focus on how the grant scheme can be reformed to ensure a more equitable system whereby more students from disadvantaged backgrounds qualify and are supported throughout their State-delivered education.</p> <p>There are some matters that need to be teased out.  We know that there are two parts to the SUSI grant.  The first part is a maintenance grant to the student and the second is the State contribution to the institutional fees.  Is the report recommending that students who attend private institutions be given access to both avenues of funding or simply the maintenance grant?  If a student within the private education model is eligible for a SUSI grant, then there is a discussion to be held around access to the maintenance grant.  We know that money which goes into the hands of a socioeconomically disadvantaged student will be important to his or her welfare and well-being.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a concern, however, regarding the State directly financing and subsidising private third-level institutions and about money going from the State to directly benefit big business in the private sector.  We are talking about a rolling privatisation of our third-level system and that cannot be on the agenda of anyone concerned about funding for our public sector.  Rather than the State subsidising yet another privately-owned institution, we should be encouraging students to attend State-funded colleges and investigating the reasons why students feel the need to attend private colleges in the first place.  What needs are our State-funded third-level institutions not providing that the private ones are?  Anecdotal evidence suggests the facilities in private colleges tend to be of a lower standard than in our public third-level institutions.</p> <p>There needs to be much greater regulation of the private college sector.  Such regulation should cover the pay and working conditions of staff.  I understand that precarious work, lower pay and low-hour contracts can be particularly prevalent in the private college sector, which needs to be tackled.  I have also received expressions of concerns from a number of full-time staff in our public university, the University of Limerick, where there has been a growing trend toward precarious work and zero-hour contracts which can only be to the detriment of our third-level education system.</p> <p>If we are to address the failings of the SUSI grant, rather than investing money into subsidising the private education system, should we not further invest in our publicly-funded education system?  We could extend the grant threshold to students whose households earn more than &euro;50,000 and increase the number of students who could then attend public institutions.  We continue to hear countless stories of students not being able to attend public third-level institutions, let alone private ones, because their parents earn over &euro;50,000 combined and can therefore not access vital grants.  Those are the students and families we should prioritise.  We should also ensure the disability access schemes to public colleges receive better funding.  We could even put the money towards decreasing tuition fees in our public third-level institutions.  In fact, we should scrap tuition fees altogether and this is one of the points that distinguish our party from the parties of the right.</p> <p>We should reverse the horrendous cuts the education system has been subjected to over the past seven years.  Under Fine Gael and the Labour Party, State funding of third level plummeted by an incredible 25%, grants were cut, students who were dependent on that assistance went for months without help and many dropped out of college altogether, having been literally priced out of education.  Participation from those in the lower socioeconomic groupings in our society in public colleges is now at 26% while we have practically full participation from those born into the higher professional grouping.  These statistics tell us that, at present, access to third level is not on merit but is a lottery based on which family and which area a person is born into.  That level of gross inequality is, unfortunately, Government policy-driven.</p> <p>It is the State's responsibility to ensure that all of our children shall have access to third-level public institutions.  It should be the right of every young person in the country and we should not have to rely on private universities or private colleges to provide services which we cannot provide.  As the largest party of the left in this country, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to build a consensus among progressive parties and garner broad support for an education system which would be fully publicly-funded and accessible to all citizens.  Is this even on the Government's agenda?  I have to say I do not think so.  Many students cannot access third level, State-funded education and many others drop out for financial reasons.  Our focus needs to be on greater reform to avoid these situations.  Our guiding principle must be that asserted by the Union of Students in Ireland, that education is a right, not a privilege.</p></speech>

I commend the report of the education committee because it highlights practical measures to be taken.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People are coming to us who are doing a course in a private college, typically with Griffith College.  It is the same as anywhere else and yet one person qualifies for a grant and one does not.  The Cassells report has been produced and I have seen the costs involved.  Many of these private colleges have been there for years and they are part of the social fabric.  One that we all know nationally is Griffith College.  I attended there many years ago when I was studying chartered accountancy.  It was the previous incarnation of Griffith College at that time.  We are always looking for equity in education and the question arises in respect of Wake-up SUSI.  The Cassells report is relatively recent, from 2016, but is there some way that the Minister might do a review to ascertain whether something has not been seen?  Is there some way in which we can give some alleviation to students who are from low-income families to ensure that people are not treated differently or discriminated against because they are in a private college doing a course rather than a public college?  This is something we need to look at.  The tax measures that apply in the private colleges will only be of benefit to those paying tax.  Many of the parents of such students might not be paying tax.  Their income might be relatively low or if they are paying tax, the fees would not get full tax relief.  </p><p>Can a review be carried out on this one particular item?  Can it be taken from the Cassells report and examined to see if something can be done?  These colleges have not been set up in the morning and many of them have built up credibility.  They are offering an array of recognised degrees.  Griffith College will have a graduation ceremony this evening for some of their students.  It a regular feature and is no different from any other third level institution.  The Minister of State might ask her officials to have a fresh look to ascertain whether something can be done for students attending reputable private institutions in which exactly the same qualifications are gained as in a publically-funded State institution.  In one institution, students qualify for grants while in the other, they do not.  I am glad to contribute to this worthwhile debate.  It is all about education and perhaps the Minister of State might have a fresh look outside the box at this issue.</p></speech>

While it is a worthwhile report, I feel the issues in it tinker around the edges.  The last time the Minister of State was in this Chamber, we had a long discussion about third level funding and about income-contingent loan schemes or the potential for their introduction.  She made the point that she was waiting for the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to come up with proposals to react to the Cassells report.  Once the committee did its work the Minister of State said she would react to it.  I do not think that washes anymore as a political answer.  It is time for the Minister of State and her Department to take leadership in this area.  I am still exasperated at the her ministerial colleague in the same Department, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who still will not state he believes in equality in education in terms of pay and will not commit to the vision of free education.  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, have launched a campaign and the Labour Party has launched a campaign to have a vision for free education at all levels, namely, primary, secondary and third level.  The Minister of State's response to our debate was that the Joint Committee on Education and Skills should be allowed to do its work and then to come back to her.  That is not good enough.  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills is not in charge of education policy in the country.  The Minister of State and her Department are.  She should be driving the agenda; not the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  If the committee has not got down to doing the work, is not conducting hearings and is nowhere near producing a report on it, the Minister of State then must step in as the visionary for higher level education in this country.  Hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, regardless of the standard of contributor to that committee, is just not good enough.  We need from the Minister of State a strong commitment to a vision for free education.  No one suggests this can happen overnight, in one budget or even in a number of budgets.  It might be possible over five years or perhaps over ten years.  However, were that vision to be announced by the Minister of State and her ministerial colleague in the same Department, we might be able to work together to achieve it.  Until this point, however, the Minister of State has been hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and saying it is up to it to come up with proposals.  It is not; it is actually up to the Minister, her ministerial colleague and their Department to set out that vision as to how third level education should be funded and to set out the vision for free education.  That is something I believe we should all be able to share and work towards with the Minister.</p> <p>My final point is when we were in government with Fine Gael, one of the biggest rows we had was over the issue of grants for third level.  The contention of the Labour Party is that PAYE workers are constantly taking up the tab for others who find access to third level grants, be they maintenance grants or other grants, because of the magic wand of accountants that certain self-employed professions are able to employ.  I recall an example of one individual who had &euro;250,000 in a savings account but was still eligible for a full suite of grants for his children to attend third level education.  A PAYE worker would not be able to do that.  These matters are assessed on need but the suggestion that we would have any kind of a capital assets test, in whatever way, was hugely resisted by the Minister's own party in government and we did not get very far on introducing that.  In a system where approximately 45% to 50% of students are availing of some level of grants and it costs approximately &euro;300 million a year to administer these grants, I would have assumed that the most vulnerable of students would be the ones who would avail of these grants and not those who have accountants who can move the money around.  Unfortunately, that remains the case.  I have two questions for the Minister of State.  Does she believe in free education and will she stop hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in order that she can verbalise that vision and work towards it?  What is the position in respect of the capital asset test and can we look forward to a day when PAYE workers will not always be asked to pick up the tab for those who can avail of accountants who can hide assets and therefore get the grants they do not deserve?</p></speech>

I join my colleague, Senator Gavan, in thanking the committee for its work.  I am glad to have the opportunity to join the discussion relating the third level maintenance grant.  I commend the Wake-up SUSI campaign group and support its cause.  The grant needs to be more robust.  There have been ongoing issues with that grant since my time in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  Grants need to support anyone in third level who needs means assistance, which was the original intention of the maintenance grant.  However, through years of Government indifference towards students, we now have a system that is not fit for purpose.  It is a system that does not cater for those who have lower incomes.  We have a system where the income limits and grant awards have been cut by successive Governments despite the cost of living increases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not consider the extortionate price of rental accommodation that students face or the increases in the cost of transport, books and utilities.  Governments were warned against this by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI.  Indeed, the DIT cost of living survey conducted in summer of this year found that the average cost to attend college for a student in Dublin was &euro;12,495 and &euro;11,766 elsewhere.  <br/><br/>A household can often have two or three students at college at the same time but the grant does not allow for any easing in terms of income limits up to the level of four dependent children.  The gross income for a household must be below &euro;45,000 for a student to receive any level of maintenance.  At that limit, the cost of living is covered to a maximum of 6.4%.  The income limits of the grant do not recognise the actual lived experience of students in 2017.  Students from lower and middle income households are struggling which is why student assistance fund applications have sky rocketed.  <br/><br/>Sinn F&eacute;in believes the Minister should initiate an affordability review of third level education.  There would be some stark findings for the Department in such a review.  The Minister should also review the adjacency rate change, made in 2011, which extended the distance criteria from 24 km to 45 km.  The implication was that all students living within 45 km of a college were expected to commute.  This did not take into account the location of a college <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the transport infrastructure in an area, meaning that it has had a more serious impact on rural communities.  The move was made without considering how it might play out.  <br/><br/>I join other Senators in thanking the students from Griffith College student's union for their report which highlights one of the many issues with the student grant.  I hope the Minister identifies this as an opportunity to right that wrong.</p></speech>

It enables growth and innovation through high quality research and learning, facilitates the self-actualisation of citizens, opens up access routes for under-represented groups and ensures that Ireland Inc. remains an attractive place in which to invest.</p><p>To deliver on these key social and economic priorities, the Government needs to make the right choices.  We need to prioritise investment across a key range of areas, across society and within education.  Decisions on the future funding of student supports will be informed by the consideration of the options contained in the Cassells report published in July 2016.  As committed to in the programme for Government, the report has been referred to the relevant Oireachtas committee.  Out of respect for that committee, I am awaiting its report before any making any decisions in that regard.  I am happy to give a commitment in Seanad &Eacute;ireann today that once I get the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, I will bring it to Cabinet and decisions will be made.  </p><p>While the Cassells report deals with the medium and long-term funding needs of higher education, the Government has been cognisant of the immediate funding challenges in the sector.  It was in this context that additional moneys were secured in budgets 2017 and 2018 for the higher education sector.  This year, for the first time, the budget for education has exceeded &euro;10 billion, some &euro;2.6 billion of which is for higher and further education.  The Government, to be fair, has put its money where its mouth is and is investing in education.  Admittedly, we need more investment in higher and further education but this year's budget is a statement of intent in the sense that it provided a substantial increase for the sector.  There will be &euro;200 million in public, private partnerships for the 11 institutes of technology.  A commitment was also made last year to invest an additional &euro;100 million in higher and further education, bringing the total to be spent on capital between 2018 and 2021 to &euro;360 million.  Additional money was also provided in budget 2017 for access plans targeting disadvantaged groups.  Last year, funding for these plans amounted to &euro;36.5 million while this year, &euro;60 million was provided on top of the &euro;36.5 million.  There is a serious commitment in that context.</p><p>I was asked about the CAO issue, which I fully recognise because the Wake-up SUSI group made a very strong case to me.  The CAO is planning to put a link on its website to the SUSI list of approved courses for 2018, which I welcome.  Another Senator referred to tax relief.  Such relief is available at the standard rate for all fees, including those of private colleges.  </p><p>  The additional money that I have just mentioned will be targeted at various access measures such as maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students, lone parents, a</p><p>new 1916 bursary scheme and measures to incentivise higher education institutions to attract more students from disadvantaged communities.  Other higher education activities that will benefit from the additional funding include <i>inter alia </i>research, skills, technological universities and institutional mergers, flexible learning, demographics and the international education strategy.</p><p>While the State provides some Exchequer funding to private higher education institutions in certain instances, for example, through the Springboard programme and an ICT skills conversion programme, this is very different from a proposal to extend the free fees initiative and student supports to students in private institutions.  To do so would require significant additional investment at a time when there are challenges in meeting existing levels of demand.  We also need to be cognisant of other cohorts of students who would benefit from accessing the free fees initiative and the student grant scheme if resources were available.  In particular, these include part-time students, postgraduate students and repeat students.  In the decisions it has taken, the Government has sought to prioritise funding where it will be most effective.</p><p>I have great ambitions for what can be achieved in higher education.  I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills is finalising its deliberations and is due to report</p><p>to the Minister for Education and Skills in the near future.  </p><p>A number of other issues were raised during the debate.  A Senator asked a question about larger families.  There are different income thresholds for families with fewer than four dependent children, families with four to seven children and families with eight or more children.  There are increments available when additional students are attending college.  There are different grant rates for those children.  The student assistance fund is also available.  </p><p>I think I have covered most of the points made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have taken on board the points that Senators Gavan, Gallagher, Byrne, Kieran O'Donnell, &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in and Warfield have made and will consider them and talk to the officials about them.

Last year the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said we need to encourage our insurance companies not to use this as an excuse to hike insurance premiums.  The encouragement needs to be strengthened.  That is why I have tabled this amendment to attempt to monitor premiums that are being helped from the public purse in respect of risk equalisation rates.  It is necessary for this Bill to be passed but we need to be prudent and look after the public purse too and make sure there are no unintended consequences of this encouragement not to put up premiums.  We need to have oversight of this and keep the insurance companies to their word; they can increase premiums but not so high that they will increase their profit.</p><p>Community rating is important in our two-tier system which has come under scrutiny lately.  I hope the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report will be enacted in the coming years to create a system based on need only and not on ability to pay.

This is about risk equalisation.  The money is not coming from the Department of Health or from Government expenditure.  Rather, it is being charged to the general public through their payments.</p> <p>I agree with my colleague that insurance companies should not be allowed to use this as a reason to increase premiums.  However, there is competition out there, and we must be careful that any legislation is not in breach of the competition rules of the European Union.  It is true that we need to protect the public.  However, over the last 12 to 18 months, the number of people who are taking out private health insurance has increased by over 150,000.  It is important that we have competition in the market.  At one point we had only one insurer in real terms, now we have a number of them.  No matter what regulation one brings in, competition is the only way of keeping prices down.  It is important that we encourage that.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Devine for the proposed amendment.  The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors, such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care and the cost of claims, and therefore contribute to the cost of premiums payable.  Health care usage is strongly linked with age.  The ageing of the population has implications for health care policy generally and can directly impact health insurance premium prices.</p> <p>This is why we have a risk equalisation scheme in the health insurance market, whereby credits are paid to all insurers to take account of the older and sicker members on their books.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts.  The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.</p> <p>A crucial point is that all of the moneys collected from the stamp duties are transferred to a fund administered by the Health Insurance Authority and redistributed back to the health insurance companies by way of credits in respect of older and sicker people.  None of the stamp duties on each health insurance contract goes to the Government.  They are all redistributed to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy people.  Health insurers have often cited increases in stamp duty rates as being one of a number of different contributors to the cost of health insurance premiums.  However, it is not the case that any increase or decrease to the rates of stamp duty automatically lead to an increase or decrease in the cost of health insurance premiums.</p> <p>The other contributory factors to costs which I have mentioned are also taken into consideration in the commercial pricing decisions taken by each insurer when setting their product prices.  I mentioned already that the total amount collected in stamp duty from insurers equals the total amount of credits paid to insurers.  If the amount of stamp duty collected was higher than the credits paid then the scheme would be inflationary for the market.  Conversely, if the stamp duty collected was lower than the credits paid, temporary funding would be required from the Exchequer.  This is where the role and expertise of the Health Insurance Authority is particularly relevant.  Taking into account market trends, each year the authority is able to accurately predict the total cost of credits and the stamp duty rates required to fund them.</p> <p>As part of its evaluation and analysis of the market, the Health Insurance Authority already provides information on premium inflation in the market.  The most recent information provided by the authority, for the 12-month period ending in June 2017, shows that the average gross premium paid by consumers was &euro;1,188.  This represents a 2% increase on the average premium paid in the 12 months prior to June 2016, when the figure was &euro;1,164.  Given that the Health Insurance Authority already has an ongoing role in the evaluation and analysis of market information including premium inflation, on behalf of the Minister I decline to accept the proposed amendment.  We believe it is not necessary, and therefore we will reject it. </p></speech>

One would almost need a PhD in mathematics to be able to make sense of the current health insurance market, because the plans are so complicated.  I refer to the complexity of the differentials between the plans, the add-ons that are added on, the take-offs that are taken off, etc.  What Senator Devine is putting forward is very much in favour of the consumer buying the insurance, because it is very difficult for anybody to compare plans and costs.  Senator Devine is putting forward the case that if the equalisation fund is used in such a way as to make sure that there is balance, so that people who are older or at greater health risk are covered, that is fair enough.  However, we do not want to see premiums sneaking upwards in a crafty way, by a small add-on here or there, to ensure that the credits are subsumed into the company's profits and it is the consumers who pay that little bit extra at the end of the day.</p> <p>I understand what Senator Burke is calling for, namely, that we should leave it to the open market, but we have left it to the open market in many other areas.  Some of the companies in the insurance area, in the car insurance market for example, are absolutely fleecing people when they can get away with it.  We have seen that regulation is practically useless in that scenario, and no amount of Government finger-wagging or telling the insurers that this is bad and it should stop has actually alleviated the situation.  We find a similar situation in health insurance for returning emigrants.  I deal with a lot of spokespersons for the diaspora who tell me that one of their main barriers to coming home is the cost of health insurance.  The irony is that some of these people are insured with the same company in a different jurisdiction, but when they come back here, their no-claims bonus or their track record with that company is not taken into consideration.</p> <p>We believe that we cannot trust the companies or the market here.  What we are trying to do is look after the patients in this scenario, or customers, as the companies see them, and make sure that it is a level playing-field.  If the equalisation fund is being used in a proper manner, to make sure that people across the board can get health insurance, then we should put every safeguard in place to make sure that the companies cannot subsume those moneys into their own profit margins by some stealth method.  Go raibh maith agat. </p></speech>
