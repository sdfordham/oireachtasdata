Without going into detail on the personalities involved, I want to raise one point with the Deputy Leader and receive a commitment on it.  I raised this matter on many occasions prior to the imposition of what those in government call the local property tax which, as we know, is not a local property tax.  I saw four of the Deputy Leader's colleagues rail against it, interestingly and ironically, by way of a motion in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I remind these Deputies that they voted to bring it in.  I said at the time that it was an anti-urban and anti-Dublin tax because it was based on valuation.  I remain opposed to it.  As we know, not one cent of it went to the local authorities this year; it all went into the Central Fund.  From what we hear in reports it appears the Government will decide to reduce subventions from central government to local authorities in areas in which a higher proportion of property tax is collected.  We were told when the measure was brought forward that it would be used to support and enhance local government services.  It appears that the areas in which a higher proportion of the property tax is collected will be penalised because the Government will reduce the subventions.  I note that Senator Pat O'Neill is shaking his head, but by all accounts his party's main man in Kilkenny will not be the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government soon.  I ask whoever will be the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government post-8 July which I understand is the date the Taoiseach will announce the reshuffle-----</p></speech>

Be it the current Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, or whoever else, there will be ample time prior to the summer recess for whoever is the Minister to come into the House and answer questions for us.<br />I wish to make one further point.  We have discussed the very important centenaries to be marked in the next few years, one of which is the centenary of the start of the First World War.  As we all know, in 2016 we will mark the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  I ask that well in advance of that centenary we have a proper debate which I would invite the former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, to attend.  I was somewhat dismayed but, unfortunately, not surprised by his comments at the Irish Embassy in London yesterday where he said:<blockquote>...Padraig Pearse rejoiced in violence.  He rejoiced in the prospect of unionists arming.  I think he was wrong about that.  He was a romantic.</blockquote>I know the former Taoiseach's background.  He professed himself to be a Redmondite, which is fine, but, interestingly, in his remarks yesterday interestingly - I would like to question him about this - he made no criticism of his hero John Redmond who sent tens of thousands of Irish people to fight for the British Empire in Europe in the First World War.  These comments by a former Taoiseach carry a lot of weight - excuse the pun in that regard. </p></speech>

When I heard it, I tweeted that the Taoiseach had declared many months ago that he would campaign for marriage equality and he is true to his word, for which I thank him.  This morning On &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said the Government would set a date for the referendum and campaign for marriage equality.  Of course, this is a momentous day for those of us who have campaigned on this issue for decades.  I received a tweet that it was an important side topic but that there were many more issues to be dealt with.  It is a side topic for whom.  It is an issue for a minority and their families and friends.  The Government has a programme to support minorities, as well as majorities.  It is also a critical announcement because it is the first that a recommendation of the Constitutional Convention will be followed up on.  I again remind my colleagues that 79% of the delegates at the convention voted in favour of putting the issue of marriage equality to the people.  I am thinking of other recommendations of the convention, for example, holding a referendum on economic, social and cultural rights, and look forward to hearing from the Government on its actions on these other recommendations because, ultimately, the measure of how successful the convention has been is how the Government responds to its recommendations.  </p><p>Can we have a debate with the Taoiseach on the report of the Constitutional Convention, with reference to its recommendation on marriage equality?  I know that a debate took place in the D&aacute;il, but to distinguish our debate from that of our colleagues in the Lower House, perhaps we might use the report as a springboard to feed into the design of the constitutional referendum in the autumn.  As all of us are aware, many of us have been active on this issue for a number of years on both sides of the argument and, no doubt, will be invited to debate it outside the House many times.  My request is to use the House for what it is best at - drawing on the expertise of its Members to debate in a rational and respectful manner the detailed human, cultural and sociological complexities of law.  For example, I want to debate the meaning of the terms &quot;the common good&quot; and &quot;the natural law&quot; and how they relate to the 21st century understanding of civil marriage.  I want to reflect on the resources we use to make law, the ethical traditions and the sociological and psychological evidence.  The T&aacute;naiste once said marriage equality was the civil rights issue of this era.  I thank him for having that conviction, particularly as he is about to leave that office.  As I know that there are some who disagree with him, we need to have a debate on such a fundamental legal institution, the human right to access legal protections and the status surrounding what is one of the most fundamental promises one human makes to another.  Wider still, it should take in what we want Irish culture to mean.  Are we open, respectful and inclusive?  I am asking the Leader to have this debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>With regard to the referendum on this issue, I look forward to rolling up my sleeves with my beloved spouse and partner to take the final lap in our race for love.</p></speech>

I will not go through all of them, but they include recognising family carers as an exceptional group, implementing the national carers strategy, reviewing the fair deal scheme and restoring the respite care grant to the figure of &euro;1,700.  Major issues for the association are the provision of support for carers caring for those with a mental illness, basing eligibility for a medical card on need rather than income and flat rate prescription charges.  Many other changes are requested, but these are the ones that come to mind and that I recognise as being very important.  In the discussions and debate as we move towards budget 2015 it is very important that the House discuss and debate these issues.  If the economy continues to grow at its current rate, there will room for manoeuvre.  The submission made by the Carers Association should receive priority in order that we can help the neediest in society in budget 2015.  I am asking whoever will be Minister for Social Protection in the coming weeks to come to the House to discuss this issue before we break for the summer and sit down to decide the terms of budget 2015.</p></speech>

I will give an idea of the figures spoken about yesterday.  The rent had been &euro;728,000 but has now been increased to &euro;1.46 million until 2017.  The House has passed the Upward Only Rent (Clauses and Reviews) Bill 2013, but it has not been passed by the other House.  The reason I am at pains in saying this is that yesterday the judge said the decision was based on the specific terms of the lease and that the court was not setting a precedent.</p> <p>As such, it does not set a precedent, but both Government parties included in their manifestos the desire to abolish upward-only rent reviews.  Three learned experts have supported the view that it is constitutional to abolish such reviews.  The trouble is that the Attorney General believes it is not.  Standing Order 55 reads: "A Minister of State or an Attorney General may attend and be heard in the Seanad."  Will the Deputy Leader invite the Attorney General to the House to explain her stance on upward-only rent reviews?  This is an important matter.  Yesterday's decision does not close the door, but there is a difference of opinion among lawyers. Just as when doctors differ and patients die, whether there will be a death knell for many small businesses depends on this legislation passing.  I urge the Government to support it in the Lower House, after which the President will send it to the Supreme Court for a decision.  In this way, the situation will be clear.  I urge the Government parties to remove the Whip when the Bill is shortly before the Lower House.</p></speech>

On last Thursday's "Prime Time", Ms Aoife Hegarty did a sad report on the death of a six year old girl in Connemara due to medical issues.  The Conroy family tried to have a hearing with the Medical Council on the death of Aibha.  Due to particular legal circumstances, the Corbally High Court ruling kicked in when the family tried to have the case heard.  The programme raised serious issues about the ruling's effect on people who were taking cases where they believed there had been poor professional performance or standards in the medical profession had not been upheld.  The programme also stated that there were serious implications for the role of the Medical Council as an independent arbitrator in ensuring that patients got justice.  A number of families feel that they are not getting justice because of the double jeopardy rule.  When the Medical Council holds a hearing, it now takes a narrow interpretation of the High Court ruling, which makes it difficult to prove poor professional performance.  Once the hearing has been held, the case cannot be heard again because of the double jeopardy rule.</p><p>A number of issues arise.  Some pertain to us while others to the families that feel they have not got justice.  At least 11 other cases are pending Medical Council hearings.  I would appreciate it if the Minister for Health attended the Seanad to debate the role of the Medical Council in this and its intentions for those other cases.  An appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court in the autumn.  Does the Medical Council intend to postpone the current cases until after that has been ruled upon?  If it does not, it will leave other families in a position similar to that of the Conroys, in that they will feel they have been denied justice.  Why did the council not postpone the hearing of the Conroy case or pursue other courses of action that would have revealed more answers as to why that tragic situation occurred?  The family would like to have the truth and answers and does not want to see other families in the same position.  The Minister's attendance for a debate on this matter would be important.</p></speech>

Many Senators were involved in the constitutional convention and have much to contribute to the debate.<br />I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, of the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for those women who underwent symphysiotomies.  I have raised this issue continually since entering the House.  There has not been a week that I have not called for the Walsh or Murphy report.  I am delighted that they were published yesterday.  Payments under the scheme will range from &euro;50,000 to &euro;150,000.  The procedure that those women underwent during childbirth was cruel and barbaric.  Many underwent it in my local hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, in County Louth.  The practice was continued until 1984.  I have dealt with many fine women in recent years who never gave up.  They constantly sought answers and pressed for what happened yesterday.  It was a long time coming.  I pay tribute to the unwavering courage and determination of the survivors and I am delighted that their day eventually came.  Dealing with this issue formed part of the programme for Government.</p></speech>

John Bruton is entitled to express his opinion.  If the Senator disagrees with his view then that is fine but do not deny him his right of expression.  The Senator said that John Bruton should not have said what he said.  If the Senator disagrees with what he said then that is a different matter.  Also, John Redmond united the Irish Parliamentary Party, worked very hard for home rule and his son died in the conflict.  He is another of our great heroes.  We need not be exclusive here.

A young man named James Kirwan is seated in the Visitors Gallery, he is from Shankill and he is a liver and kidney double transplant patient.  Since 2006 he has never looked back after his transplant operation.  He is on the youth advisory council of the new children's hospital which is only right.  His attendance here today parallels with Dr. Eilish Hardiman's appearance in <i>The Irish Times</i>, on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; and in other press about the unanimous agreement on the children's hospital being sited at St. James's.<br />We have had many arguments here about the matter but I shall not go back into the matter.  Mr. James Kirwan has been on the council as a young man, a teenager and now as an adult.  He agrees that the hospital should be located at St. James's and I am inclined to agree with him due to his experience of spending most of his life in hospital.  As he said to me this morning, he will remain in hospital as an adult because that is how he will stay alive, and he is happy to remain there.  He is on his way to university also.  It is important that somebody like him who was put on the council by the Government is here today.  He is the type of person that should influence policy, politics and how we move forward in health.  I congratulate and welcome him to the House.  I hope that one day he may be here as a politician.  </p></speech>

I was very distressed to find out from a patient, in correspondence I received this morning, that the drug fampridine, which has been shown to improve the ability of patients with multiple sclerosis who have impaired mobility to walk, is now being withdrawn.  Also, folks who have MS, many of whom who are bad enough to need the drug - I will not say most - will not be able to work and, therefore, will be on a fixed income, depending on their supports.  They have now been told that they will have to find &euro;300 per month to pay for the drug as support for it has been withdrawn.</p><p>MS is a relatively uncommon condition and it is only prescribed for patients with MS who need the medication.  I know we do not live in an economic vacuum and I know the health service does not exist in an economic vacuum.  However, I also know that the HIQA and the Department of Health is still hiring public relations people, that HIQA could find the money to increase the number of inspectors up to over 200 and that front-line staff, as we mentioned yesterday, are being reduced and replaced with more expensive agency staff.</p><p>Reducing the mobility of a patient with MS increases his or her dependence, and also the costs and investment in other health care and social support resources that must be made.  It is a classic example of non-joined-up thinking.  Whatever department of the HSE is responsible for drug budgets just sees its budget.  It is classic silo thinking and silo mentality.  It is the same kind of thinking which resulted in the closure of the obesity surgery unit in St. Vincent's when every one of its operations saved money.  We must convey the message that colossal mismanagement is taking place.  I have highlighted this further example and thank Senators for their attention.</p></speech>

I understand that the next phase is to select the design team with construction to commence in the spring of 2015 which is only a number of months away.  In 2018 the hospital is scheduled to be opened almost 20 years after the idea was first mooted.</p><p>There will be continuous debate and opinions on whether St. James's is the appropriate location or whether the hospital should be located somewhere else.  There will be debates on whether it is the right design, and there will be debates on the traffic and so forth.  It is almost ten years since the McKinsey report was produced which said that one of the prerequisites of a new national paediatric hospital was that it should be co-located with an adult hospital.  Yet paediatricians differ from that opinion and say that the prerequisite is to have it co-located with a maternity hospital in order to avoid any trauma being suffered, during the journey to the new hospital, by premature and newborn babies who suffer from various defects.   </p><p>I note that planning permission has not yet been applied for.  Almost a year and a half ago I brought it to the attention of the House that the planning permission should be the phase 2 option for a maternity hospital.  Unfortunately I did not get any answers to my particular query back then.  In the history of planning permissions, phase 2 approvals for hospitals have never taken place.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure that the application for planning permission is made for a maternity hospital rather than waiting for the hospital to be built and then realising that planning permission for a maternity hospital is needed.  Go raibh maith agat.  </p></speech>

Also, in the context of the outstanding performance by the United States team in the World Cup, which sadly went out last night having put up one of the bravest fights anyone has seen in a football game in the World Cup, the team was outstanding and many people in this country adopted the USA because they are, after all, our cousins and we did not have one of our own, particularly after England went out of the World Cup.</p></speech>

Who knows what would have happened then?  It did not, unfortunately, but I am sure the Deputy Leader would like to convey the good wishes of the House to the new ambassador, Mr. O'Malley, and raise with the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ongoing negotiations on the J1 graduates visa, which is due to expire in October after a five-year cycle.  My understanding is there is optimism that the visa will be renewed.  It is different from the standard student J1 visa and allows graduates, under certain eligibility criteria, to work in the United States on an exchange programme for a minimum of one year.  The problem is that many employers in the US are reluctant to take on Irish graduates for a one-year period so I understand negotiations focus on extending it to a two-year term.  This will be of great benefit, particularly to graduates who wish to gain overseas work experience and bring it back to this country for the benefit of this economy.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader can raise the matter with the T&aacute;naiste and get an update on current negotiations on the renewal and possible extension of the visa.</p></speech>

I welcome the offer of compensation to the families concerned and the acknowledgement of the inappropriateness of the actions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this case.  I commend the Ombudsman for Children on her very straightforward report and clear recommendations.  I also acknowledge the comment in the report that the Ombudsman for Children accepts the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was acting at all times in the best interests of the children concerned.  That is not an excuse for what happened and I note the comments of the acting Garda Commissioner who fully accepted the report and indicated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take all measures within its powers to ensure such events do not recur.<br />I support my colleague, Senator Mary Moran, in commending the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on yesterday's announcement that Cabinet agreement has been reached on an <i>ex gratia</i>compensation payment scheme for approximately 250 women.  The tragedy for the women concerned was an issue taken seriously by the Minister in opposition and in government.  I am glad that he has been able to secure agreement from Cabinet for proposals that will hopefully be of great assistance to the women concerned.</p></speech>

As a society, we need to apply the question more broadly and I fear that the answer maybe "No".  I was deeply touched by the seven-year-old Roma girl who has reportedly dyed her hair black not to look prettier but to fit in.  Why did she do that?  Even at the tender age of seven years, she figured out that she would be safe by doing so and would look like the rest of her family and not be in danger of being taken again.  The issue raises many questions.  The Ombudsman for Children has declared the Athlone case to be an example of racial profiling.  It raises questions about the type of society we are, how tolerant we are, how respectful we are and whether we respect difference.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to come to the House before the summer to examine a number of matters.  These include the changes to policing, changes to GSOC and to discuss the report by the Ombudsman for Children.  This will happen again and there will be other child cases.  What new protocols will be in place?  How will it be handled in the future?  We need the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take situations seriously but we must always be innocent until proven guilty.  Are there better ways of handling things?  Should a social worker have handled it alone?  We must be careful.  We value the family in our Constitution.  Everything that could go wrong went wrong in these two cases.  Considering the breadth of the role that the former Leader of the Opposition in this House, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, holds as Minister for Justice and Equality, it would be useful if we could have the debate before the summer recess.</p></speech>

My understanding, following an Adjournment debate two weeks ago, is that a new application for approval had been submitted by the drug company and it is being considered.  Hopefully, the drug will be made available in the not too distant future.  This is a matter of utmost importance to the people who require the drug.  The sooner a decision on approval is made, the better.</p></speech>

Our beef farmers are unable to secure markets.  The British market is effectively closed due to the labelling issue in Northern Ireland and the inaction by the current Minister cannot go unnoticed.  It is certainly not going unnoticed among farmers.  A Private Members' motion was tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il last week and the Minister failed to show up.  I have high regard for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but his current actions leave much to be desired.  Perhaps he has his eye on another ball but he should not drop the ball he is currently holding.  The Irish beef industry is worth &euro;2 billion to the Irish economy.  Prices have decreased by 15% to 20% as a result of the lack of live export trade and the lack of political will by the Minister to address the labelling issue north of the Border.  We should have Irish beef labelled as Irish beef on a 32 county basis.  British retailers would then accept it as Irish beef but, due to a labelling anomaly, British retailers are not willing to accept beef reared here and finished in the North.  It is creating major difficulty.  I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a debate this week, if possible, with the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I hope we can find time.  I do not want to push the issue to a vote tomorrow and I will give the Deputy Leader, in conjunction with the Leader's office, space to allow the Minister to come before the House.  This is a major crisis.  Small suckler farmers will be wiped out unless something is done over the next week or two.</p></speech>

If the Seanad has a constitutional entitlement to receive such a presentation, it would be worthwhile.  The issue has been the subject of much debate in the House.  We hear about the programmes for Government and their importance and that they are sacrosanct.  There was a Fine Gael proposal, a Labour Party proposal and a proposal in the programme for Government to deal with the issue.

It is a matter of jobs.  A Government for jobs, surely, would examine the issue and try to fulfil not only the electoral commitments but also the commitments made in the programme for Government.  I thank Senator Feargal Quinn and my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for keeping it on the agenda.

However, it is also worth noting the high level of compliance with the tax, a feature sometimes overlooked in debates on the matter.  Revenue which is engaged in ongoing collection of the local property tax has already collected over &euro;291 million this year.  It has achieved a compliance rate of 94% for 2013 and 91% for 2014.  That is most impressive and shows that, by and large, people have signed up to the tax.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely with the Senator that it is altogether welcome to hear the Taoiseach's confirmation.  The Senator reminded us of the 79% vote at the Constitutional Convention in favour of marriage equality and the T&aacute;naiste's comment that this was the civil rights issue for our generation, a comment with which I agree.  I will gladly seek a debate on the report of the convention on marriage equality in order that the House can debate, in particular, the design of the referendum.  I look forward to campaigning with the Senator in favour of the referendum proposal.</p><p>Senator Denis Landy commented on The Carers Association's briefing this morning and the various issues raised, including the recognition of family carers, the review of the fair deal scheme and so on.

The HSE has established an expert panel which will examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that should be considered for inclusion as part of the process.  It is chaired by Professor Frank Keane and has been asked to report to the director general of the health service by September.  I gather swift progress is being made.</p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about the decision made by the Supreme Court yesterday in the Bewley's case.  I have not yet had an opportunity to read the judgment, but I know that we will all do so with interest.  It is a matter of profound regret that the Government has not moved on the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  Clearly, as many colleagues have acknowledged, there has been different legal advice and the Supreme Court judgment is, undoubtedly, a blow to those who had hoped we could do something more about the matter.  The House passed Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill in February.  We all recognise the major imposition placed on small business by retention of these clauses, in particular.  The Senator called for the Attorney General to attend and be heard in the House.  I understand various requests have been made for the Attorney General to attend the House to deal with various matters.  There would, of course, be constraints on what she could say, given that she is the adviser to the Government and gives confidential legal advice.  That is a matter we can consider, perhaps when we have all had a chance to read, review and consider the Supreme Court's judgment.</p><p>Senator Michael Comiskey welcomed the Vodafone-ESB agreement on fibre-optic broadband services.  We all welcome it.</p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme broadcast last Thursday which I did not see concerning the tragic death of a six year old child in Connemara.  I am sorry to hear about the case.  I suggest it might be the subject an Adjournment matter since it involves a particular case.  I understand the Senator also raised the more general issue of the role of the Medical Council.  I will certainly ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss the broader topic.</p> <p>Perhaps that should take place after the appeal to the Supreme Court in the autumn which the Senator mentioned.<br />Senator Moran commended Senator Zappone and seconded her call for a debate on marriage equality, which I will seek.  She also welcomed the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, of the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for women survivors of symphysiotomy.  Senator Moran has done a great deal of work on this and has spoken on it many times.  I agree that it is a very welcome development.  At last there is some justice for those women.<br />Senator Leyden raised the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill.  I simply agreed yesterday to the amendment sought by Senator Henry, as the Leader always does with regard to being able to introduce a Bill.  I cannot say what inspired any individual to bring forward a Private Members' Bill; clearly, that is a matter for them.  However, it is a good idea that we debate this issue.  I think we should change our licensing laws to allow people to consume liquor on Good Friday.  Easter is a huge tourism date for us and it would simply make sense of something anomalous.  We could have a good debate on alcohol consumption generally with the introduction of the Bill.  However, it is a Private Members' Bill so the scheduling of debate on it will be up to the Fine Gael Members to decide.  I cannot say when it will be before the House.  It was circulated yesterday, so all Members should have the text of the Bill.<br />Senator Jim D'Arcy called for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on progress on diversity of patronage, given the report published yesterday by the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector.  All Members who spoke last night in the debate on the education Bill with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, paid tribute to his great work in reforming the education system in many ways and, in particular, in seeking to ensure greater diversity of patronage and greater choice for parents in the type of school to which they send their children.  I would welcome and will seek to have that debate.  Senator D'Arcy also referred to the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, and defended his right to give whatever view he wishes on P&aacute;draig Pearse.  That is absolutely right.<br />Senator O'Donnell welcomed James Kirwan, a liver and kidney transplant patient from Shankill.  I too welcome Mr. Kirwan and am glad he is on the youth advisory council of the new children's hospital.  It is great to have people such as Mr. Kirwan on the council.  We welcome the fact that progress is now being made on the hospital.  Senator Eamon Coghlan referred to the progress being made and the fact that the Cabinet has signed off on the blueprint for the hospital.  Construction will commence next spring and we hope the hospital will be open in 2018.  With regard to the site, which Senator O'Donnell also mentioned, I was one of those who wanted it to be sited adjacent to the Coombe Hospital, a major maternity hospital in Dublin, but the St. James's Hospital site is very close to the Coombe.  Senator Coghlan is right about seeking to ensure a maternity hospital is constructed alongside the children's hospital, but given that St. James's Hospital is such a major acute adult hospital, it is also very important that it be co-located there.<br />Senator O'Donnell also referred to the Botanic Gardens and encouraged all of us to visit Dublin's green lung.  I am regular visitor and I agree with the Senator that it is a fabulous facility in the centre of Dublin.</p></speech>

Senator Colm Burke has pointed out that he raised this on the Adjournment recently and that the HSE is to reconsider a new application on the matter.  Senator O'Brien has also raised this issue a number of times in the House, and it has been raised in the media.  All of us have concerns about this.  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of fampridine in the general medical services, GMS, and community drugs schemes.  In accordance with normal procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted an evaluation of fampridine and concluded that as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish health care setting it was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product, which has led to the difficulty.  However, the manufacturer may submit a new application at any time.  As Senator Colm Burke has pointed out, it has submitted a revised application for fampridine and the HSE is reconsidering it in accordance with the agreed procedures and timescales.  We all hope this matter will be resolved very swiftly for people with MS.</p><p>Senator Crown also raised the general HSE budget.  I responded on that issue yesterday.</p><p>Senator Mooney referred to our relationship with the US and extended a welcome to the new US ambassador, Mr. Kevin O'Malley.  We join Senator Mooney in that and in wishing all US citizens in Ireland a happy Fourth of July on Friday.  Like Senator Mooney, I was very impressed by the performance of the US football team in the World Cup generally and particularly in the match against Belgium last night.  The team fought really hard.  It is great to see soccer becoming such a popular sport across the US in recent years.</p><p>Senator Mooney also asked me to raise with the T&aacute;naiste the ongoing negotiations on the J1 graduate visa.  I will write to the T&aacute;naiste and ask him to ensure it is renewed this autumn.</p><p>Senator Naughton referred to the very welcome apology given yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the acting Garda Commissioner to the Roma families whose children were removed, and to the offer of compensation made by the Government.  Like Senator Naughton, I commend the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, on her excellent report.  I have read the recommendations section and some of the report, but I recommend that colleagues read it.  It is harrowing reading.  It is very difficult for a parent of young children to read about the way in which those children were removed and taken into care.  Clearly, this is a matter on which the State owes those families a very sincere apology and compensation.</p><p>The recommendations in the report are hugely important, particularly regarding the use of section 12 by the Garda.  I have acted in the Children's Court and in what is called the HSE court in respect of cases in which children are taken into care.  The garda&iacute; generally act in good faith and they do not tend to act unless there are real risks, but it would be great to have a proper review of the exercise of Garda powers more generally.  This report and the two incidents raise serious concerns about ethnic profiling and the manner in which these radical powers of the Garda are exercised.  As Senator Healy Eames pointed out, it is particularly disturbing to read about the seven year old girl who dyed her hair as a result of this.  It is dreadful to think of what she went through away from her family for two days.  I support the Government's apology to the families and I hope compensation will be paid swiftly to them.  Of course, it cannot compensate them for what happened, which was dreadful.</p><p>Senator Naughton also welcomed the symphysiotomy scheme.  I understand it will extend to approximately 350 women.</p><p>Senator Healy Eames also called for a general debate on policing with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I would prefer to have that debate in a couple of months.  We are still working on this and the justice committee will be holding more hearings on policing.  The committee has already made an interim set of recommendations on the GSOC reforms to be made and the Government has signed off on the heads of a Bill.  It would be good to have a debate on policing in the autumn to examine what else must be done, particularly in light of the report on the Roma families.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the fampridine issue, to which I have responded.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about prices for farmers in the bull beef crisis.  This was also raised by Senator O'Neill yesterday, who referred to the prices of livestock generally.  I said yesterday that I would invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the House to discuss this matter and for a more general debate on farming.  Senator Conway referred to the fulsome praise of the president of the IFA for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, which he expressed at the event in the Shelbourne Hotel yesterday.  I was not at it but I am glad the Minister was praised for his excellent work with the agriculture portfolio.  I also welcome Caroline Byrne, who is job-shadowing the Senator.  The Senator also referred to the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe the Senator's substantive point was to seek a debate on aviation and related industries with the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I will seek to arrange that debate.</p><p>Finally, Senator Bradford referred to the upward-only rent reviews, which I have dealt with.</p></speech>

We indicated that we would table amendments on Committee Stage and have done so.  Earlier in the year the D&aacute;il engaged in a very interesting Private Members' debate on a motion tabled by Independent Deputies on using the services of An Post in the making of social welfare payments.  As the Minister will know, when that debate took place, the trade unions involved were very concerned about any move that would strip post offices of services and their ability to provide them.  That concern arises as a result of the very precarious position in which some post offices, especially those in rural areas, find themselves.  Post offices are important to the social fabric not just of rural areas but also if communities the length and breadth of the State.<br />We are concerned about section 3 in the context of the move to replace the term &quot;An Post&quot; with that of &quot;payment service provider&quot;.  I listened to what the Minister had to say on this matter during her reply to the debate on Second Stage and also in the D&aacute;il.  I did not, however, find any comfort in her words.  If one reads the explanatory memorandum, it appears that section 3 is benign enough.  The explanatory memorandum states the section &quot;provides for changes to enable functions relating to payment of benefit or assistance and related payment services to be provided under arrangements with selected payment service providers&quot;.  The problem is that neither the Bill nor the explanatory memorandum refers to An Post.  In fact, the purpose of section 3 is to delete all references to An Post from the principal Act.  The Minister has previously indicated that this is necessary as a result of what is deemed to be the privileged position An Post holds, particularly in the context of any consideration of service provision in the future.  I do not have a difficulty in this regard.  An Post should hold a privileged position, especially in view of the hugely important role post offices play in communities throughout the State.  The post office network is crucial to the social fabric, especially in rural areas but also in urban neighbourhoods.  The removal of An Post's status creates the possibility of a multinational company or bank with no connection to communities swooping in and acquiring the contract for social welfare payments.  That would not be in the best interests of social welfare recipients or the wider community.<br />The Minister will be aware of the Grant Thornton report on the future of post offices which was published some time ago and highlighted how up to 557 of the 1,150 post offices could close if the social welfare contact was removed from An Post.</p></speech>

I am merely reciting what was contained in it.  It stated there was potential for 557 of the 1,150 post offices to close if the social welfare contract was removed from An Post.  The figures in this regard may not be correct, but there is absolutely no doubt that if the contract were to be removed, post offices would come under huge pressure.  The contract is vital for post offices because the service to which it relates is pivotal and attracts customers in the first instance.  It also makes post offices central hubs in the communities in which they are located.  That is what the Grant Thornton report states and the Irish Postmasters Union has made the same point.  Its members have struggled to survive in a very difficult environment.  Instead of creating even more difficulties, the Government should be developing a national strategy to protect the post office network and the jobs of the 3,000 people employed within it.</p><p>The Minister can see what we are trying to do with the amendments in the context of amending any section which replaces the term &quot;An Post&quot; with that of &quot;payment service provider&quot;.  An Post should continue to occupy the privileged position with which the Minister seems to have a problem.  I await her response, but I assume, on foot of her interjections, that she is not of a mind to accept the amendments.  I would have inferred this from her reply to the debate on Second Stage.  She may have a job to do, but so do we.  The nature of that job is to hold her and her Department to account.  That is what we will seek to do in dealing with this issue.  We will also seek to stand up for those who work in post offices throughout the State.</p></speech>

I am sure he is aware from reading the Grant Thornton report that a grand total of four post offices have closed.  Most often, such closures are due to the death of the proprietor or postmaster.</p><p>We are all - particularly those of us on the Government side - concerned and anxious that post offices and sub-post offices have a viable and successful economic future.  We want to ensure they will continue to provide services and employment in the areas in which they are located.</p> <p>Sometimes during the debate, one would think post offices and sub-post offices were mainly in rural areas, including very remote rural areas, but the fact is that there are a significant number of sub-post offices in urban areas.  The latter are just as important as the sub-post offices in rural areas.</p><p>The measure is designed to have a number of objectives, one of which is to protect the State and the contract with An Post from challenge by third parties.  A legal issue arose some years ago in which the post office contract or relationship with the Department of Social Protection was challenged.  Under European law and the various rules of the European Union, it is possible for other providers or potential providers, whether one likes it or not, to challenge existing providers if they feel there is a flaw in how the business and contract-awarding has been conducted.  Such cases are taken and such a case was taken.  The latter found its way to the European Court of Justice.  Very serious legal advice was given to the effect that the contract ultimately had to go out to tender.</p><p>Senator Cullinane did not say that An Post bid for and won the contract but I am delighted to do so.  Given the Senator's wish to be positive about post offices, I am a little surprised he did not congratulate An Post on winning a contract which represents enormously valuable business.  The contract is for an initial period of two years and this is renewable for a further period of four years.  This amendment deals with the legal advice as to how to represent properly the payment service provider in law so the basis of the contract would not be open to a further legal challenge, as happened during the period of the last Government.  One must remember, however, that unless Sinn F&eacute;in wants to say there will be no right for people to use commercial law to seek to exercise what they believe to be their rights under EU and Irish legislation, its position is questionable.</p><p>Some Sinn F&eacute;in Members suggested in the D&aacute;il that people should not be allowed to have their pensions or child benefit sent to them via their bank account.  I would love to know how many Members of the Seanad in receipt of a payment such as child benefit have it paid into their bank account or whether they queue up at their local post office.  I would like to be enlightened on that.  The move nowadays is towards electronic funds transfers, particularly in the case of people who already have bank accounts.  In Ireland, however, very significant numbers of people do not have bank accounts and, therefore, if they are receiving an income from the Department of Social Protection, having access to the post office is vital.</p><p>As Minister, I require that all jobseeker payments, particularly to new jobseekers and those under 62, be made via the post office system in order to ensure that people present at the post office to collect their payment in person.  That is an extremely valuable piece of work that the post office does in connection with social welfare payments.  It is one of the services that we specified in the contract.  With a view to deterring fraud, including identity fraud, it is important that people show up in person.  As the Seanad may be aware, we are rolling out a new personal services card that allows for a much higher level of scrutiny of identification details, through the photograph of the person presenting to collect money.  Owing to this, we needed in this legislation to provide An Post, as the Department's contracted payment service provider, with the necessary authority to assist the Department with its anti-fraud and control measures.  Therefore, the measure supports the contract, which I signed before Christmas.  I am a little amazed the Senator did not congratulate An Post; perhaps he did not know it won the contract.  I am surprised he did not congratulate the staff in An Post on their successful bid for the contract.  The contract is currently in place and it will maintain continuity of cash payment services throughout towns and villages.</p><p>Concern was expressed by the Senator's colleague last week that this matter could have a devastating effect.  Winning a contract, according to the Senator's colleague in Sinn F&eacute;in, is devastating for An Post.  I do not know whether the party would like to rethink that.  I believe An Post should be congratulated on winning the contract.  So many people on a social welfare payment collect their money in cash or do not have a bank account.  Without a bank account, they are not in a position to avail themselves of any other service.</p><p>The concerns that have been raised are baseless.  It may be good politics to scaremonger.  Many people are delighted with scaremongering as a political objective, and some parties specialise in it.  Whether it is better in the long-run in terms of the confidence people in various locations have in their services is for the Senator to decide.</p><p>The measure provides a solid legislative basis for the arrangement under which payment services will be delivered by An Post as a payment service provider.  It will also enable An Post to carry out the activities that will contribute to the prevention of welfare fraud and, therefore, make sure the payments go to the right people.  That is important.  Last year we had recoveries in regard to overpayments, most of which arose from fraud and errors on the part of the customers.  They amounted to well over &euro;70 million, which is a very significant amount.  It is almost equal to what the Department spends on the travel arrangements and free travel, which I am delighted to say is not under threat..  However, I understand that some organisations consider it to be the case that there is a possible threat.  As Minister, I must state I value the free travel arrangements introduced by a previous Government, just as I value the post offices.  The arrangements have continued for 40 or 50 years, or more.</p><p>These amendments will actually consolidate and enhance the position of An Post as the service provider and make the contract less subject to legal attack from others, who have actually taken cases against An Post and who took several references to the court, which they are perfectly entitled to do, during the time of the previous Government.</p></speech>

I was not going to engage in debate on this.  It is inevitable that, because of the wording of the various amendments concerning section 3, the Minister and Senator Cullinane will engage on this at the heart of the debate.</p><p>I have just a couple of points.  Will the Minister outline the terms of the contract?  Of course I congratulate An Post.  This is not my first time.  The achievement of An Post was very laudable.  Perhaps the Minister might provide the context for this.  Did many tender for the contract?  What were its terms and was any indication given that the payment provider, as the provider will now be called, would have to provide a comprehensive service?  This leads me to the question of whether, in the future, some other entity could advocate that it could provide the service.  I refer to supermarkets, for example, which seem to be moving increasingly in this direction, aided and abetted by An Post.  It is cutting its own throat in this regard, and I just do not know why it is doing so.</p> <p>Perhaps, the Minister could outline that.</p><p>We have had an exchange of views already on the legal challenges.  However, the Minister has not answered a question I put on Second Stage and which Deputy O'Dea put in the D&aacute;il.  I would be grateful if she would address it for me for the record.  In 2007, there was a High Court judgment which came to a particular conclusion in a case taken in the context of the 2005 legislation, which already included reference to An Post.  What has changed since?  If it was thrown out in 2007, why has it been reinstated?  The Minister made the point that a Fianna F&aacute;il Government introduced this, but both this Government and the last have just been trying to be good Europeans.  Perhaps, we should take a leaf out of the French book.  The French post office network has been completely protected and does not seem to be succumbing to legal challenges from Europe.  I often wonder if we in this country are perhaps bending over backwards to help the Brussels bureaucracy contrary to our own national interest.  Here is a situation where we should just put it up to Europe and say &quot;Challenge us&quot;.  The Minister should write into the legislation in relation to contracts a preference for an entity which can provide the type of service An Post can.  While I appreciate the Government would have to be careful with the wording, it should not be beyond the competence of the legal draftsmen and women to bring forward wording which would ensure the post office network was protected.  It can be done under social legislation yet there seems to be a marked reluctance among certain elements in Europe to engage in the debate.</p><p>I was a parliamentary representative on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which now seems to be long forgotten but was incorporated into the Treaty of Lisbon.  I remember the solid hostility to the introduction of proposals to protect social services, particularly in rural parts of Europe such as in Ireland where there was a need to ensure that all citizens were treated equally in terms of the provision of utilities and services.  This is part of the same thinking that is going on within Europe to the effect that big business should win out and the smaller and rural communities across Europe, particularly in western Europe, should just be forgotten about.  It should be incumbent on any Irish Government to protect its citizens and their rights to ensure they have the same service in the heart of Achill Island as in the heart of Dublin.  They should have the same services in Waterford and Leitrim as are available to people in Dublin.  It seems, however, that we are developing a two-tier society and the Bill is a reflection of that.</p><p>I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify those issues.  Why is it necessary?  Who put in the legal challenge?  Where did it come from?  In light of the success of the An Post contract, the Minister says it is for two years and can then be rolled over.  Does that automatically mean An Post will have it for a further six years?</p></speech>

How many companies were there and what were the terms of the contract?

Hopefully, post offices will benefit from it for a long number of years, not just the six.</p><p>My concerns and those of my party can be dismissed cheaply by the Minister if she so wishes.  That is fair enough.  I am not all that interested.  However, I am articulating concerns that have been raised with me by people who work in the post office sector, the trade union involved and service users.  It is their concerns I ask the Minister to address, not just those of Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in.  I agree that there are certain parties who are very good at scaremongering.  In her response to my contribution, the Minister misrepresented the Sinn F&eacute;in position absolutely, which is what she tends to do.  She waffled on about things neither my party nor I ever said.</p><p>She referred to a concern Senator Kathryn Reilly raised on Second Stage, however, and said it would be a disaster.  I agree.  It could be a disaster if, at a future date, An Post did not get the contract but some other provider did.  Senator Mooney hit the nail on the head when he talked about Europe.  If we cut right to the chase, we have had for a long number of years a threat to public services and a liberalisation of the market coming from Europe.  That has been happening consistently in a whole range of areas.  I see this as part of the same drift.  The Minister and the Government are in essence hiding behind the threat of court action to implement European policy.  That is what is happening here.  Competition is good and it can be healthy but what we are seeing from Europe across a range of areas is the distortion of the competition argument to the advantage of larger business, including multi-nationals.  Smaller networks such as post offices and credit unions can be the losers in that.</p><p>Our concerns are not baseless.  When I say &quot;our&quot;, I include the Irish Postmasters Union, postmasters themselves and others who work in the post office sector.  While I am sure they are very happy they got the contract this time around, there is a concern that they will not always have it.  It is open to this Government or any future Administration to award the contract to somebody else.  That would spell disaster for post offices.  Our concerns are well founded.  There is no difficulty in giving a preference to post offices.  If we do not, it goes right to the heart of what Senator Mooney spoke about, namely, the drift in European policy in recent times to promote competition above the provision of core public services.  It is something I certainly do not believe in and I did not think the Labour Party did either.  Of course, we have been proven wrong about that over the last number of years.  The electorate have certainly seen that and will see it again for some time to come.</p></speech>

They were on the nature of state aid, social services and economic contracts.  The Commission does not specifically define what is meant by the term "social services of general interest".  However, it has described such services as economic activities which deliver outcomes in the overall public good which would not be supplied by the market without public intervention or would be supplied under different conditions such as quality or affordability.  One can look at this either way from the point of view of a public or private service with which to compete.</p></speech>

They can launch legal action, as they did during the time of the previous Government in 1999.  This goes back to then.  The payment services provided by An Post to social welfare clients are similar to the payments services delivered by banks and, nowadays, other operators using mobile phones and the Internet.  In relation to social welfare clients, the services are being delivered to the Department.  Many other customers of the Department who have bank accounts choose to have their payments from the Department, including child benefit and retirement pensions, paid into those accounts directly.</p> <p>That is something that has been ongoing in Ireland not just in respect of social welfare services but also financial transactions in general.  The services provided by An Post are delivered as part of a commercial arrangement, with a market price being paid.  Therefore, any activity that consists of the offering of goods or services in a given market is deemed to be economic within the meaning of EU competition rules.  The Senator has, understandably, concentrated on the social impact and significance of sub-post offices.  I accept this and I am a very strong supporter of them, but it is also an economic activity; therefore, under EU competition rules, it is open to somebody else to compete.  </p><p>The Senator asked what were the conditions of the contract.  I will read some of the conditions.  The contract was awarded on 2 January 2014.  An Post is required to provide and maintain a network for the term of the agreement ensuring at a minimum outlets are available within 3 km of 95% of clients in an urban area and 15 km in a rural area.  This means that it must have a very wide network of branches available to service clients.  It has been required to consult the Minister in advance of introducing any significant change in the number, nature and distribution of offices.  Therefore, it could not arbitrarily decide that it was going to go out of business in some region or a significant section of the country.  It is required to ensure services are designed such that they can be accessed by all clients, including those with particular language, sight, hearing, access or literacy requirements; those who require a nominated person to collect a payment on his or her behalf; other vulnerable clients; and those with an atypical lifestyle.  As the Senator is aware, the post office service provides services for all comers and all types of people.  An Post must ensure payments will be disbursed in accessible, safe and secure environments.  Outlets must be clean and accessible, meet health and safety standards and facilitate access for people with disabilities.  The payment services shall be provided by An Post for a minimum of five and a half days each week during normal business hours.  Welfare payments shall be issued in cash in full to the authorised client or his or her approved nominee as provided for under the contract.  No deductions can be made from cash payments other than those provided for under statute or in accordance with the provisions of the contract.  As the Senator is aware from previous legislation, I have enhanced the legislation dealing with household benefit payments via An Post.  They have become a significant additional stream of income for it and sub-post offices from the Department of Social Protection as a result of the legislation passed.  An Post must confirm the identity of clients or their authorised agents before cash payments are made.  One of the things I have done is insist on all new jobseekers under 62 years collecting their cash in person from the post office.  As we roll out the identity card - presumably, post offices will also invest in the technology - they can verify their identity to the standard of a biometric photograph in the same way as such a photograph is used when people are travelling through airports.  It was because An Post could provide these services at an agreed contract price that it won the award.  It is a very valuable contract for it.  </p><p>The essential feature in respect of wider EU legal issues is that it is possible for other potential providers to contest for the contract, as they did in 1999 and 2005.  I would like to see An Post develop to the point where it would be in a position to provide basic bank account services.  As I said on the last occasion, it provides savings services, but it does not provide bank current account services.  It would certainly be welcome if it teamed up with another agency such as a bank to provide such services for clients.  Given the trend towards automatic electronic banking, it would certainly assist it significantly in securing its future if it were able to provide the kinds of banking service provided by other outlets.  The same is probably true of credit unions throughout the country which also provide an important localised service on a local basis.</p></speech>

Giving the Department of Social Protection more powers to recover overpayments is a good idea, but I have seen situations during the years where the overpayment has not been the person's fault.  I know of a case involving a couple who came home from Cyprus to look after a elderly person.  They have declared all of their assets, income and savings.</p></speech>

If the Department had taken on board what the couple had declared, they would not have received a payment.  I do not think we should give the Department too much power to take money from people where it is its mistake in the first place.</p></speech>

We tabled an amendments to section 8 which states, &ldquo;(3) Where a qualified adult as defined under this section is temporarily resident outside the state in order to provide care for an ill relative, the provisions as outlined under this section shall not apply.&rdquo;.</p><p>Section 8 sets out the rules for those who are absent from the State.  Under section 8(2)(b) a new subsection (6A) provides that State benefits &quot;shall not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is &mdash; (a) resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State, or (b) undergoing imprisonment or detention in legal custody.&rdquo;</p><p>There is a need for some flexibility because a situation could arise where a person is temporarily resident outside the State, providing care for an ill relative or other legitimate reason that removes him or her from the State for a short period.  What are the Minister's views in that regard? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200015#O00600"><p>I understand the amendments have been ruled out of order.  The social assistance payments are means tested and are payable on the basis of income need.  The situation between somebody who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in the State is slightly different from the person who may be in the State for a period of time - I think it is important to keep that distinction - but who may qualify for social welfare payments under the HRC and his or her spouse qualifies for a qualified adult payment.</p><p>In general a person who is getting the principal payment but who is detained in prison or legal custody is disqualified from payment throughout the period of detention.  This disqualification applies to claimants and recipients as well as to qualified adults of the claimant or the recipient because the State is paying to maintain the person while he or she is in prison.</p><p>Since I became Minister we get the PPS number of anyone who is detained lawfully in custody and we would not continue to pay him or her a social welfare payment because the State is covering his or her maintenance while he or she is in prison.  The disqualification is informed by the principle that where a person is in prison or otherwise being detained, his or her needs are being met by the agency of the State responsible for his or her imprisonment or detention.  Deciding officers have the scope to adjudicate on claims for social assistance payments, having due regard to the need for adequate scheme controls while at the same time recognising the reality of people's lives.</p><p>There is a general disqualification for receipt of social assistance payments.  We are referring to social assistance payments to a person who is going out of the State in the long term and not just for a week or two.  Where the claimant or recipient is resident outside the State, the payment is allowed for short periods to facilitate the person to visit a sick relative, for family emergencies including attending a funeral, attending to a relative who has fallen ill or accompanying a family member who requires treatment abroad.  Social welfare offices are well used to dealing with those typical examples.  There is no change in any of the arrangements.</p><p>These arrangements will also apply following the extension of this disqualification to the qualified adult of a claimant or recipient, where the qualified adult is resident outside the State for similar reasons.  The current practice extends to the qualified adult.</p> <p>If, however, a person is abroad for any extended period of time in order to care for a sick or disabled relative, that person may qualify for income support from that other state and it would not be appropriate in these circumstances to continue income support under the Irish social welfare system.</p><p>Let us suppose somebody immigrated into Ireland and the person's spouse or partner has been working here and is a qualified adult.  They then return home to their country of origin, perhaps to care for somebody, and stay there for an extended period, not the short period we have described.  It is hard to justify that we would continue to pay that person when the person's home country, which would have been their original domicile and where perhaps they now intend to stay, should be paying the qualified adult increase to them, or, indeed, paying for the principal person.</p><p>The understanding on which social welfare assistance payments are made is that the person is resident in the State and stays in the State.  If they leave the State to pursue other things in other countries, save for the kind of family medical situations and brief visits I have described, they are then in another country and it is hard to understand why we should be paying them social welfare.  I do not know if that is a reasonable explanation.</p></speech>

The Minister might indicate what is the timescale involved in the word "temporarily".  In one case I know of, a family had to take their child abroad for four or five months to have treatment.  In another case, which involved a primary payment and not a dependent adult, a carer went to Australia for four weeks to visit their children.  The person took the caree with them and was still caring for the caree in Australia, but their carer's allowance was stopped while they were abroad.  People get the payment for three weeks and it stops after that, no matter how long a person stays.</p><p>I would like the Minister to give us some indication on this.  There are occasions when people really and truly have to go, and they cannot determine how long they will be gone for.  If a person is going to care for somebody who is terminally ill with cancer, it cannot be determined whether the person will die after three weeks, four weeks or five weeks, and they cannot tell the social welfare officers exactly how long it will be.  Can we have some indication of what time period &quot;temporarily&quot; involves?</p></speech>

The problem with this new subsection, as I see it, is that it could end up being a very blunt and crude instrument because, unfortunately, there are and will be situations where some level of discretion would need to be applied.  That is what is being contested here, not primarily what the Minister is trying to do.</p><p>The section provides that qualified adult increases will not be paid for any period that the qualified adult is not resident in the State or is in custody.  Essentially, by amending the definition of a qualified adult in the principal Act, section 7 subjects the qualified adult to the residency requirement.  A number of questions then arise.  Senator Mooney gave the example of a person who has returned home to their own country temporarily rather than for the long term, and asked why that person should not receive the payment.  While our amendment was ruled out of order, some of the issues we raised are relevant, including situations where a person is held in custody on remand and is subsequently found not guilty.  Is it fair in that case to disqualify the person?  What if a person is legally detained for a mental assessment?</p><p>I assume the Minister is not going to accept the amendments and will, of course, not accept those that were ruled out of order.  However, will she explain to us whether social welfare officers have some level of discretion if such situations arise?  I would hope common sense would prevail and that the subsection would not end up being what I described it as potentially being, namely, a crude or blunt instrument which would not allow for common sense to prevail.</p></speech>

If somebody has become resident in Ireland and they then leave the country for extended periods of time, it is hard to justify why we should continue to pay qualified adult social welfare payments.  However, if somebody is going for some kind of family issue or family emergency, such as a funeral or illness in the family, that is an entirely different issue.  The deciding officers have the power to exercise discretion.  Very often, in such cases of hardship, as I am sure Members know, the community welfare officer assists people and the actual practice in social welfare offices is to be extremely understanding.</p><p>With regard to somebody who is lawfully in custody, again, it is very difficult to justify double payments because the State is at a considerably higher expense than a weekly social welfare payment in looking after the needs of that person and, of course-----</p></speech>

Very often, the only recourse people have when they come out of prison is the local community welfare service, and the social welfare services also provide significant support to the families of people in prison.  Social welfare staff throughout the country have always been very responsive and approachable in regard to families and dependants of people in prison.  I know some of the Senators here would have personal knowledge of this but I want to reiterate that this has been the practice for a very long period and continues to be the practice.</p><p>Nowadays we exchange data from the Irish Prison Service in regard to the PPS numbers of everybody who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Before I became Minister, there was a concern about the fact that, in some cases, people were having others collect their social welfare payments while they were in prison, which they were not entitled to do.  We have pretty much closed that down.</p></speech>

Family income supplement, FIS, is a weekly tax-free support targeted at low-income workers who have children.  FIS provides a crucial support for over 44,000 working families and almost 100,000 children.  We are spending some &euro;280 million this year, which is a very significant increase in this payment.</p><p>The purpose of the support is to provide an incentive to workers to take up or stay in employment rather than claiming a social welfare payment.  While weekly social welfare payments are increased according to the family size, weekly income from employment obviously does not take into account the worker's family size.  Therefore, FIS is a very important supplement to the worker's weekly earnings where they have children.  It is a very strong incentive to stay in employment when compared with the social welfare payments that might be available for somebody who decided to stay on social welfare.</p><p>Section 9 redefines what constitutes a family for FIS purposes and affirms that FIS cannot be paid to a claimant who is maintaining a child where that child does not reside with the claimant, unless the claimant is also maintaining his or her separated spouse or civil partner with whom the child is residing.  It further clarifies that, in such cases, FIS cannot be paid if the spouse or civil partner with whom the child is residing is in receipt of a weekly social welfare payment in his or her own right.</p> <p>Under the provisions in section 9 of the Bill, the circumstances in which a child is to be regarded as normally being a member of a household for FIS entitlement purposes will be specified in regulations which will be made in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  This is not an issue where the parents or guardians and children live together, which is straightforward.  However, where the parents or guardians live apart, regulations are required in order to set out the rules to be used to determine which parent or guardian the children will be regarded as normally residing with for FIS purposes.</p></speech>

The proposal is that 20 serving garda&iacute; would be recruited into the Department of Social Protection to assist with a better emphasis on fraud detection and, where the fraud is significant, prosecution.  That is a very important element of saving money for the Department.  I mentioned earlier that last year the Department recovered over &euro;70 million in overpayments, the vast bulk of which arose from fraud.  I would like that to continue.  The seconded garda&iacute; will be issued with a certificate of secondment, which will clearly identify that they are appointed to work with the Department.  The certificate will include a photograph of the person concerned.  As a matter of practice, departmental investigators from the Department of Social Protection identify themselves and produce their certificates of appointments to all the persons with whom they deal.<br />The change in the Bill to remove the phrase &quot;in uniform&quot; is being made first to achieve consistency in social welfare legislation between section 250(16) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which requires a social welfare inspector to be accompanied by a uniformed member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While section 250(16)(<i>b</i>) also requires a social welfare inspector to be accompanied by an member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it does not have an &quot;in uniform&quot; condition.  The change to the Bill would allow garda&iacute; seconded to the Department to accompany social welfare inspectors carrying out activities under section 250(16) without the requirement to wear a uniform.</p></speech>

This permits attachment of payments, including lump sums due under the redundancy payments Acts and the protection of employees (employers' insolvency) Acts apparently without the consent of the claimant.  The proposal must be seen in the context of the fact that redundancy payments are a resource to a household to compensate for a loss of employment and income and that it would allow recovery from a person at a time when a household is at its most vulnerable following a loss of a job.  The concern relates to the lack of an adequate, objective and fair system to ensure claimants and their families are not subjected to hardship in the calculation of what should be taken.<br />The concern is exacerbated by current practice in the recovery of overpayments under section 13 of the 2012 Act which permits the Department to recover historic overpayments from claimants up to 15% of their basic social welfare payment, and more than 15% if the claimant agrees.  I understand that until these changes are introduced, the maximum the Department can take is &euro;2.  If that is the case, I have a certain sympathy with the Department's wish to increase that and have no problem with it in principle.  According to FLAC, the Department always seeks to recover the full 15% without any evidence that the person's capacity to pay has adequately been taken into account.<br />There is also the question of the statutory right to a redundancy lump sum.  In practice, where an employer does not pay a lump sum, it could take up to two years to get a determination.  Once such a determination is issued, an application is made to the Minister for payment.  However, this could be wiped out by an alleged overpayment which the claimant has not had the opportunity to challenge.  Claimants' rights to fair procedures must be safeguarded and provided for in section 14.  I share the view that the section is essentially unfair and has the effect of defeating a statutory right to a redundancy payment.  The proposal is that section 14 should be amended to include detailed procedures to permit due process and fair procedures to a person who might be subject to these powers before any payment is recovered in this way.  If this is not possible immediately, the section should not be commenced until such processes, including right of appeal, are in place.  No sum should ever be recovered that risks a claimant's income falling below adequate levels.</p></speech>

There is a balance to be struck.  In genuine cases of fraud, nobody would have difficulty with the Department taking every opportunity available to recover money obtained illegally or through fraud.  The problem arises where people have been overpaid through no fault of their own, through a clerical error on the part of the Department, which often happens, and are asked to repay the money in an unsustainable manner.  That can be unfair.  A number of State grants, such as the sustainable energy home grants, could also come under this.  These grants are claimed by people after they have spent the money, and it could put families in unbearable hardship if that money is seized as repayment for an overpayment may not have been their fault.  I have a number of concerns about the section, not all of which the Minister has addressed.</p></speech>

While the Minister did not respond during the debate, in the interim she has given me written confirmation that these grants will be excluded from recovery of overpayment.</p></speech>

As well as having a responsibility to those who rely on a social welfare income, I have a responsibility to those who pay PRSI, income tax and other taxes to ensure payments go to the right people in the right amount.</p> <p>To give members an indication of the percentages involved, approximately 42% of overpayments arise as a result of fraud - in other words, people who claim something to which they are not entitled.  Third-party error accounts for 37% - people misstate their circumstances unintentionally or their circumstances change and they forget to advise the office.  The departmental error level is about 8%.</p><p>It sometimes arises that after a person has passed on they are found to have left a very significant estate behind while they were collecting a means-tested social welfare payment.  It has been the practice over a very long period to recover those funds from estates.  When I came into office as Minister, &euro;2 a week could be recovered.  It was offensive to people living in an estate where one person was known to have significantly defrauded the Department.  If a person wished to co-operate, as has always been the practice, he or she could pay significantly more.  When mistakes have been brought to people's attention, most have volunteered to pay significant sums back as soon as they could, commensurate with their means, and that is quite carefully done, but some people have given the two fingers to the Department, paid back &euro;2 a week and left the Department waiting 20 years for the money.  The people living beside them in the same estate are working and paying tax and PRSI while those people are giving two fingers to the Department.  We should bear in mind that last year the recoveries involved amounted to more than &euro;70 million.  About half of that is recovered by direct deduction.  We have made changes in the law to provide that if a person has moved on and gone to work, we can still recover moneys from him or her.</p><p>In an examination that was carried out in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and that was reported in the public media sometime ago, it emerged that some people who owed the Department money had very significant amounts of money in their bank accounts.  I recall one case in which a person had approximately &euro;400,000 in a bank account.  It is very difficult to say to people who rely on a retirement pension, as many people do, that a person who has very large bank deposits should not repay a sum of money that he or she owes.  The officials in the Department are extremely careful to take account of personal circumstances.  The 15% can be recovered only from the personal payment; it does not relate to any other payments made to individuals or in respect of children in the person's household.  It is all done very carefully and effectively, but the end result is that the recovery of moneys has been significantly enhanced.  It also happens in a more timely way, and the beneficiaries of this are people who rely on a social welfare income but also general taxpayers who have to pay taxes and PRSI to fund what is a very important social welfare system in this country.  I suggest that Members would not want to see the social contract undermined by a belief that moneys cannot be recovered from a tiny number of people who have abused the system, to the detriment of the people who support the system and who pay taxes.</p></speech>

Obviously, for child benefit purposes and in many educational situations, PPS numbers are used, and this provides confirmation of where the child is residing.  It is anticipated that Irish Water may use that data because there is a proposal, as I am sure the Senator is aware, to give a water allowance in respect of children.  I anticipate that this will be the major significant use of this data - to identify the number of children in a household under 18 who would qualify and, obviously, their location.</p></speech>

I understand this issue has been raised by some of my colleagues at briefing sessions.  I want the Minister to put on the record that the use for which the data are provided to Irish Water, which she has outlined, will be the exclusive use to which it will be put.  There cannot be any scenario in which Irish Water can provide that information to a third party for commercial purposes, as happens with a variety of personal information that is provided.  All of us will be familiar with what happens when shopping online, whereby if one does not tick a box one's information is provided to third parties for commercial purposes.  By default, many people find their information has been provided to parties beyond what they had originally intended.  I need the Minister's reassurance that the use to which the data will be put is exclusively that outlined and no other, and that Irish Water cannot use it for any other purpose.  Can the Minister assure me that this is written into the legislation?</p></speech>

The ability of Irish Water to use PPS numbers and access relevant information is compatible with the State's data protection obligation, as provided for under the Data Protection Acts of 1988.  The use of PPS numbers by Irish Water will have a legislative base and it will serve a public purpose, but the Social Welfare Consolidation Act provides that it is an offence to use PPS numbers in a manner not provided for under the Act, and a fine and other penalties are provided for in the case of a person who is convicted of such an offence.  It will be a source of valuable information, but that information will be covered by general protection and we are satisfied that it will not be used for any other purpose by Irish Water.</p></speech>

On the thrust of the amendment, we believe there is a gap in the legislation in that it provides for certain obligations for the trustees.  The Bill, in providing for the amendment of section 50 of the 1990 Act, states that the trustees of the scheme shall &quot;within one month of the date of the notice, notify in writing such persons as may be prescribed of the following&quot;. </p> <p>It goes into some detail.  Subsection (5) states: <blockquote><br />it substitutes the following paragraph for paragraph (b):&quot;(b) the trustees of the scheme and the employer to whom the scheme relates shall make such notifications and provide such information to such persons as may be prescribed, when and in such manner as the Pensions Authority may specify,&quot; and<br />(ii) in paragraph (c), by inserting &quot;within such period as may be prescribed,&quot; after &quot;direction,&quot;,</blockquote>It goes into some considerable detail as to the obligations of the trustees in respect of providing this information.  However, we believe that failure to provide this information and failure to subscribe to the section as proposed should carry a sanction.  There is no sanction whatsoever.  The trustees can blindly ignore this provision and there is no sanction.  They can be incompetent or inactive.  That is the reason we have proposed that failure of the trustees to notify members of changes as outlined under this section shall be an offence as prescribed under section 3 of the Pensions Act 1990.<br />The Minister will be aware of growing concern about the power of trustees in companies where they can make changes to pensions without any notification whatsoever to the members.  The members find out afterwards or, alternatively, as is happening in the case of Aer Lingus, in a situation where they believe their defined benefits can be changed without any recourse by them to the trustees.  They can do it unilaterally.<br />In the context of this legislation there is, in our opinion, a need for some type of sanction because this area is becoming increasingly fraught with controversy, primarily because there is a shortfall in a whole variety of defined pensions and companies are constantly changing their pension rights and obligations to employees.  There was a time when all of this was straightforward.  As we look back on that time it seems that was a utopia when there was no controversy about pensions.  One paid one's contribution into a pension scheme in a company, the employers paid the pension and one was given it at the end.  As I am afraid that scenario no longer applies, there is a real need for some form of sanction.  We want to ensure the trustees live up to their obligations and that we do not have the scenario where members are having rows and arguments with the trustees who can then hide behind legislation such as this and, as the Minister said in another context, give them the two fingers. </p></speech>

The training and selection of trustees in obviously critical in pension funds.  I do not propose to accept the amendment, the reasons for which I will clarify.</p><p>Section 3 of the Pensions Act already makes it an offence for a trustee to fail to notify members where the pension authority makes a direction for a scheme to restructure scheme benefits.  Section 3 of the Act provides for a range of sanctions for those guilty of an offence, under the Act, including fines and or a custodial sentence.  I put it to the Senator, with respect, that there is no requirement for this amendment as it is already covered in the Act.  </p></speech>

There is already a provision whereby trustees have to notify members.  The issue the Senator raised is slightly different in the sense that members may feel very aggrieved by the actions or the proposals of trustees but there is a requirement to notify them.

Consistent with the objective of focusing the use of the identifier and its data set, the intention had been that the provision would cover health research that had been the subject of research ethics approval under national or EU law, for example, clinical trials of medicinal products for human use.  In addition, paragraph (d) was also intended to encompass other health research that would come through the voluntary but governed research ethics approval arrangements to be provided for in the forthcoming health information Bill.  However, the legal view was that the wording was too broad to achieve the intended objective.  Hence, amendment No. 3 provides an explicit reference to the carrying out of health research that is the subject of a research ethics approval, or any cognate expression, under an enactment or European Act where the Minister has prescribed that enactment or European Act for the purposes of paragraph (d).</p><p>This issue was the subject of some discussion in the D&aacute;il, where concerns were raised that the inclusion of the reference to research in the definition of secondary purposes might somehow suggest that private bodies that carried out research, such as research institutes and pharmaceutical companies, would have access to a person's personal health data that they did not have previously.  I want to make it clear that the Bill does not change the current law on the collection, use and disclosure of personal data for any purpose including health research.  If, for example, a person wants to participate in an ethically approved clinical trial, it will still be for him or her to allow the researcher access to his or her medical records.  In that situation, a researcher might wish to associate the person's individual health identifier with such a record to ensure that each person voluntarily participating in the trial is uniquely identified.  Accordingly, it is most important to note that allowing the use of the identifier for research purposes is tightly controlled in the Bill.  Even in the limited circumstances where it is allowed, the Bill in and of itself does not confer a right of access to anyone's medical records.  Any disclosure of personal health data, those being, patient identifiable information, by a health care provider, for example, the HSE, a hospital or a general practitioner, GP, to a third party for any purpose not connected with patient care is governed by data protection legislation, the common law duty of confidentiality that a health care provider owes to a patient and professional ethical rules.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 relates to paragraph (g) of the definition of secondary purposes, which initially referred to &quot;any processing of personal data that is in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.&quot;  Paragraph (g) was potentially broad and could have allowed the use of the identifier and the disclosure of identifying particulars beyond what was intended.  Consistent with our desire to control and limit the use of the identifier and its data set, the original paragraph (g) was replaced with a more specific provision allowing the processing of the identifier and its data set under the Bill where required to protect or prevent injury or other damage to the health or safety of an individual, where required under the law or by order of a court or where the processing was in accordance with the Data Protection Acts and necessary for obtaining legal advice or for the purposes of legal proceedings or alternative dispute resolution procedures.  As some flexibility may be desirable, the Minister will be able to prescribe other health-related processing of the identifier and its identifying particulars not already covered under secondary purposes, should it be necessary.  This will only be done where the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so and he or she has also consulted the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>For completeness, I should add that amendments Nos. 3 and 4 have been positively discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  In fact, this is an appropriate point to acknowledge the constructive engagement with the commissioner and his officials on this Bill generally.  That engagement has ensured that the commissioner plays an important role under the Bill, as is expressly evident in numerous provisions.   It also reflects my desire that privacy protection considerations should underpin the Bill.</p></speech>

Section 10 provides for access to the national individual health identifier register by the Minister and specified persons, including health professionals, their employees and agents, health organisations, their employees and agents, and other bodies.  The potential number of specified persons is, therefore, large.  As the section stood after the Bill was passed by the Seanad, access was to all of the information on the register, that is, the identifier and identifying particulars, with no provision to allow the Minister to control or restrict access by specified persons to a lesser amount of information.  It was appropriate to include such a provision, as not every specified person would need access to all of an individual's information on the register.  While the PPS number, for example, should be a searchable element in establishing an individual's identifier, it should not be something that is universally available to any specified person accessing the register.  Accordingly, the purpose of amendment No. 8 was to allow for the making of regulations to limit access to the information on the register.  Such regulations will require consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and a public interest dimension.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 to section 11 is similar in principle to the amendment to section 10.  Among other matters, section 11 deals with the processing by the Minister and specified persons of the identifier and the related identifying particulars in the register and the disclosure by them of such information to another specified person for relevant purposes or to an authorised disclosee for secondary purposes.  Amendment No. 9 has allowed for the possibility, through regulations, of restricting the processing or further processing by specified persons of certain information on the register and the disclosure by them of such information to other specified persons for a relevant purpose.  The notion of restricted disclosure is additionally strengthened by amendment No. 9 as regards disclosure by specified persons to authorised disclosees by providing for the possibility that it may also extend to restricting the use of such information in terms of certain secondary purposes.  Regulations made pursuant to amendment No. 9 will involve consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and have regard to the public interest.</p></speech>

I am also glad that we have accepted these amendments from the Lower House.  The Minister might recall that, following our debate on the Bill, I spoke to him about the question of specified persons under the Data Protection Act.  That matter is now covered under section 4 where it relates to paragraph (g) in section 2.  I am glad that the Minister accepted my suggestion, as it adds clarity in terms of the Data Protection Act where the provision was previously a little loose.</p> <p> The Bill is highly technical and we have given it a good bit of consideration here and in the other House.  It is long overdue and I am very glad that we have passed it today in this House.  I congratulate the Minister.  </p></speech>

I also thank all of the people who were involved in his Department and the people on the legal side.  This is a very technical Bill.  It is important that it is brought through but it must also provide the necessary protections and the Bill covers all of them.</p><p>Once the Bill is fully operational, perhaps in three or four years' time, and I know none of us may be around in that capacity, the Department could check to see if it needs to be reviewed in any way.  In other words, the Department must ensure that all of the adequate protections exist but at the same time ensure that the Bill is doing what it set out to do.  The legislation is very technical in nature but down the line someone may decide that it goes too far or not far enough.  I would be inclined to have the legislation reviewed in four or five years' time and I do not want it left unsupervised or unchecked in the future.  This is important legislation and I agree with my colleague that it is long overdue.  I thank the Minister for the work done on this matter.</p></speech>

I also thank the Department and all of those who worked on the Bill.<br />An issue relating to the Bill was reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>which indicated that patients' records were somehow made available to pharmaceutical companies and insurers.  I want to put on the record of the House the fact that the HSE has confirmed that the healthcare pricing office does not - and I repeat does not -  make hospital patients' personal records available to pharmaceutical companies, insurers or any other companies or entities.  However, it does provide statistics on hospital activity.  All data made available by the HPO is aggregate in nature which means patients cannot be identified.  The type of data requested by agencies, external to the HSE, typically relates to aggregated statistical data at a national level, not at patient or hospital level.  For instance, a query could relate to the number of hip replacements carried out in a given year.  The release of this type of statistical data does not represent a breach of confidentiality.  There is a lot more to be said.  The Bill, in no way, will enable a further disclosure of people's information and in fact it protects further against same.  </p></speech>

The key features of the Bill are as follows: it provides an entitlement for all children aged five years and younger to a GP service without fees; it removes the need for children aged five years and younger to have a medical card or a GP visit card under the general medical services, GMS, in order to qualify for a GP service; it will remove the need for many families with children aged five years and younger to be forced into a situation where they need to consider whether the child is sick enough to justify paying for a visit to the GP; it provides that the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of this GP service to children; and it provides that the Minister may set the rates of fees payable to GPs for this service.</p><p>The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees for the entire population.  At present, just over 40% of the population can access a publicly-funded GP service.  The balance of the population, almost 2.5 million people, must pay the market rate for a GP consultation, which is currently in the region of &euro;55 per visit.</p><p>A number of consequences arise from this.  It deters some necessary medical care because it is generally recognised as unreasonable to expect an individual to make a good decision on what is necessary and unnecessary care.  Given the complexity of health issues and modern health treatments, an individual does not have the expertise to make a fully informed decision.  That is why the ability to attend a GP is so important as a gateway to accessing care in the health system.  The current situation also works against the objective of increasing and enhancing the role of primary care and preventive care.  It is difficult for a person to justify spending money today on a GP visit for an issue that may or may not become serious at some point in the future.  Finally, the current situation impedes the reorientation of our health system from a hospital focus to a primary and community care focus, which is an objective we all share.  When this first phase is in place, approximately one half of the population will be covered by a GP service without fees at the point of use.</p><p>As announced in the budget, the Government has decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by providing all children under the age of six years with access to a GP service.  It is important to be clear that nothing will change for families who currently have, or are eligible for, medical cards, including those with children under the age of six.  They will continue to receive all of their medical card entitlements as normal.  There will be no change for them.  They will not be affected in any way.</p><p>The 2013 report of the expert advisory group on the early years strategy recommended providing access to GP care without fees to all children in this age group.  There are good reasons to provide universal access to GP care in view of the health needs of the cohort aged under six years.  The identification of health issues at an earlier age can mitigate or reduce the impact of ill-health later in life.  For example, the Growing Up in Ireland survey reported that almost one in four children in Ireland are either overweight or obese, which is likely to lead to significant health issues later in life. </p><p>We must move towards a health system based on universality of access, which must be sustainably funded to enable the provision of services to meet health needs.</p> <p>It is important that we view this Bill as a stepping stone to universal GP service.  I wish to see the rapid roll-out in successive phases of more GP coverage, and I would not be as supportive of this legislation if the under-sixes scheme were an end in itself.  This Bill is a stepping stone.  It is the first phase, not an end in itself.  If we believe, as I do, that our society should progress to a universal GP service, I ask Senators to support this Bill as the first step towards achieving a universal service.</p><p>The policy objective is to have the entire population covered by a State-funded GP service.  A universal GP service is a vital building block of universal health insurance and the reform and restructuring of our health service.  A universal GP service will also complement the existing universal hospital system.  The Government's clear aim is to achieve this objective by 2016.</p><p>I now turn to the substantive provisions of the Bill.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for a general practitioner service to be made available without fees to all children aged five years and younger.  The Bill provides that the HSE shall make available a general practitioner service without fees to all such children.  It also provides that the HSE will be entitled to enter into a contract with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained general practitioner for the provision of GP services to all children aged five years and younger, and the contract will specify the services to be provided by the GP.  The Minister for Health may, by regulations and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, fix the rates of fees and allowances to be paid to GPs for services provided under these contracts.</p><p>Section 2 amends the existing legislation relating to appeals under the Health Act 1970.  It provides for the extension of the current HSE appeals process to decisions on the operation of the new GP service for all children aged five years and younger and also for the director general of the HSE to appoint persons to carry out appeals.  It clarifies that where the person carrying out an appeal is an employee of the HSE, that person shall hold a grade senior to the original decision maker.  The existing provision in the Act that the Minister may make regulations in respect of the appeals process is restated without change.</p><p>Section 3 amends the existing &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; framework in the Health Act 1970 to reflect changes made in section 2.  It also extends the &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; framework to include the new GP service for all children aged five years and under.</p><p>Section 4 removes children who have not yet attained the age of six years from the existing GP service under the medical card scheme as provided for in section 58 of the Health Act 1970.  They will be covered by the new service under section 58B.  As I mentioned earlier, it is important to be clear that nothing will change for families who currently have, or are eligible for, medical cards, including those with children under the age of six.  They will continue to receive all of their medical card entitlements as normal.</p><p>Section 5 is the heart of the Bill.  It provides for the insertion of sections 58B and 58C into the Health Act 1970.  Section 58B provides that the HSE shall make available a general practitioner service without fees to all children aged five years and younger.  It provides that a parent or guardian of a child seeking access to this service should provide to the HSE such evidence as it considers necessary to demonstrate entitlement to the service and where such evidence is not provided the HSE may treat the child as if he or she is not entitled to the service.  Where possible, the HSE will offer a choice of GP to those accessing this service.</p><p>Section 58C provides that the HSE will be entitled to enter into a contract with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained general practitioner for the provision of GP services to all children aged five years and younger.  However, the HSE may enter into a contract for relevant services with any registered medical practitioner who already holds a GMS contract for the six month period following commencement of the section.  The contract shall specify the services to be provided by the GP.</p><p>In addition, the Minister for Health may by regulation, and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, fix the rates of fees and allowances to be paid to GPs for services provided under these contracts.  The section requires that the Minister, in making a regulation for this purpose, shall engage in consultation.  Further, it prescribes the role of the Minister and the HSE, the nature and manner of the consultations and the considerations to which the Minister must have regard in making regulations, including having regard to agreements entered into with the representatives of GPs relating to the conduct of such consultations.</p><p>Senators may be aware of the framework agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, which I signed on 4 June.  This agreement sets out a process of engagement on all aspects of the GMS contract with GPs, with due regard to the IMO's representative role and within the context of legislation underpinning the introduction of GP care free at the point of access.  That engagement with the IMO has begun with regard to the draft contract for the provision of services to all children aged five and younger.  Under the framework agreement, the IMO can fully represent its members in respect of discussions around all aspects of this draft contract, including fees, and in respect of the GMS contract.  Where the rates fixed by regulation under this section are varied under subsequent regulations, a GP who does not wish to continue providing services may terminate his or her contract by giving the HSE three months notice.</p><p>Section 6 is a technical amendment to the nursing homes support scheme to put beyond doubt that assets which are transferred after an application for the scheme is made also come within the definition of &quot;transferred assets&quot;.  The purpose of the amendment is to prevent a situation arising where an applicant could transfer assets immediately after an application for State support is made on the basis of an argument that such asset transfer is not definitively captured by the definition of transferred assets in Schedule 1 of the 2009 Act.  The nursing homes support scheme is predicated on the principle that applicants must contribute according to their means.  The existing Act provides that assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  The provision does not affect a person's right to sell assets for full market value.  Rather, it is intended to prevent people from depriving themselves of assets for the purposes of the financial assessment.  If a participant in the scheme were to transfer assets immediately after an application for State support is made, or at any point subsequent to that, the existing definition means that it may be possible that the asset could be excluded from a financial review.  Therefore, it is essential that there is no ambiguity in this regard, and this amendment seeks to address that.</p><p>Section 7 is a technical amendment that will change the election year for the Opticians Board from 2014 to 2015 and provide that the subsequent election years will be 2019 and each fifth successive year after 2019.  The purpose of this amendment is to have the practical effect of removing the requirement to hold elections to the Opticians Board this year, a matter of months before the board is due to be subsumed into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  This is in accordance with the Government's programme of rationalisation of State agencies.  The drafting of the Bill to rationalise the Opticians Board into the council is currently being finalised,.  It is intended that the regulation of the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician will be transferred to the amended Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 by the end of this year or early next year.</p><p>Section 8 is a necessary technical amendment to enable the seamless implementation of section 2.  It extends the existing eligibility appeals process to the new GP service for all children aged five years and younger.</p><p>Section 9 states the Short Title of the Act, provides for the collective citation of this and prior health Acts as the Health Acts 1947 to 2014 and includes a standard provision relating to commencement of the provisions of the Bill.</p><p>In conclusion, the main purpose of the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 is to amend the Health Act 1970 to provide for a general practitioner service to be made available without fees to all children aged five years and younger.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and I hope that they and people in general  will support this landmark first step to universal GP service for the entire population of the State.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I wish him luck later this week in terms of the personal political deliberations.</p><p>I welcome this Bill.  While there was much discourse over the last number of months about the Bill, I and my colleagues had a serious problem with it against the backdrop of the medical cards debacle.  It is a noble cause to try to engage in early intervention, which this Bill will achieve, in terms of creating the necessary engagement with the health service from the earliest stage, so we all have histories, and in terms of trying to help families who are to the pin of their collars.  Those aims are noble and we certainly support them.</p><p>The medical cards debacle was highly regrettable.  We had a taste of it ourselves when we were in government in respect of the over-70s.  However, it went on for some time and that is regrettable.</p> <p>In fairness, the Minister of State has acknowledged that it is regrettable that Members on all sides in both Houses have been obliged to place on record the anecdotal evidence being made available to them in their clinics.  Members have been outlining the distress being caused to families, individuals, children with Down's syndrome, those with serious illnesses, etc., for some time.  However, it took a major political development, namely, the loss of hundreds of local authority seats by various parties in the recent elections, before someone decided it was time to take action.  My general criticism of the political process is that in many ways we live in a dictatorship disguised as a democracy.  A couple of people run the whole show.  It is a closed shop with one or two senior civil servants involved.  Those who run the show ignore, as a matter of form, their own backbenchers and the Parliament as a whole.  I have often stated that the Parliament is actually subservient to the Government of the day.  It should be the case that the Cabinet of the day - regardless of its political hue - should be subservient and responsible to the Parliament.  In practice and regardless of who is in power, this sadly does not happen.  We all face a challenge in this regard going forward.</p><p>We are within the so-called three-week period when 15,000 or so discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards are due to be returned.  I have seen some evidence that they are being returned, which is a hugely welcome development.  I hope all of those affected will have their cards returned to them as quickly as possible, because that is what is required.  That said, the Bill before us is to be welcomed.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's personal commitment but I am not so sure the Government has gone about what it is doing in the correct manner.  In essence, it made an announcement, is proceeding with its work and is only now knuckling down to what might prove to be difficult negotiations with the IMO.  I welcome the conclusion of the framework agreement.  As with Europe and the United States, the authorities here had no one to speak to on behalf of GPs.  Thankfully, some progress is now being made in this regard.  In the context of any adjustment of competition law, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to allow for the appropriate consultations to take place on a collective basis.</p><p>We must exercise caution during the negotiation phase.  We can all criticise various aspects of the health service.  I refer not to the individuals who work within it but rather to its general management and organisation.  One area in respect of which I believe we can all pretty much agree the health service is working well is the provision of primary care by GPs.  We must be cognisant of the need to avoid, if possible, messing up in this area.</p><p>It is easy for politicians and members of the public to state that consultants make a fortune.  While a salary of &euro;109,000 or more per year seems huge to me, I am conscious of serious competition from abroad.  I read a newspaper article in recent days which stated that consultants in Ireland are among the highest paid in the world.  I am not so sure, particularly when one considers that 250 posts throughout the country are vacant and there is no queue of people seeking to fill them.  I am not trying to focus too much on money, but we are not attracting the relevant people.  It appears that young doctors who have completed their GP training are attracted to Canada and Australia.  I do not know whether it is actually the case, but it seems that annual salaries of &euro;250,000 are on offer, pretty much the norm and achievable in these locations.  If it is a choice between entering a new set-up and flogging their bodies for a salary in order to try to build up a list of clients, and travelling abroad to available of opportunities such as these, then I can understand the attraction.</p><p>From a consultant's perspective, one can understand why people might leave the country if it is a case of earning hundreds of thousands per year as opposed to &euro;109,000.  I met a retired orthopaedic surgeon who originally trained in Canada.  He informed me that good interns and senior registrars worth their salt who are seeking to become consultants are worth between $700,000 and $900,000 per year.  I consider that amount of money to be obscene, but if that is what we are up against, then we have a problem.  We will be obliged to devise some innovative ways of dealing with the disparity that exists in this regard and in respect of GPs.  We must certainly be cognisant of the disparity in salaries in the context of the overall aspiration of having free GP care for everybody.  If we have an expectation that people who have studied for 11 years or more are going to provide their services for what I might consider to be either the average industrial wage or an appropriate wage, we are going to be disappointed.</p><p>The principles behind what the Government is doing are all fine and the benefits are many.  However, there is a need for it to be extremely careful in the negotiation phase and in what it might seek to do in upsetting what is generally a good system.  We all agree with the aspiration to make the system better but we must ensure that we get it right.  In the current climate, it is difficult to approve of the payment of large amounts of money.  However, we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>I hope no one will interpret what I am about to say as being racist.  We are extremely lucky that people of other nationalities are prepared to come here to work.  I understand that 15 years ago the number of non-consultant hospital doctors from abroad working here stood at 5%.  That figure is now heading in the direction of 25%.  There are a number of factors at play in this regard.  It is great to have those doctors here, but we must ask whether we are exporting expertise on one hand and then importing it on the other.  Is that an appropriate way to proceed?  I recall Senator Crown explaining on a previous occasion that all 20 senior oncologists in this country had trained at the top six institutes in the United States.  There is not a hospital or state in the US that would not give anything to have that type of expertise available to it.  Will we be able to say the same thing 20 years from now, or will we have exported our best and brightest?</p><p>I would appreciated it if the Minister of State would take the couple of points I have made on board.  There are issues we may raise on Committee Stage, but we will be supporting the legislation.</p><p>The services available at accident and emergency departments can be abused on occasion.  When free GP care for those under six years of age becomes available, we must appeal to the public to be responsible when it comes to the use of the service.  There cannot be a scenario in which a person with a headache goes to the accident and emergency unit; he or she must go to his or her GP.  Some private health insurance companies offer a system whereby they have nurses on call and their customers can ring them to seek medical advice.  When one has one's first child, every time he or she belches one wants to know what is going on.  Perhaps a similar telephone service might be provided in respect of those under six years of age in order that their parents might obtain advice as to whether they need to bring their child to see a GP or whether they should proceed directly to accident and emergency.  It might be useful to consider introducing such a service.</p><p>The Minister of State has my best wishes in the contest due to take place later in the week.  I am conscious of the fact that he began his political career in this House and it would be great to have a party leader with whom I shared these benches.</p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

It is important to place on record the figures relating to medical cards.  I have consistently stated - I will continue to say it - that since we entered office in 2011, the number of medical cards in circulation has increased by over 217,000, from 1.73 million to 1.951 million.  The Bill before the House deals with a particular group of individuals, namely, those under six years of age.  Many members of the medical profession have stated that they do not understand why people who have very good incomes should receive free GP services for their children.  However, there are many individuals who are caught in the middle in this regard.  I refer to those who are working, who do not earn large incomes and who do not have the benefit of a medical card.  People with two, three, four or five children  are caught within the tax net while not receiving the support they require.  I have encountered families that have had a bad run of luck whereby two or three of their children may have become ill at the same time, and that has proven to be expensive for them.</p> <p>It is in this case that the legislation will be of benefit, which is important.  It is also important to realise we have worked out the net cost of this provision.  There are already quite a few children under six who benefit from medical cards in any case.  Approximately 60% of children do not have free medical services provided to them.  We are talking about including them in the equation to ensure they will have access to adequate health care.<br />I am not disagreeing in any way with the Bill but believe we have changed slightly in respect of prescriptions through the imposition of a nominal charge.  We did so because there was a problem with people getting a lot of medication and not necessarily using it.  I wonder whether we shall be asking in the House in a few years whether there should be a nominal charge for going to the general practitioner.<br />We reviewed a large number of medical card holders and the outcome was that four in 100 were to be removed from the scheme because they did not fulfil all the criteria.  The other 96% still had to go through the process.  The big problem general practitioners have raised with me at a number of meetings, both as groups and individuals, concerns the amount of administration and paperwork they are now doing.  It is consuming a considerable amount of time.  The time general practitioners have to devote to examining health issues has been greatly reduced as a result.  I am concerned that there could be circumstances in which people will go to their general practitioner with the slightest cough.  I was talking to an individual recently who overheard a medical card holder in a shop stating she had taken her child to a general practitioner and got a prescription and medication.  She was asked how the medication worked but she replied that her child was fine and that she did not bother giving it to him.  However, this required a general petitioner visit, the issuing of a prescription and the collection of that prescription, thus incurring a huge cost.  The lady went through the process for reassurance rather than anything else but it was interesting to note how the cost arose.  It is in this context that I am making my point.<br />Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It represents a good move.  There will be a benefit for working, taxpaying families on a very tight budget.  If they have a bad run of luck, they will have difficulty in gaining access to the medical services they require.  That is what this Bill is addressing.  I welcome the decision by the Minister to bring forward this legislation.<br />Let me touch on section 6.  I have been considering this issue in a different context, namely in regard to the transfer of assets under the nursing home scheme.  As the Minister knows, I have been very involved in this matter for over ten years.  I have been examining the matter from a legal perspective over the past six months.  It relates to the qualifying criteria that apply when somebody has assets.  Strangely, if somebody becomes unwell, different criteria apply.  I am open to correction and am not asking the Minister for an answer today.  I will probably be reverting to him on it.  There is a cut-off point of three years in regard to the contribution to nursing home care.  If one has a gradually worsening illness, such as MS, and ends up in a nursing home because one needs a full-time carer, there is no upper limit on the number of years for which one must contribute.  The problem this is causing for a family on my books is that, on the basis of an income assessment, the contribution will have to be made <i>ad infinitum </i>until the patient passes away.  This is causing great difficulty for the family because the income now being generated from their asset, a farm, is not sufficient to support the family who have taken over the running of it.  This is unfair.  I have a question over the constitutionality of it.<br />We are now amending the section.  I see where the Department is coming from.  It is a technical amendment requiring the transfer of assets afterwards.  However, it is the current legislation that I am concerned about.  There is a discrepancy causing difficulties.  A very small number of families are affected but extreme difficulty is caused for them.  There is a cost to the State because nursing home costs are working out at roughly &euro;50,000 per annum per patient.  Where there is income, there has to be an appropriate contribution, obviously, but in some cases the contribution required is excessive and makes it difficult for families who are trying to run and generate an income from the family business or farm.  This is just one of the problems that has arisen.<br />Overall, I welcome the Bill.  I hope general practitioners will be brought on board in regard to the implementation of this service.  We need to be conscious of the amount of administrative work, however.<br />Let me touch on what was said by Senator MacSharry, who has raised some important points.  I do not agree with the report in <i>The Irish Times</i>and the comments of the OECD on the consultant issue.  There is a strange set of circumstances regarding the interpretation of consultants' salaries here.</p></speech>

When we consider the salary compared to that in England, we should note there is a primary salary initially and that one is paid for any additional work taken on.  The starting salary of a consultant in England might be &pound;80,000 but additional sums are added, which brings the figure way above that in Ireland.  There are no English qualified consultants applying for jobs here.</p></speech>

I very much welcome this Bill.  I will try to restrict my comments to the Bill and its intention, which is to provide GP cards to all children aged five years and younger without fees.  I  acknowledge there are many competing demands in our health services but I will not play one off against the other.</p><p>What we learned from the medical card crisis, or whatever term different parties give it, is that each story gave us an insight into the ensuing distress for individuals and families.  I do not stand over any of the withdrawals or the lottery-type system but believe that what occurred very much shows how we need a health system that is transparent and based on rights.  That is what we are trying to do today.</p><p>Giving free GP cards to all children under six is the first step in taking a rights-based approach to health care.  Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states the child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health possible and to have access to health and medical services.  In giving free GP cards, we are proceeding in line with General Comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which calls for universal coverage of quality primary health services.  The World Health Organization has identified that the aim of universal health coverage is to ensure that everyone can use the health services they need without risk of financial ruin or impoverishment.</p> <p>GP care is often the first point of contact with our health system.  Illness is not a planned activity and families can find they have one, two or even three unexpected doctor visits in one month.  It is not something any of us can plan.  The cost of visits to the GP along with prescription charges and other associated costs can be significant and very often move families dangerously close to the at-risk of poverty threshold or even push them beyond it.  With so many pressures on family finances, a small health concern may be postponed until it becomes a significant health issue.  A report on medical card entitlement highlighted that parents, particularly mothers, neglect their own health because of the expense and related costs of GP visits.  When it came to spending decisions, children were their priority.</p><p>GP care is the cornerstone of a successful health service as highlighted in the Children's Rights Alliance report card in 2014.  It is the first point of contact with the health system and we must ensure that it is resourced, effective and making the connections.  We have seen in the study on growing up in Ireland how important access to GP care is.  My concern is that where a child gets access to GP care, he or she may still have to wait a long time before seeing a consultant.  We have certainly seen that those living in more socially disadvantaged areas are less likely to go to a consultant or obtain further treatment.  While I welcome this move, I wonder if it will show up other areas of stress in our health system.</p><p>We must note the cumulative impact of six tough budgets which have pushed many parents to their limits.  We must give hope to families and communities.  The survey last week by Pfizer - the health index - found that 69% of people are still finding it difficult to make ends meet while 81% did not see that their current level of disposable income would improve during the year.  The majority of those surveyed were very welcoming of the new free GP card.</p><p>I have a question about equality of access.  We must ensure that all children benefit, especially those who are less likely to link in with the same GP on a regular basis.  This was raised in the Children's Rights Alliance report card, which set out the example of Traveller or Roma children as well as children who live in direct provision accommodation.  We must ensure we do not just link into our child benefit register or PPS numbers as those systems exclude many of these groups of children.  I want to be clear that the Bill is for all children in Ireland irrespective of their status and that the habitual residence condition will not apply.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  While I realise the pressures that are on the health service, this is a rights-based approach and a welcome first step towards universal health care.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1117" speakername="John Gilroy" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200028#BB00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I welcome the Bill as the legislative basis for a new universal GP service.  I point out that &euro;37 million has been provided in the 2014 budget to fund this initiative, which is a funding provision over and above that which already exists within the system.  To say the funding is being diverted from existing services is not just factually incorrect but politically dishonest.  I have heard the argument used all too frequently and, I am afraid, all too effectively during the recent elections.  When the legislation is implemented, 240,000 children who must currently pay to see a GP will have access to free GP care.  Almost half the population will have access to free GP care, which is the first step in the provision of free GP care to the entire population.  This is also a key step towards the provision of universal health insurance.  I ask the Minister what the next step is.</p><p>It has been asked why high earners who can well afford to provide for their own children's GP care should be included in this.  This is the argument about universality versus means testing.  When one puts a means test in place, one must decide where to set the threshold.  It comes back to what Senator van Turnhout spoke about and the question of whether we go down the utilitarian route of the greatest good for the greatest number or the rights-based route.  My preference and that of the Government is for a rights-based approach to health service provision.</p><p>I attended several meetings of GPs in the south of Ireland over the last number of months.  The GPs outlined vocally their concerns and spoke not so much about the provision of free GP care for the under-sixes, but in general terms about the new GP contract, which was drawn up under a previous Minister.  Whoever drew up the contract certainly gave GPs plenty of scope for concern.  Certainly, they made well-targeted criticisms of it.  The situation has not been helped by the fact that it was thought that the ruling of the Competition Authority precluded GPs' representatives from entering into strategic negotiations with the Minister and the Department.  The Minister referred to the June agreement with the IMO and he might say a few more words on that in his response to the debate.</p><p>Our ability to deliver a universal health insurance system has been questioned by many commentators in politics and the media.  It has been said that it cannot be done at all, that nothing has happened and that the political will is not there.  The Netherlands has a system which is something like the one we are purporting to introduce here.  It took almost 20 years to introduce it there.  The Dutch model is based on numerous health care providers and insurers competing for resources and it appears to offer best value for money and the best health outcomes.  There is high patient involvement, which is key, as well as very low political interference.  The latter is very important and something we could perhaps do with in this country.  One of the main criticisms of the system involves its cost.  Studies have shown that a high level of expenditure does not always equate with good health outcomes.  What is more important than the amount of money spent on health services is the organisation and political culture in which health or any other services are being delivered.  That is the best guarantor of good health outcomes.  In preparing for the debate, I was amused to read one report which referred to politicians involving themselves in the provision of health care as well-meaning amateurs who ultimately undermine the very system they purport to support.  We have a bit to learn in this country in that regard.</p><p>At one of the meetings I attended in the south with GPs, a politician who shall remain nameless stood up and said he had received 26 representations on health issues that very day.  That struck me as more than most GPs in the room had received.  There must be something very wrong with a system where people feel the first port of call for health care delivery is a politician rather than a medic.  The diagnosis not the remedy is the awful two-tier system we have.  There is competition for resources and access to health is not always determined by medical need but often by one's ability to pay.  I am glad to support the Minister's efforts to reform health services radically and get rid of the awful two-tier system the results of which we see in our clinics all the time.  I am glad the legislation is before us today and that the first step is being taken in the radical transformation - not simply reform - of the health service.  I look forward to continuing to support the Minister's efforts.</p></speech>

I do not welcome the Bill.  It harkens back to the era of bribing people with their own money.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>last Thursday that the Department of Health has a reported overrun of &euro;158 million.  Why on earth are Ministers in that Department extending eligibility when they cannot fund what they have?  That has been a persistent criticism of the IMF.  I note that the Minister of State does not state how much it will cost or the number of people involved.  This could very well repeat the mistake made the last time we had one of these measures, which was the extension of medical cards to everybody over 70 which was a massive cost overrun.<br />I believe in targeting and that those who have should put money into the fund so the have-nots will benefit.  We cannot entertain the delusion that one can subsidise everybody although we did so by borrowing vast amounts of money abroad.  Redistribution in society means that some people pay in - I think they should be those in the top half of the community - and some people benefit.  First of all, those who benefit should be those right down at the worst level of poverty.  We should gradually work on them.  Extending benefits to the entire population in a country that is bankrupt is bizarre.  It is bribing people with their own money.  To the economist in me, this brings us right back to what got this country into trouble - people making irresponsible political promises.  I apply this to the tax cuts I have heard mentioned in some discussions.  <br />Everybody accepts that there should be a redistribution from the haves to the have-nots.  This is what the medical card system set out to do.  As the Minister of State said, it is currently benefiting the 40% of people who are worst off.  In respect of extending it to 100%, I wish to draw attention to the EU Survey on Income and Living<br />Conditions, EU-SILC, study of poverty among children which used an index involving 12 items such as a separate bed, their own books, food and drinks for friends when they call over, their own money, a family holiday in Ireland or abroad, a day out with the family, a bank or post office account, shops close to home.  The study found that 69.5% of children reported not having to go without any of those items.  Why did we not use the DEIS model which deals with deprivation in schools?  It caters for 167,000 out of 888,000 children in primary and secondary schools.  Barnardos estimated recently that 9.9% of children are in consistent poverty.  The DEIS number is 19%.  The EU-SILC survey has a figure of about 30%.  Nobody has 100%.  We are fooling ourselves in this House if we think we can subsidise 100% of the population on the basis that somehow 100% of children in this country are in poverty.  <br />I also note that there are other solutions to this.  I see that VHI offers a 15% discount for children and students that expires in October.  The fourth child and subsequent children are free on those plans.  We must be serious about income distribution in this country.  It does mean taking from some people to give to other people.  One cannot give something to everybody except through the kind of foreign borrowing we have engaged in.  Bribing the electorate with their own money or borrowed money should be left in the past.  There is no evidence to support subsidising 100% of children in any of the research on child poverty that I have researched in preparation for today.  <br />The GP service is the part that actually works.  It does not keep people on trolleys and does not seem to have waiting lists.  I believe the Government wishes to abolish the HSE.  It should have tackled the problems in hospitals but it is now interfering with the bit that does work.  A total of 60% or 70% of the population pays &euro;55 to visit a GP.  We would all love to shunt the bill on to somebody but that is make-believe land.  There is no magic wand that will pay that bill.  Why are we distorting the part of the health system that actually works and not reforming situations involving people on waiting lists and people on trolleys?  <br />This was a misguided political promise.  I do not think it has any benefits at all.  We were doing it at the time.  We were taking away medical cards from people who were in genuine need.  Given the precedent of the mistake that was made with the over-70s, we should not have continued with this.  I ask the Minister of State to redistribute resources towards the really needy in society and not people who do not satisfy any of the research criteria as to what constitutes poverty.  Pretending we are all poor and that, therefore, we will have a huge redistribution policy towards everybody is an illusion.  It is part of the reforms that we should have introduced in this House when we all came up here three years ago and part of the response to when a country goes bankrupt.  To persist with the free money from Brussels and free gifts for everybody when we know the current state of Exchequer - we are borrowing &euro;8 billion per year - is wrong.  Choosing the richest 40% and 50% of the population as the group to benefit from a measure like this is doubly wrong.  </p></speech>

The Bill, as other Senators have alluded to, has caused considerable angst among the medical community prior to the agreement with the IMO, which I commend.  From recent polls, it is clear that 80% of the public are behind the proposal.  This Bill is the starting point for a new universal GP service.  This first step will give an entitlement to a GP service without fees to all children aged under six.  It is the first step in the Government's ongoing commitment to ultimately bring about a universal GP service without fees within its term of office and as set out in the programme for Government.  It is one on which we need to deliver.</p><p>Many people have concerns around the introduction of this.  Some of these have played out in the newspapers over the past year.  One of my main sources of concern is that many GPs, including many of my friends, are leaving the country.  It is not just GPs who are leaving.  Consultants and junior doctors are also leaving.  We need to urgently figure out why these people are leaving the country in a way that goes beyond anecdotal evidence and then address those factors.  Is the reason financial?  I think it is.  Is it supply-based?  Is it because of career path concerns or other reasons?  Obviously, people reach decisions for a variety of reasons.  It is not just GPs who are leaving.  I would be very interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments because it is something that affects many of my friends and acquaintances.  One matter that is of grave concern to me involved the sister of a friend of mine who left for Canada recently.  She is not a GP and I suppose I am digressing from the issue but it is relevant to the overall issue.  She was told by a would-be mentor in the department to go and stay away for at least ten years because things would not improve.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments to counter that argument when it comes to that particular difficulty we are having in our medical services. </p><p>The framework agreed with the IMO is welcome and removes the most significant stumbling block to the rolling out of this service.  There had been well-publicised concerns from GPs about this but one underlying problem, which I am not sure has been addressed, has been the idea that if a service is free, people are inclined to use it when it is unnecessary.  It would seem to me that even if we were to introduce a nominal fee of say &euro;5 or &euro;10, it might prevent this from happening.  In saying this, I do buy into the argument that once a charge is introduced, it could be subject to being increased so I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's comments on that.  </p><p>The medical card issue arose during the local and European elections.  In my view, there is a lack of informed debate on the real cost of maintaining this system and how the system can be substantially funded.  </p> <p>There is also a lack of honesty about the figures.  Nearly 2 million medical and GP cards are in circulation, covering more than 40% of the population.  Under this Bill, 420,000 children will receive free GP care, and the 181,000 who already have GP cards or medical cards will be joined by a further 240,000 who will gain entitlement under this Bill.  It is most welcome and will ease the pressure on parents, particularly those who are under financial pressure, and will lead to better health care overall from the point of view that people will not delay accessing our health services through their GPs in the first instance.  Studies indicate that the number of GP visits made is related to price and that free GP access results in more frequent visits to the GP.  However, all evidence shows that earlier detection and treatment of illness ultimately reduces both the long-term cost to the system and, hopefully, the impact on the patient.</p><p>The measure is not being funded as a consequence of savings implemented elsewhere in the health system and is an entirely separate budgetary measure.  It will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children who currently must pay to see a GP.  Providing access to a GP service without fees to all children aged five and under will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees and will see us a long way towards implementing the Government's strategy.</p><p>I acknowledge the contribution of GPs to restoring our economy and the very significant role they play.  GPs have experienced a reduction in fees paid under the general medical services, GMS, scheme.  In 2008 they received &euro;353 per patient per year, and this was reduced to &euro;243 in 2012 and further in 2013.  The overall figure the Government paid to GPs under the GMS scheme remained at &euro;450 million as a result of an extra 600,000 people becoming eligible for medical cards.  I welcome the Bill.  The acceptance of the scheme by the GPs and ongoing dialogue is very important.  I commend the Minister on his work in the area, to which he is very committed.</p></speech>

I wish him the very best in his endeavours.  Senator MacSharry led out for our party on the issue.  I have a number of issues and questions.  The Minister will not get everything right immediately, and that is the purpose of debate.  I welcome the reinstatement of medical cards, particularly to children.  The Government acknowledged that the HSE made mistakes which caused much distress.  I was glad to see that cards are being reinstated in my area.  It is important we keep on top of that and ensure it happens.  I support this legislation, subject to the assurance that people who are sick and require medical cards will receive them.  Over the past two years, particularly since the review was brought forward, I have had grave concerns about this.  Given that this is only Second Stage of the Bill, we will seek further figures on the number of medical cards that have been reinstated, which the Department will have.</p><p>The review of medical cards on which the HSE and the Department insist is, in many instances, a waste of time and money.  While I have heard the Minister talk about this, and I agree with him, nothing has been done as yet.  We are asking people who have life-long illnesses, ailments and disabilities that will not be cured to renew their medical cards.  It must be a waste of capacity in the Minister's Department, particularly in the medical card unit.  While I will not go into specific details of cases, every week I deal with numbers of people who will clearly retain their medical cards but who have to fill in the forms and send in the financial data.  I see the Minister nodding and I am glad.  I hope it will be addressed because we could save a lot of money, time, hassle and effort.</p><p>When people aged under 70 apply for a medical card there seems to be an insistence that they are applying for their families and spouses and the Department requires the spouses' financial data.  In one case, a child aged over six years requires a medical card but the Department has asked for all of the data for all six people in the family.  Again, it is a waste of time, money and effort.  While we all want children and sick people to be able to access GPs for free, it is not really free; the taxpayer pays for it.  Whatever we do, we must be fair to the GPs.  I hope the new mechanism the Minister will use to discuss the draft agreement will be that.  While there are certain constraints under legislation including the Competition Act, to insist upon items such as a gagging clause so that no GP who signs up to this can be critical of the HSE is ridiculous in a democratic country such as this.  GPs who do not sign up to the scheme for the under sixes is being threatened with the prospect that medical card patients aged under six will be removed from them and the contract is for five years.</p><p>While I agree with all the HSE's stipulations to ensure the GPs' practices are up to scratch, GP practices will need to make a substantial capital investment to meet the requirements set down by the Department and HSE.  While any GP practices that are limited companies or partnerships will be able to offset the requisite capital spend against future income, no grant is available.  The Minister will know through his work that while everybody has the view that GPs are loaded, many of the GPs I know are not, particularly those who have started practices in the past five to ten years.  Having invested heavily in their practices, buildings and facilities, many of them are heavily indebted.</p><p>It is about time somebody said that GPs are a very important part of our health system.  In my area we have the D-Doc system, which works very well and provides a service 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year.  The more people can be dealt with by GPs instead of attending hospital accident and emergency units, the better.  We should take a step back on this.  While I do not know who will be the Minister for Health next week, whoever it is needs to find a new approach to our GP services because this will not work without their approval and support, and we do not need to fight them.  Under the previous Government, there was a serious situation regarding pharmacists, who had very serious concerns about issues such as dispensary fees.  Over time, they were dealt with.  We all want what is best for our citizens, but let us be fair to GPs.  We do not need to hold up examples and say these people are minted and can take it on the chin.  Many of them cannot, and we must support them.</p><p>I broadly welcome the Bill.  While I take the Minister at his word, I do not know whether he will be in the same position next week.  I do not mean this in any flippant way.  Whoever is Minister needs to ensure fairness exists throughout the system.  If he does not have the answer today, maybe on Committee Stage the Minister could report on the number of medical cards that have been returned to children and people with illnesses.  Let us deal with the renewal of medical cards once and for all.</p> <p>I have no idea why the HSE continues to insist that people with conditions such as serious epilepsy or amputees seek to have their medical cards renewed. It is a joke and a waste of money.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for his presence and for his contribution this afternoon.</p></speech>

We had a new Bill which, taken on its own, could only be welcomed.  Anything that seeks to expand the access and reach of the medical card scheme can only be seen as a positive thing.  Taken on its own, it is not particularly progressive.  It is expanding access to medical cards but, given the context of what was happening at the time, originally denied but now all but tacitly acknowledged - the attempt to row back on the interpretation of who would qualify for a medical card in other age groups on the grounds of need due to the alleged stringencies of probity - we now know there was a double-edged approach to the issue.  The overall effect of this would have been to decrease the number of people who had medical cards, to reduce the expense of the system.  While we were taking cards from people who, by virtue of illness and age, were more likely to incur an expense to the State through their medical cards, we were giving them to a demographic who in relative terms was less likely to cost money.  One would have to say - I am sorry if I sound unduly cynical about this - that these two measures together, in the absence of a more fundamental approach to health reform, would appear to have been populist, vote-getting measures rather than substantive efforts at reform.</p><p>Who could oppose this Bill?  I will not oppose it, but I cannot let the opportunity pass to make a few points that need to be made.  Others have made them and I am sorry if I sound repetitive, but I work in one part of our health system and I am a close observer of the other parts.  The hospital-based system is highly dysfunctional.  It is unfair.  It systematically incentivises inefficiency and inactivity.  Its core business plan is to keep people on waiting lists as long as possible, because once they come off the waiting list they cost money.  In this time of stringency, the only good that we are advocating in the health services is to come in under budget.   We have an incredibly dysfunctional public hospital system which urgently needs reform.</p><p>We have quite a functional GP system.  It works quite well.</p></speech>

We would welcome as a society any attempt to roll out free GP care, and most of the GPs I know would too.  If this under-six scheme is the beginning of a roll-out, I ask the Minister of State - I am delighted to see he has a pencil in his hand - to give us the timeframes for the roll-out to under-eights, under-15s, over-70s and over-65s.  When does it become a comprehensive free GP scheme?  If it is part of a phased introduction of free GP services, the logic of it would seem to be that there will be further milestones along the road.  Instead, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that when this was conceived it was taking with one hand what was being given with the other, which was meeting a pre-election commitment to expand GP care to a particular age group while at the same time funding the expansion by taking services away from people who needed them the most.  Collectively, the two initiatives, thankfully, were caught out by the political process at the time of the local and European elections.  This, as has been admitted by members of the Minister of State's party and the other party in the Coalition Government, caused a certain amount of soul-searching and has led to a change.  It has had the unintended effect of making this better legislation.</p><p>I will support the Bill.  If one takes away the attempt to remove medical cards from others, this as a stand-alone Bill makes more sense.  We will try to pin the Minister of State down to the timeframes and scale of the roll-out and whether it will be phased or whether we are waiting for the great moment - as they used to say, after the revolution - that moment when suddenly we will have universal health care for all.  Everything is on hold until then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200031#EE00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy White.  This is a Bill to implement the Government's commitment to provide GP care to all children under the age of six years.  Like Senator Crown, I want to see universal primary care for all citizens that is free at the point of delivery.  I will not oppose the Bill.  Senator Crown made the point that the Bill needs to be the start of a transparent roll-out of free GP care for all over a particular timeframe.  Otherwise, it will only further emphasise the inequalities in our health system.</p><p>The context of the debate is the Government's U-turn on discretionary medical cards.  We were told by Ministers in the months leading up to the recent local and European elections that there was no such thing as a discretionary medical card.  It was something the Taoiseach repeated over and over when he was questioned about the issue during Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il.  We are now being told that 15,000 discretionary medical cards have been removed from people since 2011, and these will be returned.  These cards should not have been removed in the first place.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in said so, as did others, but the appeals fell on deaf ears.  We also appealed to the Government in a motion in advance of the elections on 23 May to restore them, and I am sure the Minister of State was one of those who voted against the Bill at the time.  It was only after the elections - in which both parties, but particularly the Minister's party, got a good kicking - that there was a wake-up call and the soul-searching that Senator Crown spoke about, and the U-turn followed.</p><p>The Government's decision leaves many unanswered questions.  It leaves out many people who have been refused medical cards.  We are told that some 15,300 people who have lost their medical cards since 2011 will receive notices by letter in the next few weeks that their medical cards will be reinstated.  This is confined to former holders of medical cards on a discretionary basis related to hardship caused by particular illnesses, conditions or disabilities.  Of course that is fair, and we would support that.  Those concerned submitted documentation to the HSE when they were notified that their cards were being reviewed.  There is a huge discrepancy between the number of people in the above category and the number of cards that have been removed, which is 30,000.  I have no doubt that many people who had their discretionary medical cards taken from them looked at the situation and decided there was no point in proceeding with a review process because what they could see at the time was a roller-coaster of culling and cutting.  As they did not proceed with the review process, where will they stand?  Are people who validly held medical cards but did not proceed with the review process to be excluded from consideration?  Will there be a process of appeal or review for those who had their cards removed over the relevant period but do not receive a letter in the coming weeks?  Will there be an opportunity for them to apply again?  What about those who applied for cards on discretionary grounds over the relevant period and had their applications refused?  Given that the same criteria of assessment were applied to such people between 2011 and 2014, surely they are equally entitled to have their situations taken into account?</p><p>I will now address the Health (General Practitioner Services) Bill 2014.  People understandably ask where is the fairness in giving free GP access to a healthy child of four while denying it to a very ill or disabled brother or sister who happens to be more than six years old.  Where is the fairness in giving free GP care to a disabled child from birth and taking it away from him or her on reaching the age of six?  These are the anomalies and inequities that are built into a system that is not based on true universality of access, which should be based on medical need alone, regardless of income or age.  The Government will argue that it cannot roll out universal free GP access in one go.</p> <p>I believe that is fair enough and it is a valid response.  As we support the principle of universality, we will not, of course, oppose this Bill.  We are prepared to regard it as a first step and take the Minister's word that this is what it is.</p><p>My concerns are very similar to those of Senator Crown.  Where is the timeframe and the programme to roll out universal free GP care in a progressive and transparent manner?  It is most certainly not in this Bill.  We are being asked to take a very big leap of faith where we are not getting the details of any timeframe in regard to how this will be rolled out.  The Bill lacks clarity in that area and it certainly lacks a timetable for the rollout of universal free GP care for all, to which I know, with respect, the Minister of State is personally committed.</p><p>We also need to take into account the concerns of GPs regarding the under-resourcing of primary care.  They have stated that their workload has increased while resources have been cut.  While I would obviously argue with the Minister about medical cards which have been cut, the people who have lost their medical cards and so on, we all accept there are more medical cards out there.  The reason for this is that people have lost their jobs or are on low pay, and they are entitled to medical cards based on income grounds.  At the same time, however, the resources to GPs have been cut by &euro;160 million.  The Government spends just 2% on general practice out of the total health expenditure, both public and private, compared to 9% in the North and in Britain, and practices are struggling both financially and in terms of capacity, as a number of other Senators pointed out.  We have to listen to the concerns of GPs and make sure they are properly resourced and can roll out free GP care for all when the time comes.  While we will meet with resistance from some, I would hope the majority will see this as progressive and as something that should be embraced and delivered.  The test of that will be how this is rolled out and accepted.</p><p>As a first step, the Bill is to be welcomed.  It is something that is hopefully the start of a process that will lead to universal free GP care for all and a serious investment in primary care.  Huge strides have been made in recent times in primary care centres and in far more integrated care at primary care level.  It is the way to go, it is revolutionary, it is delivering best practice health care and it is something I am very much supportive of.  The more we invest in primary health care, the better it will be for all and the less pressure we will end up having on our acute services.</p></speech>

I interpret the general thrust of what has been said, with perhaps one exception, as support for the Bill, although not unqualified support.  I have very much taken note of, including physically in my notebook, the various comments and observations that speakers have made.  I find myself in much agreement with almost everything that has been said by those who have welcomed the Bill, although not in an unqualified way, particularly given the context of the recent controversy about medical cards awarded on the basis of discretion and the decisions that were required to be made in that regard.  I understand what Senators are saying and also the context in which they have welcomed the Bill.  On a personal note, I thank all of the Senators who wished me well in another matter in which I have been preoccupied to some extent in recent weeks.</p><p>Senator MacSharry made the point at the outset of his speech that early intervention in health and well-being, and the importance of promoting and enhancing primary care, is what he termed a &quot;noble cause&quot;.  If I may say so, Senator MacSharry very much gets it in terms of what this is about.  This is about putting in place a system of primary care, free at the point of access, which is consistent with all of the international literature and research in regard to health services.</p><p>While I do not want to come directly to what Senator Barrett said, it occurs to me that all of the international literature, experience and insight suggests we should have a robust system of primary care that does not have the barrier of fees in respect of access.  There is very substantial evidence that fees are a very real barrier even for people who are relatively well off.  This is about the health needs and the well-being of the population, and it is not just about access for people of low means, although I do not want to underplay that.  The question is how best to configure the health services.  All of the international evidence is that the best way, and I would venture to say the only way, for us to even begin to hope to reform the dysfunctional system Senator Crown talks about is to put in place a primary care system that works, is properly funded and does not rely on the kind of market-driven approach that has characterised a good proportion of the health service.</p><p>I do not believe the necessity to pay a fee should ever be a barrier for anybody attending a doctor.  That is well established in practically every other country in the OECD, certainly in the European Union.  We are a complete outlier with regard to the demands we make on so many people to pay fees to attend their general practitioner.  I believe very strongly that we must address this now.  There will never be a good time to do it, certainly not when coming out of a catastrophic economic collapse.  If one had a chance to pick a period in history to reform the health service, reorient it towards primary care and introduce free GP care, one would probably not pick the current period.  This is where we are, however, and we have to start from where we are.</p><p>Senator MacSharry made a point about negotiations and said he was not sure we were going about this in the right way.  I take him to refer to the consultations and negotiations with GPs.  I have always made the point that it is critical we have a meaningful engagement with the representatives of general practitioners - I have made that point from the outset and it remains my view.  The negotiation and agreement of a framework agreement, signed at the beginning of this month, is the basis for that to now happen.  The GPs, the IMO in particular, have very real, understandable and legitimate concerns about the obstacles that were there or appeared to be there in respect of the meaningful engagement they need to have with the State in order for them to be sure they get paid a proper fee for doing what they are doing, that there is a contract that is fit for purpose and that they have an input into the content of that contract.</p><p>Senator Noone made the point, and I agree, that doctors are crucial to this and their confidence in this is hugely important.  The framework agreement facilitates that.  It did take a number of months to put together and we did have a period in which there was a stand-off, which was unfortunate.  Nonetheless, I attended and addressed the IMO annual conference, and engaged with the members there.  It was a very good engagement, although it was not always the friendliest or the easiest for doctors in circumstances where they felt something was being imposed on them.  However, we got through it.  We talked through the issues, we engaged together and we then managed to get this process going, which I call talks about talks.  This was literally to get a framework agreement in place that can actually be the basis for us moving ahead.  Substantive discussions, not just talks about talks, have now commenced in regard to this matter.  I will say no more than that they have commenced, I hope they will proceed and I have every confidence that they will.</p><p>Senators MacSharry and Noone both raised an issue regarding young GPs and the pull to leave the country and go abroad.  These are very real workforce planning issues but they are also very real issues for the individual doctors themselves, men and women who are trained in this country and would like to see themselves working in this country, raising families and having a good and fulfilling professional life.  I want to see that as well.  A report from Professor Brian MacCraith is beginning to address these issues and has been brought forward by him to the Minister for Health.  It is a very real issue.  I am sorry Senator MacSharry is not still present, although I am sure he is busy.</p></speech>

I was actually making a positive point about him.  I was in Sligo recently and spent two and half hours with a group of general practitioner trainees.  I heard their perspective on the world and on their prospects as GPs, as well as their criticisms and concerns with regard to the system.  It was a useful engagement for me, as Minister of State, to hear what they had to say and it will certainly inform my thinking and knowledge on the issue.  There is a capacity issue as well and we must keep that very much to the fore as we continue to implement the system.</p><p>Senator Burke made a point about a universal system.  I address the point with respect to my friend Senator Barrett as well.  We have known each other for many years and we may have had this conversation in other areas of public policy, not only with regard to health.  I repeat my view.  All the evidence suggests that to have a properly functioning primary care system we must have a universal system.  We must remove the barrier of fees.  We must have a system that we can manage as a whole.  We must take away the notion of a commercial relationship between the individual and the doctor.  It is a question of public health as much as anything else.  I accept that it is a distributional question from an economic point of view.  The term &quot;rationing health care&quot; is awful but we know and we all accept that we ration health care.  How do we ration it?  The rational way to do it is for everyone to pay into the system according to our ability to pay so that it is there for us when we need it.  It is a universalist approach.  Senator Barrett would not necessarily share that view intellectually, but I believe in the fundamental principle that we should all pay in as a community, whether it is through taxation or social insurance, and build up a proper system so that it is available for any of us when we need it.  This should provides a proper basis for the types of preventative strategy that we need in our primary care system.  It is accepted throughout the world that such strategies are the only way to fund our health services and system in the future.  It will be necessary to have proper health and well-being realised as much through preventative strategies as through caring for people when they become ill, which is the most immediate preoccupation of any health service.</p><p>Senators Burke and Noone raised the issue of possible nominal charges.  Co-payment is a controversial area in health care.  I do not exclude the possibility.  Earlier this year at my party conference I made the point that it is something we should not take off table.  Then I found myself on the front page of one of our national newspapers the following day supposedly announcing that it would happen.  One of the problems with the environment we live in at the moment is that we cannot even canvass public policy options, accept that there may be a case for them and then debate them.  If we do so, we are suddenly on the front page of the newspaper of record as if we have announced that the Government has decided to do something when, in fact, the Government has made no such decision.  We must have an intelligent debate on the matter.  There is a case for nominal payments in some situations, but I do not believe there is a good case in respect of children.  We have no intention of providing for co-payments in this legislation for those under six years.  I do not favour it for children up to 18 years of age.  I believe children up to 18 years of age should go free, if I may use that phrase, but there may be a case to be canvassed for the broader population.  There are countries in Europe which essentially have free systems but with nominal co-payments.</p><p>I will have to come back to Senator Burke on the nursing homes scheme and the particular case that he raised because I am not fully familiar with it.  I can certainly do that for him.  It is not germane precisely to the contents of this Bill.  It is a separate issue, but we could try to get some answers on the matter.</p><p>I welcome what Senator van Turnhout has said and I entirely agree with her that one of the lessons from the recent controversy is that we should have a rules-based and rights-based system such that people know where they stand.  We must get away for all time from the business of form-filling, as mentioned by Senator O'Brien, from the notion of discretion and the notion of who exercises discretion and in what circumstances.  We must get away from a situation in which people have to fight for the health care they need when they become ill or where there is an emergency or a sick child.  Our system should not work that way.  Again, I make the point that a universal system would mean that we all pay in advance and in accordance with our ability to pay so that we have a proper system in place that is available for people when they need it.  Senator van Turnhout is correct in this regard.  The Pfizer survey also made the point that there is significant support for this measure, and I welcome that.  I put it to the Senator that this provision will comprehend all children under six years.  Eligibility will depend on ordinary residence.  We are not seeking to import the other regimes of habitual residence and so on.</p></speech>

He said, correctly, that it was a first step.  Along with Senator Crown and Senator Cullinane, he asked whether any thought had been given to the next steps.  I will come to that in a moment.  The point was made about GPs and the importance of meaningful engagement.  That is certainly going to happen, absolutely.</p><p>Senator Barrett made a point about there being no reference to cost.  This proposal has, in fact, been costed.  A sum of &euro;37 million was set aside in last year's Estimate.  Therefore, there is a costing.  Senator Barrett may wish to maintain opposition to it for the reasons he gave, but it would be wrong to say it has not been costed.  Respectfully, I disagree with Senator Barrett on the notion that the management or funding of the health service or decisions about the distribution of resources in the health service constitute interference - that was the word he used - with doctors.  Doctors are entitled to a high level of professional autonomy; there is no question about that.  They are the experts in their field.  However, we are the Parliament.  We should determine the proper distribution of resources and people's entitlements or eligibility.  We could do so in line with what Senator Barrett advocates or in line with what I advocate, but either way, we are the people who make the laws.  Of course doctors are entitled to be consulted, but we as the Legislature make the decisions about the distribution and allocation of resources.</p><p>Senator Noone made a point about the importance of engaging with doctors.  I agree with what she said.  I have covered the points on the nominal charge and the contribution of GPs.</p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien can rest assured that we will we keep the House updated with the progress in returning cards awarded on a discretionary basis.  The Senator may have these figures already but, as of 27 June, a total of 4,151 cards have been returned.  As he rightly said, the process is continuing.  He has observed it in his area and I agree that the process is continuing.  Anyway, we will give a further update as soon as it becomes available.</p><p>I take Senator O'Brien's point about the review process and questions that are repeated even where information may be available on the system.  This has occurred in circumstances where a person's medical condition is unlikely to change, where it is relevant to his application and where he has expenses associated with it.  It should be possible - I understand it is now possible - for the HSE not to repeatedly ask questions that have already been asked and settled in a particular application.  The Senator is right about that.</p><p>The Government's approach to GPs must be fair.  I have made that point.  We have a framework agreement and we are proceeding on that basis.  There are live issues in the discussions and negotiations, such as the gagging clause and the five-year contract limit, and these will be addressed.  I accept that many doctors have legacy costs and investments and so forth, and I understand the environment we are dealing with in the case of many GPs.  They have explained this to me and I accept it.</p><p>Senator Crown made a point about the hospital system being dysfunctional, although he said he supported the legislation.  The notion that we were taking cards from one group to give to another was put forward.  I have never accepted that this was what was intended, although I accept that this is the way it was represented.  I believe this very good proposal was discredited or that people sought to discredit it in circumstances in which people were pointing to mistakes and decisions that had been made elsewhere.  Naturally enough, in public discourse people set one off against the other.  Anyway, that was never the intention and it is not the intention.  Senator van Turnhout made the point that it is not about taking from one and giving to another; it is about trying to expand or introduce a proper system.</p> <p> I was the person who was quoted as saying there is no such thing as a discretionary medical card but I was merely trying to say that all medical cards are the same.  If people make an application for a medical card they go through the means test system first.  If they do not succeed in that, they can then invoke the discretionary element.  I was trying to make the point that a medical card is a medical card, irrespective of how one got it but, again, it was interpreted as me trying to say there was no such thing as discretionary medical cards.  It may have been picked up wrongly and I regret that people may have received it in a dismissive way from me.  It was never intended in that regard.</p><p>I agree with Senator Cullinane.  We are trying to reform the system we have, and I accept that anomalies and contradictions are being exposed in the course of that.  If we go for a cut-off point of six years of age there will always be the question, &quot;What about the seven year old?&quot;  However, I question the argument about giving the card to children under the age of six whose parents are wealthy and so on.  We have a primary school system where we do not charge the children of millionaires, TDs or Senators to send their children to primary school.  Another Senator made the point that there are many low and middle-income earners who cannot get a medical card.  The argument about the children of millionaires is nonsensical but to the extent that we are talking about the children of millionaires, we have ways of dealing with social equity, whether it is through the taxation system or otherwise, that we can all debate on another occasion but the universal system should be in place just as much in the area of health services as it is in the area of education where I support it.  Those arguments are weak but they arise from the contradictions that will inevitable emerge from only providing it for young people up to the age of six when we would love to do it for everybody in one fell swoop, and we cannot.</p></speech>

I am very conscious of the issue of the timeline, particularly now that there seems to be such wide support for this legislation in the other House and here.  It is under active and current consideration by the Government.  I cannot say too much more than that because it is in a deliberative process but I would be hopeful of early decisions on it.</p><p>If I am pressed for my view, I have said previously that with regard to the next steps, we have gone to six years, and my personal view - I need to be careful because I am referring to the way I would like to see it rolling out - is that children and older people are public health priorities; all the literature tells us that.  If we could move the provision to those under the age of 12, for example, or to those under the age of 18, and universalise it for the over 70s, that would be where I would be coming from in regard to this, but my Government colleagues will not thank me if I was to canvass it any more than that.  I repeat that it is under active and current consideration in Government and it is fortified by the wide support here and in the Lower House for this legislation because it needs to be seen as the first step in the process and not as something that stands on its own.</p></speech>

I am glad of the opportunity to put forward the Bill this evening and thank Senators Leyden and Darragh O'Brien for co-sponsoring it.  The issue is very close to all of our hearts.  At least Senator Gilroy, who has done a great deal of work with regards to the health committee and is a health professional, is no stranger to the issues that I shall raise here today.</p><p>I know that the Minster of State, Deputy Lynch, is not available.  I wish her well and hope she is recovering well.  I am sorry that the Minister for Health was not available to attend.  In fairness, he is very good at coming here.  He does make himself available to us very regularly and was here earlier today.  Given the importance of this issue I would have preferred that he attended.  Notwithstanding that I am delighted to have the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, in attendance.  I know that he will take the Bill on its merit and in the spirit in which it has been put forward.</p><p>Last year I published a document that Senator Gilroy will be familiar with, called Actions Speak Louder than Words.  The common denominator of my policy document was an admission that politicians do not have the solutions to this silent crisis.  We all participate in the endless rhetoric that takes place in these Houses when there is an incident of suicide, a loss of life through suicide or a report, as there was in recent weeks, on the national mental health service.  The indignant rhethoric of all us demanding that action be taken, how this crisis cannot continue and so on is deafening at times.  However, when it comes to political leadership and political will to take the appropriate measures we all fall short, which is not to overly criticise this Government any more than it is to absolve previous Administrations.</p><p>My document put forward a structure and resources that we believe needs to be put in place so that the experts, such as people from Senator Gilroy's profession, the people in the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the people in the Samaritans, Console and the various other organisations, both voluntary and professional, throughout the country can begin to peel back the blindfold that is on the phenomenon of loss of life through suicide.  The measures were estimated to cost in the region of &euro;90 million.  Where would one possibly find that amount of money at a time when we are trying to nurse so many deficits throughout all the Departments and so many cutbacks?</p><p>The first thing we need is the political will and courage to say that we are losing the population of an entire village every year through suicide.  It is the same as saying two jumbo jets filled with people are going to crash next year but strangely we know where and, to an extent, when they are going to crash.  We know what the problem is yet we are not prepared to tangibly do what is required in order to prevent suicide.  That is inexcusable in everybody's book yet we continue, and again I am not overly focusing criticism on the Government or absolving other Governments, to commend ourselves on all the good work that we are doing and say it is great.</p><p>We have the policy framework called A Vision for Change which is a great plan that we all signed up for.  There is scarcely a policy in the history of the State, other than corporation tax, that has such support yet it is the first target when it comes to gathering up a few shillings to fill a hole in another aspect of a Department or in another Department.  Over the years we have ring-fenced moneys for mental health and suicide prevention measures.  However, buried within the bowels of the HSE, the policy is subservient to the budgetary constraints and challenges of that organisation and, inevitably, is ranked lower in the pecking order than it should be.</p><p>It was suggested in our policy document that we would look at an area with scope such as the off-sales area.  The Bill does not precisely mirror the proposal in the policy document but reflects its spirit.  It was proposed that a levy could be applied within the off-sales sector that is based on volume and strength but applied by the retailer, collected by the Revenue Commissioners and put specifically into the mental health fund to be established under this Bill.  That money would then be available for the roll-out of policy measures such as those suggested and the accelerated roll-out of A Vision for Change.  The &euro;90 million was only some of the money and, therefore, the balance would be very significant.  We have calculated that up to &euro;200 million would be available for the accelerated roll-out of A Vision for Change.</p><p>I know this is not specifically the Minister of State's portfolio but I need hardly underline the challenges throughout this area.  For example, we had a report on hostels in recent weeks, the Mental Health Commission and a report into the Galway and Roscommon issues regarding mental health services in the region.  Senator Gilroy would be a lot more fluent than I about the individual cases but each corner of the country has its own story to tell in how we, collectively, have failed in this regard.  We have tried to come up with an innovative way to raise money, not to impose a tax on people, not to beat up the retailer who is working so hard, and not to beat up the alcohol trade generally.  It can be said that alcohol is a contributing factor in terms of mental health issues and suicide but there are others such as relationship breakdown, losing one's job, depression and many other social factors.</p><p>We, with the co-operation of the drinks industry and the retail off-trade sector, would like to harness what has been shown in our research and I refer to the goodwill of individuals.  Research shows that when people seek to enjoy themselves responsibly they may be prepared to pay that little bit more in the knowledge that the money would be specifically ring-fenced.  Unfortunately we do not have an example to point to in this regard.  There is no precedent within the Exchequer to say that funding goes directly to an issue and that is where it stays but so what.  Why not test it?  Why not try it?  Why not put it in place?  If we did we would reap the benefits.</p><p>Naturally, retailers feel challenged by the proposal.  In our own area of the north west, where the Acting Chairman comes from himself, we have the Border area.  If Committee Stage of this legislation was accepted then additional measures could be made to give added protections to retailers in the area who must deal with competition from across the Border and its different regime.  Of course such a provision would have to be made.</p><p>People are definitely at their wits end and at the pin of their collars from an economic perspective and the effects of austerity, so they are entitled to enjoy a glass a wine at the weekend if they want.   </p> <p>They do not want to have to pay more for it, but an extra 25 cent on premium lager, an extra 80 cent on a bottle of wine and an extra 16 cent per measure of whiskey or vodka would be a relatively modest amount in the context of the overall price, yet the contribution it would make in terms of the mental health service, the infrastructure and staffing required and the measures outlined in Actions Speak Louder Than Words in creating that new structure and other measures aimed at suicide prevention would be immeasurable in terms of savings for the State.  Instead we have had haphazard funding for mental health services, uncertainty as to whether funds will be available and the fact that A Vision for Change remains an aspiration and, despite the best efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and her colleague, as she had to admit on "Morning Ireland" this week, will not be implemented in the lifetime of this Administration.  That is not acceptable.  We can make a difference here and can choose to do this.  I agree that the best we can hope for is to bring about half of the people with us on Facebook.  I was subjected to scurrilous attacks from certain quarters and received great support from others, but this a tangible measure that could be implemented to ring-fence funding and society as a whole would thank us for it.  It is not about being popular but doing the right thing.</p><p>I do not want to pre-empt what the Minister of State will say, but there may be suggestions that there are European directives that may, in some way, impede the possibility of the Bill being implemented.  I agree that some of the measures might be debatable.  We sought legal advice from senior counsel and believe the Government should test the Bill.  We also believe it is possible to implement its measures.  Let me give one example in terms of betting.  We had the potential to apply a tax in a betting office but not at the dog or race track.  Equally, we are looking to apply something to the off-licence trade where, in fairness, there is scope to do so.  I reiterate it is not to hammer the alcohol retail sector, but there is scope to do so in that area, given historically low prices.  If the Bill is passed on Second Stage, we could on Committee Stage examine whether a proportion of the excise paid by on-trade publicans or a proportion of their commercial rates bill could be ring-fenced and put into this fund also.</p><p>A great deal of work has gone into the Bill and the Actions Speak Louder Than Words document.  We have tried to come up with a tangible solution that the Government coud embrace.  There is nothing I would like more than for the Minister of State and his colleagues to accept the Bill on Second Stage, make changes to it, some of which I have outlined, and bring the wisdom of the likes of Senator John Gilroy and others to bear to improve it.  It would be pioneering legislation but also worthwhile and innovative in that it could reduce the incidence of suicide by 30% in ten years.  Unlike the prediction made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, through no fault of her own, earlier in the week, it could accelerate the roll-out of A Vision for Change, which means that the Government could take full credit for its completion, instead of depending on the goodwill of the next Government to carry it forward.</p></speech>

It would provide substantial funding for the implementation of a range of measures to reduce the rate of suicide in Ireland.  It is broadly based on the Senator's policy document, Actions Speak Louder Than Words, which was published last year.  I compliment him on taking the initiative to try to reduce the level of suicide, which is appalling.  He has outlined his case very well and used imagination and research which is based on the document he published.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and hope the Government will give serious consideration to the Bill.  It is a good, solid suggestion because funding is always an issue in this area.  As a former chairman of the Western Health Board and a former Minister of State in the Department of Health, I know that the effort made during the year is restricted because of the amount of money available.  The Bill would provide a stream of funding for the Department to assist in reducing the incidence of suicide.  Reducing its incidence is all that is possible at this stage, although its elimination would be the ideal.</p><p>Far too often suicides are alcohol related.  In many cases, people do not drink responsibly, but alcohol might be an added aspect when young people commit suicide, which is a tragedy for families.  There is nothing worse.  We cannot compare deaths, but suicide causes utter shock and devastation for the family and friends of the person involved.  The total loss of life through suicide on an annual basis represents the equivalent of the population of an entire village.  That puts the issue in stark terms.  Mental well-being and suicide prevention policies and initiatives have always been starved of the resources they need to have a penetrative impact.</p><p>The Bill would deal with the gap between the licensed trade and off-licences, including major supermarkets, in the price of drink sold.  The Government has done nothing to try to level the playing pitch in that regard.  It constantly increases excise duties on drink sold in licensed premises which are controlled environments in the sale of alcohol, while ignoring the position in supermarkets.  People are buying excessive amounts of alcohol in supermarkets at a very cheap price.  The Minister of State may not realise that rural publicans cannot buy Jameson or other spirits from their wholesalers at less than the price it is sold in Tesco, Dunnes, Aldi, Lidl, SuperValu and Londis.  It is extraordinary.  Having an involvement through the Castlecoote Lodge Bar and Lounge in Castlecoote, County Roscommon, I realise it more than ever having seen the level of competition in that regard.  The public house is a controlled drinking environment.</p><p>I was particularly disappointed when I read the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2014, the signatories to which are Senators Imelda Henry, Maurice Cummins and Colm Burke.  It would allow for the drinking of alcohol in pubs 365 days a year.</p></speech>

Publicans may have different views, but I believe Good Friday and Christmas Day are two days on which publicans can come together to pray or engage in recreation.

All I am saying is that people have a chance and opportunity to reflect on Good Friday.</p><p>I second the Bill and commend Senator MacSharry on his initiative in this regard.  He has put a lot of work into this and I hope the Government accepts his Bill and rejects the other Bill mentioned.</p></speech>

I know from my involvement in drafting that there is significant work involved in drafting any Private Members' Bill and I pay tribute to him and those who worked with him in producing the Bill.  It is important to remember that the introduction of a Bill creates debate, and the Senator has certainly put forward the arguments in favour of the Bill.<br />In dealing with the issue of suicide, it is important that we realise the number of people both directly and indirectly affected.  The figures for suicide from 2010 to 2013 and those for the past 12 months show that we have moved from a high of 554 people who died by suicide to 475.  Suicide is not just about the people who die; it is also about their families and the difficulties the suicide causes for them.  This is not something that lasts just for a week or a year but something that lives with them for the rest of their lives.  Suicide touches families for ever.  We must always be careful how we deal with this issue, because so many people have been directly or indirectly affected by it.<br />The Government is dealing with this issue in a comprehensive way.  For example, the budget of the National Office for Suicide Prevention has doubled over the past three years, from &euro;4 million per year to &euro;8.8 million.  This office is making an important contribution to dealing with the issue.  Not only is it concerned with what is being done currently, but it is also planning for what needs to be done in the future.  The mental health budget is a substantial budget.  It is a huge slice of the health budget because of the huge number of people who receive and require assistance from the health service.  This year, 2014, the budget is over &euro;776 million, and over the past three years an additional &euro;90 million has been provided for mental health care.  We must continue to work on providing services in this area.<br />We have more than 1,100 additional people employed in this area and we are also developing and focusing on community health teams.  These teams are not just about assisting the person directly affected, but also about assisting families.  The whole purpose of the community mental health teams is focused on the community, rather than on admitting people to an appropriate medical facility, because admission does not necessarily mean the problems will be sorted.  In the community mental health teams it is important to work not just with the individual but also with the immediate family.  It is about ensuring everyone is involved and all of the issues that contribute to the problem are dealt with.  This role of the community mental health team is important.   I would like to thank the Department, the HSE and all of the medical and back-up support people for their contribution in turning around how we deal with mental health.  I hope we continue to expand and develop the service with the result that we reduce the number of people who see suicide as the only solution. <br />The new strategic framework for suicide prevention and the Reach Out strategy are being developed.  When dealing with the area of mental health, we must also concern ourselves with the integration of the services we provide.  We must look not just at the people at the front line who are dealing with mental health but also at the backup support services, including social welfare and other areas.  We must look at all elements that affect a person's life and ensure co-ordination between all services.<br />In the context of this Bill, a significant part of the debate relates to the connection with alcohol and to Senator MacSharry's proposals.  We should, therefore, refer to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  Last October, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, including a public health (alcohol) Bill.  These measures were agreed in full, along with the recommendations of the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy.  The recommendations in the strategy are grouped under four pillars: supply, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, and research.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average - 9.1 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i>per year - by 2020 and to reduce the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol.<br />In 2013, the average <i>per capita</i>pure alcohol consumption in Ireland for everyone over the age of 15 was 10.64 litres.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing for alcohol products, the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets, health labelling of alcohol products and regulation of sports sponsorship.  This is a comprehensive package and it is important it is brought forward, implemented and followed through on at the earliest possible date.  This is the type of change we require in order to help all of the people directly affected by the misuse of alcohol and excessive alcohol consumption.  There is a connection between these and suicide; Senator MacSharry is right about that.<br />I believe the Government is dealing with the issues in a proper and structured way.  However, we need to fast-track some of the measures in regard to outstanding issues and I support what Senator MacSharry has said in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200037#LL00700"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I was just doing a quick mental inventory of the number of people I know personally who have taken their lives over the years, and I could make a list of 12.  Suicide is a common problem, a tragedy for those concerned and an unbelievable tragedy for the bereaved.  Anything we can do to highlight the issue and tackle the problem should be given priority.  This innovative Bill is an attempt to ensure that much-needed services are developed for suicide prevention through the use of a novel funding formula.</p><p>All across our health service, we have critical deficiencies.  This morning, we discussed patients who are being denied multiple sclerosis drugs that would decrease their pain and save money for the State.  Patients are told they cannot have life-saving obesity surgery, although it could not only save their lives but save the State money.  Cancer drugs have been denied to patients and breast reconstruction operations have been put on what may be indefinite hold for younger women who have had mastectomies for breast cancer.  We have waiting lists for children who are going deaf and who need to see ear specialists.  The longer this surgery is delayed and the longer they must wait for the appropriate remedial services, the greater the personal and economic consequences for these people.  </p><p>We have problems everywhere and could whinge about them and say they are not our fault and talk about legacy issues and the rotten and miserable set of cards the current administration was dealt on coming into power.</p> <p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, came in with a reformer's brief and zeal with good ideas for health service reforms but has found his hands tied by economic circumstances which occurred without his responsibility.  If we find clever ways of raising moneys to deal with problems, then we should pursue them.  There is no point in putting them on the long finger against some future nirvana where the wonders of economic recovery, universal health care and an integrated approach to all aspects of preventive medicine will kick in.<br />Maybe that will happen.  However, my legislation, limited in its purpose, aimed to introduce a ban on smoking in cars in which children are present became glued up in treacle-like bureaucracy for two years.  After a year and a half of going nowhere, we were shamed into doing something about it by the British when, more or less on the spur of the moment, they adopted our idea and rushed it through both their ancient Houses of Parliament in a short time.  This leads me to believe that not supporting this Bill because we might get something better in the future is not a good strategy.  Governments can easily get distracted, electoral considerations can get in the way, priorities can shift but, meanwhile, we have an opportunity to tackle this heavy burden of suicide with this legislation.  It is clear from the number of psychiatrists, social workers, psychologists and support services we have that we are not doing enough.<br />In addition to this welcome opportunity to raise moneys for much needed suicide prevention services, it makes sense for us to stop to think about our relationship with alcohol itself.  Any measure that puts a tax on a product also acts as a disincentive to consume it.  We, as a society, must be absolutely unambiguous on the fact we need to drink less.  We, as a society, drink approximately five times more litres of alcohol per person per annum than we did in the 1960s.  Discretionary alcohol spending decreased on what it was a few years ago at the height of the Celtic tiger but we are still way above where we were in the 1960s.  Despite our national reputation, we actually had a relatively low burden of national alcohol consumption then.  Perhaps the figure was distorted because of the unusually large number of people who for social, cultural, religious reasons did not drink alcohol at all.  In many other countries it would be typical where one did not have a drinking problem to enjoy a casual glass of wine or two.<br />All the following would happen if for some reason the good Lord Jesus appeared to us all tomorrow morning and told us to stop drinking.  Trust me, I speak as someone who likes a drink as much as the next person and probably more than some.  Liver disease would become extremely rare.  Pancreatitis would go down.  Cancers of the mouth, tongue, tonsil, larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, pancreas, liver, colon and breast would all decline dramatically in frequency and the burden on our health service and mortality rates would also decline.  Hospital waiting lists would be slashed.  Accident and emergency departments would become far less busy.  Overall, there would be much less spending on health.  There would be decreased violence, domestic violence, rape and unplanned pregnancy.  There would be fewer murders and road deaths, as well as foetal abnormalities.  There would be far more discretionary spending available to families to spend on their children&rsquo;s clothes, education, food, etc.  Suicide rates would also go down.<br />I have been accused of having a somewhat inconsistent approach to the various substances with which we have a problem in our country.  The inconsistency stems from the fact I do not believe there is a one-size-fits-all approach to all of the different problems with which we need to deal.  Tobacco is an absolutely special case which we need to eradicate.  We need the tobacco companies to be put out of business and that those who sell it to understand they are participating in an international conspiracy to deal death to young addicts.  That means everyone from the mom-and-pop shop on the street corner to the garage must realise they are part of that deal.  Tobacco is a special case.<br />Taken to its extreme, people say that if one wants to eliminate tobacco so much, why not limit junk food.  Junk food is, <i>per se</i>, not bad for one; excessive consumption is.  If a demented philanthropist sent containers of McDonald&rsquo;s Big Macs and fries to a Darfur refugee camp, he would save lives.  It is the excess use of such foods is the problem.<br />Alcohol falls in the middle.  There is no doubt that it should be society&rsquo;s goal to greatly decrease alcohol consumption to 1960 levels and deal with the minority who have tremendous alcohol problems.  Taxation affects behaviour.  We do it all the time through forms of social engineering trying to persuade people to have smaller cars, opt for diesel engines, not to smoke cigarettes.  It is justifiable for us to adopt a similar approach to alcohol consumption.<br />I will be supporting Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s innovative Bill.  It looks at two great social problems in this country, attempting to use revenues from one to reduce the other but, in the process, will actually reduce both.  In the unlikely event that we get to debate this Bill on Committee Stage, I will propose some amendments.  For one, I do not buy into this theory that alcohol purchased in a shop or garage forecourt is somehow more dangerous than that purchased in a pub.  Different people can abuse alcohol in different ways.  If we are going to deal with the problem of alcohol abuse in this fashion, we need to deal with it consistently across different sectors.<br />I commend Senator MacSharry and his hardworking team for introducing another health care Bill for which he deserves great credit.</p></speech>

We will not be supporting the Bill for several reasons, however.  In doing so, I do not want to be seen as being at odds with Senator MacSharry.  I commend him on his good and useful report on suicide for his party.</p><p>Section 2 provides for the Minister to make regulations that allow for a levy at point-of-sale, payable by the licensee and to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is accepted there is a significant correlation between alcohol consumption and suicide.  In the early part of this century, rates of alcohol consumption were high and suicide rates were correspondingly high.  From 2007, consumption levels dropped with a parallel drop in suicide rates.  However, new evidence shows the rate of suicide is again creeping upwards.  When we debated this at the health committee when I published a report on suicide, the Central Statistics Office did not really agree with me on it.  The point is that whatever position one takes to start will determine whether it is increasing or decreasing.  If we say the rate of suicide is increasing and start from 1960, it can certainly be shown to be the case.  The real point is not to get involved in an argument about the process, as there are other dynamics at work, for example, the recession.  The National Suicide Research Foundation has recently published figures which showed between 305 and 560 extra deaths by suicide in the past five years may have been caused by the recession.</p><p>Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s Bill wants to get a little beyond revenue-raising.  We need to examine this with regard to the proposed minimum-pricing legislation for alcohol.  We need to be cognisant of the effects of one on the other to ensure that one does not negate the effect of the other to such an extent as to make both meaningless.  That is the single reason I will not support this Bill.</p><p>As a Government spokesperson on health, I am expected to state the great job we are doing with mental health services.  I got a briefing note earlier today to say exactly that.  However, I will not because I do not believe we are making a good job of mental health services at all.  We are very poor at policy, expecting to feed in policy at the top and find it oven-ready at the bottom without mediating steps in between.  Our ten-year policy on suicide prevention, Reach Out, will expire this year with having had no interim reviews to analyse changing circumstances over a decade.</p> <p>I refer to the 560 extra deaths that occurred in the past five years, a period halfway through the Reach Out policy, which did not take into account changed circumstances.  It is not good enough for us to stand here and say that we are doing a good job with mental health services when we are not.  Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to geographical areas where there are serious problems in the mental health services, including Galway, north Dublin, Kerry, Carlow and Kilkenny.  I have been a psychiatric nurse for 28 years and was a trade union representative for much of that time.  Many of my former colleagues phone me in exasperation at the state of the health services.  We cannot say we are doing a good job.  Ninety young people were admitted to adult psychiatric wards last year, which is unacceptable.</p><p>The recently published report by the Mental Health Commission contains nine fairly damning charges against our policy.  These reports are written by civil servants who couch their language in a particular way.  The report says that policies are implemented inconsistently and that there are shortfalls in filling posts, notwithstanding the money that has been allocated to it.  There are nine criticisms of the Minister of State in the report of the chairman of the Mental Health Commission, and we must sit down and reflect on it as a Government.</p><p>The Bill proposed by Senator Marc MacSharry is welcome and needs discussion.  Even though we will not support the Bill, I urge the Senator to send the proposals and his policy to the National Office for Suicide Prevention for consideration in the new suicide prevention framework later this year.  I have confidence that the National Office for Suicide Prevention will produce a comprehensive policy for reducing suicide.  I have much more to say about this but, as indicated by the Leader, we will have a further debate in September and I look forward to making a contribution at that point.</p></speech>

It is an innovative and welcome initiative.  He launched his policy last year and this is a positive step to see what we can do.</p><p>I acknowledge the great work of organisations such as Headstrong and the Jigsaw initiative.  Others include D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, whose 200 delegates discussed mental health last year.  I had the pleasure of attending part of the meeting as one of the link people with the Oireachtas.  They discussed mental health, bullying, peer pressure, sex education, drug and alcohol abuse and social isolation.  These issues are all interlinked and they decided to have a gathering on mental health.</p><p>I also acknowledge the work of SpunOut, particularly the Ditch the Monkey series of five videos by the Irish animator Eoin Duffy and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  It outlines the five steps to wellness and is a set of evidence-based actions that promote positive mental health by encouraging people to choose to get out in the world, to connect, to contribute, to be healthy, to accept themselves and to be aware so that they can stay on the path to wellness.  On that point, most of the people I have had discussions with in this arena have cautioned me about overusing the term &quot;suicide&quot; instead of having a broader discussion about mental health and wellness.  In my volunteer life, I am doing a series of consultations with young people in the Irish Girl Guides.  I was in Macroom on Saturday and the young people were talking about trends, the pressure on them from trends and how their physical health is so connected to mental health.  We need to build up self-esteem that protects us, mental health and mental wellness.  Anything we can do to ensure this should be welcome.</p><p>I have a specific issue to raise with Senator MacSharry, which makes me hesitate to support the Bill.  Looking at the legislation, I fear it may breach EU law.  Any proposed levy on off-licence sales would be in breach of the EU excise directive concerning the general arrangements for excise duty.  Council Directive 92/83/EEC provides for the taxation of alcohol on the basis of volume and content and breaks alcohol into specific excise duty categories for various alcoholic drinks.  These rates are applied to all alcohol, making no distinction between on-trade and off-trade.  I have no doubt that Senator MacSharry has looked at this.  I support an increase in the pricing of alcohol, so this is an issue I have looked at, but we cannot do it only for the off-trade.  Applying a levy appears to be in breach.  Applying a levy to a container in which alcohol is sold while not applying the same tax rates to the on-trade does not satisfy the provisions of the directive.  It would affect competition.  I would welcome if Senator MacSharry could give me advice on that provision in the Bill.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;bhar an-tromch&uacute;iseach agus an-t&aacute;bhachtach &aacute; phl&eacute; againn.  Aithn&iacute;m go bhfuil br&iacute; an Bhille at&aacute; &aacute; chur chun cinn ag an Seanad&oacute;ir MacSharry t&aacute;bhachtach agus go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht seo &aacute; moladh aige le toil mhaith.  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; beaga againn leis, &aacute;fach.</p><p>We acknowledge the good intentions of the Bill presented by Senator MacSharry, focused as it is on the need to enhance resources for mental health services and suicide prevention.  In the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in has a comprehensive Private Member's motion that seeks progress in the development of mental health services and suicide prevention.  This is particularly the case with regard to increased staffing, which is seriously deficient at present.  The motion has secured all-party support, a welcome development.</p><p>However, with regard to this Bill, we do not favour the central proposal.  Funding for mental health services and suicide prevention should be allocated directly from the health budget and should not be dependent on the sale of alcohol, no more than funding for primary care or physiotherapy or any other aspect of health care should be so dependent.  I acknowledge that we must address the issue of below-cost selling of alcohol as a matter of urgency.  The position of Sinn F&eacute;in is that it should be banned and we favour increased taxation of alcohol.  If a portion of this is to be ring-fenced, it should be devoted to awareness raising and education on the dangers of alcohol, directed especially at young people.  On the Sinn F&eacute;in D&aacute;il motion in the Chamber, Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed to the report of the Mental Health Commission published two weeks ago, which makes alarming findings.  The report of the Mental Health Commission shows that only 44% of psychiatric hospitals and mental health facilities are compliant with staffing level regulations.  The report also makes clear that since 2007, staffing in mental health services has been reduced by the implementation of recruitment embargoes and the employment moratorium.  Such policies are endangering the delivery of competent and responsive community-based services, as envisaged in A Vision for Change, the Government's mental health strategy.  It is of huge concern that the commission reports that children are being admitted to adult units.  Some 91 admissions, representing 22.3% of all child admissions, were made in 2013.</p><p>Suicide is a complex issue that demands a national, cross-departmental co-ordinated response.  There are many risk factors for suicide.  A 2008 review of the evidence suggests that living in an area of socioeconomic disadvantage and being unemployed are risk factors, as is having a diagnosis of a mental disorder, including depression, schizophrenia, personality disorder or a childhood disorder, which can increase the risk of contemplating suicide.  Misuse of alcohol and drugs is a known risk factor, as is having previously self-harmed.  Adolescents who have experienced sexual abuse are at high risk.  In general, the national suicide prevention framework will require a cross-departmental response and it is vital that Departments outside the Department of Health, particularly the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, are involved in developing the actions under the framework.</p><p>A key priority for suicide prevention is the development of an adequate 24-7 crisis support service for people experiencing severe mental or emotional distress.  A Vision for Change states that a protocol for crisis intervention should be agreed upon for each area by the local community mental health team and that the agreed response should be available 24-7.  The policy also recommends that each mental health service area should have the facility of a crisis house that offers brief respite to those suffering a crisis where hospital admission is not appropriate.</p> <p>The HSE should ensure that 24-hour, seven-day crisis intervention is available in every mental health service as a matter of urgency.  It is also important that such 24-7 crisis services are culturally competent so that they are accessible to people from minority ethnic communities, including the Traveller community.  Finally, it is important that there is an effective 24-7 crisis service available to people who are homeless.  There is a need for all sectors and groups working in the area of suicide prevention to share resources and work together more effectively and efficiently.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention also needs to co-ordinate its funded programmes towards agreed strategic priorities and ensure the programmes are funded to a level that can meet identified population risks and needs.  For example, initiatives should be available throughout the country and targeted at higher-risk groups.  The suicide prevention framework should prioritise marginalised groups, all of whom have a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties.  It should also prioritise children and young people, given the clear evidence that early intervention is cost-effective.  The framework should incorporate clear commitments from the Department of Education and Skills and the Child and Family Agency on mainstreaming mental health promotion within schools.  The HSE should ensure that all community mental health teams provide a 24-7 crisis intervention service as recommended in A Vision for Change.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion in the D&aacute;il this week seeks to refocus the Oireachtas and public opinion on mental health and suicide prevention and the need to implement A Vision for Change by ensuring sufficient resources and firm political commitment.  We are seeking all-party support for our comprehensive motion.</p><p>I note that Senators on both sides of the House are critical of Government implementation of policy at present.  I remind Senators that we will be debating budgetary issues in the autumn.  I hope they will show the same resolve when we are discussing the budget for mental health when the time comes.  Proper funding should be put in place to roll out the services we have called for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200040#OO00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, back to the House this evening.  I commend my colleague Senator MacSharry on the spirit of the Bill and the intention behind it.  The Bill as proposed is not in accordance with Council Directive 92/83/EEC, which deals with alcohol taxation and taxes on related products that are applied in respect of their nature and strength.  The Bill seeks to introduce a levy on alcohol products from take-away facilities, which would represent a clear violation.  I commend the spirit of the Bill but cannot support it for these reasons.</p><p>I agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has made every effort to provide better mental health services throughout the country in the past three years under limited and difficult circumstances.  It is important to highlight this aspect when we debate the matter.</p><p>Health, especially mental health, can be a contentious topic not only in this House but in many forums.  I have stated previously that it is important that we as public representatives reach out to the groups and members in our local communities to continue the campaign to erase the stigma around mental health.  In Dundalk, along with service providers and representatives from the town, we created the Dundalk positive mental health forum, which facilitates discussions and events for the public on a regular basis.  We meet to discuss the mental health issues in our community.  At the start of this year we got great support from our local radio station, Dundalk FM, which allocates a one-hour slot once a month to discuss positive mental health issues.  It is very good because we need to bring this out into the community and do all we can to reduce the stigma.  I am aware of many excellent groups and individuals throughout the country who engage with their local communities in a variety of innovative and necessary ways, and they have made a very real impact.  However, as we are all aware, the mental health services are not up to par.  I say this with the utmost respect for the Minister of State, but the truth is the truth.  We have children who are being completely left out of the picture because they are in an age bracket in which they are too close to adulthood but not close enough.  There is a major problem for children between 16 and 18 years of age who are not being looked after.  The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services programme seems to stop at 16 years of age.  The services maintain that they take children of that age, but I can talk about umpteen cases in which people are not being seen.  In an Adjournment debate some months ago I raised the particular case of a child with an intellectual disability who could not be seen because he fell within that age group.  Every child matters and every child should be afforded the same level of support when it comes to their mental heath, whether the child is one year old or 17 years old.  It is most unfortunate that children with an intellectual disability, particularly in that age group, do not have access to the support services available.  We need to ensure that we look after these children as best we can at the earliest possible age so that they can have the best start possible before the additional weight of adulthood is placed on them.</p><p>I can confirm that in my area in County Louth no child psychiatrist is available for children with an intellectual disability in the age bracket from 16 to 18 years.  This is something I have brought up continually.  CAMHS will not see children in this age bracket.  This means that for two years the service fails this group of children.  They must wait until they are 18 years of age to receive the supports they deserve.  Furthermore, once a child reaches the age of 16 years, the paediatric services stop.  Again, the child is lost for two full years.</p><p>Whether a child has an intellectual disability does not matter.  People do not seem to understand that we have a major problem in this area.  I realise the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is not in the House but, as a fellow Louth man, I call on the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to take this matter further.</p><p>Last week saw the publication of the Mental Health Commission's annual report, which detailed the good and, unfortunately, the unacceptable aspects of our mental health services, particularly with regard to children.  Last year there were 408 child admissions, 91 of which were admissions to adult units.  I adverted to this point in my maiden speech in the House when I said I was keen for change so that children with mental health difficulties would not be placed in adult units.  I for one am very sorry that three years later we still have children being placed in adult units.  Only 31 of the 91 admissions were admitted to child and adolescent units.  Again, a total of 68% of these admissions refer to children in the 16-to-17 age bracket.  It is the same problem.  We are failing these children.  I can categorically state that children in this group and their families leave the care of paediatricians and are then lost to the system for two full years.  At that stage, we have an entirely different set of problems when those children are admitted back into the system.</p><p>The question of what happens while they are in care is important.  I have visited some institutions where I have witnessed a lack of consistency in treatment.  After a patient is discharged, one week she might see one doctor and the next week she might see a completely different doctor who is in place to deliver the same function as the previous doctor.  I am not a mental health expert but anyone who knows anything about trying to deal with people with mental health problems, as far as I am aware, knows that consistency is vital and key to improving their health.  Consistency and trust are vital in providing mental health services, not least for all our children.  The report also highlighted that less than half of the services met the standards for therapeutic services and programmes, that staffing only reached a level of 44% and, more worryingly, only 60% of services provided individualised care plans.</p><p>The Bill seeks to raise funds through the levy to enhance the functions of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  Funding for this office has increased since the Government took office from a level of &euro;4 million to &euro;8.8 million.  Since its establishment in 2005, the office has made strides in terms of the national strategy document Reach Out.  The overall mental health services budget for the year stands at approximately &euro;766 million.  I recognise that every cent is utilised, although perhaps not as effectively or efficiently as we would wish.  It is our job as legislators to see a better return and better provision for our euro.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE have begun work on the new strategy for suicide prevention managed by the NOSP, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  I eagerly await the publication of this strategy and hope that this will provide a better overall strategy for a problem that has been locked away for too long.  I have many problems with the mental health services in our country.</p><p>Finally, I wish to raise an issue I have raised previously during the past three years, that is, the case of those who have been on antidepressants for a considerable period and who are likely to continue on such medication.</p> <p>I am aware that another conversation is taking place about the pros and cons of antidepressants.  However, there is a serious need to consider making long-term illness cards available to those who have been informed that they will be obliged to take medication for life in order that they might retain their equilibrium.  Medication required to maintain one's medical health is just as important as that required to maintain one's physical health.  We cannot draw distinctions on these matters any longer.  I understand the difficulties and hope to discuss the matter further with the Minister.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the need for road safety.  While some of the television advertisements relating to that matter in recent years have been extremely upsetting, we must consider how an entire culture has been changed.  It is for this reason I commend Senator Marc MacSharry.  We cannot discuss the matter to which the Bill relates enough.  In 2011 &euro;50 million was allocated for road safety measures.  In the same year &euro;8.8 million was allocated to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  That is quite a difference.  The number of deaths by suicide is practically double that caused by road accidents.  I am not in any way trying to say the budget for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport should be cut.  I am merely making the point.</p><p>We must continue to do everything in our power to help to create a country in which citizens can feel that, as a result of their sadness and emotional and other difficulties, talking to other human beings is an easy and healthy step to take.  The prevention of suicide is not the exclusive responsibility of any one sector of society.  The media, families, educators, health providers and the HSE, workplaces and employers, schools and colleges, doctors and primary care providers, the Irish Prison Service, social clubs, the church, the Garda, youth organisations, legislators and those who decide how taxpayers' valuable money is spent all have a responsibility to prevent suicide which is a silent killer.  It is welcome that Senator Marc MacSharry has made provision in the Bill for alcohol, particularly as it is one of the main reasons young people are taking their lives.</p><p>Younger people are suffering more mental health problems than their predecessors.  I accept that poverty, inadequate education and unemployment may be factors in this regard and that their lives are filled with hopelessness and that there is a lack of purpose and a family history of suicide.  In that context, alcohol abuse is a problem with which we are not dealing.  We pay lip service to the subject, but Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward this Bill in order to try to actually do something about it.  Two previous speakers referred to a particular EU law which might act as a roadblock, but let us try to find a way to circumvent it.  I really want to support the Bill and was extremely saddened to discover the existence of this EU law, with which we must concur.  It is welcome that Diageo has removed Arthur's day from the calendar.  It was another occasion on which young people could get absolutely plastered.  When they woke up the following morning, they were left with a hangover and feelings of low self-esteem and nothingness.  According to the World Health Organization, the risk of suicide among young people who drink is eight times the norm.  Some 40% of self-harm cases arise as a result of alcohol abuse.</p><p>There is a need for the Government to introduce legislation to combat cyberbullying because it is having a major impact on young people's mental health and self-esteem.  They are being targeted by silent bullies who can get at them through social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, Viber and Snapchat.  These are the ones about which I know because I have a 14 year old but there are lots more.  Older people are also committing suicide as a result of poverty, social isolation, depression, poor quality housing and physical health problems.</p><p>We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of the people and volunteers who have established charities and other organisations and are working endlessly to combat the problem of suicide throughout the country.  I do not wish to criticise any of these amazing people, most of whom had loved ones who committed suicide, but there are 500 suicide charities.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention supports approximately 20 of the charities in question.  Most of the 500 charities to which I refer are not regulated and an audit has not been carried out of them.  They are spread throughout the country and no one has joined the dots.  A large number of people have made a massive effort in this area.  However, there is a need for someone to come up with a way to bring all of the various charities to which I refer together, garner the energy of those involved and provide them with more funding.  There is also a need to create synergies and introduce proper auditing, particularly in respect of counsellors.  In that context, there are many unregulated counsellors.</p><p>There is a need for the media to act responsibly in this matter.  In addition, we must seek to educate people because what we really want to encourage is suicide prevention.  I employ 160 people at my company and realised earlier today that I had never put in place a mental health programme.  We all know the cost which accrues to the economy as a result of people being obliged to be absent from their place of employment as a result of work-related stress.  However, it must be recognised that people in certain workplaces are being bullied.  I encourage all employers to conduct seminars and education and well-being sessions for their employees in order that they might feel better and recognise the signs of mental distress among their work mates which might lead to their contemplating suicide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200041#PP00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I congratulate Senator Marc MacSharry on the work he has done in drafting the Bill which deals with a very important issue.  Anything we can do to prevent people from committing suicide is absolutely vital.  I support the provision under which it is proposed to raise &euro;200 million in funding for the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  Like previous speakers, I am of the view that EU competition law must be imposed both in pubs and off-licences and that there are decisions of the court which apply in this regard.<br />We must recognise that the rate of alcohol consumption is falling.  The younger generation is much more responsible than that of which I am a member when it comes, for example, to drink driving.  There has been a massive reduction in the number of road fatalities caused by drink driving.  The next reduction will result from vehicle adaptation.  For example, Matthews bus company in the Minister of State's constituency has installed alcohol locks on all its buses.  The installation of the relevant devices adds relatively little to the cost of buses and the devices could also be fitted to other vehicles.  It would also be possible to fit devices which monitor eye movements in order to detect when drivers are exhausted and which automatically stop the vehicle as a result.  We could do a great deal more in dealing with this matter and I have informed the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that we should participate in and promote the relevant programme.  Safer vehicles wll be the next stage in the process.<br />Members of the younger generation are much more responsible in their use of alcohol; consumption levels are falling and at least one pub closes every week.  We must engage in a wider discussion on the causes of suicide.  For example, we must ask whether alcohol caused someone to commit suicide or whether he or she took to it after the rest of his or her life had fallen apart.  We have been inclined, particularly in recent times, to place the blame on drink.  The <i>Economist Pocket World in Figures</i>states we drink substantially less than people in most other countries and shows that in 2009 the figure for alcoholic drink sales per head of population in Australia, which was first on the list, was 99.4 litres, while in Ireland which was 23rd on the list, the figure was 63.5 litres.  <br />There is literature which indicates that people who have three drinks are on a binge.</p> <p>We looked up &quot;binge&quot; in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>and one of the definitions was of a spree.  I do not think anyone would regard it as a shopping spree if he or she bought three items.  Some of this has developed a head of steam that is not often based on the research.  Other countries consume more, particularly in the Mediterranean countries where they have wine with meals.  It is part of their lives and they do not have the attitude of demonisation we do.  Having said that, if there is a need for funding for suicide prevention, Senator MacSharry's proposals to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are well worth supporting.  I will support them here today.  However, we need research on the causes of suicide but the budget, as Senator O'Brien said, is very small notwithstanding the increase from &euro;4 million to &euro;8 million.<br />Let us adopt a more comprehensive approach.  Whether people have stopped drinking in pubs and are taking it home is not germane to the issue.  In fact, one could argue that it is safer that they drink at home where they are not at large and all they can do is fall upstairs.  I have looked up the numbers from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reports and note that incidents of drunk and disorderly behaviour represent a small proportion of total crime.  Let us control and manage this and listen to what Senator MacSharry has said, but let us not get it out of proportion.<br />The proposals the Government is considering on minimum pricing will affect low-income people much more than the rest of us.  Do we want that kind of income distribution effect from Government policy?  It will not affect the &euro;100 bottle of champagne consumed in an exclusive club.  Why do we pick on people down the line by insisting that something the market wants to produce for &quot;X&quot; becomes &quot;2X&quot;?  The idea that any of the money should go to the drinks industry, which unsophisticated minimum pricing would lead to, is unacceptable.  It should all go to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and those others who are in charge of the national finances.<br />I commend Senator MacSharry.  We must address suicide and we need a more balanced approach to drink than has been common in the country in recent times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200042#QQ00200"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome and I thank him for being here.  I commend Senator MacSharry for doing a little bit more than talking about this issue.  He has put deep thought in, taken action and is working this through to budget costs.  I take it that he is saying the Bill if implemented would raise &euro;200 million per annum.  It is a lot of money and an interesting concept.</p><p>Usually, I agree with much of what Senator Barrett says, but this evening I will disagree with him regarding the links between alcohol and suicide having worked in health promotion for four to five years and as the mother of teenagers, which is real, hands-on experience.  My children have a whole cohort of friends in that age group.  I have also spoken to a psychiatrist who works in this area.  There is no doubt that there is a very strong correlation between alcohol and mental health incidents, alcohol and accidents and alcohol and suicide.  I take Senator Barrett's point that there needs to be more research into the causes of suicide, but the evidence I have seen is that alcohol is arguably the greatest contributor.  I may be wrong, but that is based on my conversations and observations.  The only answer here is a multi-pronged approach.  That is always the case; it is never just one approach.</p><p>We are looking at new habits in this country when it comes to alcohol.  I was surprised at the description of &quot;binge drinking&quot; as involving three or four drinks.  To be fair, anybody on a night out is bingeing based on that description.  However, my definition of &quot;bingeing&quot; is much more than that.  I am seeing so many young people bingeing before they go out.  It is common practice among my peers - the mothers of teenagers of 14 and 15 years - to check the ten or 12 children coming to dress in a house to see if anyone has alcohol on them.  We also check them leaving the house to see if there is alcohol on their breath.  This is happening in some of our homes.  These kids are going into well-supervised discos so they cannot have drink in their possession there.  However, they may have it on their breath.  They burn out very quickly once they have alcohol and need lots of water.  If they mix it with another substance, they are in real danger.  There are new habits around and I find that young people are drinking to get drunk, not just to enjoy themselves.  I was talking to a teenager recently.  She is 19 years old and has moved to Canada.  Having been there for four or five weeks, her feedback is &quot;My God, Ireland is so druggy&quot;.  We really binge here.  The feedback is different from what Senator Barrett was saying.</p><p>I also take issue with my good friend Senator Mary Ann O'Brien who said that when people wake up the following morning, it is with feelings of low self worth.  I disagree that they wake up with those feelings.  They wake up with sore heads but do not consider it a reason for their lower self-esteem, rather they consider it normal.  We have normalised alcohol into our culture to a great extent over the centuries, albeit we agree that there is a new type of binge drinking.</p><p>The following is something really dangerous.  We all know we should get our kids into sport, but now &quot;Get into sport&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Get into alcohol&quot;.  This is because drink provides the large advertising support for sporting events.  I favour breaking that link.  I would love if some of the fund in Senator MacSharry's Bill would go towards that.  Many of our children grow up and win and the celebration happens in the pub.  So much talent is wasted because the transition for the 16, 17 and 18 year old is into the pub.  In every town, there are pubs which specialise in serving the youth and are better for youth to frequent.</p><p>We must look at new ways to find out more about young people before they, sadly, take their lives.  I have been exploring this a little as it is a huge concern.  Approximately a month ago, there were seven suicides in one week in Galway.  There were two alone in Moycullen.  That was across a range of ages.  In a period of two months over the last three months, two friends of my 19 year old son took their lives.  This is visiting me and our families.  It is so common and it has really gone overboard.  One of the things I see in other communities is that wherever there is a river, there is a very significant risk.  We have the River Corrib in Galway.  I have seen in Cork there is a river watch, but it would take 1,000 people to man it.  One might have two people on a night, who have to be debriefed.  It is a huge amount of work.  We need real, practical help.  I spoke to someone who did a river watch and talked a girl down from taking her life but she was back three nights later to attempt suicide again.</p><p>Something we could promote is &quot;journaling&quot; at an anonymous level.  If there was a safe place where young people could document their feelings it would be useful.  We must learn more about them before they take their lives.</p> <p>I was looking at some evidence from New Zealand and Australia. </p></speech>

Contrary to what might have been said, we have wonderful child and adolescent mental health services in Galway which do great work with our kids up to the age of 18.  Unfortunately, services differ, and it is a pity about the lack of uniformity across the country.  I commend Senator MacSharry and wish him well.  I had not thought about whether I would support the Bill or not, but looking at what the Senator is trying to achieve, I will support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-07-02a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014070200043#RR00400"><p>I commend Senator MacSharry on his hard work and the commitment to this issue that he has shown over the past few years.  I welcome the discussion as I believe we need to spend more time in this House focusing on mental health strategies.  To be fair to the Government, it has shown its commitment to providing mental health services in a number of ways such as through the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the increased funding for suicide prevention in 2012 and 2013 and the increased funding for mental health services over the past three budgets.  If we take some time to focus on each of these, it is clear that it is a Government priority.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention has carried out substantial work on almost every recommendation of the national strategy for action on suicide prevention and funds more than 30 non-governmental organisations through agreed grant aid agreements.  The programme for Government has committed to ensuring that part of the ring-fenced funding provided for mental health will be used to implement Reach Out, which is the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.  This commitment is of great importance and one we need to ensure we adhere to.  The priorities of the Government are further demonstrated through the increased funding for suicide prevention, with the HSE allocating funding to the National Office for Suicide Prevention from its overall budget for mental health.  The budget has increased significantly from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;8.8 million in 2014.</p><p>I agree with the point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien about Arthur's day.  It is unfortunate that this has turned into a discussion on alcohol, but there are obviously significant links.  I do not always agree with Senator Healy Eames and I normally agree with Senator Barrett but I find myself agreeing with her and disagreeing with him for the most part on this issue.  Arthur's day was just another excuse for young people and indeed adults to drink.  There is much debate about how young people are doing this, that and the other when it comes to the misuse of alcohol but they do not learn their behaviours from the sky.  In the vast majority of cases, it is learned behaviour - granted, from their peers, but also from adults in their immediate families in many instances and in society.  </p><p>Senator Healy Eames said that the link between alcohol and suicide could not be underestimated.  My mother is a psychiatrist and she would definitely say there was a significant link.  This is not to say that alcohol is not a drug that is fine to use once consumption levels are reasonable.  I would disagree with Senator Barrett.  That is not what I see.  I do not know what those statistics are based on.  When I am out and about, I see young and older people behaving in a way that is off the charts.  It happens in other countries such as the US, the UK and Australia, particularly where Irish and English people congregate.  We have a dangerous relationship with alcohol and I do not believe the statistics.  If the statistics show anything, they show that people are not drinking in pubs, if one pub per week is closing.  That is unfortunate for business but it means that people are drinking at home.  I would disagree fundamentally with Senator Barrett on this point.  If people are drinking at home, it is totally uncontrolled.  There was a time in Ireland where the publican took an interest in the clients in the pub and would make sure they could not fall.  As Senator Gilroy said, at least if they are in a pub they are not in a forest drinking.  The availability of cheap alcohol is fuelling drinking in all sorts of environments and the pubs are the least of our worries when it comes to drinking.  I regret that I am speaking about alcohol all the time in a debate about suicide, but the link between the two cannot be overemphasised.  I raised the issue of water safety recently.  One in three deaths by drowning involved people who had been drinking alcohol.  We have a really serious problem across the board in Ireland that we need to face up to.  </p><p>The new strategic framework for suicide prevention will seek to build on the comprehensive work delivered under the current Reach Out strategy, which was devised in 2005.  The aim of the new strategy is to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide.  It is expected that this will come into place by the end of this year.  I hope the Government follows through on this.  Through these initiatives, it is clear that the Government is making consistent efforts and some progress, although I completely agree that more work needs to be done.  </p><p>The Bill is commendable for attempting to continue and sustain this work.  I agree with the revenue-raising side of the Bill, which would seek to tax off-licence trade.  This is something that the Government effectively intends to do via the introduction of minimum pricing of alcohol.  I have consistently called for this.  The intent of the Bill in seeking to bring about awareness and to ring-fence funding for mental health services is admirable.  I believe minimum unit pricing will go a long way to achieving the goals of Senator MacSharry's Bill.  Government progress on rolling out a holistic mental health strategy with increased funding that is not tethered to any particular revenue-raising initiative but is instead embedded as one of the core fundamentals of our budgetary strategy is the way to continue to pursue this.  I thank the Minister of State and commend Senator MacSharry on his work on this.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health is unable to be here and sends her apologies to the House.  Like physical health, mental health and well-being are relevant to everyone.  I know that Members are well acquainted with the complex and sensitive issues that arise when this subject is under discussion.  Senators and the Government share the same objective, which is to reduce the number of deaths by suicide.  We are fully committed to this aim but, of course, there are different ways of achieving and funding it.</p><p>The Bill proposes the introduction of a levy on all alcoholic beverages sold from but not intended for consumption on licensed premises to be paid into a specific fund for supporting suicide prevention.  While I appreciate the motivation behind this Bill, it is important to point out that issues around the misuse of alcohol are much broader than just suicide and that, therefore, any measures taken by Government must have regard to the many social and health harms caused by alcohol.  It is important to state that the Minister for Finance has responsibility for levying and collecting taxes and excise duties and that the Government has no plans to alter this arrangement.  The collection of an excise duty on alcohol which would be placed in a tightly defined fund would restrict the Government's ability to prioritise expenditure.  This would not be in keeping with the Government's approach to revenue collection and the process by which decisions are made as to the most appropriate use of the revenues raised.</p><p>This Bill seeks to limit the levy to alcohol products sold for consumption off premises.  As has already been mentioned, Directive 93/92/EEC, which governs the structure of alcohol taxation, requires taxes on alcohol products be applied by reference to the nature and strength of the product.  It does not allow for differentiation of rates according to where the product is sold or the type of packaging involved.  Accordingly, the introduction of a levy on take-away products only would not be possible, and we must recognise that fact here.</p> <p>This debate is very welcome in that it brings a focus on the damaging impact alcohol abuse has on mental health and the role alcohol plays in suicide and self-harm.  In 2012 the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group reported that alcohol was responsible for at least 88 deaths every month in 2008; is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals; is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm; and was a trigger in one third of domestic abuse cases and cost the health care system &euro;1.2 billion in 2007.  The devastating consequences that alcohol specifically has on mental health are startling.  Alcohol was a factor in 40% of all cases of self-harm in 2010.  Alcohol-related disorders accounted for one in ten first admissions to Irish psychiatric hospitals in 2011.  The WHO has estimated that the risk of suicide is eight times greater when a person is abusing alcohol and half of all those who took their own lives in Ireland had abused alcohol in the previous 12 months.</p><p>The Government is committed to tackling alcohol misuse and the widespread harm and pain it obviously causes.  Last year following a full consultation involving Ministers and Departments, a comprehensive and detailed package of measures was approved to address this problem.  It is the first time the misuse of alcohol has been addressed as a public health issue.  We understand that we need decisive and innovative actions.  The overall objective is to reduce the consumption of alcohol from 12 l of pure alcohol per person per year to 9.2 l, which is the OECD average, by 2020.  That is what these measures have been framed to address.  </p><p>The key measure is the drafting of a health orientated legislation on alcohol, the public health (alcohol) Bill.  This Bill will be drafted taken into account the recommendations of the national substance misuse group's report.  The Bill will provide for minimum unit pricing for retailing of alcohol products, regulation of marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship specifically to place on a statutory footing an existing voluntary code that governs sports sponsorship, separation of alcohol from other products in retail settings, enforcement powers for environmental health officers in relation to alcohol and health labelling of alcohol products.  The nature of the challenge we are addressing requires a significant public health response.  This public health (alcohol) Bill and the measures for which it will provide are proportionate to the scale of the problems we face as a society.  </p><p>I would like to inform the House of the work to date in regard to suicide prevention and mental health and outline the Government's approach to the development of an updated framework for suicide prevention over the coming years.  Our mental health and well-being is something we all have to nourish and cherish and in these very difficult economic times it is even more important than ever to do so.  Since Deputy Kathleen Lynch was appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for this area her priority has been to ensure that our mental health services are developed in such a way that we provide the best quality of care in whatever setting is needed whether that is in an inpatient setting in the community or in a person's own home.  We are fortunate in the mental health area that we have our strategy document, A Vision for Change, guiding us in the way we deliver our services.  This strategy is well recognised as being in line with best practice internationally.  It is evidence-based and realistic and it proposes a new model of service delivery which will be patient-centred, flexible and community-based.</p><p>The House will appreciate that the current economic environment presents a significant challenge for the health system generally in delivering and furthering services, however, it is being treated as a priority by this Government.  In line with our programme for Government commitments, &euro;90 million and some 1,100 additional posts have been provided since 2012 to develop community mental health teams and suicide prevention resources.  The budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, has also more than doubled from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;8.8 million in 2014.  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is obviously our key priority as well.  Policy is guided by the national strategy for the period 2005 to 2014, Reach Out, which has made a number of recommendations in relation to fast-track referrals to community-based mental health services, an effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, reducing stigma, promoting positive mental health and research.  The NOSP has primary responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Reach Out and has been tasked with co-ordinating suicide prevention efforts around the country as well as supporting agencies and individuals interested and active in suicide prevention.  It funds more than 30 non-governmental organisations to carry out an array of work in communities that promote positive mental health and work to reduce the incidence of suicide and self-harm.  This work is supported at a regional level by HSE resource officers for suicide prevention.  In 2014 the number of officers will increase from ten to 16.  The office has also developed a range of initiatives not just to support people who are suicidal but also their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.  </p><p>Work is also continuing to build the capacity of front-line service providers and communities to respond to suicide through the delivery of a wide-range of awareness and training programmes which are available in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  These include safeTALK which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reaching Out, ASIST, Taking Control, Mind Out and STOP.  A number of media awareness campaigns have also been run in recent years, including the Let Someone Know campaign, which focused specifically on young people and delivered a message that it is important to reach out and seek the support of others.  Other awareness programmes including the Please Talk initiative running in third level colleges since 2007 encourage young people experiencing problems to talk to others and identifies the supports available to those in need. </p><p>Mindful that schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and that they are all also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties, the NOSP has worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to develop guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention in post-primary schools. </p><p>Reach Out comes to the end of its ten-year term this year and, consequently, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has begun development of a new national strategic framework for suicide prevention, building on the comprehensive work delivered under the existing strategy.  The objective is to have the framework completed by the end of 2014.  This new framework will support other relevant Government policies, including A Vision for Change, Healthy Ireland and the National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The aim of the framework will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide while aiming for improved co-ordination, integration of services and responses in this area.  The process of developing the framework includes consideration of national and international evidence and existing good practice, addressing areas such as policy, practice improvement, engagement, research, communications and media.  The process also includes a review of Reach Out, a public consultation process and a review of the evidence base for suicide prevention initiatives.  This strategy will be focused on a whole of government approach and will include engagement with other Departments, including the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  A number of new suicide prevention measures have also commenced or will commence shortly.  These include increased training for GPs and practice staff, the development of the suicide crisis assessment nurse model which allows for crisis intervention at primary care level.  Eight new services will commence before the year end.  This service provides active liaison between primary care and mental health services; the role out of dialectical behaviour therapy, specialist therapeutic services for people who have a history of deliberate self-harm and who have certain personality profiles; a community resilience fund has been established to support local HSE suicide prevention initiatives; and the launch earlier this year of the Samaritans national free to call 24-7 number for people in emotional distress.  Another worthwhile initiative is the new counselling in primary care initiative.  Funding of &euro;7.5 million has been provided from the ring-fenced moneys for mental health for the development of psychological and counselling support services in primary care. </p> <p>This service is specifically for persons with mild to moderate psychological difficulties who are eligible under the GMS scheme.  This initiative, together with the continued development of adult, child and adolescent community mental health teams, will help to provide services in the community where they are most needed.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity afforded by the House to debate these critical matters, in which we are all engaged, in order to address the complex societal issues associated with suicide.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to the mental health service and the continued development of modern and responsive person-centered services in line with the plans set out in A Vision for Change.  I acknowledge the contributions made by all Senators involved in the debate which will certainly inform Government policy.  I also acknowledge the commitment, thought and effort that has gone into presenting the issue in the House.  The contributions from all sides have increased our knowledge of how best to deal with it.</p></speech>

I want to briefly run through some of the initiatives this plan would have financed.  They include reform and restructuring of the National Office for Suicide Prevention as an independent office with special status; a ring-fenced budget; performance targets; and an independent employment system in order that it would be free to obtain the required expertise.  There would also be a clear interdepartmental input at Government and Secretary General level but not within the bowels of the HSE.  It would enhance the size of the office in order that it would have the appropriate staff, as well as a 24 hour helpline.  In addition, the number of resource officers would be increased from ten to 60, which is what is required.  </p><p>All GPs would be adequately resourced.  Our survey showed that an incredible number of GPs felt ill-equipped to deal with the suicide crisis.  A system of GP practices would be put in place, whereby the prescription of anti-depressant drugs would be checked on a monthly basis, rather than every three to six months.</p><p>An out-of-hours social worker emergency service would be established across the country.  Such services are not currently available.  </p><p>The plan would reverse the Government's decision to abolish dedicated guidance counsellors' time allocations in secondary schools, while introducing guidance counsellors in primary schools.  That is not about careers but about the availability of counselling and pastoral services, whereby somebody could tap into these teachers as a pastoral resource under the cover of seeking career advice.  Mr. Brian Mooney, a commentator and career guidance professional, has said expecting teachers to deal with children's mental health issues daily was akin to expecting passing motorists, instead of paramedics, to deal with road casualties.  </p><p>The plan would regulate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist by mandatory registration, as well as phasing out advertising and sponsorship of events by alcohol brands.  It would consider alcohol and substance abuse a form of self-harm to be treated accordingly.  Funding would be increased dramatically for projects aimed at preventing suicide rates from increasing in all sections of society but particularly in high risk groups.  Banks would be compelled to provide professional counselling for those at risk of foreclosure or who have already been subject to foreclosure.  </p><p>All forms of media should be requested to embrace a new approach to the coverage of mental health issues.  In fairness, some of this has been happening in terms of the commentary on this difficult issue.  This document contains a lot more detail and is available to anybody at any stage.</p><p>Our legal advice leads us to believe the EU directive on the structure of alcohol taxation can be tested.  In my introductory remarks I said some people would raise this issue and they have.  There is a precedent in the case of betting tax.  How did we manage to facilitate gamblers on a racecourse but not in a betting shop?  As we managed to do this in the past, why can we not do it to save lives?  If the Bill were to be accepted on Second Stage, on Committee Stage we could examine the potential of an amendment to the Rates Bill or amend existing excise duties.  In that way we could ring-fence moneys within the licensed sector, including pubs, and put it directly into the fund.  That would create equality.  </p><p>We have heard much rhetoric about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I would like to provide a few facts.  It refers to minimum unit pricing, which the authorities in Scotland tried to introduce.  The Scottish Whisky Association appealed the deicison to the Scottish Supreme Court which, in turn, referred it to the European Court of Justice, where nothing will happen for two years.  God knows who will be in government when we get to bring forward that Bill, if we have to wait for that decision.</p><p>Structured separation will not happen, although we are waiting for the Minister for Justice and Equality to bring forward her proposed consultation paper.  It is a proposal to bury alcohol at the back of a shop instead of stuffing it at the front beside the sweets where at present one can buy a case of premium larger for &euro;10.  </p><p>I do not want to focus too much on the alcohol abuse issue in this debate which is about providing for measures to deal with a difficult societal issue.  It is not to beat those who sell alcohol over the head necessarily, although the link with mental health issues is widely accepted.  That is a fact.  Nothing will happen on minimum unit pricing and nothing will be done to increase funds for the Minister of State.  I have mentioned some of the things that can and need to be done.  We have learned from our Scottish cousins that if we were to implement some of the measures I have outlined and finance them appropriately, the professionals would be able to begin to peel back the blindfold on the loss of life through suicide.  If so, we can win this battle.  We could reduce suicide levels by 30% in ten years, but we will not do so.  I do not want the Minister of State to be personally upset, but I have heard this speech for 12 years on how well the Government is doing.  According to it, we are all brilliant at writing down what needs to be done but not in doing it.  I sat on the Government benches and cringed as Government amendments were tabled commending our brilliance in spin and incoherence, instead of highlighting our neglect and inability to show the leadership and political will to do what was necessary.  There are challenges within the Bill, but it offers an innovative solution at a time when there is no money available.  The EU directive is a red herring.  It can and ought to be tested in the interests of saving lives.  As we have done it before for others, why can we not do it when it is to save lives?  Sadly, in the coming week ten more lives will be lost through suicide, eight of them men.  I am bound to say our ambivalence is damning.</p></speech>

We both know that elements of this Adjournment motion were discussed at a committee meeting last week, but that is purely coincidental.  I was not even aware of the committee's wide-ranging discussion until I read about it the following day.  I was prompted to table this motion by one or two instances of parents attempting to adopt children but being caught in the limbo that has seemingly existed since the ratification of the Hague convention.  It has been suggested that the convention, which was supposed to clear the way for adoptions, is actually a major obstacle.<br />National newspapers have published articles on this issue in recent months, one of which I will quote from in a moment to support the case calling for statements or observations from the Department concerning all that has been happening - or, more accurately, not been happening - since the convention's ratification in 2010.  The heading of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>reads: &quot;Changes to adoption law have shattered my hopes of becoming a parent.&quot;  The lady in question referred to the life-changing days in her life, for example, 1 November 2010, when &quot;the Republic finally enacted the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption&quot;.  She stated: &quot;There is very little domestic adoption here now.&quot;  She continued:<blockquote>Before November 2010, government agreements meant the principal countries from which Irish people could adopt children were Russia, Ethiopia and Vietnam - known, in bureaucratic jargon, as the Republic's &quot;sending countries&quot;.  Russia and Ethiopia do not comply with the convention, so they are no longer options for anyone with a declaration issued after November 2010, a &quot;post-Hague declaration&quot;.  Those countries are also now closed to people who adopted from them with pre-Hague declarations and had hoped to return to adopt another child.  Lobby groups have been established for both Russia and Ethiopia, seeking bilateral agreements with the Republic, but so far they have had no success.<br />Bulgaria complies with the convention, and a number of Irish people have sent their applications there, but since 2010 just one Bulgarian child has been adopted from Ireland by parents with a post-Hague declaration.  Nobody could call that an encouraging statistic....<br />There have been other intercountry adoptions here since the enactment of the Hague convention.  They continued until last year for people whose declarations were issued before November 2010, as the declarations were valid for three years.  There were 446 such adoptions between 2011 and 2013.<br />But there has been a stark change since the convention was ratified.  Only 11 children have been adopted by people with post-Hague declarations: two in 2011, six in 2012, three in 2013.  There have been no post-Hague adoptions so far this year.  It is hard not to conclude that intercountry adoption has all but stopped here.</blockquote>This issue is at the core of my question.  What has happened?  There seems to be a great deal of below-the-radar criticism of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and its practices, for example, referring people to a third party agency called Arc Adoption that costs prospective adopters between &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000 even though many cannot afford anything of that nature.  I have read that going to Bulgaria personally to pursue an adoption costs &euro;5,000.  The authority's chairman has endorsed Arc Adoption, but questions have been raised by sources close to the authority about its credibility in this matter.<br />Serious questions must be addressed.  At the committee meeting, the various agencies associated with adoptions raised similar issues with the changes to the legislation.  I am sure that, by this stage, the Minister has been well briefed on the issues and I would be grateful for his response.</p></speech>

In the course of the few moments available to me, I will inform the Seanad of how the landscape has changed in respect of inter-country adoptions and provide a better picture of what inter-country adoption might look like in the future.</p><p>The decrease in the number of inter-country adoptions worldwide in the past decade has been substantial.  The total number of children adopted into the top 12 receiving states in 2004 was greater than 43,000.  By 2011, however, this number had decreased by almost 50%.  One of the major catalysts for the changed landscape of inter-country adoption has been the worldwide implementation and adherence to the principles of the Hague convention on adoption, which has been central to the development of inter-country adoption worldwide and to ensuring that the core values of inter-country adoption are those that protect children.  When we recall some of the practices of the past in our own country, for example, informal adoptions, we can appreciate the need for strong legislation and an international child-centred approach to adoption.  It allows for a transparency in the inter-country adoption process that, in the long run, protects all involved, most especially the child.</p><p>Economic and social change in those countries that have traditionally been sending countries for inter-country adoption has also had an impact.  Children are being adopted domestically, not only because the convention's principles demand it, but because the economic circumstances of developing Third World economies enable domestic adoptions.  This has led to a change in the age and needs of children in need of adoption.  If the core Hague principles, such as informed and considered parental consent and subsidiarity in the adoption processes, are adhered to, the age and needs profile of children who become available for adoption will continue to change.</p><p>The issue of the adoption of children with additional needs, medical or age-related, or with needs related to the transition from long-term foster care is being given consideration in Ireland.</p> <p>The assessment of the needs of these children must be comprehensive and transparent if their needs are to be served effectively by the inter-country adoption process and met by the receiving country.  The needs of the older child may also present challenges.  To address such challenges, prospective adopters need guidance, advice and assistance before, during and after the adoption.  However, there is still a continued need for inter-country adoption.  While the principle of subsidiarity is vital, there are children throughout the world who would benefit from inter-country adoption.  The benefits are not just for the child and family concerned but also for the fabric of Irish society.  These children have a valuable contribution to make and it is imperative that the Hague Convention, in its operation, works to assist them in that process as much as it works to protect them.</p><p>My predecessor asked Dr. Shannon, in his capacity as chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, to review the implementation and operation of the Adoption Act 2010, which allows for implementation of the Hague Convention in Ireland.  I hope this review and my own consideration of the Act will allow us to address ways in which Irish legislation can fully adhere to the convention and the ways in which the Act can facilitate Hague Convention adoptions, while at the same time ensuring children in need of adoption can be placed in Ireland.  </p><p>As I said, the total number of adoptions into the top 12 receiving states fell by almost 50 % between 2004 and 2011.  The passing of the Adoption Act 2010 and Ireland's ratification of the Hague Convention have had similar implications for the number of inter-country adoptions in Ireland.  While we are part of a worldwide trend, we need to keep our procedures and process constantly under review in order to ensure we achieve the best outcomes possible for the children concerned.  I listened to what the Senator had to say and note, in particular, his remarks about countries such as Russia, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Bulgaria.  I have already met some of the groups involved and will remain in close contact with them.  I am sure the Senator will agree that adherence to best legal principles internationally and nationally is paramount in this regard.  I have taken on board his comments on the Adoption Authority of Ireland and will communicate with him at an early date about my intentions in that regard.</p></speech>

They are afraid that if they raise concerns, this will somehow inhibit their possible chances of adopting a child.  That is the reason I raise the issue.  There must be some questions raised about why it should cost so much money.  My understanding is the money must be paid up-front.  It seems that this is a financial burden too far.  </p><p>I am pleased that the Minister has made reference to the countries I mentioned because they are the ones in which Irish parents were previously successful in adopting pre the Hague Convention 2010.  Does he have a timeline for completion of the review and his consideration of its findings and the Act?  Obviously, time is ticking for the parents who have been in the system for so many years.</p></speech>

It is my intention to meet the Adoption Authority of Ireland during the next few weeks.  I will specifically address with it the issue of a timeframe for completion of the review.  </p><p>On the accredited agencies which the Senator has described as third parties, under international obligations, we must establish such agencies to assist in and facilitate the process.  The Senator's remarks on costs relate to one of these agencies.  There are costs involved and I accept the Senator's remarks on the scheduling of fees.  In the circumstances it is important that costs be kept to a minimum and that there be full transparency in the process.  I am sure the Senator will accept that there are costs involved. </p><p>I will arrange an early meeting with the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  I am conscious of the remarks made by the Senator which I will bring to the attention of the chairman of the authority.

This matter arises from written question No. 655 submitted on 31 January 2014 to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe by Mr. &Aacute;ngel Pintado, a Spanish MP, concerning late term abortions and the rights of newborns who survive late term abortions.  As stated by him, in a number of European countries which allow late term abortions it happens that foetuses often survive.  The Minister will recall that this issue was discussed in this Chamber last year.</p><p>News programmes and articles featuring interviews with health care workers reveal that it is not uncommon to find an aborted foetus with a beating heart and struggling to breathe.  For example, it was reported that in the United Kingdom that 66 babies aborted in a particular year had been left to die after the abortions had gone wrong.  In Sweden one such child lived autonomously for 90 minutes after the abortion and received no care before he died.  In Norway there is evidence to show that some of these newborns could have been viable if they had received the appropriate medical care.</p><p>The question put to the Committee of Ministers by Mr. Pintado was what specific steps it would take to guarantee that foetuses that survived abortions were not deprived the medical treatment to which they were entitled as human persons born alive according to the European Convention on Human Rights.  As a member state of the Council of Europe, Ireland must take a position on this question.  I respectfully ask the Minister what position the Government has taken or will take on this matter when it comes before the Council of Europe.  Having regard to the constitutional position in Ireland, in particular, I would have thought it behoved the Government to honour the spirit of the Constitution and defend the right to life of the unborn, particulaly in such cruel circumstances, and add its voice in defence of the right of the child to live.  Also, who, on behalf of the Government, will contribute to the elaboration of the reply of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe?</p></speech>

Therefore the legislation clearly requires that unborn human life must be saved, where this is possible, without compromising the right to life of the woman.  In cases of early induction, the neonate must receive the necessary care in accordance with clinical guidelines and best practice.  Our response will reflect this extremely clear position.</p><p>An initial reply was circulated in May and it was in line with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution and the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  A new draft reply, reflecting the views received by some delegations, was circulated by the secretariat for comments.  My officials have considered the revised draft and have submitted views on it to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  If there are no further amendments, the draft reply will be formally put to the Committee of Ministers for agreement on 9 July.  If consensus is not reached, consideration will likely be deferred until a later date.</p><p>As the House is aware, the Government's position on this matter is extremely clear.  Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution states: &quot;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its law to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&quot;  The written question was submitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe by a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  As such, it is for the Committee of Ministers' deputies, which comprises the permanent representatives of all Council of Europe member states, to agree a reply.  We will be advising our permanent representation in Strasbourg of our response through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and it will report back to the Committee of Ministers.</p></speech>

I understand from it that the thrust of the Irish Government's position will be in favour of protecting children in that situation and preserving their lives.  Will it be possible for us to access the brief from the Irish Government, both at the initial stage and also as the attempt to reach consensus is made?  Is it possible for the Minister to furnish us with the brief that will be given to our representative at the Council of Europe?</p></speech>

With regard to the Senator's question, I would have to consult the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before I would be in a position to revert to him.</p></speech>

The A5 and the Narrow Water Bridge projects are significant cross-Border infrastructural projects and are worthy of support on a number of fronts.</p><p>Last week, at the meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement representatives from both sides of the Border in the north west, comprising the A5 working group, appeared before the committee and called for a further push to deliver the A5 upgrade.  The project includes 86 km of dual carriageway from Aughnacloy in County Tyrone to Newbuildings outside Derry city.  As the committee chairman, Deputy Joe McHugh, stated, there is no doubt that the long-standing dearth of modern transport infrastructure in the north west is seriously hindering development and the relatively high unemployment and poverty rates can be directly attributable to this lack of connectivity.  Tight timelines are required to avoid any further slippages on the delivery of this critical piece of infrastructure.</p><p>With regard to the Narrow Water Bridge, unfortunately we ran out of time on the last occasion despite the great efforts of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  We must renew our efforts to provide this unique piece of infrastructure, which will do so much for tourism in the south Down and north Louth area, including in villages and towns such as Carlingford and Omeath, Warrenpoint, Kilkeel and Newcastle.  It has the support of people of all political opinions on both sides of the Border.  The last meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council stated that the council supports the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge.  I request that this be changed to &quot;is committed to the Narrow Water Bridge&quot; and that the council will agree to support a new funding application under INTERREG V.  Furthermore, the criteria for applications for INTERREG V funding will be drawn up between September and December.  Ireland, Scotland and the Northern Executive must ensure that the criteria are fit for the Narrow Water Bridge.</p></speech>

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants paid by the Minister's Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>The Minister has confirmed many times, through parliamentary questions and in other fora, the Government's disappointment that the Narrow Water Bridge tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial costs budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge.  Given the budgetary constraints that his Department is operating under, it could not take on full responsibility for the increased project cost and the significant risks involved in the project.  While the Minister was willing to consider assisting with the shortfall, this was explicitly contingent on significant contributions from other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  These commitments were not forthcoming within the timescale required for the INTERREG IV A programme.</p><p>The Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, then decided to withdraw its funding for the project and to reallocate the funding to other eligible projects in the transport sector to ensure that the EU funds were not lost, which was the intelligent thing to do.  The Minister looks forward to an announcement in conjunction with the SEUPB regarding the re-allocation of that EU funding to other transport projects on Friday morning.  As to the possibility of the Narrow Water bridge qualifying for funding under the next INTERREG V, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the lead Department liaising with the SEUPB regarding the INTERREG V funding process.  The Minister understands that the SEUPB has now published a draft operational programme for public comment with a set of funding priorities.</p><p>As regards the possibility of grant funding from the Department for the project, the Minister has confirmed that his Department is not in a position to grant aid the project as he does not have the scale of resources required when the priority must be road maintenance and restoration as against new projects.  No similar new road or bridge projects are going to construction anywhere in the State at present and some that are at a much more advanced stage than the Narrow Water Bridge have been stalled due to lack of finance.  However, the situation might change should there be a substantial increase in the Department's capital budget in the future.  The Minister's Department must work within the very constrained budget available to it.</p> <p> As the Senator will be aware, the Northern Ireland High Court decided in March 2013 that an appropriate assessment of the impact of the A5 scheme on the River Foyle and the River Finn, which are special areas of conservation under the habitats directive, was needed and consequently quashed the Minister for Regional Development's approval for construction of two road sections of the route.  Since that decision, the Northern Ireland authorities have been working on the preparation of the necessary environmental assessments and revised statutory orders and considerable progress has been made in getting the assessments and orders prepared and out for public consultation.  The outcome of the public consultation process will have to be considered and factored into the decision on the need for a new public inquiry next year.  The Government's comprehensive review of expenditure for the period 2015 to 2017 and the capital review for the period 2015 to 2019 have commenced.  Those involved in these reviews will consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the current tight fiscal climate, including the extent to which funding will be available for the maintenance and development of the road network.  The Minister cannot say at this point what will be the outcome of process relating to the comprehensive and capital reviews. He has. however, drawn the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure to the need to consider the position in respect of the A5.</p></speech>

I am pleased that it has been confirmed that the matter is expected to be discussed at the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on Friday, 4 July in Dublin Castle.  I expect that the support expressed at the previous meeting will be upgraded to a commitment.  I am pleased the Narrow Water bridge project remains in the mix for funding under INTERREG V.  As stated earlier, we must ensure that the bridge project can meet the criteria laid down.  People are aware of the Taoiseach's support for the project but very few are aware of the amount of support the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has given to it.  I am sure the Minister and his Department will continue to support it.</p><p>The project relating to the A5 is extremely important.  I note with interest that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has again drawn the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the need, in budgetary terms, to consider the position in respect of this project.  I hope that no new public inquiry will be needed next year.  We thought that such an inquiry might have been necessary in respect of the Narrow Water bridge project but that did not prove to be the case.  I hope that the position in respect of the A5 will be similar and that all of the relevant questions will be answered in a satisfactory fashion in order that the project might proceed on time.  I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.</p></speech>

The Minister understands that the SEUPB has now published a draft operational programme for public comment with a set of funding priorities.  I have no doubt the project will be discussed in the context of that process.  It was, as already stated, contemplated under INTERREG IV and there is no doubt that it could be possible for it to be considered under INTERREG V.</p><p>The Northern Ireland Office is working to deal with the environmental concerns relating to the A5 project.  The Senator and Deputy McHugh in the Lower House have consistently advocated this project.  I have no doubt that the issue of INTERREG V funding will be discussed at the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Dublin Castle.  The Government secured a considerable amount of funding under the programme for the period 2014 to 2020.  I have no doubt that the project in question will be considered in the context of the draft operational programme published by the SEUPB.</p></speech>
