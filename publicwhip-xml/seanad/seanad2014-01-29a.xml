While we afford a cautious welcome to the individuals that are involved and the move to appropriately and independently examine the case I refer Members to motions on the issue in both Houses, one in particular in the D&aacute;il, where the Minister proclaimed that one cannot change on the whim of a passing fashion.  Such was his view on the high voltage lines that are to be overground.  Clearly, we are operating in a two-tier Ireland where proximity to a Minister dictates approach to major capital projects; funding in the first instance and it seems, safety, in the second instance.  The new body is to examine Grid Link, which affects counties from Cork to Kildare and the Taoiseach's constituency of Mayo to Roscommon.  The people of Laois, Cavan, Monaghan and Meath can swing for it because their safety concerns do not apply to the Labour-Fine Gael Government in power.  One wonders whether it is because there is no Minister in those locations.  In any event, it commands and demands the attention of the Minister.  When he is finished explaining himself on Newstalk this morning he might come into one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely, the Seanad, to explain why that is the case.</p><p>A second and related point is that while welcoming this group and welcoming the intention to examine the matter, we have huge concerns on the lack of a health expert on it.  The eminent Catherine McGuinness is chairing it, the economist, Colm McCarthy, the economist, John FitzGerald, Professor Keith Bell, an expert in the specific area of technology, and others with expertise in architecture and landscape.  Who is going to advise on health?  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has written to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, highlighting health concerns on the issue, yet the chief medical officer has said it is not his responsibility to examine the impact of power lines.  We are somewhat in disarray as to the approach that must be taken on the issue.  First, all are equal in Ireland but some are more equal than others in the context of the lack of attention to the north east of the country.  Second, we are putting an expert group together to consider the aesthetic impact of the lines but there are no concerns about health.  That sounds foolish in the extreme.  It is almost as foolish as the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in December simply saying that one cannot change on the whim of a passing fashion.</p><p>Deputy McEntee in a contribution on local radio this morning was most concerned about the issue.  She appealed to Catherine McGuinness, the chair, to extend her remit to look at the north east.  Surely Deputy McEntee and Members of this House know that it is not the eminent former Supreme Court judge, Catherine McGuinness, who decides on the remit, it is the Minister?  Let the Government decide whether all the people of Ireland are equal and whether we are to deal with the issue in an appropriate fashion.  We will be pressing this to a vote.</p></speech>

I anticipate that the group will conduct its hearings in a thorough and comprehensive manner.</p><p>I wish to return to the judgment in the Louise O'Keeffe case by the European Court of Human Rights which both I and a number of colleagues referred to yesterday.  We should have a debate, not just on the ramifications of the judgment itself but on its ramifications for other cases.  I declare an interest as someone who has represented people in the past who sued national school managers and boards on the same basis as Louise O'Keeffe and whose actions were therefore affected by the outcome of her case.  There was a suggestion by her solicitor yesterday that the State should review its attitude or response to the applications made by applicants in similar cases.  That is entirely appropriate given the very different decision to which the European Court of Human Rights has come in comparison to the decisions in our domestic courts.</p><p>In that vein, could I also ask that we might similarly have a debate on measures the State has taken in recent years to safeguard children in schools against abuse?  We touched on the issue previously and we covered various aspects of it.  We have debated various items of legislation such as the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act but it would be worth looking at all those matters together.</p><p>I ask that we might have a debate on school patronage.  Some colleagues yesterday referred to comments by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, over the weekend.  He was widely misquoted and misreported.  In fact, he was responding to school principals at their conference who asked him about trying to fit the curriculum into the time allotted to them.  He pointed out that there is a good deal of time spent teaching religion, in particular in schools of religious faith, especially in years when there is sacramental preparation such as second class when there is preparation for communion.  That is a valid point which has been made previously.  We do spend a larger amount of time in primary schools teaching religion than in any other European country.  All of us agree with the notion of parental choice but when 95% of schools are under religious control and 90% of those are under Catholic control there is very little choice for many parents who would prefer not to have their children receive instruction in a particular faith.</p></speech>

Primary school holidays are only two months long - it is just July and August.  There are good pedagogical reasons children and teachers should have a break from the intensity of lessons.

Does that not undermine the Government's previous insistence that burying power lines is not feasible?</p> <p>Would it not be ironic if lines were to be put underground to satisfy the requirements of other metal structures, namely turbines, rather than to save our natural amenity, tourism, the quality of rural community life and the value of the land of rural dwellers?  We are not going to learn anything new.  I mean no disrespect to the commission in saying the Government will not learn anything it does not already know.  Any difference in cost associated with putting the lines underground would be more than offset by the moneys saved by not damaging tourism, our amenities and land prices.</p><p>Let me raise the disturbing news that the Central Bank has ordered over 200 credit unions to cut lending.  The latest reports suggest that thousands of credit union members are being refused loans because half of the credit unions are under orders to limit lending.  I have heard disturbing reports that older people are being refused loans for cars and parents are being refused short-term loans to defray family costs.  Some are being denied loans to cover funeral costs because of the lending limits.  This undermines the entire basis of the community credit system.  I am sure bank managers are delighted the Central Bank is using such a blunt instrument to restrict lending.  I agree with the Irish League of Credit Unions in questioning the criteria being applied when a credit union is told to limit lending.  It is a blunt instrument and it is not in the best interest of the community and those most in need of the great service the credit union system has been providing over the years.  I would be grateful if the Leader could invite the Minister for Finance to the House to debate this.</p></speech>

I am delighted that Ms Louise O'Keeffe received the result she deserved in the European Court of Human Rights.  All the Members of this House can unite in praise of her determination in fighting what must have been insurmountable odds.  As a legislator and teacher, I very much welcome the outcome and the clear decision that the state actor, our State, had a clear duty of care towards Ms O'Keeffe and others.  The State, during the term of the current Government, has not been slow to admit the mistakes of the past and I hope it will do so again.  This case, however, throws into sharp focus our system of primary education and its myriad contradictions.  The State has a constitutional obligation to provide primary education for free.  Through historical agreement, the State has always fulfilled its obligations by providing funding to privately managed schools or schools of a religious ethos supervised by a patron.  The State trains the teachers, sets the curriculum, pays the wages, inspects educational standards and maintains the schools.  The local school, under religious patronage of whatever variety, employs the teacher and decides who gets in.  Heretofore, the State was able to avoid any liability for abuse on the basis of not having any liability in tort law as it was not the employer.  The patron was the employer.  Although the judgment is but a day old and requires comprehensive analysis, it appears the State may now have liability for each case of abuse that occurred or may again occur.</p></speech>

The protection of children must always be prioritised.  We should recognise that the State has rightly been very critical of failures in the church organisations and various other bodies to protect children, but often it is quite sanguine about its own responsibilities in this regard.  This will now have to be faced up to.  Those responsible within the public service should equally be held to ridicule for their failures in this regard.</p><p>  Does the Leader agree with me in commending the Committee of Public Accounts on its very wise decision yesterday?  It decided, as was its right, to continue to hear in private - this is the correct format - the evidence of a Garda sergeant on losses of revenue.  It is correct to confine its proceedings to this.  These matters have shone a light on the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Government and its interaction with the Parliament and its committees.  While I commend the Minister on his initiative, I believe he would have to admit he took the decision to refer the matter to the Garda Ombudsman rather belatedly.</p><p>  The Leader will certainly agree with me that any inhouse inquiry of this nature is very much facilitated and enhanced by virtue of having an independently produced report available to those involved.  The Leader, other Senators and I sat for a number of years hearing witnesses in inquiries that had been carried out by Mr. Justice Barron on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and various other atrocities committed in the State with British collusion.  We found that to be a very good format.  Having the report enabled the committee to be incisive in the manner in which it conducted its inquiries.  It helped immeasurably.</p><p>  The Committee of Public Accounts, which does great work, does not have any representation from the Seanad.</p></speech>

It does not involve increasing the cost of the Exchequer but scrutinising and monitoring.  There are many Members in this House who would be prepared to do this.  Most of us would agree that Senator Sean Barrett, for example, would be a very valued member of the committee and make a good input.</p><p>Will the Leader consider this matter and also the continuing discrimination of Members of this House, who recently received a mandate from the people, and Members of the other House with regard to a range of allowances? It is only when one starts doing one's returns that one sees the disparity.  There is no justification whatsoever for what is occurring.  I ask the CPP and the Committee on Members' Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to examine these issues.  I do not mind if allowances are scaled back but there should be no disparity or discrimination between Members of this Houses with regard to these issues.</p></speech>

I am happy to state D&uacute;n Laoghaire exceeds the national average in every category of activity.  What is important to note, however, is that D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown has a higher average age than the rest of the population.  I wish to draw attention to a longitudinal study that was published very recently on the health of those in the over-50 cohort.  There is some good news and bad news.  Worryingly, over one third of those over 50 are obese, and over 44% are overweight.  This has serious consequences for their health, particularly cardiovascular health.  There is no doubt that we have been paying a lot of attention to the obesity of younger children, as we rightly should, but we must not forget that there is an older cohort to whom attention should also be paid in terms of their life expectancy and health.  Over 20% of men and 25% of women over 50 had fallen in the 12 months prior to the study.  This is a very worrying matter that should be taken into account, particularly when considering lifelong adaptability of housing and what we are doing in our built environment.  While I acknowledge that this House has been very active in discussing age and ageing, we could have a further debate on these issues in line with the study.</p></speech>

We have heard in recent days from experts and economists that there could be an overspend of &euro;2 billion on Irish Water.  It was quite obvious to Senators on this side of the House when we were discussing the Water Services Bill and asking direct questions of the Minister of State during the lengthy debates on the issue that this was a disaster waiting to happen.  It was clear that there was no proper accountability and transparency and it seemed to us that the Minister of State either did not have the information or was not willing to give it to us when we asked various questions during the course of the debate.  We asked questions about staffing, recruitment and bonuses.  We have now learned that Irish Water has hired a number of former senior officials at local government level, including a former county manager in Waterford who retired with a very generous package and had his pension topped up.  Mr. Ray O'Dwyer was given a very generous severance package, had his pension topped up by having a number of years added and then walked into a top job in Irish Water.  The pension abatement rules do not apply to him and when asked why in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Taoiseach's responded that it was because Irish Water was a semi-State or commercial business.  That is simply not acceptable.  This is exactly what causes many people to throw their hands up in the air in despair at how we do business.  That a senior official in local government could be retired with a very generous package and then walk into a job in an organisation primarily funded by the State is simply not good enough.  We must have a debate on this issue.  We must discuss the pension abatement rules applying not just to the public service but also to any institution funded by the taxpayer.  That would ensure fairness because there certainly is no fairness in the current arrangement.  The individual involved should not be taking the salary he is taking.  The Government should ensure in the instances where people have received top-up payments that the pension abatement rules will apply; otherwise, how can people have any confidence that the Government will do things differently from the previous one?</p></speech>

I come from an area where an entire valley was flooded in the building of a hydroelectric power station.  While my own family was directly affected by that development, benefits accrued to the entire community and country in that the State was able to provide electricity for every household and business.  That was 50 years ago and today we must look at new ways of developing and making sure business can be conducted anywhere in the country.  We need to have a structured and real debate on the issue.  The Minister is right to initiate the review recently announced.  We should have a debate in this House in order that all of the issues can be put on the table.  It is important to do this now because we need leadership.  There is misinformation, while a lot of factual information is unavailable.  A debate in the House on the issue would be helpful.

A study was published this week which showed that the risk of obesity doubled for those living in low income households, which is no big surprise.  The study of childhood obesity discovered that socioeconomic factors impacted significantly on a child's chances of becoming obese, with parents' social class, education and whether they drank or smoked all having a major impact.  This should come as no surprise as the environment often plays a role in a great many aspects of a child's life.  In this instance, the impact is alarming in that the risk of obesity is actually doubled.  While I agree entirely with Senator Aideen Hayden that we need to address the fact that many adults are obese, it starts with children.  In fact, mothers being obese is a vitally important factor.  The study also revealed that children who were obese had an 82% chance of remaining so into adulthood compared to just 15% of children of normal weight.  One interesting finding was that if a mother was obese, her child was 5.5 times more likely to be obese.  This is of concern and may also go some way towards explaining why those in lower income households are more susceptible.  Dietary education can play an enormous role in highlighting how people can feed themselves healthily and inexpensively by cooking from scratch.  Such education should be provided for parents also in schools.  Obesity is a ticking time bomb for the nation, especially in the context of the cost to the health service which is already struggling.  One in four children is now classified as being overweight or obese.  I apologise for raising this issue again, but I would be very grateful if we could engage in public consultation or a debate on it in the very near future.</p></speech>

While I welcome the establishment of the expert group, I deplore the decision to omit the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Laois and Offaly from its remit.  It is important that the Minister come to the House to explain why these counties were excluded.  Are their inhabitants second-class citizens, as Senator Marc MacSharry suggested?  We demand to know the reason for their exclusion.  There seems to be confusion among Government Deputies, particularly those from the north-east region, on the matter.  Deputy Conlan who represents the constituency in which I live said on radio this morning that he had spoken to the Taoiseach and had been assured that his constituency would be included in the next 48 hours.  At the same time, the Minister said in the national media that it would still be excluded, while this morning Deputy Helen McEntee called for its inclusion.  What exactly is going on?  To facilitate the Minister in putting the record straight, I strongly support the call made by Senator Marc MacSharry that the Minister come to the House this morning to discuss the matter and explain the reasons for his decision.  It was interesting to hear Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen suggest some of the wind energy companies planned to lay over 200 km of cable underground to facilitate the provision of electricity for the United Kingdom.  I understand they offered these facilities to Eirgrid in the counties affected but that the offer was not taken up.  Why was it not accepted?  I strongly urge the Minister to come to the House.</p></speech>

However, householders and business people in Kilreekil having been fighting for this basic right for 30 years.  Unfortunately, they are now considering taking a case to the European court, given the failure of successive Governments to address their plight.  Approximately 140 homes, a primary school, a pub and a shop must all rely on private wells and rainwater tanks for their water supply, which is not good enough in this day and age.  Investment in water infrastructure is now within the remit of Uisce &Eacute;ireann and I am calling on its CEO, Mr. John Tierney, to ensure the necessary funding is provided to extend the Loughrea regional scheme to Kilreekil.</p> <p>I have every confidence that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will successfully address our infrastructural deficits in the coming years.  I want it to have that first success in County Galway and to lay down a marker by providing the necessary funding for the Loughrea scheme and to deal with the unacceptable difficulties with water supply in Kilreekil to be addressed for once and for all.  I hope the people of Kilreekil will not have to go to the expense of taking their case to Europe.  This is a situation that should have been dealt with many years ago.  I look forward to a positive outcome to this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance agreed to our request and retained it.  However, it is now time for the sector to play ball with the Government.  For example, on the night of the Garth Brooks concerts, a hotel not far from Leinster House has raised the price of a double room from &euro;149 to &euro;299.  While I know hotels will take advantage of the demand for rooms, they should not be exploiting these events.  These are our own people, coming from all over Ireland for the Garth Brooks concert.  It is expensive enough with train fares, food and concert tickets, not to have to pay double the price for a hotel room.  In a way, these hotels are cutting off their nose to spite their face.  If they kept prices down, people might decide to stay an extra night.  Will the Irish Hotels Federation speak to its members and ensure they do not exploit people at times when there is a demand for rooms?  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to attend the House so we can hear his views on this?</p></speech>

It represents another step in the Government's reform programme, which will provide a modern integrated health service that places patient care and safety at its centre.  The Bill will allow us to introduce a system of unique identifiers for both individuals and providers of health services right across the health system, including both public and private providers.  The Bill sets out what these identifiers are and who will use them, as well as governance arrangements, including the registers that will be put in place to hold the identifiers.</p><p>  In developing a system of health identifiers, my Department has been keen to ensure that the governance arrangements fully address any privacy concerns that individuals or health care providers may have.  To that end, this Bill has been discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner during its development, and I thank the office for its input, which I believe has strengthened the governance arrangements set out in the Bill. I am sure Senators will agree that a strong governance framework is important to ensuring there is public confidence in the identifier system and right across the health system.</p><p>  The case for health identifiers as key enablers of better patient safety and care is well established internationally.  Individual health identifiers are fundamentally about patient safety and ensuring that the right information is associated with the right individual at the right time - at the point of care.</p><p>  The 2008 report of the commission on patient safety and quality assurance, entitled Building a Culture of Patient Safety, recommended the development and implementation of a unique identifier system for the health service.  The national health information strategy also recommended the introduction of health identifiers, and HIQA has advocated that identifiers should be provided for health care providers as well as individuals accessing health services.  Health identifiers are not only an important tool in delivering safe and quality care; they will also play a critical role in managing the health service more efficiently and effectively.  They are centrally important to the delivery of many reform initiatives - for example, the money follows the patient model - and this Government's ultimate goal for the health service, which is the introduction of universal health insurance to provide a single-tier health service in which everyone can receive safe high-quality treatment based on need rather than ability to pay.</p><p>  Health identifiers also form an integral part of the e-health agenda.  As Senators will remember, e-health strategy for Ireland was published on the same day as this Bill.  The strategy sets out a strategic roadmap for improving health and well-being - for example, through the introduction of e-prescribing.  The introduction of health identifiers will allow the health system to work much more efficiently.  It will mean that the same information does not need to be collected on numerous occasions, something that can be a frustrating experience for both patients and health care providers.  Unique health identifiers will also reduce the need for repeated diagnostic tests, because previous test results - even where they have been carried out by a different health provider - can be reliably associated with a patient's records.</p><p>  Members will be aware that it had originally been intended to legislate for health identifiers in the Health Information Bill, and the consultation process on that showed widespread support for the introduction of unique health identifiers.  However, given their critically important role in supporting the effective delivery of the wider health reform agenda, a decision was made to develop a separate and focused Health Identifiers Bill, which takes account of the view of HIQA and other relevant stakeholders.  In meeting publication timeframes, it was not possible to bring this Bill for pre-legislative hearing.  Work is continuing on the other elements of the Health Information Bill.</p><p>  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework for a system of unique health care identifiers for both individuals and health care providers.  It is principally about patient safety, ensuring that people are properly matched with their records, treatments and results.</p><p>  The Bill sets out what health identifiers are, who can use them, and the governance arrangements, including the establishment of registers to house the health identifiers.  As I have mentioned, my Department has worked with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that privacy considerations are fully addressed.  In addition, the Bill provides for certain governance-related offences, which should also help to strengthen public confidence in the health identifier system.  In relation to vaccination programmes and screening programmes, it is very difficult to have a true assessment of their effectiveness if doctors do not know what populations they are responsible for and if we cannot accurately determine who has been vaccinated and who has been screened.  A unique health identifier will help in a major way.</p><p>  I would now like to take members through the main provisions of the Bill.  The first part of the Bill sets out a number of standard provisions, including commencement, interpretation, regulatory powers and provision for expenses incurred by the Minister for Health or any other government Minister.</p><p>  Section 2 sets out a number of key definitions.  &quot;Specified persons&quot; are<i></i>defined as those who can use individual health identifiers and access the individual health identifier register.  These health service providers and persons are listed in Schedule 2 of the Bill.  &quot;Authorised disclosee&quot; is a person to whom an individual health identifier may be disclosed for a particular secondary purpose.  Authorised disclosees are listed in Schedule 1.  The Minister for Health can add to the list of specified persons and authorised disclosees by regulation, where doing so is in the public interest and following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner.  A &quot;relevant purpose&quot; defines the basis on which individual health identifiers can be collected, used and disclosed; this is divided into primary and secondary purposes.  The &quot;primary purpose&quot;<i></i>means the present, past or future provision of health services to an individual.  A &quot;secondary purpose&quot; is defined as including the promotion of patient safety, including clinical audit and investigation and reporting of patient safety incidents; management of the health services, including planning, monitoring, delivering, improving, auditing and evaluating health services, investigating and resolving complaints about health services, and managing national health systems; certain health research; the provision of health or health-related insurance schemes; or the processing of personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.</p><p>  The second part of the Bill provides for individual health identifiers and the accompanying national register of individual health identifiers - the IHI Register.  An individual health identifier will contain no personal data: it is simply a number.  </p><p>  Section 5 provides for the assignment of individual health identifiers.  The Minister for Health can assign an individual health identifier to a living individual who is, has been, or may be provided with a health service, whether or not that individual is ordinarily resident in the State.  An individual health identifier may also be assigned to a deceased individual where that person has died on or after the coming into operation of this section without having been assigned an individual health identifier when alive.</p> <p>The section also makes clear that assigning an IHI does not indicate, in and of itself, entitlement to or eligibility for a particular health service.  The intention is that members of the public will be advised of their IHI in making contact with the health service, allowing staff to confirm a person's identity in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  The section also provides that the Minister for Health can put in place measures to help an individual to have his or her IHI made known to him or her or another person acting on his or her behalf, because of age, capacity or death, for example.</p><p>Section 6 provides for establishing and maintaining a national register of IHIs by the Minister for Health.  The register will contain the IHI and any other known identifying information for each person who has been assigned an IHI.  This identifying information, the basic details that allow a person to be uniquely identified, is defined in section 2.  It includes, for example, a person's name, address, date of birth and PPSN.  It also provides for a signature and photograph as further identifying information.  The Minister for Health can make additions to this list but only following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner.  It must be stressed that the list of identifying information cannot include an individual's clinical information.  The only items of information that can be contained in the IHI register are the IHI and the defined list of identifying particulars.</p><p>Sections 7 to 9, inclusive, enable the initial seeding of the national IHI register and provide for maintaining the accuracy of the information, which is vital if it is to operate efficiently and effectively.  Section 7 allows the Minister for Health to make use of the identifying information with which he or the HSE must seed and populate the register in order to avoid having to ask people again for information they have already provided.  It also allows a provider of health services to ask an individual who is, has been or will be provided with a health service for his or her identifying information.  Health care providers must provide this information and relevant updates for the Minister for Health, as appropriate.  Most of this exchange of information will be catered for by ICT systems that will be developed to underpin the register.  It occurs to me that much of the confusion in the past over people's applications for medical cards where some information held locally was not transmitted centrally will be completely overcome by this provision.  They will be able to obtain the information very quickly in an efficient fashion.  Without getting into specifics, let me outline a recent case in which an individual's information was not known when a decision was made.  This was understandable from the point of view of the GMS or PCRS section because there were approximately 133 people with the same name.  What is proposed will overcome these difficulties.</p><p>Section 8 allows another Minister to provide the Minister for Health with a person&rsquo;s identifying information but only where it is solely for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an accurate IHI register.  Section 9 enables an ard-chl&aacute;raitheoir to provide information for the Minister for Health relevant to the Minister's functions under the Bill.</p><p>Section 10 provides for access to the IHI register.  The only persons allowed to gain access are the Minister for Health, a specified person as defined in section 2 and an equivalent person covered by an agreement under section 12.  These persons can access the register only for relevant purposes.  The Minister for Health may also access the register to perform a function conferred on him or her by the Bill or any other Act.  The section requires the Minister for Health to put measures in place to allow the register to be accessed subject to these conditions and otherwise make it inaccessible in order to ensure the registry is secure and privacy is protected.</p><p>Section 11 sets out how the IHI and information on the register can be used.  In providing a health service a health care provider must ask the individual for his or her IHI and the health care provider must associate the IHI with the patient's medical records and use it in relevant communications, with the provider's own identifier details, as per section 20 - for example, when a general practitioner writes a patient referral to a hospital consultant.  Importantly, no one will be denied a health service solely because he or she either does not have an IHI or refuses to provide it.  Obviously, however, by not providing one he or she would be making life very difficult for himself or herself and all those trying to help him or her.  Given that the main reason for introducing IHIs is to enhance patient safety, it is reasonable to expect that very few people will refuse to co-operate positively with the new identifier system.  However, it is important to recognise that certain occasions may arise, mainly in the area of very sensitive medical conditions, where someone may be reluctant to identify himself or herself fully.  None of this changes the existing set of circumstances where a health care provider is entitled to satisfy himself or herself that it is right and safe to treat someone.  The section also provides for disclosing an IHI and identifying particulars to an authorised disclosee for a particular secondary purpose.</p><p>Section 12 provides for the use of the IHI and access to the register in another member state in certain cases where an individual has travelled to that member state for a health service.  This is subject to an agreement on which the Data Protection Commissioner has been consulted being in place between the Minister and the health service provider in that member state.  The section is intended to provide for situations where, for example, the HSE has entered into an arrangement with a service provider outside the jurisdiction to provide services for a significant volume of patients.  It is not intended for use in the case of individuals electing to seek services outside the jurisdiction or for small volumes of patient referrals.</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill provides for health service provider identifiers and the related national register of health service providers.  The intention is that provider identifiers will be gradually rolled out to health service providers over time.</p><p>Section 13 sets out that health service provider identifiers can be assigned to a health practitioner such as a general practitioner or dentist; a relevant body such as a hospital; and a relevant employee or agent of a health practitioner or relevant body.</p><p>Section 14 provides for establishing and maintaining a national register of health service provider identifiers, the provider identifier register.  Sections 15 to 18, inclusive, are designed to ensure the provider identifier register is seeded and accuracy is maintained on an ongoing basis.  Sections 15 to 17, inclusive, make it clear that there is a proactive requirement on professional regulatory bodies, relevant bodies or health practitioners, as appropriate, to provide the specified information.  The Minister for Health is not required to seek this information, either initially or for updating purposes.  We intend to use existing professional registration numbers, in so far as it is possible to do so, in the new register - for example, by using Medical Council registration numbers for doctors.  Section 18 allows the Minister to use relevant information he or she or the HSE already has to assign a health service provider identifier and establish and maintain the register.</p><p>Section 19 provides for access to the provider register, while section 20 provides for the use of the provider identifier and register.  Senators should note that access to the provider register, under section 19, is different for the IHI register.  Given its nature, the provider register will be publicly accessible and hold different information.  As a register of health service providers, the only information that will be held on the provider register identifying individuals will relate solely to their role as health service providers.  Consistent with section 10 and the use of the IHI, section 20 requires health service providers to associate their provider identifiers with patient records and relevant correspondence.  However, this requirement does not apply where the provider is required by another Act to use the registration number given by his or her professional regulatory body when providing a health service.</p><p>Part 4 of the Bill provides for offences.  Section 21 provides for offences relating to the assignment of IHIs, while sections 22 and 23 provide for offences relating to accessing the national register of IHIs and an offence relating to processing an IHI.</p><p>Section 24 provides for offences relating to the assignment of health service provider identifiers, while section 25 provides for offences by corporate bodies.  These provisions are intended to secure the privacy and correct use of identifiers and registers.</p><p>Part 5 of the Bill provides for the delegation of certain functions of the Minister for Health.  Section 26 provides that the Government may, by order, delegate to the HSE any or all of the Minister's functions under the Bill, except excluded functions.  These excluded functions are the Minister's power to make regulations and enter into section 12 agreements.  Any function delegated to the HSE continues to be vested concurrently in the Minister.  The delegation does not remove or derogate from the responsibility of the Minister for Health to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, or as a member of the Government, for the performance of any function that is delegated.  When I mention the HSE, I mean it or any of its successor organisations.  The section sets out that the Minister for Health is always responsible and, ultimately, accountable for the identifier system, which is as it should be.  However, the section also recognises that responsibility for the actual day-to-day operation of the system may be delegated to the HSE as an organisation with the operational capacity to manage this national system.</p> <p> Part 6 of the Bill addresses the application of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  The Data Protection Acts are concerned with the protection of the personal data of living identifiable persons.</p><p> Section 27 deals with the relationship between the Bill and those Acts.  Subsections (1) and (2) deal with the individual health identifier of a living individual.  Under subsection (1), a living individual's IHI will be considered personal data under the Data Protection Acts when held by the Minister, a specified person or the HSE when acting in a section 26 capacity under the Bill.  However, this should not be construed as preventing a living individual's IHI held by any other person from being treated as personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts.</p><p> Subsection (3) is concerned with the information on the register on a deceased individual.  As an additional protection, it provides that sections 2(1)(<i>d</i>) and section 2C of the Data Protection Acts - which deal with security arrangements for personal data - will apply to the information in the IHI register in relation to a deceased individual in the same way as those sections apply to a living individual.</p><p> Part 7, sections 28 to 39, inclusive, provides for a range of matters.  Under section 28, the Minister for Health can arrange for investigations to be carried out on the operation of any provisions of the Bill, as he or she considers reasonable and necessary for the proper monitoring of the assignment and use of identifiers.  Section 29 provides that the Minister for Health can enter into an agreement with another person to carry out certain activities, for example, specialist IT support services.  Section 30 allows the Minister for Health to carry out measures to verify any information provided to him or her under the Bill, or to establish the efficient and effective operation of the registers.</p><p> Section 31 provides for data exchange agreements between the Minister for Health and other relevant persons.  These will specify the procedures to be followed by each party when exchanging personal data between them.  The Minister for Health must consult the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to data exchange agreements.  As a further privacy protection safeguard, under section 32, any processing of personal data by the Minister for Health or the HSE will go no further than is reasonably necessary for the performance of those functions.</p><p> Section 33 provides for the Minister for Health's power to specify the form of documents required for the purposes of the Bill.  To provide the flexibility that is needed, section 34 sets out that the Minister for Health can extend the time period for providing the information required under the Bill.</p><p> Sections 35 to 39, inclusive, allow for the legislation in relation to health professional regulatory bodies to be amended to enable the Minister for Health or, if delegated, the HSE to make complaints to regulatory bodies where a professional has not complied with a provision of the Bill, for example, where a health care provider has failed to associate an IHI and its own provider identifier to a patient record.  While there is no reason to expect that to happen, the legislation must provide for a means of dealing with such exceptional circumstances.</p><p> Schedule 1 covers authorised disclosees and Schedule 2 lists specified persons.  As the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 is now in force, I propose to bring a Committee Stage amendment to include the new Child and Family Agency as a specified person in Schedule 2.</p><p> The provision of health identifiers will require investment in ICT to develop and maintain the registers' infrastructure to hold the required information.  There will also be costs associated with rolling out the new system of identifiers, including the change management processes.  However, using the HSE to operate the identifier system will ensure that the technical and other expertise, as well as the operational infrastructure, of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, is maximised in implementing and operating the identifier systems on an ongoing basis.  Likewise, appropriate leveraging of the public service card technology provides further possibilities for a cost-effective solution.  The overall approach of building on the identity management infrastructure being developed by the Department of Social Protection will help to keep costs to a minimum, and I acknowledge the considerable assistance and co-operation of the staff in that Department in preparing this legislation.</p><p> The HSE is engaged in ongoing work on costs, and the publication of the Bill provides an opportunity to engage with the market to get accurate cost estimates to develop the most appropriate and cost effective model.  Senators should note that individual project components will be subject to peer review, including costs review, prior to project approval being sought, in line with Government policy, from the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform.  All of this is designed to ensure that we have accurate and reliable costs at the time decisions need to be made, and approval sought, on particular elements of the implementation model.</p><p> We all are concerned with our own patient care and safety and that of family, friends and anyone who uses our health system.  Individual health identifiers are principally about patient safety, ensuring that the right information is associated with the right individual at the right time - properly matching people with their records, treatments and results.  The programme of health reform that I am implementing is designed to ensure that patient safety and quality care are the paramount concern of the broad health system, and the introduction of health identifiers is critically important in that regard, reducing the chance of duplication, confusion and unnecessarily repeating tests on patients who do not need to suffer twice for the same result.</p><p> We all want to build on health reform initiatives and the further development of a modern health system.  Health identifiers will also support more efficient management and delivery of health services.  They are, for example, an important component of fully implementing money-follows-the-patient, in advancing the e-health agenda, and ultimately, delivering universal health insurance where everybody will be treated on the basis of medical rather than on what they can afford.</p><p> Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.  I look forward to Senators' contributions.  I am always open to suggestions that will help improve the Bill and its operation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900011#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister for yet again making himself available to the House.  My party will be supporting this legislation and I have only a few brief points.</p><p>When it comes to data protection, sometimes I feel that the practical application of the aspirations of the Acts are at times counterproductive to the needs of the individual in terms of the information that is available.  So many different aspects of Irish life require the same information that is sought in different ways and lodged and stored in different places, and then we must have this seemingly endless duplication and potential for human error, for instance, where one set of information cannot be got or gets lost because the wrong person had it, etc.  My party would fully support the idea of health identifiers and health practitioner identifiers as something that can help bridge the gap in information breakdown, enhance safety in terms of health results but also have all the key information in the right place.</p><p>The big question is why we cannot have all of this information accessible to the key arms or Departments of State if and when that is required rather than going off and collecting it again, not only in the health area.  In the area of social welfare, I, for one, would be an advocate of a national identification card, including a chip that stores all of this information and incorporating codes so that the appropriate professionals are the only ones with access such as the Department of Social Protection in the case of social welfare and the Department of Health in the case of health of the patient, etc., so as not to encroach too much into the area of data protection.  It is a no-brainer and it can help.</p><p>The Minister has given a detailed overview of what the legislation proposes, and I appreciate that.  Clearly, we will have a look again prior to Committee Stage to see whether there are ways of improving it.  The critical question I have is whether the resources will be available to make it work correctly.  In terms of IT, the EU average spend on investment in IT in the health sector is 2.5%.  In Ireland, it is 0.85%.  It is not the percentage in itself; it is how it is applied.  There was the disaster some years back with the centralised paying system.  We all are concerned about that.</p><p>In December, the Minister launched the e-health strategy.  eHealth Ireland has its aspirations of what it will do and in early 2014 eHealth Ireland will publish a new IT strategy for the health system.</p> <p>I presume this will be part of that.  What will be contained in this strategy?  When will it be published?  In what way does this legislation fit into that?  What kind of numbers are needed to adequately roll out this measure to ensure we have the successful practical application all of us yearn for and that the Minister envisaged in bringing forward the legislation?  The Minister mentioned that the fact that the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, has already been used is of great benefit in the context of how this measure will be rolled out.  Is the PCRS system adequate?  Is it capable of doing this particular job?  The explanatory memorandum states that the publication of the Bill provided the right opportunity to engage with the market to get accurate cost estimates for developing the most appropriate, cost-effective system.  That sounds like a big Bill.  Where are we on that?  The Minister might expand on that aspect in his closing remarks, because it is a concern.</p><p>I am aware that this was a commitment given to the troika; its origins go back to 2009.  The troika, and indeed the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, raised it as an issue in its April review of the programme and included a specific section to do with this area, but another report in 2012 showed that of those dealing with financial management within the health service, less than 10% have adequate qualifications to do that particular job.  Are the IT specialists that are required to adequately bring this process forward in place?  How much will they cost?  What will be the recruitment process and will it be affected by the embargo?  There are many questions to be asked but I do not want to go on unnecessarily.  The Minister has given a detailed output.  All of us welcome the potential of the Bill, in terms of the introduction of health identifiers, for achieving cost-effective health services and, ultimately, for achieving savings, but it is clear that quite an amount of investment - the Minister said this also - is required.  Will it be available?  How much will it be?  Presumably, we are learning from the Irish Water debacle in that regard.</p><p>I will conclude shortly to give other Members an opportunity to speak.  I know it is not related to the Bill but, as we say in Ireland, while we have the Minister in the House we would be interested to know his view on the exclusion of a health professional or expert from the expert group, given his concerns expressed in writing to his ministerial colleague about the pylons.  While we all welcome the review group-----</p></speech>

It is an issue I have spoken about a good deal in the past five years, particularly because I have examined the Danish, Finnish and Swedish systems, which are way ahead of ours, and other systems internationally, including the United States, on the issue of e-health.  The Danes started developing their system as far back as 1994; therefore, we have a good deal of catching up to do.</p><p>The Bill clearly outlines the setting up of a structure in regard to individual health identifiers for patients and service users, and also the setting up of registered health service provider identifiers for health professionals and organisations.  The idea behind the measure is to improve quality and safety of care, streamline record management, reduce repetitive and unnecessary care, as the Minister mentioned, reduce administrative costs, and facilitate e-health projects.  It is interesting to read the report from HIQA which estimates that up to 30% of the health budget may be spent on handling, collecting, searching for and storing information.  That is a huge part of the budget.  Therefore, this legislation and this development is welcome.</p><p>To refer again to the Danish system, Denmark has a similar population to Ireland's and it is interesting that their system has saved over &euro;1.8 billion over quite a short period in the provision of health care.  Their system is interesting.  Each person has a patient medication card.  When a person goes to a general practitioner, the GP uses the person's card to access his or her file. Instead of handing him or her a prescription, the GP puts the prescription on the card and gives the card back to the person, who then goes to the pharmacist.  The pharmacist can access the prescription on the card and give the person the prescribed drugs. Research has shown that approximately 27% of the handwriting on prescriptions from hospitals cannot be understood by pharmacists.  Computerisation would make a major contribution in terms of ensuring the right information is given to the professionals dealing with the patient.</p><p>It is also about accessing records quickly and efficiently.  Under the Danish system, a person admitted to hospital who has his or her patient medication card does not have to wait for three or four hours for the file to be found.  Once the card is produced, access to the records can be gained immediately and there is no delay.  We have a good deal of catching up to do in that area.  When they introduced the system in Denmark in 1994, there were approximately 4,000 exchanges of messages.  Last year, there were 60 million exchanges of messages within the health service because of the system they are using.</p><p>Regarding the sharing of information, I had a meeting recently with the Irish Pharmaceutical Society, whose pharmacists believe they can make a far bigger contribution in terms of savings and also in developing the area of e-health.  They are very much in favour of this development.</p><p>The Department of Health spoke about this issue as far back as 2001.  Thirteen years on we are only now putting on the pressure to develop and implement it.  It is long overdue.  I welcome the work by the Minister and the Department on progressing this matter and ensuring it will be operational and effective in a short period.  There will be savings, and this is about getting better value for the taxpayer in the provision of health care.</p><p>The individual health identifier is a unique, non-transferable lifetime number assigned to all individuals accessing health and social care.  Its purpose is to accurately identify the individual and enable health and social care to be delivered to the right patient at the right place and at the right time.  That is the importance of this legislation.  </p><p>On the benefits of an individual health identifier, it improves patient safety and quality of care, streamlines record management, reduces repetitive and unnecessary care, and reduces administrative costs.  In terms of the benefits to the health service provider, it enhances the quality and safety of patient care, reduces the possibility of administrative and clinical error, and reduces duplication.  It also accelerates access to information, which is extremely important.</p><p>The Bill is comprehensively drafted.  I will read it in more detail in the coming days but I believe it is a measure we should have introduced ten years ago because we are now far behind many other European countries in this area.  It is interesting to see the developments in the Nordic countries such as Finland, Sweden and Denmark and how much they have achieved in a short period.  There is no reason we could not do the same.</p> <p>We have the expertise in this country.  We have health care professionals who provide very good health care but we also need to make sure that they can provide that level of health care in a far more effective and efficient way and within a shorter period of time.  It is extremely important we ensure that is done.</p><p>The Minister has given an explanation of the medical card procedure.  More than 1,983,000 people now have either a medical card or a GP only card.  We have a great deal of information already computerised.  The Minister was correct in highlighting the issue where decisions were taken, where the people taking them did not have access to the information they required.  The introduction of this legislation and the setting up of the systems can eliminate many of the problems that have arisen in the medical card area and they can also ensure that GPs, nurses and community nurses, in particular, can get the necessary information to look after patients in their own homes.  Because we have such a high turnover of medical staff, especially among junior doctors, it is important they get all the correct information and that such information is available to them in the event of a person suddenly being admitted to hospital as they are on the front line.  </p><p>This legislation will set up the structure that is needed within the health care sector.  I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the work that the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE are doing in this area. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900013#M00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I am broadly in support of the idea of enhanced patient identification as a means of improving safety.  There is no doubt that when one has as internally discordant set of health services as we have in this country that it is essential that we think of better ways of managing medical records and facilitating appropriate transferral of sensitive information.  However, it is important to put this in a context.  There is a colossal problem with medical records in general in Irish hospitals.  I believe that about 95% of the total dysfunction that occurs in Irish hospitals as a result of poor record systems will not be fixed by this initiative.  The problem is internal in the hospitals.  We have systems that cannot talk to each other, so to speak, within the same hospital.  We have a reliance on paper charts.  We have charts that disappear going from one clinic to another.  These are issues which on a daily basis cause potential risks to the care of patients.  This is the key priority in patient informatics which needs to be addressed.  It needs to be addressed at a systems level, by mandate, with what, I believe, would be a relatively modest degree of infrastructure, and with what would be a colossal cultural change in the work practices of health professionals.</p><p>From a very simple point of view, in some rudimentary situations there are occasions where some aspects of medical information are displayed primarily electronically rather than on paper.  Are there enough terminals?  If one has three or four doctors and nurses working in one ward trying to deal with the problems of 15 or 20 patients, there is only one terminal and an orderly queue is forming, that is not a recipe for efficiency or safety.  It is an incentive to cut corners and say &quot;maybe that piece of information is not so important after all&quot;.  I would not want to disrespect the notion of having the unique patient identifier and the provider identifier but nor would I want to overstate the impact it will have.  By and large the great majority of patient interactions occur along relatively well-established referral pathways with relatively decent lines of communication.  They will get better with this initiative but the fundamental problems will not be fixed.</p><p>I am addressing my remarks to the Minister today which, coincidentally, is the day that we found out that Her Majesty's House of Lords will debate an amendment to the Child Protection Act, which will in one swoop make it illegal to smoke a cigarette in a car where a child is present, and this is happening nearly two years after we introduced our legislation in this area.  </p><p>I speak as somebody who is a little concerned about the prioritisation of reform within the health service at present.  For the benefit of folks who perhaps have been lucky enough not to hear me say this before, all of us and pretty much everybody in this country agrees with the principle of socialised health care, of cross-community solidarity, of the rich subsidising the poor and of care determined by need, not by ability to pay.  We all believe that but there are different models of delivering it.  One model, which is used in a small number of developed countries, is the general taxation or NHS model, where the government takes money at the beginning of the year, centrally runs, controls, co-ordinates, mandates and budgets the entire system on an annual basis prospectively.  Budgets are predetermined.  This is a system which is incredibly good for containing costs and that is the reason the NHS has one of the lowest cost outputs of any of the health systems in the developed world.  It is also a system which incentivises waiting lists, inactivity and also an extreme degree of inefficiency.  It is for that reason that many of us over the years who have studied health policy have examined other models such as the German model in particular.  At the time of the last election, I believe the Minister, his Cabinet colleagues and two parties in government were given a thumping mandate from the electorate to introduce this kind of reformed health system.  It is one which is based on universal insurance, competition, a level playing field for all patients, and all patients having a freely transferable insurance instrument, which they could take to a hospital of their choice, one which might be public, one which might be private, one which - my own preferred model - might be run by not-for-profit companies, by universities, by academic organisations or perhaps by charities.  Most of all the truly great leading, international medical centres in the world would follow that model.   They are led by people who have a board of governance who act with the mission of the institution in mind. </p><p>Let me parenthetically state at this stage that I was troubled over the last several weeks to hear the board of a large institution, which gets &euro;206 million in direct Exchequer funding annually, say that they now would concede the point that it was necessary to set up a public interest committee.  If the board is not acting in the public interest, in whose interest is it acting?  This is a question that needs to asked by the Minister of the governing boards of several of our largest hospitals.</p><p>On the tempo of the reforms we are seeing at present,  I am prepared to concede the point the Minister has always stated that the goal of universal insurance-based reform is the ultimate goal and that it is not a short-term goal.  I believe it could be a shorter-term goal than is being currently suggested.  I believe it is essential we do it now because until we do it we are copperfastening the inefficiencies, the waste and the poor quality which I am afraid exists throughout our system.  Looking at this from the outside, I see a huge amount of effort being put into reforming the current system in the direction of - I ask the Minister not to not take this as too harsh a criticism - making it look like the NHS.  In terms of elements such as having national contracts for doctors, in the kind of model we are talking about, doctors who are employed in different circumstances would have widely different kinds of contracts, depending on their working conditions, their employment and even their specialty.  We talk of a model of money following the patient as if this is somehow the implementation of an insurance-based model.  It must be remembered that in the Thatcher era with the reforms of the internal market in the National Health Service there was also an attempt at money following the patient and what we are doing in the short term, something which parenthetically will be facilitated by this unique identifier, appears to be introducing that type of health care instead.  There is an increasing tendency for the HSE to refer to itself as &quot;the health service&quot;.  In the reforms that we are talking about and the kinds of models we will have there will be many people who will have nothing to do with the HSE.  They may well have occupationally, socially, or privately-based insurance, they may well deal, I would hope, with the university College Dublin medical centre or the Eccles Street medical centre or some other hospital which is not owned by the HSE.  They may have nothing to do with the HSE which should become a management organisation for a smaller number of State services.  </p><p>The introduction of the groups, while rational in some ways, will also have the effect of decreasing competition and bringing in more of a directed referral model, which has been something long espoused by the HSE.  </p><p>I look forward to having more opportunities to look into some of the more complicated details of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to clarify one issue for me, which perhaps reflects on my lack of comprehension.</p> <p>How much of the medical record of a patient will be available to anybody who has legitimate access to the unique identifier number?  Will someone have complete access to records nationally?  If not, what is the point of the system?</p></speech>

Listening to the Opposition, I fear it is taking advantage of the good and generous nature of the Acting Chairman by introducing extraneous material instead of discussing the Health Identifiers Bill 2013.  We are talking about unique health identifiers.  I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and say that I am amazed these unique health identifiers are not already in place.  They were first mooted in 2001 and again by an expert group in 2008.  Some 13 years later, we are getting around to doing it.  It is an indication of the continuous reform the Minister and the Government are achieving in the health services and in the provision of health service delivery.</p><p>Sharing information across the health service is what this is about.  I was a psychiatric nurse for 28 years of my career and the real difficulty we had in the mental health service, and in all branches of the health service, was the sharing of information.  Different hospitals, different units and different people in the same hospitals used different methods to keep track of records by allocating different numbers.  Looking for a particular file on a patient involved searching under three or four filing records and one could still be unsuccessful.  This was particularly the case in respect of out-of-hours admissions, such as in the middle of the night, when the medical records staff were not at the office.  For ward staff, finding the relevant records was nigh-on impossible.  This is a welcome initiative.  Patient safety and efficient management of the system is what is intended in the introduction of these models.</p><p>I have several questions about the operation of the system and Senator Crown referred to some of these by asking how much of the patient information will be available on the system administered through unique identifiers.  The protection of patient privacy is of primary importance.  I see this is ensured in the Schedule to the Bill.  For instance, there does not seem to be difficulty if GPs in small practices access information on file.  What about busy accident and emergency units or acute admission wards in the mental health services?  In such cases, access would be required by all staff involved at some level.  Does access to the system leave a unique identifier trace by the person accessing the records?  There were media reports of unauthorised access to social welfare files some years ago and staff seemed to have easy access to information that was not relevant.  It seemed to be the result of curiosity rather than delivery of a service.  It is impossible to achieve the reform we are trying to achieve, the model of money following the patient, without these unique identifiers.  It could not possibly work unless we can trace the patient with the money through the system.</p><p>Hearing ICT and the HSE in the same sentence is enough to spark terror in anyone's heart.  We remember the PPARS system, which was proposed to be introduced at a cost of &euro;6 million and ended up costing &euro;250 million.  It did not achieve the objective it set out to do.  At the time, the PPARS system was there to collect only one type of information, payroll, and we could not deliver it.  Do we have confidence that the system in place now has the ability to achieve results that PPARS could not?  Is there a requirement for standardisation of templates of information gathering across all GPs?  In complex medical situations, there is a tendency to generate huge volumes of information about patients.  I see this in the mental health services where some nursing care plan models generate two or three pages of information a day about a patient.  Does the system have the capacity, or is there a necessity, to record this information?  Is there remote access to it?  Is there a requirement that there will be a particular server or will it be stored in a cloud?  These are questions that need to be asked.  The idea that it will not cost a great deal of money is a statement from the Minister that I view with a sceptical eye.  In Ireland, our ability to roll out ICT systems is such that they tend to cost a lot of money.  I refer to the Garda PULSE system; we will not mention electronic voting, as it descended into farce.  I have every confidence the Minister has considered these questions and has reached conclusions.</p></speech>

I will be supporting the Bill.  Senator Gilroy pointed out that it should have been in place a long time ago.  It should not have taken so long for the previous Government to put this in place and it took the current Minister to introduce the Bill, which is a necessary development in the delivery of health services in the State.</p><p>Almost all Members have the experience of difficulties caused by the obvious disconnection in the different elements of the health services and the fact we do not have a joined-up approach, which we hope the Bill will implement.  There is little co-ordination between the records of patients kept by GPs and other providers of primary care, including the HSE.  This also applies to the primary care providers and acute hospitals and providers at secondary and tertiary levels.  Within hospitals, we have difficulties because of the absence of a single patient number for each patient and many people have experienced the repeated filling out of patient information forms during the course of one hospital visit, even when the hospital already has the patient information on record.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is one we support, namely, to assign a unique health identifier to each individual to whom health service has been or may be provided.  The focus must be kept on that simple and straightforward aim to ensure we get maximum benefit from this change.  That is what the Minister is seeking to do so that we can improve and enhance health care delivery as a consequence of the policy being implemented.  Concerns have been raised about people's information being given to Departments and that information is used in the best possible way and that people's personal data is protected so that we put prevent potential abuse of what is a very important, but also a very valuable, database of the population of the State.  I am sure the Minister has been made aware of concerns, which have been expressed to him.  In recent times, we saw US agencies misusing their position in respect of people's information.  People have genuine concerns about this.  We must also strike a balance and ensure we can provide the best health services.  People will not object to being part of this and providing information.  They will see the clear logic of having a personal identification number.</p><p>This was raised with me when I held a conference on health services in Waterford.</p> <p>I invited experts such as GPs, consultants in hospitals and people who work in different forms of primary health care delivery.  Part of the discussion was around the need to improve and join up services at primary level, as well as acute services.  Even at that time, in 2002, we had experts calling for a single patient registration and identification numbering system.  It has taken us a long time to get here, which is unfortunate, but the Bill is now before us.  The aim of the legislation is very straightforward but it could be very significant in its achievements and the potential improvements for the health care system.  That cannot be understated, so I will certainly support the Bill and the Minister in this regard. I hope the Bill will be implemented as quickly as possible, although that may be down to the hospitals and people who work in our health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1153" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900015#O00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for bringing the legislation before us.  The Bill seeks to establish a profile system of unique identifiers for individuals within the health system, as other Senators and the Minister have pointed out.  It makes perfect sense, as we will be able to track an individual going through the system and his or her interaction with doctors, dentists, nurses and all medical personnel.  We will know if a person is undergoing treatment and if he or she has reacted badly to a particular medicine or has an allergy.  Patients are continually questioned about such issues.</p><p>  Implementation of a unique identifier system is recognised as being an essential infrastructural initiative which will facilitate many significant improvements to the health system in areas such as patient safety and improved data access and quality, leading to improved overall systems efficiency.  It is also a fundamental requirement for deploying electronic solutions and an essential building block for &quot;money follows the patient&quot; and universal health insurance, both of which are cornerstones of the Government's reform agenda in the health area.</p><p>  There was a story from last April in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> which made it clear that this system is required.  The journalist, Niamh Drohan, posing as a student, visited seven GPs displaying symptoms of depression which she had read about on the Internet.  She subsequently received prescriptions from all seven GPs, with few advising about maximum dosage, and none advising about potential side-effects.  The article posed a number of interesting issues but more than anything else, it exposed how people, if they so wish, could effectively &quot;game&quot; the system and receive multiple prescriptions.  She wrote at the time that of the seven phone calls she made seeking an appointment, just two inquired if medical records needed to be transferred.  Three prescriptions were issued for one month, one prescription was issued for two months, another was for three months and yet another was for six months.  The total was approximately 20 months of antidepressant medication without the need to revisit any GP, which is incredible.  In one case a three-month prescription was given out in fewer than ten minutes.  This Bill should effectively clamp down on the issue in a very simple way and ultimately stop anybody from abusing the system in this way.</p><p>  Senator Burke has done some research on Scandinavian countries, where systems have been implemented that are ahead again of what we propose to implement.  I visited Estonia recently on committee business.  That country is not coming from the same base as us, so it was less complicated for them to implement a system, but it has a sophisticated system whereby a person's records are available to any medical practitioner.  The people involved are very much aware of the data protection element.  I was fascinated by their work, and I am sure the departmental officials may have already considered the Estonian case.  The information is available on a website, and I can provide the information I was given if it could be a useful comparison.</p><p>  I agree with Senator MacSharry's comments regarding a national identity card.  In Estonia, they do not stop at medical records, and in a way it could be seen as bordering on &quot;Big Brother&quot;, if one was somewhat paranoid.  The country can track everything to do with a person's motor car and health, as well as systems like social welfare requirements.  In certain circumstances, sensitive information can be held back and released with the consent of the person to whom the information applies.</p><p>  It is clear the legislation is a building block and first step towards deploying e-health solutions that could provide us with better data access, better health care analytics, and, overall, a better and more efficient health care system.  Moreover, it is also a platform for the universal health care insurance.  Health care reform has faced many obstacles but we have been successful in reducing waiting times across the country.  In a few months we will introduce free GP care for those who are six and under, and this Bill will also play a useful part in holistic health care strategy, as it will allow us to follow the patient, ensure the system is working efficiently, and potentially highlight anomalies within the system in a very efficient way by giving us very straightforward data which can be analysed and potentially debated.  There is no doubt that this will help us improve the national health care system.</p><p>  Privacy concerns are important, and that is why consultations have been held with the relevant data protection authorities.  We must ensure to adhere to the best international data protection governance, and I am confident we will do so.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials for their work and commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The issue of resources was raised, along with the ongoing exercise to estimate costs.  My Department has asked the HSE to establish a project team to continue the work of developing high level estimates.  Engagement with the market will be needed to determine the final cost but there is no question of another personnel, payroll and related system, PPARS, fiasco.  I can guarantee that.  The ICT strategy being prepared by the HSE is nearly complete and it will complement the e-health strategy I published last month.  Senator Gilroy is quite right in that now there is almost an allergic response to information technology in health services because of the PPARS debacle.  We must grasp the nettle and we are doing so.  We must act in a way that will minimise the number of systems we must use, as there are approximately 1,700 different IT systems in the health services.  They are not necessarily related to finances but they must all be able to interact.</p><p>There were some comments about the myriad of people dealing with finance in the HSE who do not have financial experience.  That has been corrected through the new chief financial officer and his financial reform board.  We have a much greater grip on finances than we ever had before and it is clear to people that, having taken almost &euro;4 billion out of a &euro;16 billion budget over the past number of years, there is no financial black hole in the health sector any more.</p><p>Senator Burke raised the issue of the Swedish health system, and the e-health strategy has had regard to the best practices in both Sweden, Denmark and other countries.  Senator Crown spoke of cultural change, which is necessary, and this Bill and the e-health strategy is a step in the direction we want to go in order to kick-start that change.  Senator Gilroy also raised the matter of security and access to the individual health identifier, IHI, register.  It will be an offence to inappropriately access the IHI register, and it is intended that the implementation process will record who has accessed the system.  We will be able to track those who access the system in that way.  Senator Crown asked what would be available in the IHI.  The identifier is used to identify a person, and access to medical records, etc., is another matter entirely, which would be based on clinical need and the level of clinician involved.  The identifier will help significantly in that process.</p><p>I thank Senators for their input.</p> <p>We all share the view that the introduction of a unique system of identification for patients and providers would be a very positive and welcome development.  It has taken an inordinate length of time.  While its principle purpose relates to patient care and safety - that must be our absolute priority - an identifier system could bring a range of benefits across the health system in areas such as better and more reliable data quality, system efficiency in information collection and management, supporting desirable initiatives such as the money follows the patient model, and facilitating the whole e-health agenda.  In short, a unique health identifier is regarded internationally as essential to underpin a modern, integrated health system, and in framing the Bill we have had regard to international experience and best practice, as well as input from HIQA and others who have contributed much to the Bill.</p><p>It is critically important that as we reform, we learn.  Underpinning our approach to the health service has been the aim of making it patient-centred and improving outcomes for patients while learning from the reforms we have introduced - reform, learn and reform again.  In planning the health service, in observing how reform is operating and evaluating what we are doing, we need a unique health care identifier for patients to have much more accurate information.  In a broader sense, we also need much better IT systems.  We are looking at that as well.</p><p>The Bill provides the appropriate enabling framework to implement a unique identifier system in a structured and planned way that will best suit the needs of the health system as we meet challenges in the future.  I look forward to debating the issue further with Senators on Committee Stage.  I am open to suggestions Senators might have to improve the Bill.  I again thank Senators for their contribution.</p></speech>

This will permit the making of regulations to enable the application of the provision of the freedom of information legislation to Irish Water, Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The measure is being introduced in line with the procedures set out in the existing FOI legislation, but will of course continue in force once the new FOI legislation has completed its passage through the Houses and is enacted.</p><p>  Recent developments have highlighted the importance of a high degree of openness and transparency in helping to underpin public confidence and trust in Irish Water, in light of the critical role and responsibilities of that body in regard to what is one of our most valuable natural resources.</p> <p>In those circumstances and given the very significant impact that the operation of Irish Water will have on all households and businesses in the State, there is a broad consensus, shared by the Government, that the activities of Irish Water should be undertaken in an appropriately open, transparent and accountable manner so that the public can be assured that it is being operated as effectively and efficiently as possible.  The application of freedom of information provisions is one of several mechanisms for ensuring that this will be the case.  </p><p>As the House will be aware, during the Committee Stage debate on the Freedom of Information Bill in the other House in November last, I indicated that I would take steps to make Irish Water subject to freedom of information provisions following the enactment of the new legislation and once the entity itself was up and running.  Following the recent public debate on the establishment costs of Irish Water, the meetings of the relevant Oireachtas committees attended by the management of Irish Water and taking into account the expected timetable for the enactment of the Freedom of Information Bill - it was originally hoped to have it enacted by the end of last year - I indicated to the D&aacute;il on 22 January that it was my intention to take the necessary steps now to ensure that Irish Water is brought within the freedom of information legislation as early as possible.  </p><p>Section 3 of the Freedom of Information Act of 1997 provides that regulations may be made to extend the coverage of the Act.  In such cases, section 3(3) of the Act provides that a resolution approving these regulations in draft from must be passed by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann before the regulations can come into effect, following their signing into law by me, with the consent of the line Minister.  The normal practice is to give a period of six months to public bodies to put the necessary administrative arrangements - which can be quite demanding - in place to enable them to respond to freedom of information requests in an efficient manner.  It is reasonable that Irish Water should be allowed some time to make such administrative arrangements but I believe that 30 working days would be an appropriate time frame to enable the body to make such preparations.  Accordingly, I am here today to ask the House to support this motion to extend the provisions of freedom of information to Irish Water with effect from its legal date of establishment, which was 17 July 2013.  In addition, records held by the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the local authorities relating to the establishment of Irish Water and any dealings with Irish Water since its establishment are, and will continue to be, covered under the Freedom of Information Act, subject to the normal operations of that Act. </p><p>I am calling for the support of the House for this motion to enable Irish Water to be brought under the Freedom of Information Act with effect from 17 July 2013, within 30 working days of the signing of the necessary orders.</p></speech>

There was a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment in the D&aacute;il which sought to make Irish Water subject to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, but the Government argued that it was not needed and that was not done.  The establishment process was kept secret and that culture of secrecy was allowed to fester, with the results we have seen.</p><p>This is not enough.  The whole culture in Irish Water must change.  There are many issues of concern surrounding its establishment but the argument about commercial confidentiality is not tenable.  This is a public utility managing a public resource and therefore does not have commercial considerations.  It is about time the Labour Party stood up to Fine Gael, which seems to want to privatise water provision.  There are a number of issues of concern regarding Irish Water that have been debated over and over again but the inclusion of the body under the freedom of information legislation could have been done a long time ago.  There seems to be a determination to keep things private.  </p><p>What have we seen so far?  We have seen a bonus culture return; wasteful spending; the recruitment of more than double the staff required; and suggestions that certain individuals were favoured in the context of office leases.  It has been a farce from start to finish.  There seems to have been a shocking waste of public resources, coupled with a determination on the part of the Government to keep that secret in the start-up phase.  The intention was to set it up before the local elections and get it out of the way, with freedom of information provisions only applying next year.  </p><p>The Minister has backdated the application of the freedom of information legislation but only because of political pressure.  He has done it in advance of the local elections, which is not what the Government wanted.  I look forward to journalists, politicians and political parties submitting freedom of information requests and getting the information they seek.  One of the key issues that is annoying people currently is that the Government promised last year that the moneys raised through the local property tax would be spent in local communities.  That did not happen and the money was spent, predominantly, on the establishment of Irish Water.  </p><p>If the required change of culture is to take effect, I hope that Ministers will also answer questions relating to Irish Water and will not just pass the buck.  The parliamentary questions that have been answered in recent weeks were first put as early as June 2011 and were also put in the D&aacute;il in November 2013.  It is unacceptable that what was effectively a slip-up by the CEO during a radio interview led to the release of this information.  </p><p>While we support this motion, despite it being late, it is not enough.  A whole change of culture in the organisation is required.  Irish Water is there to serve the people, to manage a precious resource and to manage the financial resources of the people who are paying it.  </p></speech>

The freedom of information legislation will bring transparency, accountability and, hopefully, responsibility to the actions of Irish Water, which is such an important entity.  Making Irish Water subject to that legislation will ensure a greater level of confidence in a company which has had considerable teething problems.  When we are dealing with taxpayers' money, openness, transparency and accountability must be foremost in our minds.  Allowing the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to be extended to Irish Water will go some way towards ensuring that we can rebuild trust in that entity.</p><p>During the Committee Stage debate on the Freedom of Information Bill in November last, the Minister indicated that he would make Irish Water subject to the legislation once it was up and running.  I accept that one has to allow a period of six months to public bodies to put the necessary administrative arrangements in place to enable them to respond to freedom of information requests in an efficient manner.  It is, in my opinion, reasonable that Irish Water should be should be allowed some time to make such administrative arrangements.  I welcome the motion and support the Minister on same.</p></speech>

However, it should not have taken the ongoing controversy surrounding this State utility to force the Government into doing that.  I accept the fact that the Minister made commitments during the Committee Stage debate on the Freedom of Information Bill but it seems that Government decision-making is increasingly happening on the hoof.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has argued in the past that commercial semi-States should be brought into the schedule of bodies covered by the freedom of information legislation.  My party colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, has argued that legislative protection can be provided in the context of commercial sensitivities to ensure a level playing field for those companies operating in a competitive environment.</p><p>As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is Deputy Howlin concerned at the manner in which public moneys are being spent by Irish Water?  Does he believe the scale of spending thus far, without any money having been spent on infrastructure, can be justified?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recently claimed that the troika has imposed too short a turnaround time for the setting up of the company.  In that context, does the Minister believe this means that the utility, as set up, is not actually fit for purpose?</p><p>As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the inclusion of Irish Water in the schedule of bodies covered by the Freedom of Information Act but it should not have taken the recent controversy to speed up its inclusion.</p></speech>

Now, at the end of January we are including it.  Evidently, the Senator does not know much about how government works if he thinks it is going to be forced to introduce such legislation because of a conversation on the radio.  Irish Water was always going to be included in the freedom of information legislation and I support this motion.</p><p>Freedom of information is only one tool to get information as there are other methods such as parliamentary questions.  All semi-State bodies must follow rules on corporate governance as set down by the Department of Finance.  These will apply to Irish Water too.

Irish Water, which has had a dreadful start, needs to be brought under the freedom of information legislation.  It should also come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General as to how it spends money.  I must commend the chairman of the Oireachtas environment committee, Deputy Michael McCarthy, on how he conducted the recent hearings with Irish Water.</p><p>The Minister should note the Seanad had scores of amendments tabled on the water services legislation but the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, not the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, did not want to listen to or debate them.  We asked for the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to be involved in an attempt to regulate a monopoly.  Over the past two years, we have failed to even get a figure for the average water bill and the free allowance.</p></speech>

However, we ran into the proverbial brick wall.</p><p>Why is an energy regulator regulating water?  Is it not a specialised field?  Water engineers in the United Kingdom wanted to spend &euro;27.4 billion between 2000 and 2015 on water services which was cut back to &euro;19.1 billion in the end.  That is what engineers will do with their pet projects.  We must be careful that the engineers here do not double the national debt.  That is why the Minister&rsquo;s project appraisal mechanisms have my support.  The UK industry wanted a return of 4.3% on its investment but the regulator put it back to 3.85%.</p><p>There is an awful lot more that we need to find out about Irish Water.  I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s first instalment on freedom of information at the time.  This extension of the legislation is very necessary with Parliament asserting itself.  It is necessary because Sir Humphrey is not a natural democrat, so we must teach him that.  I support the Minister in his endeavours in this regard.</p></speech>

There is a certain populist tone coming from Senator Byrne when he speaks about a bonus culture and so forth.  That runs well in a newspaper headline.  However, practices have been bedded down by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, for example, to save considerable moneys with a move away from an incremental pay arrangement to a performance-based one, a model towards which all commercial semi-State bodies and, ultimately, State agencies, should work.</p><p>There is a broader view, which Senator Reilly expressed, that we need freedom of information and a range of other impositions on commercial semi-State bodies but that do not apply to their commercial rivals.  That would make it impossible for commercial semi-States to operate in the marketplace.  I know there are some of the view it would be good to kill off the commercial semi-State sector, a view not shared by my party or myself.  There is a case, however, to be made for extending freedom of information to semi-State bodies which are monopolies.  Accordingly, I was always going to apply freedom of information to Irish Water once it was up and running and the legislation was enacted.  In fact, I actually fast-tracked it, even though the legislation is still on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>When a Minister listens and accepts arguments and motions, it should not be labelled by Members as a U-turn or coming in with one&rsquo;s tail between one&rsquo;s legs.  Do they want Ministers to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; repeatedly?  Is that the way Parliament should operate?</p></speech>

That is not the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s job.  Commercial companies are subject to company law, as well as corporate governance and other oversights that apply in this sector.

Irish Rail is another example.  We can debate what a monopoly is and what it is not when I return with freedom of information legislation.</p><p>Senators asked if the setting up of Irish Water was rushed.  The establishment of Irish Water was a troika commitment entered into by the previous Government that we inherited.  It is a move that I support and it must be remembered I abolished water charges in the mid-1990s when I was Minister for the Environment.  However, to secure the provision of safe and abundant water supplies for our citizens and business into the future, it makes sense to have one integrated entity which operates on scale.</p> <p>It makes sense to have one integrated entity which operates on scale.  There is a compelling article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today, penned by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, rebutting in some detail some of the generalisms put out by Mr. Fitzgerald of the ESRI.  We need rational argument and open debate on these issues.  Everybody's point of view needs to be tested and not simply headlined.</p><p> With regard to why we are using the energy regulator, the idea is to have economies of scale and that where we have regulators we integrate them.  Part of the recommendations of the McCarthy report is to consolidate and co-ordinate oversight and regulation rather than to establish new bodies for everything we want to do.  I hope to see more of it.  When I introduced the lottery legislation in the House I indicated that in my judgment the regulator for the lottery should become a regulator for gambling in due course so we do not duplicate a new body every time we have a new purpose. </p><p> I thank Senators for their support and I look forward to returning for a broader debate on the issue of freedom of information when the Bill presents itself from the other House.</p></speech>

I stand here to propose that this House should be reformed according to two principles that are cornerstones of any genuine democracy, and that this House should be reformed with a sense of urgency by the immediate establishment of an all-party task force so we can have meaningful reform in advance of the next Seanad general election.</p><p>Some of the criticisms levelled at the Seanad during the last referendum campaign are unfounded and untrue but it remains beyond dispute that this House is not democratic or as effective as it could be, and the Seanad electoral system is elitist.  So what is the Government willing to offer the people now they have spoken?  We can look at the public record.  On 18 December, the Taoiseach ruled out proposals that would have given every citizen a vote in Seanad elections, doing so on the basis that he did not &quot;believe that the framers of the Constitution intended that you'd have a universal suffrage for the Senate in the same way as the D&aacute;il&quot;.  I will rebut this declaration in a few moments.</p><p>The other issue on public record is the Government's amendment to the motion, which effectively places on public record the minutes of the meeting that the Taoiseach had with political party leaders last December.  The Government's offer to the people is as little reform as possible, as slowly as possible and with no sense of urgency and certainly no reform in time for the next Seanad general election to provide the people with what they are entitled to in a democracy, which is one person, one vote, and universal suffrage.  What the Government offers the people this evening is simply the minutes of a meeting that happened over six weeks ago.  The Government should stop underestimating the people.  Our motion does not underestimate the people, and it reflects the growing consensus across Independents, the Opposition parties and some individual members of the Government and relevant civil society groups that the bottom line requirement for the next Seanad is that every person should have a vote and the franchise should be extended universally.</p> <p>It reflects the primary elements of my Bill with Senator Quinn, Senator Crown's Bill, the recently published Fianna F&aacute;il Bill and proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Our motion is framed with cognisance of the Constitution.  Article 6 of the Constitution acknowledges that it is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; of the people to &ldquo;designate the rulers of the State&rdquo;.  It is the right of the people to choose who governs them and who makes the laws in their democracy.  Article 18 of the Constitution clearly does not exclude universal citizen suffrage in Seanad elections.  It does the exact opposite.  The Constitution simply provides that general elections to the Seanad &ldquo;shall be held on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote&rdquo; and that the law shall regulate those elections, not the Constitution.</p><p> The Taoiseach&rsquo;s claim that the Constitution must remain rooted in the political convictions of the 1930s and cannot be reinterpreted to fit modern needs is not only archaic, it disregards a well-established judicial principle that the Constitution is a living document.  The generation who wrote the 1937 Constitution is the same one that fought for our national freedom.  It gave us a free Constitution to empower our people politically, socially and economically.  The whole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of this country&rsquo;s quest for sovereignty and national self-determination was to ensure that Irish people in every generation would be free to chart their own future according to their times, so it is incumbent on the Government to respect the freedom of our people to choose who can make our laws.  As long as the Seanad remains unreformed in its electoral system, disregarding the democratic right of every person to have a vote, the Government is not respecting the constitutionally embedded freedom of our people.  Let us make no mistake about it; the power now for this kind of Seanad reform is in the hands of the Government.  If we do not see this kind of reform for the next Seanad election the fault will rest with this Government, and that will start here in this Chamber this evening if this motion does not pass.</p><p> Let me come then to the first component of our motion, the first of the two fundamental principles of Seanad reform &ndash; universal suffrage.  It is the most basic principle in any election process.  In a democracy every citizen should be entitled to vote for those who govern them.  Those who are opposed to universal suffrage for the Seanad cite a range of reasons as to why, in their view, it should not be used in Seanad elections, but I do not think those arguments hold much water.  Some have suggested that an extension of the franchise would result in a Seanad whose make-up mirrored that of the D&aacute;il.  That is not true; it is inaccurate.  Geographical constituencies elect the D&aacute;il, with voters in a certain area only being permitted to vote for candidates running within such constituencies.  In contrast, the Seanad would be elected by a national electorate, so where a voter lives and where the candidate lives will be of zero relevance in a Seanad election.</p><p> There have also been suggestions that if the franchise is extended the Seanad will somehow rival the D&aacute;il.  The role of the Seanad is set out in the Constitution.  It is principally a House of the Legislature.  The Seanad plays a crucial role in ensuring that legislation is given a second look based on expert and informed views, knowledge and practical experience in a range of specific sectors as identified in the panels.  In spite of its valued role as the House of legislation, too often the Seanad&rsquo;s role in scrutinising the law is dismissed in the interests of political expediency.  All too often the Government uses the Stages of the legislative process as a box-ticking exercise and the guillotine is regularly applied to debates.  That is not the way to make good legislation.  Let us take a look even this week at the Seanad&rsquo;s schedule.  It is another &quot;Seanad-lite&quot; week.  Where is the legislation now when we have time for it?  Why is it not here?  Where there is a political will, there is a way, but us let us be clear, there is no truth in the assertion that a Seanad that is elected by the population would rival or even mirror the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad&rsquo;s role is set out in the Constitution and also in Standing Orders.  The Seanad complements the D&aacute;il.  Extending the franchise would not alter the role of the Seanad.</p><p> One person, one vote is an important concept.  The vast majority of Members in this House are elected by a small cohort of local authority members who could have five, six or seven votes each, yet the ordinary person who did not have the privilege of going to a certain university has no say whatsoever in the make-up of this House.  That is indefensible.  One person, one vote is about ensuring that all voters are treated equally.  The views of one person in a ballot box are just as important as the next.  Why should we tolerate a situation where a teacher or a nurse might have one vote but a person who never had the privilege of going to university or third level has no vote and local authority members have six or seven votes?  As members of the Government said repeatedly during the campaign, it is elitist.  That must end and we must work collectively to bring it to an end.  While the Taoiseach&rsquo;s strategy to extend the franchise of the university panels to all third level graduates is welcome, it will not bring about an end to elitism on its own.  In fact, on its own it will exacerbate elitism.  Such a limited statutory change would leave 90% of the Seanad totally unaffected.</p><p> The second part of the motion is all about time.  We need the immediate establishment of the task force to consider Seanad legislative reform, starting with the two fundamental principles.  One could ask why that is so important.  If the people are to be given their constitutional right to a vote in a Seanad general election next time around, we must have passed a Bill to that effect by the end of 2014.  One could ask why that is the case.  It is because it will take some considerable time in 2015 to set up the new electoral process and system, to inform the people of their right to vote and to devise a way of registering and voting for the preferred panel choice.  If that does not happen it will be at least another seven years before the possibility of this kind of reform opens up again.  The people need to know that.  If the Seanad is reformed now, that would ensure that after the next general election we could have a Seanad for the people and elected by all of the people.  The Seanad would then be a truly democratically elected Chamber in which the aspirations of the 1937 Constitution would be met.  That would be the essence of democracy.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House.</p><p>  It is in truth a given that there is a prevalent cynicism about democracy and an increasing scepticism about its potential for reform and self improvement.  Many citizens are totally alienated from the democratic process, believing that a self-perpetuating system populated by self-serving people neither reflects their wishes and values nor particularly acts in their interest.  I do not make this up; it is what people think.  People feel disconnected from and unable to change many of the realities of public governance in Ireland.</p><p>  At the time of the Seanad abolition referendum, as was pointed out by my friend and colleague, Senator Zappone, the charges were laid that the Seanad was elitist, ineffective and wasteful.  We got a message from the people.  They rejected something when they said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the proposal that the Seanad should be abolished.  Two interpretations are that they rejected the Government&rsquo;s analysis that the Seanad was wasteful, ineffective and elitist and in fact liked it the way it was and wished it to remain in the <i>status quo</i>.  I have met no one who thought that, espoused that, canvassed for it or advocated it.  In any of my personal canvasses during the Seanad referendum or in any of my discourses and debates with others, the message loud and clear in every forum was reform, reform, reform.  The platforms of both sides acknowledged the inadequacies of the Seanad and the platform of the side which ultimately prevailed contained a consistent message of reform.  In short, a thumping mandate for reform of the Seanad was given by the referendum.  In fact, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is aware and as Senator Zappone has pointed out, two different reform Bills were offered before the House prior to the referendum.  They were broadly similar with nuanced differences but they both adhered to two principles.  The first was the fundamental democratic value of universal suffrage.  The second was living within the constraints imposed on us by Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  In other words, that was the maximum reform which could be achieved in the absence of further constitutional amendment.  What we are instead hearing is that we will have long overdue legislative implementation of the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution, passed in popular referendum in 1979 &ndash; all of 35 years ago.  Let us put a little perspective on 35 years ago.  Jimmy Carter was the President of the United States.</p> <p>The Shah had not yet left Iran, the USSR still existed and had not yet invaded Afghanistan.  Two senior parliamentarians at the time were Enda Kenny and Terry Leyden, both of whom remain in Leinster House 35 years later and we are very grateful to them for their long service to the people.  Why is it only now, after a referendum was rejected, that this legislation is being offered?  Is it any wonder that people are disillusioned with the lack of answerability of the political process here?  The contempt for the popular will - expressed in a referendum - exhibited by all of the major parties in the intervening 35 years is Marie Antoinette-like in its disdain.  It is as if the Government is saying, "Let them eat cake" but the trouble is, the cake is 35 years old.</p><p>What objections have been raised to true Seanad reform?  There are two principle objections, the first being that we would be left with some kind of science fiction, mutant, pseudo-replica D&aacute;il and the second, we would have gridlock.  I will deal with those in a moment but before answering those charges, let us look at the widely acknowledged need for important, fundamental political reform and D&aacute;il reform in particular.  The current problems with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, from an outsider's perspective, are as follows: it is exclusively parochial in its selection; it is, unfortunately, somewhat ineffective in its procedures because of an imbalance of power between a strong, central Executive and relatively disenfranchised individual Deputies; and that the potential input of talented Deputies from the backbenches is thwarted by them being whipped to within an inch of their lives.  These are the problems.  We cannot fix all of them but if we did have the kind of reformed Seanad that has been espoused through two stages of votes in this House and which I believe has been given a mandate by the people in the referendum, we would have two very differently functioning Houses.</p><p>The D&aacute;il needs to reform itself.  There is probably a need for constitutional change to reform some of the procedures in the D&aacute;il.  Some of these issues have been discussed by the Constitutional Convention, from which all questions of Seanad reform were, in my opinion, inappropriately excluded.  In the Seanad, as Senator Zappone has said, we would have a very different Chamber.  We would not have people who were looking over their shoulder at a local political constituency in their local area.  We would have people who were elected through national mandates and who, through clever nomination processes, would be disproportionately associated with the areas of expertise which the Constitution has suggested they would be.  </p><p>A wise Government, troubled by the increasing popular scepticism concerning politics would, in response to the palpable hunger for reform, introduce true reform of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Instead, for the second time in a few months, we are being offered a pretence at reform and are being sold a pup.  It is important that we take the message from the people.  There is a real hunger for political reform in this country and it would be an awful shame to ignore it.  It was not a wallop, it was a mandate.  If the historical opportunity afforded to this Government by the people in the context of the Seanad referendum were ignored, that would be an awful shame.</p></speech>

There have been many discussions during the lifetime of the 24th Seanad on its work, composition and its very existence.  Senator Zappone has put forward some very convincing proposals in her motion today and I congratulate her on bringing the subject of Seanad reform before the House again.  So many of the arguments have been debated time and time again but this topic is so serious that whenever it arises, it deserves thoughtful consideration by the Government and Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The amendment sets out the Government's position with regard to reform of this House.  I agree with Senator Zappone on many of the issues in her motion and believe there is a good element of common ground in both the motion and the amendment.  I do not believe the debate today needs to be an adversarial one.  </p><p>  Fine Gael gave a commitment prior to the last general election that a referendum on the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann would be held.  The referendum was held and the people voted to retain this House.  However, it was very clear from the public discourse at the time that there is also a public appetite for reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As we are all aware, countless reports on Seanad reform are gathering dust, consigned to the scrap heap by successive Governments.  These reports, in the main, dealt with how the Seanad should be elected but no Government had the courage to implement the recommended reforms.  In the aftermath of the referendum result, my party leader, the Taoiseach, acted quickly by instructing the relevant officials to commence the drafting of legislation to enact the result of the 1979 referendum which will confer the right on all third level graduates to vote in future Seanad elections.  This must be welcomed as a wise first step on the road to reform.  We must, of course, listen to voice of the University Panel Senators and address their concerns, where possible.  </p><p>  Time never stands still and further, more comprehensive change is needed.  High-level reform of the general political system is urgently required to address the disconnect between the public and politics, which is a cause of concern in many democracies.  As Leader of the House, I have tried to reform the way the business of this House is conducted, despite the archaic rules and Standing Orders under which we work.  We set up a public consultation committee at the suggestion of the Independent nominees and have engaged with many organisations, including those dealing with the rights of older people and those dealing with the lifestyle changes needed to prevent cancer.  We have consulted with Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, CoderDojo and Change Nation, which inspired us with their ideas for improving Irish life and society.  Some of these consultations have produced reports which we submitted to the relevant Ministers, not only for debate but for action.  As long as we have the co-operation of the Government, we intend to continue with this work which gives a voice to people and groups that may not otherwise be heard by Government but which are, nonetheless, carrying out essential work in wider society.  </p><p>  Last year the House provided a platform for all Irish MEPs.  I invited all 12 MEPs to come before the House to discuss their particular areas of expertise and to inform us about the work of the committees of which they are members so that we, as legislators, are better informed about the procedures at European level before we are asked to enact legislation here in Ireland that has largely been drafted elsewhere.  This initiative was long overdue, especially given the importance of engaging with our representatives in Europe.  Our EU Commissioner, Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, also gave an excellent address to the House and spoke of the need for far greater dialogue between national politicians and EU representatives and institutions.  It is essential that we continue to review EU policy and the Commission's work programme in the months ahead.  </p><p>  As I have said on many occasions, the key role of this House is to improve and enhance legislation.  However, we can only deal with the work we are given to do.  The pipeline of legislation coming through the House is a source of great concern to me and most of my colleagues.  Indeed, it has been alluded to again today.  The pattern of having very little to do at the beginning of a term, followed by a raft of long, late sittings towards the end of each term, including the shortening of debates in some instances, is a long-standing one.  I know that the Minister of State is trying to initiate reforms to improve the process and I will support him in any way I can in ordering the business of this House.  However, better planning of their legislative priorities by the relevant Departments is needed so that we can avoid the peaks and troughs that seem, to me at least, to be avoidable.  </p><p>  I wish to advise the House that I intend to bring forward a number of my own proposals to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding the schedule of business in the House.  In order to avoid clashes between Oireachtas committee meetings and the Order of Business, I propose that we replace Adjournment debates with commencement debates, from 10.30 a.m. to 12.00 p.m, when the Order of Business would then take place.  Committees would meet from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and after 1.30 p.m. each day, which would avoid clashes with the Order of Business.</p> <p>Personally, I would prefer if we had one week dedicated to committee work each month.  That would benefit both Houses and committees, but I do not believe there is an appetite for it.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, comment on this?</p><p>Oireachtas committee reports should be referred to the Seanad for debate and we should explore the feasibility of committee Chairmen attending the House for such debates.  Reports from public bodies which are required to be laid before the Houses of Oireachtas and cover issues relating to Seanad panels should also be debated in the Chamber.  The Seanad should review EU policy and its work programme annually.  The Government&rsquo;s approval will be sought for the Seanad to have a formal role in the North-South Ministerial Council, as well as the British-Irish Council, and the relevant Minister would address the Seanad following each Council meeting.</p><p>Some of these changes will require the Government&rsquo;s backing.  I am sure a way to enable the Seanad to take on such work could be found.  I will keep the House informed on the progress of these proposals.  I welcome suggestions from any Senator or group who wishes to improve the way the House does its business.  The Minister of State will outline later that the Government has proposals, too.  There is a broad consensus on the need to reform the House, how it is elected and its day-to-day business.  This can only be done with the backing of the Government and the co-operation of Members.</p><p>I commend the amendment to the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900024#X00200"><p>I commend Senator Katherine Zappone for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion and Members for their views on the issue of Seanad reform.  The reason there are not many Fianna F&aacute;il Members present in the House today is they are attending the funeral of a close and young family member of a party colleague.  I am sure Members opposite will understand this.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion.  While not disagreeing entirely with the amendment, we will not be supporting it.  No Member is on a different page in the yearning for reform of this House and the political system.  If the media had covered it during the years- it would have done well to have done so - that message would have been received loud and clear by the public.  It is only through the grace of God, the efforts of some Members, not least the Leader, and some private commentators that the public, without being informed of the true work of this House during the years, took the decision to retain the Seanad last October.  Thank God for this.</p><p>The Seanad is a piece of infrastructure that belongs to the people ultimately and the democratic system the nation tries to embrace.  We support Senator Katherine Zappone&rsquo;s motion and would like all people to take a proactive role in voting in elections.  Fianna F&aacute;il has participated in the many debates and Bills on Seanad reform in the 12 years I have been a Member.  I am glad that the Taoiseach is making a move in the interim to implement the seventh amendment of the Constitution, a law of the land which was systematically ignored by all Governments in the intervening period.</p><p>This House has always been treated very badly by the Government of the day.  The Government is no different as it has chosen to ignore it.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and others, in their consideration of matters that relate specifically to Members and their work, have treated Members very badly.  One could not be blamed for thinking how these Ministers are dealing with parliamentary allowances and expenses for Members is a bitter retort to the outcome of the referendum on Seanad abolition.  This issue needs to be addressed and I, for one, am not afraid to do so.  It is better than sneaking around trying to impress on the Minister the need to sign a particular statutory instrument.</p><p>For many years Parliament has been subservient to the Cabinet.  That is why the people do not feel they have a sense of ownership of the policy platform pursued by the Government of the day.  The Taoiseach and the strongest personalities in the Cabinet tend to dictate how policy evolves.  The Whips tell parliamentary party colleagues that this is the party position and that if they do not like it, they can leave.  Every Member of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il will recall those words spoken in their respective parliamentary rooms.  This is the sad reality of the political system.  We live in a dictatorship disguised as a democracy.  That is the way it has been for many years.</p><p>In the 12 years I have been a Member, Senator Maurice Cummins has been the best Leader of the Seanad, particularly with regard to the improvements he has managed to make to the way we conduct our business, even within the constraints placed on him.  If we really want to reform the House, the Minister of State should abolish the Whip, make the Seanad responsible for the ratification of all public appointments and the scrutiny of all EU proposals.  While he agree with what I have said, there is no way in the wide earthly world that the powers that be in Government Buildings will allow it to happen because it would make the Chief Whip&rsquo;s job more difficult.  It would also make the House more transparent and accountable to the people, giving them a genuine sense of ownership of the policy platform of the day.  No Government - be it Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party - will allow this reform of the House for the same reason the Leader gave about the raft of legislation rammed down our throats at the end of every session.  That is the will of the Government.  The Taoiseach and the stronger personalities in the Cabinet insist on legislation getting through.  We have motions for earlier signature to suit the senior Ministers and, despite their great efforts in producing legislation, officials.  It does not suit the people and does nothing to enhance their belief in the political system.</p><p>In this nation we have no sense of state.  We have a great sense of community as shown by the raising of funds for local football clubs and so forth.  We are second to none for giving donations for the relief of natural disasters.  However, we have no sense of state because we have no ownership of the policy platform of the day.  It is not about Enda Kenny, Charlie Haughey, Garret FitzGerald or any of these people; it is about a system that is rotten to the core.  Democracy in this country is not democracy; it is a dictatorship.  Parliament is subservient to the Cabinet of the day.  If one wants real reform, that is what one has to change.  Hands up those Members who have been at a parliamentary party meeting, watched all of their colleagues agree with their position on a particular issue and the Minister say the opposite and that if one did not like it, one could leave as there was a queue of people outside the gate looking to take their place.  If we want real reform, we should not tell the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to investigate the issue of reform.  Imagine if it contacted the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to inform it that the Whip would not apply in the Seanad for the next six weeks as a pilot scheme to see what the people thought about it.  Do Members honestly think the Taoiseach would issue a press release with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government welcoming it?  The reform process afoot will end like the other 17, namely, in reports gathering dust on a shelf.</p><p>I commend Senators Katherine Zappone and John Crown for their contributions on Seanad reform.  Sadly, it is all in vain because we are subservient to the Cabinet of the day unless it has the political will to really reform.</p></speech>

It was a pleasure to campaign with Senator Katherine Zappone and Democracy Matters for the defeat of the referendum on Seanad abolition in October.  That defeat gives us a welcome chance and an imperative to reform.  On both sides of the debate, there was an understanding that if the Seanad was to continue after the referendum, it should be reformed fundamentally.</p> <p>I very much welcome the fact that a number of us met the Taoiseach on 18 December and that at that meeting a road map for progress - as a cyclist, I prefer to refer to it as a cycle path - was set out, which is reflected in the Government's counter motion which the Leader has proposed and I second.  The Leader has stated there is common ground and that we are all united on the need for reform.  The critical issue is how we go about it.  After many years of debate it is imperative that we have a clear timeframe and plan to make progress on reform.</p><p>The Taoiseach has made it clear that constitutional reform of the Seanad will not happen in the lifetime of the Government.  This sets out markers for what we can do.  Looking at the constitutional articles on the Seanad we can see fundamental reforms can be carried out through in legislation alone.  In a very welcome move the Government has at last commenced drafting legislation to implement the decision in the 1979 referendum on expanding the electorate for the university panels.  As a university Senator, I welcome this and know all of my colleagues on the university benches do so also.</p><p>There are two other means of reform we need to examine and they are set out in the Government's counter motion.  The first is operational reform, in other words, procedural reform of the Seanad, which will not even require legislation, for the most part.  This is where it is proposed parties and groupings in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad present proposals for operational or procedural reform to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Leader has, helpfully, set out some of his own proposals for reform which are very welcome.  It is worth noting that this Seanad has already instituted very important reforms such as the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, the extension of invitations to speak to MEPs and distinguished speakers such as Mrs. Mary Robinson, Mr. David Begg and others.  It would be very welcome to see us having stronger links with the sectoral committees by inviting the chairpersons of committees to brief us on the work they do to ensure links are strengthened with the committees, just as they have been strengthened with the European Parliament through the issuing of invitations to MEPs.  There are clear ways by which we can do this.</p><p>We all agree that we should have a greater role in the scrutiny of EU proposals, but we must be careful.  The committees have a hugely important scrutiny role and we do not want to see duplication.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which is scrutinising EU matters while others and I are here, I welcome the Leader's proposals to try to ensure fewer time clashes.  The committee scrutinises matters under the Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General of the Commission.  We must be careful, therefore, not to duplicate work.  Seanad Standing Orders 99 to 103, inclusive, already reflect additional powers we have following ratification of the Lisbon treaty and we should look closely at how best we can implement these powers without trespassing on the work being done by the sectoral committees.  We can issue reasoned opinions on whether EU legislative proposals comply with the principle of subsidiarity, but we must examine how best we can exercise these powers.  I very much welcome the Committee on Procedure and Privileges taking on detailed consideration of these operational changes.</p><p>I wish to focus on other changes to the Seanad electoral system which might be carried out through in legislation.  The Government's counter motion clearly sets out - this was the consensus at the meeting on 18 December - that a task force representative of various parties and groupings in the Houses of the Oireachtas will examine reform of the Seanad electoral system.  We must ensure any reform is within the terms of the Constitution, but we can make fundamental changes without amending the Constitution.  Two reform Bills, tabled by Senators Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone and Senator John Crown, have passed Second Stage and there is much common ground in the reforms they propose.</p><p>The Labour Party group in the Seanad has also tabled proposals to the parliamentary party which are under consideration on what we would like to see brought about by way of reform through legislation.  We have suggested four headings under which reforms should be made, the first of which is reform to the university panels which is under way.  The second is reform of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts 1947 to 2006 to provide for the composition of the electorate for the five panels.  I would very much welcome universal suffrage, as would my Seanad colleagues in the Labour Party group, and the proposal we have tabled is that the electorate comprise all of those resident in the jurisdiction, in other words, the local election register.  How to organise this raises complex issues such as whether it would be a national panel.  My colleagues and I believe it should be on a regional basis, perhaps in line with the European Parliament election constituencies.  Would voters have to opt for one of the five panels or would they have five separate votes?  These are the issues we would have to consider.  We have suggested voters have five votes.</p><p>The third reform heading is how those on the panels should be nominated.  We suggest that perhaps 500 persons whose names are on the Seanad electoral register be entitled to nominate, with the existing nominating bodies and local authorities.  All of this would need to be thought through in some detail.  </p><p>The fourth heading is the timing of Seanad elections.  This would be a critical change that could be made through legislation and it would really transform the way in which the House did its business and how Members were elected.  Under Article 18.8 of the Constitution, the Seanad election must take place not later than 90 days after the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  Legislation could, therefore, provide, as some of the Private Members' Bills do, that the election take place at the same time as the D&aacute;il election, thereby removing the propensity for many of us who fail to win seats in the D&aacute;il election to then run for the Seanad.  Serious logistical issues are raised about how a secret postal ballot would be organised on the same date as the D&aacute;il election.</p><p>These are matters which require to be dealt with through the task force which should be given a clear timeframe to report to the Government.  I ask the Chief Whip whether a clear timeframe can be set for the work of the task force.  The Government's counter motion clearly sets out this timeframe for the task force and the cycle path for progress towards reform on the need for which we are all agreed.</p></speech>

There were 112 combinations proposed between 1937 and 2013 for the reform of the Seanad.  They covered such matters as size and composition, elections, automatic re-election of the Cathaoirleach, terms and timing of elections, the filling of vacancies, nominations, the need for gender balance, vocational panels, regional versus national panels, university seats, the Taoiseach's nominees, the legislative process, votes for persons living in Northern Ireland, the European Union and internationally, national votes, secondary legislation, public appointments, public inquiries, policy reviews, petitions, the Order of Business, the right to address the Seanad, the membership of Senators of the Cabinet, the accountability of the Government to the Seanad, the nomination of the Cathaoirleach, the nomination of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the salaries of Senators and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  There were ten reports between 1937 and 2004.  We have also had Bills presented by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Senators Katherine and Feargal Quinn and Senator John Crown.  The question for us is where to begin.  As an Independent Senator, we must begin very quickly.</p></speech>

Many issues are involved and he has outlined many improvements which have been made in the lifetime of this Seanad.  I particularly welcome his reference to the need to avoid clashes because there is interference with committees, of which we are all well aware.  As we know, the Oireachtas joint committees do valuable work.  We must clear this logjam and the Leader has outlined proposals in this regard.  As Senator Ivana Bacik stated, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is meeting and I would like to be present as it is dealing with a very important question on improving the courts system through the provision of community courts.</p><p>The change to the university panels franchise will go ahead.  This was decided by the people in 1979 and we welcome the first steps being taken.  We should not become involved in reading tea leaves or crystal ball gazing as to why the people voted in the way they did.  It was a clear &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; question.  As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell stated, we are where we are and must get on with it.  It has been set out in a submission to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and a task force has been established.  We will take it from there.</p> <p> The public consultation invitation to distinguished speakers has been very useful.  I agree strongly with the Leader that people on both sides have long since recommended that the House should be allowed deal with the scrutiny of EU legislation.  There is unanimity on the issue.  I also agree that there should be a North-South dimension.  We all agree that universal reform of the political system both in this and the other House is needed.  The people have recognised that we as Senators have a role to play in our constitutional democracy.  In fact, we are an equal legislative Chamber to the D&aacute;il with the exception of money Bills.  The various suggestions of reform which were made during the referendum campaign must be set out in the context of the Constitution.  The provisions set out in Articles 18 and 19 would limit some of the changes some people would like to see in regard to the Seanad.  At the  core of this Chamber must be a role in the passage of legislation.  </p><p>Debates in this House tend to be less partisan and more constructive in nature than those that take place in the D&aacute;il.  Ministers of all hues down through the years have commented on the objectivity shown in this House.  Senator Feargal Quinn is aware of this, having had many amendments accepted over the years in this House.  This stems from the array of Senators who have particular expertise in their own backgrounds, whether it be professional, business, cultural or from a trade union perspective.  The election and appointment procedures in place make this possible.  I have noted the reforms mentioned by Senators prior to the referendum and here today but we do not want a replica of the other House.  No matter what is done, we must not have that.</p><p>Many share the view that the process by which Senators are elected and appointed is archaic and has it flaws.  Such processes have produced some excellent Senators, such as Mary Robinson, Joe O'Toole, well known to us, Catherine McGuinness and, more recently, Martin McAleese, all of whom have made strong contributions to Irish public life as well as on the international stage.</p><p>The concept of the vocational panel system obviously has merit in bringing forward candidates who come from different backgrounds and experience but, as has been said, maybe that method of election providing for the panels can be improved upon and the way in which the various bodies can nominate candidates to the Seanad election can provide an important link between the Oireachtas and key sectors of society.  This is even more relevant now as the country recovers from the years of mismanagement.  Such a system has nominated Senators who may not have managed to get through the party political process of nomination.  Similarly, local authority members need to be recognised as another vital link between members of the Oireachtas and local communities.  I do not think we would want to lose that link in its entirety in expanding the system of election if that is the route we take.</p><p>As set out in the amendment which arose from a meeting which the various party leaders had with the Taoiseach, we must present our proposals to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and get the task force established.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Zappone, Quinn and others for tabling the motion.</p><p>There are three areas to be considered: the promised democratic revolution which turned into a power grab; the national democratic deficit which has been in place for many years, as outlined by some speakers; and what is possible for the House to achieve.  </p><p>I will start with the issue of the power grab.  In recent months we have witnessed how the democratically elected &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was abolished.  The people who will sit there and decide how taxpayers' money is spent and how issues shall be resolved in the Gaeltacht are now going to be appointed.  That is not a step in the direction.  We witnessed reform painted as some panacea in local government when in fact we are seeing the dismantling of the democratically elected town councils, the merger of some areas and more powers being centralised.  I do not think anybody in the House would argue that is a good thing.  We have the least number of locally elected public representatives in Europe.  The current position is one locally elected public representative for every 5,000 people.  We rank second worst to the United Kingdom which has one locally elected public representative for every 2,500 whereas France has one public representative for every 98 people.  We are the worst in Europe when it comes to local democracy.  We witnessed the attempt to abolish the Seanad and centralise power in a dysfunctional Chamber in the D&aacute;il.  I am sure the Government Chief Whip recognises how dysfunctional it is and it continues to be the same.  Nothing has changed fundamentally in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>In terms of our national democratic deficit we see a system that failed in the run-up to the economic crisis.  The consensus politics which was in place in the making of a building bubble, a housing boom and bust is still there.  The basic fundamentals of that system, the committee system, the way legislation is passed, and the lack of accountability, are still in place today, therefore, we continue to have a national democratic deficit.  </p><p>In the local property tax legislation which was run through amendments had to be brought back in to rectify its failings.  We have had a debate on the Water Services Bill prior to Christmas and the organ donation legislation was debated in this House in August 2013.  The first EU directive on organ transplantation in the history of the State was signed into law by a Minister without a Deputy or Senator seeing it prior to it being brought into Irish law.  Some 80% of the laws made in Ireland every year are EU directives, which are amended by Ministers and no committee, Deputy or Senator sees them in advance.  As Members of the Seanad we should scrutinise EU directives separate from what is done by the committees.  The committees scrutinise some but not all of the EU laws made in Ireland every year.  </p><p>We are talking about what is possible for the Seanad.  An argument was made prior to the election that the House it elitist.  When the number of voters who are entitled to vote in any election is confined, therefore, it is elitist.  To offer to make it less elitist but still elitist in terms of the electorate is not genuine reform.  One cannot say that is real reform.  To turn around and say that if one had the opportunity to go to third level that one will be given a vote but if not, one will not be given a vote, is not the democratic revolution that people sought in the last general election.  All we had was a change of parties but there has not been a dramatic change in terms of the way business is done in this country.  What is also possible, as outlined by Senators Zappone, Crown and Quinn, is to open up the franchise to give those in the North and the Irish diaspora, some 800,000 people who live overseas, a say in this Chamber.  Every other European country, bar three, allows its overseas citizens a vote.  We are in poor company when we say that Greece, Malta and Cyprus, are the three countries, with Ireland who do not give votes to their overseas citizens.  However, in the Government's proposal only those who have third level degrees and who had to emigrate will have a vote in a reformed Seanad.  Some 800,000 overseas citizens have Irish passports, the equivalent of the populations of Galway, Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, and yet they do not have a say in this Parliament.  They should have a say in this House we should have a more democratic House.</p> <p>How it is elected is important but what it does is far more important because these Houses have not been reformed in any real way.  The system that failed the people and caused an economic collapse is still in place.  The infrastructure has not changed.  All that has changed are the people involved but the structure remains the same.  The system that failed remains and it will fail again because the reform that should have happened has not happened.  We must see that reform to ensure that the system does not fail the people again.</p></speech>

It is good to see him here for this particular debate.  I welcome also that we are having this debate and congratulate Senator Zappone and her colleagues for putting the motion before the House.  I am clear that when the Irish people voted on 5 October they voted to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There is no doubt that they did not vote for business as usual and as many colleagues have said, the issue is where we go from here.  Numerous reports and Bills on reform of the Seanad have been proposed in this House.  Those reports and Bills presented a number of options, some of which involve constitutional reform and some of which do not.  Most of the proposals, with the exception of Senator Crown's Bill, involve the Seanad having additional powers, which would be welcome.  That flows in the face of some of the measures announced recently that do not involve Senators and with which some of us might have a difficulty.</p><p>It is important to recognise that there are many different views on the proposals that may be worthy of consideration and how they should be pursued.  I have always been of the view that the matter of Seanad reform should have been put to the Constitutional Convention.  I do not believe that the Seanad should have been examined in isolation from the rest of the political system.  I am a member of the Constitutional Convention and it is interesting that we will shortly be looking at D&aacute;il reform but, again, that will be examined in isolation from the rest of the political system and will not include Seanad reform.</p><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Bacik, that there is no reason reform cannot be incremental.  I understand there is an attractiveness in looking at reform in an incremental fashion, particularly reform that does not require constitutional referendum.  I know there is a sense of concern that there may be fatigue among the people regarding numerous constitutional referenda being put before them.  However, if we are to be true to the people's mandate, and we must respect the people's mandate, we must approach the issue of reform in a more general way than simply looking at non-constitutional reform.  If we are to be true to the people's mandate we must go back to what I would call first principles and ask what the Seanad is for and how it fits into the overall political system.  In that context we must have real discussion on Seanad reform, which cannot exclude the position of the Seanad in the Constitution.</p><p>The Constitutional Convention was one of the most exciting commitments in the programme for Government and in spite of the naysayers, it has proven to be one of the most significant developments that has taken place in the general political debate in the past 12 months.  The Constitutional Convention was weakened by not being able to discuss the matter of Seanad reform and I was disappointed that when the matter was raised from the floor by our colleague, there was a clear representation by the chair that the matter could not be considered by the convention.  Even allowing for that, it was a narrow defeat.</p><p>I have been impressed by the standard of debate in the Constitutional Convention and I genuinely believe that every strand of society is represented there.  Some of the members' comments on the overall political system have been interesting.  For example, clientalism was seen as a distinctive feature of the Irish political system.  For example, some of the convention's proposals would include the majority view that Ministers, on their appointment, should resign their D&aacute;il seats on the grounds, as expressed in the debate, that it would allow them get on with the job and not spend their time fixing potholes and addressing the needs of their constituencies.  We cannot go forward by simply saying it will not be business as usual but we should examine the Constitution with a view to determining, for example, how we can change the way in which Senators are elected.  To do that would simply give us Seanad light, for want of a better term, and we will end up with a representation of the D&aacute;il in the Seanad.</p><p>A number of issues should be considered when we consider D&aacute;il reform.  There is a general view, as expressed at the Constitutional Convention, that we lack expertise in the political system.  There is a view also that we are here to serve the local community rather than the general public interest.  There is another view that diversity and the representation of minority communities is not achieved through the current electoral system.  If we want to be serious about Seanad reform, we cannot close the door on constitutional reform.  By focusing only on reform that can be achieved through legislative change we will end up tinkering at the margins and not getting to the real issues of why we want a Seanad and its purpose.</p><p>We have had a referendum on the university panels, and I agree the Government should proceed with that.  It is many years too late but as a first step on a route map to genuine Seanad reform it is at least one gesture towards reform that we can make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900027#AA00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome and I am glad to see him in the House for this valuable debate.  On 4 October over 634,000 people voted to ensure that the Seanad would not be abolished.  I suspect that for many citizens, 4 October was the first time they had the chance to cast any type of vote relating to the Seanad.  The question now is how long they will have to wait before they can have a say in Seanad elections.  Will they have a say in the elections?</p><p>It is often asserted that this House cannot agree on a series of reform measures yet earlier this month Democracy Matters published a paper that set out six core principles around which this House can unite, and Senator Zappone has included some of them in her motion.</p><p>The Seanad Bill 2013, which Senator Zappone and I published, and the Bill published by Senator Crown, light the path towards reform of this House, and today's motion rightly focuses on two of those fundamental principles, namely, universal suffrage and one person, one vote as a starting point for reform.  I hope these are two principles on which this House can unite.</p><p>Some 43 Members of this House are elected by a cohort of county councillors, and 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach.  Of the 60 Members of this House, I am one of only six people who are elected by a significant number of people from around the country, Northern Ireland and throughout the world.  During the referendum campaign, many critics of this House labelled the Seanad as being elitist and unrepresentative.  I agree with those assertions.  However, I find it incomprehensible that any Taoiseach would want to maintain a Seanad electoral system whose underlying principle seems to be one councillor, seven votes.  That is the position with a number of county councillors who have five votes automatically and if they happen to have degrees from two universities, they get seven votes.  That is an intolerable situation when the majority of citizens have no vote.  As democrats, we cannot allow that to continue.</p><p>Opening up the electoral process to citizens at home and abroad, as well as to people in Northern Ireland, will deeply enrich the political dynamite of this House.  Since the economic collapse some years ago, there has been much navel-gazing about how Ireland can best harness the views and the confidence of the diaspora who are scattered throughout the world.</p> <p>However, one of the best ways to achieve this is by opening up the Seanad elections to citizens around the world, as proposed in Senator Katherine Zappone's motion.  In the face of Government inaction on Seanad reform the public may be without a voice in Seanad elections for the foreseeable future.  As a result of the Government's plans to implement the 1979 referendum result, the ranks of the privileged who hold university qualifications that entitle them to vote in Seanad elections will be added to, while those without a voice in Seanad elections will continue to be ignored.  The extension of the franchise to vote in Seanad elections to more graduates can only ever be a small first step towards reform; it is not of itself real reform.  </p><p>Since the referendum people have occasionally stopped me to ask me what the Seanad had done to reform itself.  In Democracy Matters we marked the passing of 100 days since the referendum and highlighted Government inaction in the delivery of reforms, but as a House we have yet to deliver the reforms which are within our gift.  It was interesting to listen to the Leader and hear some of the proposals he was making.  They are worthy of consideration and we should make sure we give them consideration, but anybody who has spent any time following the proceedings of this House can clearly see that it is dysfunctional, despite the efforts of the Leader and others to do something about this.  It is imperative that its business and workings be reformed through changes to Standing Orders.  It needs a more clearly defined role that reflects its constitutional mandate as a House of the Legislature, not just that of a mini-D&aacute;il.  </p><p>There is an opportunity to make this House more reflective of the gender balance in society.  The Bill Senator Katherine Zappone and I put through includes such a measure.  In failing to implement reforms we do not do justice to ourselves and the people who place their trust in the reform agenda.  In the absence of reform, the Seanad will remain elitist, undemocratic and unrepresentative.  The reluctance to deliver root and branch reform plays into the hands of those who like everything just the way it is.  It disappoints me somewhat to have to say this, but the only people I know who want to keep the Seanad the way it is are some of my fellow Senators.  We should make sure we listen very carefully, but more than this we should do something about it also.</p><p>Last October, some weeks after the referendum, the Taoiseach came to the House with the stated intention of hearing Senators' reform proposals.  He followed this up with a number of meetings with party leaders in December and I was one of several people who called on him to establish a Seanad reform task force which should comprise a mix of Members of the Seanad as well as people outside the House.  Why should the incumbents of the House be the sole deciders of its future?  I know the Taoiseach was unhappy with the referendum result, but rather than walk away from the Seanad, he should grasp the opportunity to reform it and take all of the criticisms the Government levelled at it during the campaign and fix the underlying problems that had given rise to them.  He has been given the answer which is included in Senator Katherine Zappone's motion.  If he took hold of it, it would enhance his reputation and he would be able to look back and say he was the one who reformed the Seanad and made it democratic and worthy of consideration.  He should accept the motion.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Katherine Zappone and all those involved in the attempts to have further engagement on the issue because we all agree that we have a mandate from the people for the reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We all agree that reform must happen in order to give the people an institution they can trust and believe in.  The Taoiseach has taken the first steps by initiating what was agreed to 31 years ago but not enacted by any party since, namely, that graduates of third level institutions be given a vote and that the mandate be broadened.  The Taoiseach has signalled that this will be done.  The electoral system has been mentioned in ten reports.  It has not been agreed in them that ours is the ideal system and we agree that it must be examined.  </p><p>The aim of the education system should be to ensure all children attend college, regardless of type, suited to their intelligence.  University is not necessarily suitable for everyone.  There are multiple intelligences and the sooner we recognise that everybody has a sphere of intelligence the better.  Everybody should be included as being worthy of having a vote.  I would like to see the institutions of State engaged in education and the level of participation examined to establish for whom they cater.  We should examine the level of engagement in third level education on a socio-economic basis, who qualifies in that respect and assist those not catered for in third level academia by way of the nominee system by the Taoiseach.  A interesting socio-economic study of engagement in third level education was conducted by Mr. Duffy and Mr. McCarthy and it should be examined in the context of this debate to ensure that if we extend the franchise in Seanad elections, as many people as possible are included.  I pose the question of whether granting universal suffrage which is worthy of debate would result in this House being a replication of the D&aacute;il.  Senator Katherine Zappone argues that it would not be.  The constitutional motivation for having the Seanad and the reason it was formed was to provide for gaining the views of those from contrasting backgrounds with experience and expertise.  Providing for universal suffrage would not guarantee this because, in theory, those elected could all be footballers, pop singers or doctors.  It would not ensure we would have people from contrasting backgrounds with experience and expertise.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his 11 nominees.  He selected nominees from contrasting backgrounds with experience and expertise.  He lived up to the principle in the Constitution.  It was the first time the nominees had been selected from outside party politics, for which the Taoiseach must be commended.  An interesting point to note is that if Ireland were to opt for a system of direct election to the Seanad or universal suffrage, it would literally be the only small, non-federal country in Europe to do so.  This was said by Mr. David Farrell of the School of Politics at UCD in 2013. </p><p>In the interests of democracy, I welcome the proposal for the establishment of an all-party Seanad reform task force.  The Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, has enunciated how that task force would work.  I look forward to its report which I think the Minister of State said would be published in early 2014, or else I read this elsewhere.  I am not a member of the task force.  Does &quot;in early 2014&quot; mean that the report will be published in the first six months of the year?</p><p>The Leader mentioned various reforms, some of which I had written down.  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to 112 proposals; there are, therefore, many proposals that could be examined.  Political reform of this House, the D&aacute;il and the committee system is very necessary.  Every speaker who has contributed to the debate has spoken about this and how the Oireachtas committee schedule clashes with Seanad business.  This is not good either for the work of the committees or that of the Seanad; both inevitably suffer as a result.  Several years ago there was all-party agreement that there be a week dedicated to committee hearings.  If we were to implement that proposal, we would do the legislative process a great favour.  </p><p>As the Leader mentioned, previous reports on Seanad reform recommended that the Seanad be given a role in scrutinising EU legislation.  Taking into consideration the fact that 60% of our laws come from the European Union, this is an ideal House in which to ensure proper scrutiny of EU legislation.  Many speakers have spoken about the lackadaisical scrutiny of such legislation.  Therefore, it is necessary that consideration be given to the timing and planning of legislation to ensure its efficient and effective delivery and implementation.</p> <p>Our Leader spoke about that.  I also support the recommendation that the Seanad have responsibility for examining public service appointments and reviewing the performance of all Departments and State agencies.  We need a review of State agencies, as demonstrated last week.  Another reform measure implemented over the past two years is opening up the Seanad to the wider community and bringing various groups into the Seanad.  The Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, deserves credit.  It is envisaged that this offers a real opportunity for building bridges with citizens.  The Leader spoke about MEPs.  As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I agree this is another area that could be considered.</p></speech>

I also thank her for keeping the issue on the agenda and I thank Senator Quinn and Democracy Matters for their very good and constructive work in campaigning on this issue and for listening to a range of ideas, voices and opinions in formulating policies and ideas on Seanad reform, which is very useful for all of us.  Sinn F&eacute;in published proposals on D&aacute;il reform and Seanad reform today.  There is a range of opinion and there is much common ground between the issues that arise when we examine all the voices seeking real reform of the Seanad.</p><p>We must accept that we had a referendum in October and the people had their say.  While it was the Government's intention to see the Seanad abolished, the people voted for reform.  I think they voted for radical reform as I doubt many people who voted &quot;No&quot; were voting for minimalist reform.  They wanted real and radical reform and they want to see a second Chamber that is fit for purpose, democratic and representative of citizens of the State and that can play a more powerful and valuable role in the overall running of the State and the Oireachtas.  During the campaign, some of us turned up for the debate and some did not.  We saw what happened when the Taoiseach failed to properly debate the issue.  It had an impact on the outcome of the vote.  There were many voices campaigning to save the Seanad and calling for a &quot;No&quot; vote on the basis of reform.  While I campaigned for abolition because it was a simple proposition put to us, I always wanted to see the option of reform put to the people.</p></speech>

I have not seen any evidence from the Government that it has that intention.  I was part of a delegation from Sinn F&eacute;in, as the Minister and the Chief Whip know, when the Taoiseach invited party leaders to a meeting to discuss his views and his approach.  It seemed to us at that meeting, and from everything we heard since, that the Government would go for minimalist reform.  The only reform option we have seen is to extend the university franchise to all citizens.  That is not radical and it does not go far enough.</p></speech>

The Constitutional Convention is meeting this weekend and may discuss the future of the Seanad.  The Taoiseach and the Oireachtas should give the Constitutional Convention a fresh mandate to properly examine Seanad and D&aacute;il reform in the wake of the referendum results.  We should properly ventilate all of the ideas and return with proposals, and then the Government can examine the proposals.  In doing so, it would be appropriate for the Government to set clear parameters and guiding principles that will underpin Seanad reform.  The first guiding principle in reforming the House is universal franchise - one person, one vote - for all citizens.  We cannot continue with the method of election to Seanad Eireann that we have had for far too long, in which people are elected by city or county councillors or if they are fortunate enough to be members of certain universities.  That has to stop, as it is elitist and undemocratic.  If we want to citizens to have real value in the Seanad and a real connection to it, we must give them a vote.  My view is that we have one person, one vote, and holding Seanad elections on the same day as D&aacute;il elections is the best way to proceed to something I would like to see.  That is one of the core principles that should underpin reform of the Seanad.</p><p>There is consensus on giving a voice to the Irish diaspora and citizens in the North from either side of the community.  If we want to build bridges and work toward unity in the country, we must give a voice to people across the island of Ireland.  Far too many people living in the North of Ireland are Irish and are disenfranchised.  They are not seen or valued by the State as part of the Irish nation.  If we give citizens in the North a vote in Seanad elections, it would be a very good and useful step towards Irish unity.  It would also be the right thing to do.</p><p>We should have equal gender balance.  That is difficult to achieve, but we should aim for 50% representation of women in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I am one of the people who supported the Government's gender quotas and the instruments the Government brought in to help achieve increased gender representation in the D&aacute;il.  We must also do so in the Seanad.  There should be representation of marginalised minority groups.  The Seanad can examine this point.</p><p>I did not get a chance to discuss the powers of the Seanad, one of which should be to scrutinise EU legislation.  There is consensus on that point.  We are up for real and radical reform.  I hope the Government and the Taoiseach are too.  I do not want to end up in a situation after the next D&aacute;il election in which we elect Senators in the same way as we have done for decades.  That would be a failure of the political system.  We need to get this right and to push for as much reform as possible.  I commend Senators who have been active on the issue and have pursued it relentlessly.  They have used their Private Members' time on several occasions to ensure we have proper debate in the House.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste met party leaders in December, as mentioned by Senator Bacik and others, and are taking a consultative approach, which is welcome.  The vote of the Irish people to retain the Seanad last October was accompanied by a widespread consensus among the public and Senators alike that the issue of Seanad reform needed to be addressed.  There is no mistaking how tangible is the sentiment that the Upper House should evolve into a more democratic institution relevant to the needs of our ever-changing and developing society.  In particular, strong views exist that the Seanad should lead the reform process by facing squarely up to the major issues and dealing with them objectively and comprehensively.  I acknowledge the point made by Senator Zappone and the other eight senators that no provision of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann requires that the electorate in Seanad elections be composed of such a restricted group as elected city and county councillors, outgoing Seanad Members and incoming D&aacute;il Deputies.</p> <p>I have no difficulty with the proposal and would welcome the extension of the franchise for the Seanad.  It is perfectly understandable that many voters find it hard to feel a connection to this institution when they have no hand, act or part in electing the Members.  However, it must be acknowledged that we are elected or appointed primarily by those who have themselves been elected by the people and so, in a sense and albeit indirectly, are representative of the people.  It must also be noted that if the franchise is fully extended to the general public, the danger exists of the Upper House becoming a "mini-D&aacute;il", which would be regrettable, as one is clearly enough.</p><p>The noble beauty of the Seanad is that it primarily centres its discussions on the bigger picture of how to improve the lives of Irish people without getting bogged down in parish pump politics; that is as it was intended when it was created.  Having said that, there is no mistaking that Irish citizens currently see a major gap between themselves and this House.  As such, it is important that any reform should give a much greater public legitimacy to this House while ensuring its composition differs from that of the D&aacute;il.  In addition, it is important to enhance the prospects of people with particular valued expertise being able to make a contribution to the work of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I would like to see a division of labour between the two Houses of the Oireachtas and identification of important jobs that currently fall between the cracks in our political parliamentary system, which other Senators have alluded to.</p><p>I would like to see a stronger role for the House in the areas of legislative consultation, and the Seanad - at least physically - played a very significant role in the legislative process in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  That example illustrates how this House could be used, although I accept that both Senators and Deputies were in the House for those consultations.  Consultations with the committees of the Houses, as mentioned by Senator Bacik, are a good idea, and scrutiny of EU legislation is something that has long been held as a job that could be carried out in this House to great effect.  We should be careful what we wish for, as we do not want legislation coming in for the sake of it, and we want to avoid repetition, as Senator Bacik noted.</p><p>At this point it is important to note that the Government has agreed that legislation may be prepared by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to implement the 1979 referendum decision, which allows the State to extend the provisions for the election of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann by certain universities to other institutions of higher education in the State.  The Government has also confirmed that when the heads of the Bill are ready, they will be circulated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and other stakeholders, including the institutions of higher education in the State for consideration.  Moreover, this Government has agreed that the question of constitutional reform, which would require a referendum or referendums, can be considered at a later date.  I am fully aware that in the course of reform, difficult decisions will have to be taken involving sensitive political matters.  If progress is to be made, there is a need to accept the political reality that Seanad &Eacute;ireann must be reformed if it is to evolve into a more relevant entity which can make a viable and distinctive contribution to the economic, social and political affairs of our country.</p><p>The decision of the Irish people last October was not to abolish the Seanad.  There is an important distinction, and although we may surmise that there was a decision to reform the Seanad, in reality the decision was not to abolish the House.  That referendum has injected a new sense of purpose into Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I am confident that with the appropriate reform, the Seanad will be empowered to make a major contribution to meeting the challenges facing 21st century Ireland.</p></speech>

We all agree they did a magnificent job in that regard.  Unfortunately, a great opportunity was lost during those debates in the referendum because the Government decided to focus on a &euro;20 million saving.  All the other debate, which could have been constructive and very helpful, was left until the very last weeks.</p><p>One is tempted to ask who came up with the bright idea at all of a referendum on abolishing the Seanad.  Many reasons have been put forward in this respect but one is particularly evident; the powers that be perhaps saw the Seanad as a nuisance because it had a view on what the Government was doing and put a brake on it while it scrutinised national and European policies.  If that is correct, it is a sad indictment which is in many ways undermining what democracy should be about.  However, we are where we are, and that is why it is significant that the same Senators have not left the field.  They are here and want to respond to what they believe are the wishes of the people.  There is no doubt that part of the decision, although not necessarily all the decision, was based on the idea that reform was expected.</p><p>It is not in our remit to bring about reform as a Seanad and very often people pose the question why this is so.  One of the reasons it took a long time to create an interest in the debate was a lack of profile of the Seanad.  One need only consider, for example, the absence of coverage of some of the foremost debates we have had in this House.  The only time I have seen the Gallery overflowing with media people was when controversy or a fight was expected.  It is still empty, although people may be listening in their offices.</p><p>There is a way to improve this issue.  A number of Bills were brought forward independently and by what we will call the &quot;Opposition&quot;.  I will give an example of a Bill I introduced on the release of the details of the 1926 census.  Everybody on the Government side spoke in favour of the Bill but the Government could not accept it.  The Bill should have been progressed to Committee Stage so many of the issues in it could be discussed.  The other evening we had a debate on sign language for the blind and the same thing happened; it was evident that we all held the same view but the Bill was stymied.</p><p>I fully agree with the idea of one vote for each citizen, as it is not a problem.  The Government must be genuine and committed in responding to the wishes to the people.  It must endeavour to allow us have a meaningful role and not feel that at all times we must be obstructed.  I hope there will be a further debate after this evening and we can continue to tease out the issue and put forward proposals to the Government.</p></speech>

I support the broad principles of reform, although I do not support all the details in the proposal.  All Senators in the House should be elected, as this is one way of getting away from group-think and the Government control of the Seanad through the very rigid Whip system.  We can consider what happened during the economic collapse and wonder if we have learned anything.  It was caused by a property bubble, an international downturn in property and the failure of regulatory authorities but there was also a significant failure of Parliament to hold the Government and Departments to account.  In order to avoid a repeat of that, we should move to a system where all Members are elected.</p> <p>The elephant in the room is Dail reform, which is much more urgent than Seanad reform.  That said, I fully support Seanad reform, which is urgently required.  I put it to the Government Chief Whip that the Government has systematically broken its programme for Government pledge not to guillotine Bills.  A total of 63% of Bills have been guillotined to date.  The ramming through of the Bill relating to Irish Water just before Christmas in a single day in the Lower House has led to an overstaffed conglomerate that is a profligate entity with total disregard for the hard-pressed taxpayer.  The Government failed to implement its programme for Government commitment to allow for two weeks between Stages of Bills.  Ministers only respond to little more than half the number of Topical Issues raised, which is evidence of disregard for the House.  The Government continues to engage in cronyism in appointments made to State boards-----</p></speech>

I am a somewhat of that view in terms of Seanad reform.  If the opportunity arose we would not start from here.  It is pity previous Governments did not take the opportunity to reform the House.  I agree with some of what has been proposed by Senator Zappone and others supporting the motion.  I agree that people should be elected by the public.  That said, the university panels are good and they provide good people.  I would not just throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement on the night of the referendum defeat that he was prepared to move on the 1979 referendum straight away.  That was a positive step in the right direction.  We must make a decision on what we can do now.  The Taoiseach clearly said the Government would not hold another referendum.  Therefore, we can only operate on the basis of passing legislation to alter this House.  The task force is a good idea.  Anyone who has ideas, be they Senators, other Members of the Oireachtas or members of the public, should bring them forward.  That should happen straight away.</p><p>I have an idea that could be introduced straight away to provide universal suffrage but it would mean the Taoiseach would have to give up something that is very important to him and future taoisigh, namely, the prerogative of choosing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominees.  They should be chosen by election.  Legislation could be passed in this House and in the other House to allow for 11 people to be elected by means of an electoral process.  They should be elected in 11 single-seat constituencies throughout the country.  Those who are elected would become the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  That would not be easy to do, as it is radical, but it would be legitimate reform and could be considered.  In conjunction with the 1979 referendum we would move towards the immediate reform of one third of the House.  We must be realistic.  The vocational panels would require a Seanad referendum to be properly reformed.  I do not have a solution to the provision of universal suffrage.  I do not envisage a system whereby anyone could put themselves forward for the administrative panel, for example, or the agriculture panel.  That will not happen.  This is a time when voter turnout for referendums is 35%.  People will not register for a vote on a particular panel.</p><p>We are also restricted somewhat due to legacy issues.  The Seanad was constituted in 1937.  It was a time of economic war.  The Second World War had not yet started, and the Cold War had not yet started, but it has since come and gone.  We should leave aside any of the views that are stuck in the past relating to when we were constituted in 1937.  We should look to the future &ndash; 2037 &ndash; and how we can be relevant at that time.</p></speech>

I am a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee but I have no problem with what Senator D&rsquo;Arcy suggested.  One of the things that has affected me is getting to know my colleagues in the Seanad.  As has been pointed out, this is another light week in the Seanad.  We are closing early this evening.  There is not a lot of legislation for us to scrutinise this week.  One thing I do know about my fellow Senators is that we are here to serve all Irish citizens.  We all know the evolutionary process that is needed just to survive in business in today&rsquo;s world.  The Irish population has never been more disillusioned or dissatisfied with us politicians.  Could we please come together and take some radical steps within the Constitution to reform ourselves so that we can be an example to the citizens who vote to keep us here?  As Senator Zappone said, if we do not get something done before the end of the term it will be another seven years before anything can happen.  I hand over to Senators Bradford and Healy Eames.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be a signatory to the motion.  I thank Senator Zappone and Senator Quinn for leading on the matter.  We are talking about Seanad reform again.  We await the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, because a roadmap needs to be laid out today on how serious, rigorous reform of the Seanad will take place.  We could not have received a better mandate from the people.  We got a mandate to retain and reform the Seanad.  I wish to see the principle of one person, one vote being upheld.  While I accept that the Taoiseach has given a commitment to implement the terms of the 1979 referendum, we must be careful that we do not create another new elite, something Government Senators accused the Seanad of being in the previous election, by just giving the franchise to university graduates.  Let us not perpetuate another new elite.</p><p>My second point is simple.  I do not want to see party politics in the Seanad.  We could have a simple vote to decide issues.  The Seanad could become the thinking House and the place for policy formulation for the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.  However, we all know in advance that the response of the Government will be a continuation of Government policy towards the Seanad, which is one of deep and utter cynicism.  Fortunately, the people thought differently.</p><p>It is interesting to debate the motion this afternoon, but it will be much more interesting to debate the motion in late May or early June in the aftermath of the local and European elections, because it is only at that stage that politicians will universally accept that the winds of change are blowing through the political system and that the same is simply not good enough.</p><p>I would welcome an extension of the university panel system but the debate would have to be about allowing every single citizen of the State to vote in Seanad elections.  I am disappointed to hear Government Members say that is not possible and that no further referendums will take place.  It is not necessary to hold a referendum to extend the franchise universally.</p> <p>If we are serious about changing politics and encouraging participation, step one in regard to the Seanad must be universal franchise, where every citizen of this country is equal and has a vote in the Seanad election.</p></speech>

I thank them all.  I would like to thank my constituency colleague, who has always played politics and is good at it.  I assure Members he played the man this afternoon.

The subject of this debate is important and I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to it.  Seanad reform was much discussed during the recent referendum.  There was consensus on all sides that, whatever else, there was little appetite for the Seanad to continue in its present form.  Now that the people have given their decision, we must all look at how the Seanad can be reformed so that it serves its purpose as a 21st century House of Parliament.</p><p>The debate on reforming the Seanad is not new.  As we know, since 1937 there have been numerous reports and policy papers on how the Seanad might be reformed.  Indeed, many of these got an airing during the referendum campaign.  The challenge now facing the various parties and groupings in both Houses is to produce proposals for practical, implementable reform, and to do this quickly and effectively.  The reforms that have been proposed down the years, and more recently through draft legislation and policy papers, fall into two broad areas.  The first relates to the role and functions of the Seanad and how it carries these out, while the second concerns how the members of the Seanad are nominated and elected.</p><p>As the House will know, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste met the leaders of the different parties and groupings in the D&aacute;il and Seanad before Christmas to get their views on what areas should be reformed and how we should proceed to develop and implement appropriate reform proposals.  There was a very good discussion at that meeting and all present had the opportunity to express their views.  The meeting identified three possible ways in which reform could proceed and I will deal with these in turn.  The first involves operational or procedural reform.  Proposals can be developed as regards both the work of the Seanad and the manner in which that work is carried out.  The second involves legislation that would be necessary in order to reform the Seanad electoral system.  Finally, change could be implemented by way of constitutional amendment, but this would entail reverting to the people in another referendum. </p><p>To return to procedural reform, there was agreement at the meeting between the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and the party leaders and groups that procedural reform should proceed immediately.  I am sure Senators will agree that there are many ways in which the operation of the Seanad can be improved.  The parties and groups were invited to present their proposals for procedural reform to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I urge all involved to do this.  Procedural reform should be the quickest and easiest way to make progress, and the sooner we start the better.  The Government will submit its proposals to the committee through the Leader of the Seanad and I expect that this will be done in the coming weeks.</p><p>In urging parties and groups to bring forward their proposals in this area, I would like to highlight the excellent work that has already been done by the Seanad Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, in improving the work of the House.  The initiatives he has brought forward since becoming Leader were praised by all sides of the House during the debate on the referendum, and rightly so.  I think it is fair to say that there is widespread consensus on all sides of the House that the way the Seanad operates can be enhanced within current constitutional and legislative frameworks.  Another area that received a significant airing during the referendum campaign was the role of the second House in regard to EU scrutiny.  I believe there is considerable scope for reform in these and other areas.</p><p>The focus of the motion before the House today is on legislative reform.  As I already said, this primarily involves reform of the Seanad electoral system.  The electoral system for the Seanad is complex and it may be worth briefly recapping exactly how it works.  The Constitution provides for the election of 49 of the 60 members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The other 11 members are nominated by the Taoiseach of the day.   The current Taoiseach made imaginative choices in selecting his nominees, the first time ever a Taoiseach broadened the selection of nominees.  I am glad to recall that even during the height of the referendum campaign there was widespread recognition of that fact.</p></speech>

These are elected in two constituencies, three by the National University of Ireland and three by the University of Dublin.  A separate register of electors is maintained for each constituency and the elections are run separately by the respective universities.  At the 2011 Seanad election, there were some 98,000 voters on the National University of Ireland register and some 53,000 on the University of Dublin register, just over 151,000 voters combined.  There is no prohibition on being registered to vote in both constituencies.</p><p>An important point arises in regard to the universities' franchise.  In 1979 the people of Ireland approved by referendum the extension of the university franchise to other institutions of higher education in the State.  That was 35 years ago this year.  It is remarkable that until now no government has acted on the outcome of that referendum.  However, the current Government is going to address that situation.  Heads of a Bill are currently being prepared by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to implement the 1979 constitutional amendment and reform the arrangements for the election of the six university members.</p><p>The legislation will provide for a single six-seat constituency and for one register of electors.  The franchise will be extended to all holders of a degree, or equivalent qualification, from an institution of higher education in the State.  It is intended that a broad definition would be applied so as to include universities, institutes of technology, other higher education institutions and private colleges.  This will represent a significant expansion of the electorate in line with the outcome of the 1979 referendum.  The general scheme of the Bill to extend the university franchise will be brought to Government in the corning weeks and there will be ample opportunity for input into the preparation of the legislation.  The Government has agreed that the general scheme of the Bill will be referred to the Seanad, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and other stakeholders, including the institutions of higher education in the State, for their consideration.  Feedback from the consultation process will help inform the preparation of the Bill.</p><p>The Constitution provides that the remaining 43 elected members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann are elected by Oireachtas Members and by members of city and county councils from five panels of candidates containing the names of persons having knowledge and practical experience of a range of interests and services.  The Constitution further provides that these elections are to be regulated by law, subject of course to the provisions of the Constitution.  The election of the so-called panel members is governed by the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947.  Five Senators are elected from cultural and education panel, 11 are elected from the agriculture panel, 11 are elected from the labour panel, nine are elected from the industry and commerce panel and seven are elected from the administrative panel.</p> <p>There are two sub-panels of candidates for each panel.  Candidates are nominated to these panels by nominating bodies and Oireachtas Members.  The Clerk of the Seanad, as Seanad returning officer, maintains the register of bodies entitled to nominate.  To be eligible for registration as a nominating body, an organisation must be concerned mainly with, and be representative of, the interests and services of one or other of the panels.  A body cannot be registered in respect of more than one panel, and organisations which are mainly profit-making concerns are not eligible for registration.</p><p>Those entitled to vote at an election of the 43 panel members are the Members of the incoming D&aacute;il, the Members of the outgoing Seanad and members of the county and city councils.  Each elector has only one vote in respect of each panel, even if he or she is qualified in more than one respect.  So, for example, an outgoing Senator elected to the D&aacute;il at the general election could not vote both as an outgoing Member of the Seanad and an incoming Member of the D&aacute;il.  The electorate for the 43 panel members numbered about 1,109 for the 24th Seanad.  It will number 1,167 for the 25th Seanad - that is 158 new Deputies; 60 outgoing Senators and 949 local authority members.  </p><p>The motion put down by Senator Zappone and other Senators calls for legislative reform of the Seanad within the existing terms of the Constitution but reflecting what the motion describes as two core principles, namely, that each citizen should have a vote in the general elections of the Seanad and that there should be one person, one vote in such elections.  The motion mentions that some citizens have up to seven votes in a Seanad general election, while other citizens have no vote at all.  It is important to clarify that the current entitlement to vote at Seanad panel elections arises not from citizenship but from holding elected office.  If it was the intention, in framing the Constitution, that there would be a universal franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, then the Constitution would have so provided and the provisions on the election of the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann would have mirrored those for the election of Members of Dail &Eacute;ireann.  The Constitution also stipulates that Members of the Seanad are elected by secret postal ballot.  Arising from this provision, ballot papers are issued to voters by registered post.  It is important to point out that the cost of running Seanad elections on a universal franchise, without a referendum to amend the secret postal ballot provision in the Constitution, would be quite significant.  Based on the Seanad 2011 election, it costs &euro;5.25 to send each ballot paper and that gives an indication of what it would cost to send a postal ballot paper by registered post to over 3 million electors.  That would not include the cost of staff to administer the election and count the votes.</p><p>Today's amendment proposes that a task force, representative of the different parties and groupings within the Oireachtas, should in the first instance look at the question of electoral reform of the Seanad.  The various parties or groupings in both Houses can present their proposals for such reform to the task force.  Once the task force has examined the submissions and scoped out the nature and extent of the legislation proposed, including an examination of any possible constitutional implications, it will be in a better position to propose a possible timeline for the enactment of any such legislation.  I should add that this process will be greatly assisted when the heads of the Bill to extend the university franchise are published over the coming weeks and are examined in detail.  Scrutiny of this legislation, which arose from the referendum thirty five years ago, will provide a useful guideline for further reform of the Seanad election system.  I note that Senator Zappone's motion proposes such a task force, as does the Government's amendment, so we are agreed on the main point.  It should be possible to get such a task force established soon.</p><p>As I said earlier, the third option for reform would involve reverting to the people by way of referendum.  There was broad consensus at the meeting of party and group leaders before Christmas that the question of constitutional reform could be considered at a later date.  Let us first see what can be achieved through the procedural and legislative routes.  We can then take stock of the situation.  There is an imperative on all of us here today, on all sides of the House, to get on with the process of reforming the Seanad.  Our aim should be, unlike the various reports and recommendations on Seanad reform since 1937 that remained on the shelf, to ensure that this time there is action and reform is actually implemented.  The success of this reform process will largely depend on the Members of the Seanad working closely together to develop reforms and working with the Government towards implementing these reforms.  I welcome the Leader's proposals for consensus on this issue and I look forward to having further engagement with the House as the process of reform develops.</p><p>Senator Cummins and others spoke about the duplication of work across the Seanad, D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas committees.  When I was appointed to the position of Chief Whip I was not in favour of the concept of a committee week, but as time has passed and I have seen how well the committee system is working.  Under the previous Government there were 23 or 24 committees, chairmanship of which were essentially &quot;jobs for the boys&quot;.  We have reduced the number of committees and they are working very effectively now.</p></speech>

I also thank my colleagues, to whom I have listened very carefully.  We have had a very fine debate on the motion and the amendment.  I regret that the Minister of State was not able to offer some more reflection on what we have said due to time constraints, although I will accept that he attempted to do so.  I would have liked to hear more of his views on some of the very creative ideas that the Leader has put forward regarding procedural reform which I will absolutely support.  Indeed, I look forward to that moving forward.  The ideas on engagement that the Deputy Leader has put forward will be brought to her own political party later and I wish her all the best with that and hope she is successful with her arguments, some of which fit in with the motion.</p><p>Rather than make the summing up points I had prepared, I wish to address the script from the Minister of State, which is essentially a speech on behalf of the Government.  I welcome the fact that the general scheme of the Bill to extend the university franchise will be brought to the Government in the coming weeks, which sounds like it will happen fairly soon.  </p> <p>As our motion is based on a sense of urgency, I am delighted to hear that.  It is also welcome that the Minister of State has noted how Senators are elected through the two sub-panels of nominating bodies and Oireachtas Members.  Essentially, some Senators are elected by nominating bodies, while others are elected by Oireachtas Members.</p><p>On the first part of the motion, the Minister of State has argued that, when framing the Constitution, if it was the intention that there would be a universal franchise for the Seanad, it would have been provided for.  I reject this argument for the clear reasons I gave in my opening statement.  The Constitution states the law will regulate this, not the Constitution.  The law for Seanad elections has been changed before and can be changed again.  The Constitution is also a living document.  This is a statement of &ldquo;No&rdquo; from the Government to a universal franchise and one person, one vote for Seanad elections.  I also reject the point that the Constitution provides that the remaining 43 Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann are elected by Oireachtas Members, as it is not accurate.</p><p>The establishment of a task force on Seanad electoral reform is to be welcomed.  I do not know if its members have been chosen yet, but it needs to happen soon.  It should also have a set date for the end of its investigation if we want to have a radical electoral reform programme including a universal franchise and providing for one person, one vote for Seanad elections, as contained in the motion.  If this does not happen, there will be an electorate of 1,167 for the next Seanad election.  That electorate will be politicians and controlled by the incoming Government.  It will be a mini-D&aacute;il coming from the politicians.  This will mean less room for minority and independent voices and fewer Senators representing and engaging with civil society according to the sectors which elect them through the panels.</p><p>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion give a clear &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a universal franchise.  The idea of a universal franchise will not be part of the remit of the task force.  I have not heard either when it will be established or report.</p></speech>

Most rape and domestic violence cases are not even reported to the Garda, let alone prosecuted in court.  It is disgraceful that women who are brave enough to report their attackers and endure the ordeal of facing them in a courtroom would then have to watch them buy their way out of jail.  I will not mention specific cases because I do not want to prejudice ongoing or future legal actions but the overall message is that if one has enough money one can escape justice.  If one has sufficient financial resources, one can rape and beat women with impunity.</p><p>  It is a damning indictment of our justice system that people are regularly sent to jail for non-payment of fines or for petty theft but not for vicious attacks on women.  As Colette Browne points out in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, more than 8,300 people were jailed last year for non-payment of court imposed fines, including 242 who were jailed for failing to pay fines for not having a television licence.  Clearly, justice in this country is only for the poor.  Financial compensation is entirely appropriate for financial or non-violent crimes but it is outrageous to put a value on the damage that rape or assault does to a person.  I ask the Government to change the law so that defendants can no longer pay financial compensation in lieu of jail time.  This issue has arisen in several cases.  It is not an isolated incident and it is time the Government put a real value on victims' lives by ensuring this will never happen again.</p></speech>

I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business.</p><p>As the Senator will appreciate, the courts are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence.  Having considered all of the circumstances of a case, a court may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  It is the responsibility of the court to determine the sentence to be imposed in a particular case, having heard all the evidence presented and taking case law into account.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender, in that process identifying where in the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factor which may be present.  From time to time, issues arise with consistency in sentencing and the sentences imposed in high-profile or particularly sensitive cases.</p><p>The Senator will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for a member of the Executive to make any comment on individual cases.  However, I draw attention to an important safeguard, which is the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence imposed by the Circuit Court, Central Criminal or Special Criminal Court that she regards as unduly lenient.</p> <p>However, I draw attention to an important safeguard, which is the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence imposed by the Circuit Court, Central Criminal Court or Special Criminal Court that she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides for the making of a compensation order, on application or otherwise, against a convicted person by the court instead of or in addition to dealing with the person in any other way, unless it sees reason to the contrary.  The Minister intends to seek Government approval very soon for the general scheme of a Bill to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, consideration will be given to the question of whether the Criminal Justice Act 1993 should be amended to ensure there is to be no link between the payment of compensation by an offender and the sentencing of the offender.  The replacement of the court poor box with a transparent statutory reparation fund, which has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission, will also be considered in the new legislation.  The details of the proposed Bill will be announced in due course following Government approval.</p><p>In September 2012, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence announced a strategic review of penal policy.  A working group is carrying out this review which is examining all aspects of penal policy, including sentencing.  The group is expected to report in the coming months.  In its deliberations, the group will take account of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's recent report on mandatory sentencing and both reports will be considered by the Minister in due course.  The issue of domestic and sexual violence is one the Government takes very seriously.  Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, is continuing to co-ordinate the implementation of the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014.</p><p>Since coming into office, the Minister has brought forward important amendments to the Domestic Violence Acts 1996 and 2002 through the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The net effect of these changes has been to extend the protections of this legislation to a wider number of people and circumstances.  It is the Minister's intention to bring forward a package of workable and effective proposals for the consolidation and reform of domestic violence legislation as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  To advance this work, officials in Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, have met with representatives of a number of groups to discuss their proposals for legislative change.  Careful consideration will also be given to the recommendations from the examination of domestic and sexual violence by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when the report is available.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that change in the 1993 Act on financial compensation will be considered.  As far as I am concerned it must be changed.  I do not see a case for leaving it as it is.  It is never appropriate to give financial compensation in an assault case, be it sexual assault or other form of assault such as domestic violence.  At the least, it should not be possible to do so without the consent of the victim.  If a victim speaks about her ordeal, be it rape or sexual violence, in court and says she objects to financial compensation it should not be possible for the attacker to get off with the payment of a fine or compensation instead.  It makes a complete mockery of the seriousness of the crime.</p><p>I welcome the fact that such a change is being considered and I hope the legislation will be changed as soon as possible.  At the outset the reply stated that it is up to the courts to decide on sentencing.  Of course that is true, but we set out penalties in this House and it is up to the Legislature to decide on appropriate penalties and what the spectrum of penalties should be for given offences.  It is our job and responsibility to decide on the issue and it is beyond time that we stood up and said that financial compensation is not appropriate in such cases and that we would change the legislation as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I assure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes appropriate action to respond to assaults, domestic violence incidents and sexual offences that are reported to it.  Senators will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is available at all times of the day and night, every day and every night, to intervene where there is a danger to life or the safety of any citizens of the State.  That includes, in particular, victims of domestic violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has comprehensive policies in place on domestic violence, sexual violence and dangers to children.</p><p>The courts need to have available to them various methods of disposal to ensure that they can respond appropriately to the wide range of criminal offences that come before them and the circumstances of each individual case.  It is fundamental to our system of justice, as Senators will appreciate, that the courts are independent of the Executive in regard to any particular case before them.  While specific difficulties arise in regard to particular aspects of criminal justice legislation, the Minister for Justice and Equality will of course bring forward such amending legislation as may be necessary.  As I already stated, specific consideration is being given to amendment of the compensation order provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and reform of the court poor box in the context of forthcoming legislation on community sanctions.  The Minister intends that this consolidation and reform of domestic violence legislation will be progressed as soon as possible, having regard to the need for consultations, other legislative priorities and any recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality arising from its examination of domestic and sexual violence.</p></speech>

A total of 16 farming deaths took place in 2013.  They did not all involve slatted tanks and, thankfully, the number was lower than the previous two years, 21 and 22 respectively.  There is insufficient knowledge and information as to what should happen if stock or even worse, a person, ends up in a slurry storage tank.  It is a pretty horrific experience of which I have personal knowledge in that 13 animals went into tanks and I did not know what to do.  I do not consider myself to have more or less knowledge than the average person in such circumstances but the reality is that such a situation is dangerous and there is no protocol.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on same.</p></speech>

The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has primary responsibility for health and safety in the workplace.  The HSA is also the enforcement agency for workplace safety.  It carries out in the region of 3,000 inspections annually and plans to continue with a high level of engagement during 2014.  These visits are aimed at advising and educating farmers of the dangers that are ever present in the farm environment.</p><p>It is a fact that farming is the most dangerous occupation in the country, with more people killed on farms than all other workplaces combined.  To a large degree, the nature of a farm is at the core of the problem.  A farm is, to a great extent, seen first and foremost as a family home.  This means it is seen as a place of security and welcome for family, friends, neighbours and visitors.  However, a farmyard is a very dangerous place of work with large modern machinery and other dangers such as animals and extensive slurry storage areas.</p><p>The difficulty is to marry the family home part of the farm with the farmyard and other dangerous areas of the extended farm.</p> <p>Last year there were 16 fatal accidents reported on farms, down from 21 in the previous year.  Unfortunately, there has already been one fatality this year.</p><p> The Department is represented on the farm safety partnership advisory committee which is a sub-committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The committee advises the board on the direction the authority should take in farm safety.  The farm safety action plan 2013-15 follows on from the previous farm safety action plan 2009-12 and has been developed in conjunction with the farm safety partnership advisory committee.  Slatted slurry storage units are safe as long as they are designed, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with best practice.  The most dangerous time in the use of a slatted slurry storage tank is during the agitation of slurry.  All animals must be removed from the building during agitation; all vents must be opened to the maximum, including sliding doors, and agitation must take place on a breezy day.  Most importantly, it is critical that no person enters the building during the agitation process.</p><p> The other danger is the risk of slat failure.  With slatted units it is important to ensure slats are inspected on a regular basis.  They are not lifetime items and need to be replaced before they fail.  Slat failure can be an expensive way to discover replacement is required.  Failure can and has resulted in the loss of highly valuable livestock.  To avoid broken legs or, worse still, animals or people in the slurry tanks, all slats should be carefully inspected for cracks and sagging and replaced, as necessary.  Attempting to rescue animals from slurry tanks is extremely dangerous and has resulted in the loss of multiple human lives.  </p><p> In November 2012 my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, published a two page article in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> on how to inspect cattle slats on top of a slurry tank in a safe manner.  The article highlighted the importance of regular monitoring of the condition of cattle slats and the safe procedures for entering a slurry tank to undertake such an inspection.  The Department has detailed specifications for the design and construction of all slatted units.  These specifications detail the required safety procedures and construction standards for these units.  The first section in all of the specifications documents concerns safety.  All of the specifications are freely available on my Department's website to anyone who is undertaking work on the construction of a slurry store.  The specifications are kept under continual review and any development in safety or construction techniques is incorporated into them.</p><p> In March 2013 the Department included a farm safety message with the single payment application packs sent to over 130,000 farmers.  The leaflet focused, in particular, on the dangers of slurry gases and the safe procedures for handling slurry.  This was a joint initiative between the Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the farm safety partnership advisory committee and its aim was to draw attention to the risks associated specifically with slurry gases.  It is just one example of co-operation between various agencies to remind farmers of the importance of following safe farming practices and the potentially fatal consequences for them, their families and other farm visitors of lowering their guard.</p><p> There is no single solution to the problem.  All relevant agencies should and, I am confident, will work with the HSA and the farming representative organisations to continue to tackle this issue.  This is a good time to be a farmer.  We want to do everything we can to get individual farmers to take care of their safety and that of their family and all others who visit their farms.  The information is available, but we must keep working to get individual farmers to take notice and put into practice good safety procedures and routines at all times.</p></speech>

To put the matter in context, on every occasion somebody enters such a tank, he or she is likely to die.  That is how dangerous it is; one lungful of the poisonous gas will kill.  The point I wish to make is that there is nothing in the safety guidelines regarding the use of a small breathing apparatus which is available for purchase and should be available at every tank, in the same way that fire extinguishers are available on farms and in worksheds, etc.  The breathing apparatus should only be used in cases of extreme emergency and the fire brigade should be called to come with the correct breathing equipment to enter tanks in emergencies.  It should be called for emergency rescues in order to ensure people will be safe.  We saw what happened, unfortunately, to the Spence family in Northern Ireland.  The necessary discussion on this issue has not been held.  People might or might not call the fire brigade because of the call-out fee.  For a very small increase in one's insurance premium, call-out fees are covered in the case of fire.  They should also be covered in emergencies such as incidents involving slurry tanks.  People do not have enough information on the protocol to be followed in cases where someone must enter a slurry tank.  If someone's son or daughter or a member of his or her family is in danger, he or she will try to rescue him or her.</p></speech>

Efforts are ongoing in considering how to make farms safer.  There is no doubt that with modern techniques and the changeover to bigger slurry tanks which create more gas, farms have become very dangerous places.  However, there are strict and clear guidelines for the spreading of slurry and agitating tanks, of which people should be aware.  As in the case of sending guidelines with the single farm payment, every opportunity should be taken to provide the relevant guidelines and information.</p><p>On the new rural development programme, I have advocated for a long time that farm safety measures be included in it.  We will discuss the programme in the next number of months, which will provide an ideal opportunity to ensure this happens.  Too many people are losing their lives and too many injuries are taking place.  If one visits any hospital in a farming area, one is almost guaranteed to meet someone in the accident and emergency unit who has been injured on a farm.  This is a real problem and no stone should be left unturned in dealing with it if the Department and I are to have any input in saving lives.  The new rural development programme should be seen as a vehicle that could be used to help us to make farms safer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900037#MM00500"><p>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I am extremely worried by the proposal, as I see it, to privatise the entire bus service in Waterford city.  All five city bus routes and the service to Tramore are to be awarded to private operators from 2016, as well as the Bus &Eacute;ireann routes serving Kildare, Tullamore, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Athy.  This is part of a larger plan by the National Transport Authority to allow private bus operators to tender for services currently operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.</p> <p>I must put on the record of the House my complete opposition to the privatisation of public transport, which I believe is not in the public interest.  I am absolutely opposed to this nonsensical plan to privatise 100% of the public service in Waterford city and I ask the Minister to explain why that is the case.  The NTA's proposals would hand over a significant percentage of the public bus service to private operators.  This has been criticised by the Competition Authority.  The privatisation of either part or all of the State's public transport network is not in the interests of the public, the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus or the State.  </p><p>We have heard criticism at Oireachtas committee hearings and in public by SIPTU and the NBRU, who spoke about the lack of public debate on the issue, problems with a very narrow consultation process and the impact that the Minister's proposals would have on jobs.  As we know, the NBRU represents 2,500 employees and is on the record as saying that this is the folly of an &quot;ideologically-based agenda&quot;, and it is hard to disagree with that.  I must ask the Minister why Waterford is being singled out for what I would see as an experiment.  Is Waterford to be a guinea pig, with all the bus routes in the city being handed over to private operators, compared to only 10% of bus routes in the State as a whole?  Why is that the case?  It is going to cause concern for those who use the bus services in Waterford and for the employees of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p><p>We are in danger here of confusing value for money with cheapness.  All international research and evidence on the privatisation of public transport companies shows that even when they are privatised they still have to be subsidised by the State.  We saw that with London Bus.  A report on public transport in this State was published in 2009 which found that the level of Government subsidy to CIE and Bus &Eacute;ireann was relatively low by European standards.  It found that subventions to both companies had continued to fall on an annual basis.  </p><p>I am taking the opportunity here to ask the Minister to rethink this foolish and ill-thought-out plan for privatisation.  I also urge him to recognise that, unfortunately, there is a price to be paid and that it costs money to provide a vital public service.  Private operators exist to provide a service and to make money, which is fine.  However, sometimes bus services are required to meet a social need.  We must provide a service to people and there may not be profit in that.  While those services must be as efficient as we can possibly make them, it does not always work out that they will be profitable.  I hope the Minister is not going down the road of privatising bus routes, with profit becoming the sole motivating factor and services coming a poor second.  That is not what we need.  Indeed, it would be a retrograde step for public service provision in this State.  </p><p>My main question for the Minister is why contracts are to be awarded for 100% of bus services in Waterford city when the figure is only 10% across the State.  Is it the case, as some fear, that Waterford city is being used as a guinea pig in the Minister's ideological experiment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900038#NN00200"><p>First, it is important to say that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not being privatised.  It will remain a State-owned company.  The Senator, due to his interest in, if not obsession with, ideology, has not actually looked at this from a commonsense perspective.  What is happening is that routes are being tendered out to contract.  Different operators can tender for those routes.  It is not something that is particularly unusual.  It is already the case that the operation of the Luas, for example, is tendered out.  It was tendered out very successfully and the Luas service is a very good one, with over 30 million journeys taken last year.  It is already the case that a lot of bus services are provided by private operators and are very popular with the public.  I ask the Senator to take that into account, to see beyond his own ideology and look at what is happening in the real world and at what real people are doing.</p><p>When it comes to the contract that is being tendered out for services for Waterford city and Tramore, it is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to tender for it.  It can tender for the contract on its own or as part of a joint venture with another company if it so wishes.  I totally agree with Senator Cullinane on one point: this is not about savings.  This policy is not about savings or reducing subventions.  I totally acknowledge that public bus services require a subvention.  This is about getting a better service for the Senator's constituents, for the people who live in Waterford.  </p><p>The NTA will draw up a set of services that it wants provided, it will say there is X amount of money available and will ask the various bus companies what kind of service they will provide for that amount of money.  I would expect that whichever company wins the contract will be able to provide a better service for the same amount of money or, at the very least, the same service for an equal amount of money.  I would expect in particular that the contract winner in Waterford would provide a weekend service, which is not provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann currently.  That is what this is about.  It is about getting better services for the people who live in Waterford with the same amount of taxpayer subvention.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann can provide a better service than it currently does, for the same subvention, then it may be the company that wins the contract.  </p><p>I understand that politicians come under pressure and heat from those who already have what they want, the existing interests, the &quot;haves&quot; who include the workers, the unions, the company itself and its management.  However, I ask the Senator to have regard for his own constituents.  How could anyone in Waterford be against having a better bus service at no additional cost to the taxpayer?  If, for the same amount of subvention, we can provide a better bus service, how could anyone be against that?  I just do not understand it, unless it is some sort of strange ideology that the Senator has which does not take into account that the most important people here are the passengers and the taxpayers.  Maybe the Senator thinks somebody else is more important.</p><p>I can read the prepared response if the Cathaoirleach wishes but the bottom line is that the decision about Waterford was made not by me but by the NTA.  If it was up to me, I would have tendered out a lot more than the 10% that is being tendered out.  The NTA made that decision.  It did not want to take too much off Bus &Eacute;ireann because the transition needs to be managed.  In Cork, the city is just too big and it could have damaged the future financial viability of Bus &Eacute;ireann if Cork was taken.  Waterford has a particularly bad bus service and a particularly low usage of that service.  This is something that public representatives from the region should be welcoming rather than opposing.</p></speech>

In the world that I live in, the Minister's plan is to put out to tender a number of bus routes in Waterford.  He has not answered the fundamental question I asked, which is why 100% of bus routes in Waterford city are to go to tender, when the national average is only 10%.  Why is Waterford being singled out?  The reality is that once those routes are put out to tender they can be transferred from Bus &Eacute;ireann to private bus operators that operate to make money, not to provide a public service.  There is a concern and a fear among people who depend on public bus services.  Those services meet a social as well as an economic need.  Once we go down the slippery road of transferring the provision of services from the State to private operators, in time we could see fewer services.  We will see the colour of the Minister's money on the question of whether we actually get improved services.  I attended a launch a number of years ago of transport plans by one of the Minister's predecessors in the role, who lived in Waterford.  We were promised super buses and all sorts of service improvements, which never came, a bit like the hypothetical bus.</p></speech>

Leaving aside the merits or otherwise of the Minister's overall plan to transfer services from Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus to private operators, I ask him to explain why Waterford has been chosen to have all five of its bus routes put out to tender, which is 100%, as compared to 10% across the State.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-01-29a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014012900038#NN00600"><p>I agree that we will have to wait and see, and what I hope we will see in 2016 or 2017 is other people around the country, in other cities, looking at how much better the bus service in Waterford has become.  I hope to hear those working in policy areas describing how the number of people using the bus in Waterford has increased and asking why it cannot be done in Limerick or Galway too.  That is what I want to see in a few years' time, but we will have to wait to see whether it works.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the decision on Waterford was made not by me but by the NTA.</p> <p>It would not make sense to tender out every tenth route because routes go into depots.  One cannot tender out one tenth of a depot.  A group of routes needs to be taken together.</p><p>With regard to the Waterford services, the National Transport Authority, NTA, noted the simplicity of tendering a comprehensive city operation and that the size of the tender package would make it attractive to the market.  It would also offer the future opportunity to the NTA to benchmark a regional city bus operation.</p><p>Tendering of Galway and Limerick services was also considered as they are sufficiently large to attract interest from potential market entrants.  However, they are also sufficiently small that bus and depot transfer from Bus &Eacute;ireann may not be essential to secure an economically advantageous tender price.  Waterford is the smallest city operation and can be grouped with services in other cities, thereby creating a geographical spread of tendering opportunities.</p><p>Tendering Cork city services was also considered an option but these services comprise almost 20% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO, public service obligation, operations.  The consequential management of a 20% downsizing in terms of staffing and overheads would be very challenging to achieve without triggering a need for an additional PSO subsidy.  Consequently, tendering the entire Cork network is not recommended, although individual corridors were considered.</p></speech>

I know he is quite familiar with Loughrea, County Galway and how it has experienced a significant increase in its population.  This has led to an increased demand on public services in the town and surrounding areas.  This is particularly evident at Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna national school, Bullaun, Loughrea, County Galway.</p><p>The school is a standard three-classroom built in 1959 with an increase in its enrolment from 39 pupils in 2000 to 187 pupils in 2013.  Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna urgently requires the construction of a new school building to help meet the demands of its increased enrolment.  To help cope with the increase in pupils, the school's board of management purchased four prefabs, costing the school &euro;100,000 a year in rent.  Pupils are also being taught out of the school grounds in the local Bullaun hall.  Parents of children at the school have raised concerns with me and other Oireachtas Members about the safety of their children going to school in Bullaun hall, as they have to cross and walk along a busy main road.  To compound matters, the owner of the land on which the school was initially given consent to locate prefabs is now using legal action to seek the removal of the prefabs.</p><p>Further to this, the school's septic tank is now absorbing water from the water table.  In the past year, it has been emptied and desludged several times.  A recent health and safety audit condemned the system.  The school principal has warned this is a crisis situation.  The board of management has already applied for emergency works to be carried out on its percolation system.  While funding has been sanctioned by the Department, the school has been unable to proceed with the project because of space restrictions and difficulties with planning permission.  The school literally does not have the space to install a new system.</p><p>The board of management has had several contacts with the Department of Education and Skills for the past seven years emphasising this significant enrolment increase was unfolding and that a new school building was urgently required.  In December 2006, an application was lodged with the Department of Education and Skills for funding major capital works at Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna.  The whole-school evaluation in 2007 resulted in a recommendation by an inspector that this funding be made available as a matter of urgency.  In 2014, funding is still not forthcoming for a school building.  Despite spiralling enrolment during the past seven years, the school has been banded 2.2 on the waiting list for funding from the Department.  Given these circumstances, the school&rsquo;s community is rightly concerned as to why it has not been given immediate priority for funding to build a much needed new school.</p><p>The patron of the school, Bishop John Kirby, has agreed to make a site available for the construction of a new school.  A fund-raising drive by the school and parents in 2006 raised &euro;35,000 towards what was then seen as a project which was highly likely to materialise. This is still in a deposit account gaining interest.</p><p>It is clear that Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna does not have adequate conditions.  Will the Minister of State outline any proposals for dealing with this matter?  I hope this project will be expedited and that the Minister of State will use his influence in the Department so the people of Bullaun, Loughrea, County Galway, can look forward to a new school building sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

The delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future pupil enrolment demand, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  While Bullaun has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth, the Department, however, also recognises that schools not included in the five-year construction programme may require additional accommodation where an immediate enrolment need in an area is arising.  Over the past five years, enrolment at Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna has risen from 140 pupils to 187, a 30% increase which is significant.</p><p>In the case of Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna, the Department has recognised the need for additional school accommodation to address its immediate needs.  In April 2012, the school was approved funding for the purchase of an additional temporary mainstream classroom.  In December 2012, the Department approved further funding for an extension of the existing staff room and resource teaching room.  These projects have been completed and all moneys have been paid to the school.</p><p>However, Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna has experienced issues with wastewater treatment on its existing school site.  In that regard, the school was authorised to engage a suitably qualified consultant engineer to address the problem, if possible, by installing an appropriate sequencing batch reactor.  In December last, I facilitated and attended an on-site meeting between the Department, the school and its consultant on the matter.  At that meeting, it became apparent that the existing site is too restricted to provide an appropriate wastewater treatment system and the additional permanent accommodation also under consideration.  In that regard, it was also accepted that the option of extending the school site was not available.</p><p>To address the site limitations, the school advised in the course of the December 2013 meeting that its patron is willing to offer a greenfield site for a new school development.  The Department acknowledged this offer and requested that appropriate details such as site maps be supplied.  The principal has told me this information has been supplied.  In addition, the Department sought that formal confirmation be supplied by the patron that the site concerned would be offered for development.  On the basis of the information received by the Department on 16 January, the Department intends to have the site concerned technically evaluated shortly to determine its suitability for school development.  In the event that no issues arise from this assessment, the new school building project can then be progressed into the architectural planning process.  I do not expect any issues to arise as the proposed site is suitable, right in the heart of the village and adjacent to a newly developed car park.</p><p>I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position on Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna.</p></speech>

Contrary to what he said, there is significant demographic growth in this area with an increase in the school&rsquo;s enrolment from 39 pupils in 2000 to 187 pupils in 2013.  I am critical of the Department's five-year construction programme and that there should be some degree of discretion to add schools to the list, especially in light of the situation in which Scoil Naomh &Eacute;anna finds itself.</p><p>It is critical the school's problems are addressed sooner rather than later.  We cannot sit on our hands any longer.  In 2007, the school&rsquo;s situation was deemed to be a matter of urgency and should be addressed with funding put in place for a school building to be developed.</p> <p>Unfortunately this has not happened, and seven years later matters are not improving but getting worse.  This relates to the constituency of the Minister of State and he knows the area.  We cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way or slow down what is happening.  We need to cut through the red tape and deliver a school for the people of Bullaun because it is the least they deserve.</p></speech>
