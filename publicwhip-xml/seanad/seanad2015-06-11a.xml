I am raising the issue of the ongoing ISIS threat because I am seriously concerned that, from an international perspective, neither the European Union nor, in particular, the United States is taking with sufficient seriousness the profound threat to what I would deem to be civilisation being posed by ISIS.  When we hear of a group which brings along a body of six year old children to watch a beheading for educational purposes, we are starkly reminded of that with which it is we are dealing.  Over the past number of years, the ISIS group has ploughed with alarming and frightening effect through Syria and Iraq to gain a major stronghold in these geographical areas.</p> <p>During the course of the 20th century, the world had to deal with and eventually prevailed over threats from fascism, nazism and communism.  In ISIS, we are dealing with a group which is just as dangerous, deranged and ideologically driven as those other groupings.  There has been a campaign of terror, cultural vandalism and religious fundamentalism which is of such sufficient concern to us that we have to ensure there is a much stronger international response to ISIS.  The group poses a threat to civilisation and to a peaceful world order.  It is posing an immediate threat to the broader middle Eastern area of the world.  In the medium to long term, it is a threat to the Western world and western civilisation.  I am, therefore, both concerned and disappointed with the apparent total lack of a response by the broader international community.</p> <p>The G7 group of countries met during the week.  They had many pressing matters to consider but I did not read any great reports of progress on tackling the ISIS threat.  The Administration of President Obama - a wonderful Administration which was to bring about hope and change - is now of such irrelevant import, it does not even appear to have a policy.  The European Union presumably has a policy but we are not seeing any action.  I am not sure what is the Irish involvement in the EU policy and I would like to hear from the Minister in that regard.  Above all, I want the Minister to assure me that he, his officials, the Government and the Department are taking this matter seriously and that there will be a ramping up by the EU of action and of whatever type of intervention to which we can commit ourselves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Without abusing the words of a former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, the world's civilisation cannot stand idly by.  It is depressing, culturally, to see monuments thousands of years old being destroyed and cities and a civilisation being buried in ashes.  That is bad, but we have also seen beheadings and other forms of execution, terror and the displacement of entire populations.  That is not only a profound human rights issue but must also concern everybody interested in world peace and order.  It is not a question of seeing if ISIS can be contained, as there is no place in the world's civilisation for a group like it.  It must be tackled and removed from the map, politically and militarily.  We must see the start of a substantive campaign against it in the near future.  I would like to hear the Minister's observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for facilitating this debate in the Seanad.  As he stated, it is an important issue.  </p> <p>The barbaric violence and culture of hatred which fuel the ISIS campaign of terror are utterly unacceptable to Ireland and the wider world and a threat to the values of freedom and human dignity which we fundamentally espouse.  ISIS's actions are harmful, first and foremost, to the people of the Middle East region, especially women and girls; ethnic and religious minorities such as Christians and Yazidis; members of the gay community; and other vulnerable groups that are the principal victims of its inhumane actions.  I also condemn the wilful destruction of cultural artefacts and ancient buildings in the Middle East, the cradle of civilisation, as it constitutes irreplaceable losses to the history of humankind.</p> <p>The ideology of ISIS is based on totalitarianism, denying all freedoms and rights to the people of the region in pursuit of a perverted interpretation and extremist implementation of religious doctrine.  ISIS is a radical group which is seeking to consolidate its power across much of the Middle East and expand its territorial control, widening the threat to the lives and human rights of millions of people across the region.  It poses a limited threat to the European Union, including Ireland, but there can be little doubt about its ambitions to export Its violence and terror to Europe.  We are working closely with our partners in the European Union and through the United Nations to co-ordinate our efforts and strengthen the tools at our disposal.</p> <p>The February Foreign Affairs Council conclusions set out five priorities in combating terrorism internationally.  They are the strengthening of partnerships with key countries, supporting capacity building, countering radicalisation and violent extremism, promoting international co-operation and addressing underlying factors and crises.  Following a special meeting of the European Council, EU Heads of State and Government set out a range of priorities to guide further work by the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils.  These priorities were set out under three headings - ensuring the security of citizens, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values and co-operating with our international partners.  The approach being taken by the European Union is consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2178 on foreign terrorist fighters which was adopted unanimously on 24 September 2014.  Ireland co-sponsored the resolution, with 103 other states, including all other EU member states.  The resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights-compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy in the resolution is in line with Ireland's approach to the issue.</p> <p>Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  An attack on Ireland is possible, but it is assessed as not likely.  There is no specific information on a threat to this country.  There are a small number of people based here who support extremism.  Their activities are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which also keeps the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in the light of ongoing developments and continues to take appropriate measures to counteract it.  In this, it has the full support of the Government.  In tandem with this, the Garda operates a progressive community relations programme in engaging with all minority communities in the State through the racial, intercultural and diversity office.</p> <p>Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been very active in this area.  With regard to preventive measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movement of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour.  With regard to the capacity to prosecute, existing legislation, dating from 2005, provides for the offences of terrorist bombing and terrorist financing.  We recently passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015 which created the three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.</p> <p>A comprehensive solution to the challenge posed by ISIS must also embrace efforts to promote a political settlement in Syria based on the Geneva Principles, as well as international support for the new unity government in Iraq, encouraging the Iraqi Government to pursue inclusivity and reconciliation.  We also recognise the immense humanitarian impact of the current conflict and have committed over &euro;41 million to humanitarian relief since the beginning of the Syrian conflict.</p></speech>

When the ISIS media watchers take note of his answer, they will be reminded of <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i>in keeping its eye on Russia.  That will be the impact of the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The media watchers may read about our support for capacity building and our co-sponsoring of UN resolutions and ask, &quot;So what?&quot;  The Minister has stated ISIS poses a limited threat to the European Union, which is a fair statement of fact.  Does he concede that the current campaign and the geographical advancement of ISIS into Syria bring it within a short plane journey of the Italian border?  Does he concede that, as we are thinking about the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union in the medium to long term, the border of the European Union could be within a short hop of ISIS-dominated territory?  What are we going to do in that regard?  The Minister did not mention any engagement with the United States.  Is there active engagement by the European Union with the United States and the Obama Administration to see if this threat can be taken more seriously?</p></speech>

There is an ongoing programme of interaction between the European Union and the United States.  Only recently the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, visited the United States and she has been particularly active on this issue since assuming office in November.  Our position, notwithstanding the Senator's exhortation that Ireland should do more, is, as I outlined, that we consider matters from a domestic perspective.  We also have influence within the 28 member European Union bloc.  Later this month the European Council will review progress in the implementation of the European Union's counter-terrorism agenda.  It includes a number of strands, including tackling the phenomenon that is foreign terrorist fighters, countering terrorist content on the Internet, improving international co-operation and information sharing, including through the adoption of the EU passenger name records directive.  Other elements include constructive engagement with third states.  In this context, I refer particularly to the Senator's comments on Turkey.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am anxious to ensure there is constructive engagement between the EU states and Turkey which, as Senator Bradford will recognise, is the main gateway for foreign fighters into Syria.</p><p>On the domestic front, Senator Bradford is familiar with the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act which was debated here before Christmas and I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, would be happy to address the House again on the domestic approach to this important issue.  We have a two-pronged approach, domestic and international.  As Senator Bradford has urged, the European Union regards this issue as a high priority in terms of its engagement on the international stage.</p></speech>

After 15 years, numerous Ministers with responsibility for education and countless false starts, the Holy Family school in Cootehill remains very much in limbo in regard to the provision of new accommodation.</p> <p>As can be attested by many, the school is an outstanding facility, with a committed staff, a supportive board of management and an active parents association.  On a visit I paid to the school, I was very impressed by the dedication of the staff and the commitment of the parents, particularly when we take into consideration the premises and existing resources.  The urgent need for the provision of a new school is obvious to any visitor to the school or to anyone who speaks to parents or staff who have experienced at first hand the cramped conditions pupils and staff must contend with.</p> <p>As of the start of this month, the new school is at the architectural planning stage, but it is not part of the five-year programme for investment in infrastructure or jobs package.  When I looked at recent parliamentary questions on school funding, this school was on the last status list of school building projects.  Unfortunately, since I came to this House and since this issue has been raised by me and other public representatives and members of the community, we have been receiving the same reply to our questions in regard to this school.  There seems to be no commitment to make financial provision for the project.</p> <p>The Minister may not be aware that the Holy Family school in Cootehill caters for people with severe and profound learning disabilities and moderate and multiple learning disabilities and for people with autism.  Reports forecast that in the coming September the student population will increase from 143 to in excess of 150 for the first time ever, with 21 new children expected to start in the autumn.  The school and board of management do not want to turn children away because of the need to bus students to another premises.  They do not want to turn students away because there is a need for this vital service.</p> <p>What needs to happen in order that this project can progress to the funding stage?  What is the cause of the delay and how can we overcome that?  It is not acceptable that accommodation must be rented to cater for the number of pupils.  This is not an issue that has just arisen.  The issue has been on the departmental, ministerial and local representative agendas for well over a decade and has cropped up frequently in parliamentary questions over recent years, but there has been little progress.  We hear a great deal of talk about the importance of education, cherishing all the children of the nation equally and ensuring those with special educational needs are not disadvantaged in our system, but the reality tells a different story.  The test is delivery in the classroom.</p> <p>The premises in Cootehill are not fit for purpose and are too cramped.  The teachers and the staff are doing sterling work.  Without their dedication and without the tireless work and campaigning of parents and the community, the situation would be even worse.  I am sure that, due to the extensive lobbying on the issue, the Minister for Education and Skills is aware the premises are not fit for purpose.  We need to deal with bottlenecks in the system as a priority.  This is an essential spend rather than a discretionary one, so we need to deal with the problems and overcome them as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by almost 37,000 pupils by 2016 and are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak in 2019.  To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools and extend or replace a number of existing schools in areas where population growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p> <p>Holy Family school, Cootehill, is a multi-denominational special needs school.  The school is co-educational and caters for pupils from four to 18 years. The school caters for pupils with moderate learning disabilities, severe or profound learning disabilities and pupils with autism.  Enrolments at Holy Family school for the school year 2014-2015 were 136 pupils, an increase of 16% over the past five years.</p> <p>The brief for the major building project for Holy Family school, Cootehill is to provide a new 21-classroom special school and appropriate ancillary accommodation, with associated car parking, a bus drop-off, a sports pitch, play areas, a sensory garden and site boundary treatment.  The project to provide the permanent accommodation for Holy Family special school is currently at stage 2a, development design, of the architectural planning process.  In order to complete stage 2a design, it recently became necessary to appoint a replacement consultant mechanical and electrical engineer to the design team.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 May 2015 and the appointment of the new engineer will be concluded shortly.  The replacement engineer will be involved with the existing design team members in the completion of the mechanical and engineering elements of the design.  Thereafter, subject to no further issues arising, the project will progress to the conclusion of stage 2b, with the completion of tender documents.  Planning permission, fire safety certification and disability access certification have already been obtained for the project.</p> <p>School building projects, including the new school for the Holy Family special school, which have not been scheduled for construction in the current five-year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stage in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being made available to the Department in future years.  The project for Holy Family special school remains available to be considered for further progress in that context.</p></speech>

The response mentioned that the appointment of a new engineer will be concluded shortly.  I hope this is a priority and that it happens as soon as possible without any further delay.  The Department stresses that demographic growth is a priority when it comes to extending or replacing schools.  I must stress the serious issues relating to the cramped conditions in this school.  For example, there are serious issues for children in wheelchairs and the logistics of getting into and out of cramped rooms.  These conditions are no way ideal and the education of some children is being disrupted.  I ask the Minister to relay that to his colleague.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.23" nospeaker="true" time="10:30:00" ><p>Annaghdown is on the shores of Lough Corrib.  It is a beautiful location but along with that comes comes national heritage area, NHA, and special area of conservation, SAC, restrictions.  It is about 12 miles from Galway.  This is a matter of public interest as only one burial plot remains.  The local community set up the Annaghdown cemetery committee in May 2013 - just over two years ago - and it has exhausted every avenue.  It worked with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht's office to extend the current graveyard and to explore other suitable sites.  It identified another nearby site of 3.4 or 3.5 acres but that would cost &euro;100,000.  The entire budget for Galway County Council for cemeteries for the year is &euro;100,000.  This is not viable.  The maximum amount of money Galway County Council will pay is &euro;10,000 an acre.</p><p>When the committee surveyed the local community, everyone in Annaghdown, some 200 people in total, was looking to buy burial plots.  It struck me quite forcefully that the people who were most exercised about this were young people.  They felt it absolutely essential that within their parish they would have available to them a burial plot.  Last Monday morning I met a delegation from Annaghdown cemetery committee at a meeting facilitated by the good cathaoirleach of Galway County Council, Councillor Mary Hoade.  In attendance were all other Deputies and public representatives.  That was the first time I realised the absolute impending crisis and seriousness of this matter.  One woman said that if she was buried in another cemetery, be it Killachunna, Creggs or Claregalway, she would personally come back to haunt those present.  Such is the depth of feeling and worry about the fact that there is only one site left.  Where will people go when they need to be buried?  This is a crisis.  My request, which I am asking the Minister to relay to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is to have her use her discretion, as has been done in the past and I have the precedents, to give permission to extend Annaghdown cemetery.</p><p>The cemetery is within the shadow of a national monument.  There have been extensive digs and so forth and all that has been found - listen to this - is iron ore and some buttons.  When the National Library was contacted, it said it was not interested and to store them in a garage.  That does not sound hectic to me, but the public need and the public good is very important in this situation.  I spoke to the previous Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.  He granted an extension to Clogheen graveyard in Tipperary and I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, this morning who said that it has been very successful.  Other exceptions are on the record, including exceptions for Kerry, Cork, Athlone Castle, Athlone Art Gallery, the Medieval Walls of Athenry and Turoe Stone in Galway.  I have a list of a number of other areas.  I think the Minister gets the picture.  It is of impending public interest locally in Annaghdown and I ask the Minister to facilitate this request for an extension to Annaghdown graveyard.</p></speech>

Reconciling reasonable and understandable aspirations of local communities to continue the tradition of burial in or near their local historic burial ground with the need to preserve and protect the archaeological heritage is always a difficult task.  On behalf of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the efforts her Department has been making to achieve this in the case of Annaghdown graveyard over the past number of years.</p> <p>I listened with intent to the threat of one of Senator Healy Eames constituents to come back and haunt everyone.  I am wondering if the Minister for Foreign Affairs is included in that threat or is it the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht who will be primarily the subject matter of the haunting. </p> <p>I would like to first explain briefly the major archaeological and historical importance of Annaghdown.  The ruined ecclesiastical buildings at Annaghdown were among the very first such structures to come into State care as national monuments.  They represent the site of a major early historic monastery, one which was of such importance that it became a diocesan centre when dioceses were first established in Ireland as part of the great 12th century church reform.  It has long been established by archaeological research that the core of an important early historic monastery was very likely to have been surrounded by an extensive settlement, the surviving buried remains of which are today of great archaeological interest.  The importance of the site at Annaghdown is reflected in the strong legal protection afforded it under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004, which legal protection the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is charged with implementing.  The ruins of the ancient monastery are in the ownership of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the graveyard is in the ownership of the local authority.  Section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 as amended by the 2004 Act makes works affecting national monuments of which the Minister or local authority are owners subject to a requirement of the consent from the Minister.  This requirement also extends to any ground disturbance in proximity to such a national monument.</p> <p>I will now set out for the House the dealings the Department has had with the local community group at Annaghdown in respect of the proposed extension to the graveyard.  In 2013, the national monuments service of the Department had extensive discussions with the local graveyard committee with regard to a proposed graveyard extension.  This resulted in an agreement to assess the possibility of a small extension to the north of the graveyard.  Following initial examination, which indicated a high probability of archaeological finds in the area, the local committee decided to look for other potential sites and did not proceed with the detailed assessment.  In 2014, the local community found a landowner who was willing to sell a plot of ground across the road to the east of the existing graveyard.  However, following archaeological test excavation in January 2014, carried out in accordance with a consent granted by the Minister, it was established that this site was, on the grounds of importance of archaeological features there, unsuitable for any development.</p> <p>The local committee then approached the Department again about a site immediately to the north of the existing graveyard and applied for permission to carry out archaeological test excavation.  The Minister granted consent for this and it was carried out in December 2014.  The results indicated that very important archaeological features are present there and, in particular, confirming that the monastery at Annaghdown was surrounded by a substantial enclosure, a very important archaeological find which adds considerably to the interest and national importance of Annaghdown.  On that basis, the site must be considered unsuitable for development.</p> <p>In March of this year, a professional archaeologist made inquiries with the Department on behalf of the local graveyard committee about the possibility of developing a different site for a graveyard extension.  This site, as currently proposed, would require a new entrance on to the public road.  The entrance and access route proposed would cross through the field where the important archaeological features were uncovered in January 2014.  The Department has advised that archaeological investigation of the site would be appropriate given its size and proximity to the site of the ancient monastery.  Such investigations would again require the consent of the Minister but the Department has not yet received any application for this.  The Department has also advised that the proposed entrance and access road should be relocated to the north western boundary of the site in order to avoid the areas of archaeological significance.  As is evident, the Department has sought and continues to seek to work with the local community to achieve a solution to the question of how to protect the nationally important archaeological heritage at Annaghdown while facilitating as far as possible the desire of the local community for a new burial ground in the vicinity.  This will continue to be the approach taken by officials of the Department and they will be happy to discuss the matter further with representatives of the local community and public representatives.</p></speech>

Everything he said has been documented to me as well in a list of 22 actions taken by the local committee.  We are gravely aware of the situation.  With respect to the Minister, the answer is disappointing and he will appreciate why.  My question to the Minister was whereto next after one more death in the community.  Where will the local people be buried?  Given their desire and, I think, right to be buried locally and given that Galway County Council does not have the money to purchase a site for &euro;100,000, I am wondering, at a human level, what news or consolation can I bring to the community?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Minister outlined, the people have done and exhausted every option.</p></speech>

The Department worked closely with the local community group in Annaghdown to resolve what was a difficult and complex issue.  It required the reconciliation of the aspirations of the local community with the highly important and appropriate protection of the nationally important heritage site.  I am sure the local community is justifiably proud of the national heritage site in the area.  Officials of the Department have met the local community and will continue to do so.  In the past there was no difficulty in the receipt of the appropriate legal consent.  It will enable the assessment to take place of the suitability of the proposed new location of the burial ground.  It is important that there be an ongoing process of interaction between the local community group, the local authority and local public representatives.  Working closely together, the Department and the local community will arrive at a decision which will take appropriate account of the competing-----</p></speech>

I commend her for the work she has done on the issue of rural development since her appointment and the work that has been done to date on the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  This Commencement matter relates to that issue and it is extremely important that we have clarity on it.</p> <p>I understand the process so far is based on a model being used across Europe for the allocation of funding.  European funds comprise 65% of the funding available, while Exchequer funds comprise the remaining 35%.  I also understand expressions of interest were sought from community groups across the country.  The closing date for the receipt of expressions of interest was 15 May.  How many of the applications have been decided by virtue of the fact that there was just one in each county area?  In how many are there multi applications and how will it finally be decided which group will receive funding?</p> <p>The second issue is the role of local councillors, which is extremely important.  In each local community development company, LCDC, there are four elected representatives among the 17 members of the LCDC in each administrative area.  I have been contacted by many councillors to seek clarity on what role they should play.  As the closing date for the receipt of applications was 15 May, not much work has yet been done as they are awaiting the allocation of funding.  They are in limbo as they do not know what they are supposed to be doing.  They are also anxious to understand and be informed about the governance procedures in the administration of this funding.  Is it the responsibility of the local authority and how will the system operate?</p> <p>Has any training been provided for the new development companies as entities?  I was a member of the first enterprise board set up in County Tipperary in 1991 and there was extensive training provided for the members of the board which was composed of a number of pillars from industry, the community and elected representatives.  As there was extensive training provided, we could understand our role and positions as directors of a company.  Perhaps the Minister of State might provide clarity on that issue also.  These are the questions councillors have been asking me about the process.  This is part of the Minister of State's functions in rural development and very important.</p> <p>In the past five years, in respect of development companies, 4,000 jobs have been created in rural Ireland, a massive amount.  I realise unemployment is decreasing, including in rural areas.  Councillors are chomping at the bit to get their hands on this money in order that they can play an effective role in the task we all face of bringing down unemployment and creating sustainable jobs.  In many cases, they are jobs in small companies, but they last a long time.  I have experience of this as a former member of an enterprise board for many years.  Many of the jobs created in the early 1990s were sustained throughout the recession.  This is proof positive that the money the Exchequer expends on this initiative - &euro;65 million, with a further &euro;153 million coming from the European Union - is money very well spent and gives value for money for the taxpayer.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

In the process we are trying to carry out with Leader funding and the LCDC as the implementer of the funding available, my main objective is not to get too caught up in the process in order that it becomes an entity in itself but to get the money to those on the ground.  That is my first priority.  I will outline the current position on the process.  </p> <p>The selection process for Leader local development strategies is not yet complete, which means that I cannot comment on the final outcome.  In this context, no contract has yet been awarded to any entity to deliver the Leader elements of the rural development programme 2014-20.  My Department is working to ensure the selection process will be completed as soon as possible and I am optimistic that the first contracts will be awarded and the strategies operational in the autumn.  That is my main priority.  I am aware that people are preparing their local development strategies.  In cases where the local development strategies are approved by the independent evaluation committee there is no reason for delay.  There will be a period in which contracts will have to be awarded, but my priority is to get the money to where it needs to be spent to support communities.</p> <p>Ireland is conducting a two-stage process for the selection of Leader local development strategies and both stages will be assessed by an independent selection committee.  The first stage, expressions of interest, was open to any local group with an interest in supporting the delivery of Leader funding at a local level.  A total of 45 expressions of interest were submitted by the closing date in respect of the 28 sub-regional areas specified in the expressions of interest documentation.  In areas where multiple expressions of interest were received my Department has given an undertaking to facilitate discussions between the relevant entities with a view to engaging all parties and, if possible, reaching an agreement to develop one coherent local development strategy for their area.  These meetings commenced last week and will continue for as long as is required.  In the meantime, I expect all expressions of interest to be presented to the independent selection committee for assessment and decision by late June.  Following this, preparatory support will be made available to all local action groups selected by the committee.  That is where the support will be provided.</p> <p>Entities successful on stage 1 will be invited to move to stage 2, the local development strategy, LDS, development phase.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They will be allowed a minimum of six months to develop their strategies but some of them will have their strategies completed much earlier because they are all working at getting them in place.</p><p>Technical support for the process of selection of local development strategies will be provided to the selection committee by Pobal.  That is another area where there will be support.  The system of governance and management in place for the new programme will be documented in the Department's Operating Rules for the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  These rules are influenced by the EU regulations governing the programme, with all the checks and balances in the EU regulations incorporated into the operating rules.  My Department is currently drafting these rules with a view to having an outline version available for stage 2 of the selection process.</p><p>I assure the Deputy that I do not see any reason for delay.  Some counties may not have their strategy developed as quickly as others but this Leader process is quite different from the previous one.  It was only when everything was ready that the last Leader roll-out could go ahead.  In this case, counties that are ready to go will be allowed to go.  If somebody has their strategy developed there is no reason they cannot get up and running with it.</p></speech>

In that regard I hope people can come together, not hold up the process and reach a compromise.  I spoke to councillors across the country in recent days in preparation for this and in some counties they have one application.  Limerick is an example where three different groups came together and made one application, and they will be ready to draw down the funding.  It is important that people are sensible about this and as the Minister of State said, everybody wants to get this process up and running.  I hope common sense will prevail to ensure that the applications will be submitted.</p> <p>In terms of rules, etc., I am pleased that there will be an application in regard to governance because that is extremely important.  In the early 1990s, governance was a major issue in an area not too far from me in respect of a similar type of enterprise.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State.  I wish her the best of luck with the continuing work she is doing in rural development.  She came up through that process, as did I, and it is critical that we continue that work.  I look forward to working with her on this and other issues.</p></speech>

It is an open and transparent process, and that is what everybody would want.</p> <p>I take the point about governance.  Governance is very important and under the local government process, and the new alignment process, increased powers have been given to county councillors.  It is very important that the councillors are at a level that is close to the community in terms of how they represent their areas and draw down funding for those areas, albeit that they are in the local development strategy.  The Department will be providing training.</p> <p>The moneys for each county have already been decided on, and the Senator's common sense approach would be welcome.  I hope that common sense will prevail.  My interest lies in helping communities that need this rural development money get it in the smoothest and quickest way because it is very important that disadvantaged areas get their slice of the cake in that regard.</p></speech>

We lost that vote 17 to 24.  Now the Government is acting but it is after the horse has bolted.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, who is in prison in Egypt.  Amnesty International has said he is entirely innocent of all the charges he is facing.  He has been in prison for 666 days - one year, nine months, 28 days.  No trial has been held to date.  A new trial date, the sixth, has been set for August but that could also be postponed.  In a note he smuggled out from prison, he said that he wakes up to the screams of people being tortured and wonders whether he will be next.</p> <p>The Government needs to act.  The Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade has asked that these Houses send out a delegation.  If Members opposite would like to visit this Irish citizen in prison in Egypt, they should join that committee delegation if it receives permission from the Government to go.  The Government needs to act as well and the Taoiseach needs to get involved in the same way the Prime Ministers of Canada and Australia got involved in similar situations where their citizens were being held in prison in Egypt under President Sisi.  The Government has not acted to date.  If Ibrahim Halawa was a Catholic from Mayo rather than a Muslim from Dublin there might be more action.  He was born in Ireland, was 17 years of age when he was arrested and has been in prison for two years.</p> <p>The Government's policy on Roscommon and its mental health services is a matter of concern.  It involves the most vulnerable people in our society - those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and mental health issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly: :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To quote Dr. Kelly: "The Government's policy in Roscommon re ... the Rosalie unit in Castlerea in tantamount to elderly abuse."

For many years I have spoken about the situation of Dublin on a non-partisan basis and some weeks, or a couple of months ago, I referred to the dereliction of the Georgian core, which I have repeatedly drawn to the attention of the city authorities.  One of the houses I mentioned in North Frederick Street collapsed.  There is a whole series of situations where people are discriminated against.  In the living city initiative, Dublin was excluded and now there is a square footage limit which deliberately and specifically excludes Georgian restoration, so there is no incentive.</p> <p>Finally, there is the Dublin City traffic management plan which is absolutely asinine.  I rode a bicycle for many years and was knocked off three times on O'Connell Street.  Now we have cyclists who are gone absolutely mad.  Apparently they are not required to wear helmets, although it is the law that they should.  They cycle the wrong way up streets, they cycle on the footpaths, they cycle against red lights and so on and meanwhile cars are going to be banned.  My journey from North Great George's Street to this House will be impossible.  Suffolk Street is going to be closed and the College Green gate is going to be implemented.  Why is it that people in the inner city were never given recognition for living in the inner city?  Nothing is done to facilitate them.  I suggest we recommend to the authorities that, just as in Jerusalem which has a different coloured place for people who live in the old city, we should introduce that system here to allow people who live in the city not to be imprisoned in their houses but to get in and out in their motor cars.  There is a terrible prejudice against the private motor car in the city.  It is just asinine.  One has only to look at the back gate of Trinity College where metal spikes have been erected and a path built, resulting in larceny, crashes and traffic jams.  It is deliberately using the infrastructure of the city in a manner that is dangerous to the users of cars and pedestrians.  I call for a debate on the city of Dublin with particular emphasis on the Dublin traffic plan.</p></speech>

The advances we have made when it comes to cycling and walking in this city are fantastic.  At the same time, I agree entirely with Senator Norris.  We do not have the climate, first and foremost, to be constantly on foot or bicycle in this country.  While the ideal is that we would have people on foot and reduce congestion, we need to remember the motorist in the context of the overall debate on how we move around our city.  I support Senator Norris in his call.</p> <p>An issue I wish to raise briefly is that of inheritance tax.  This is a matter we could usefully debate in the House.  It has come to light recently that the rate at which the tax is imposed is the seventh highest among countries that are members of the OECD.  The tax kicks in here at a much lower value than other western countries.  By way of example, in Britain the exemption from the tax is set at almost &pound;450,000 for one category while in Germany it is &euro;380,000.  This report shows that compared with the United Kingdom, a person here will pay far more when she inherits.  In Ireland, the capital acquisitions tax is imposed at a rate of 33% on amounts over &euro;225,000 for a son or daughter.  The rate has soared from 20% in 2008 and the tax-free threshold has been cut in half.</p> <p>This makes it all quite onerous on people if they inherit even a modest house.  Families are suddenly being hit with serious inheritance tax bills this year as rising property prices push them over exemption limits.  Revenue currently allows people to pay over a period but at an interest rate of 8% per year if families choose to pay by instalments.  Given the sums involved, this can sometimes be quite large.  A rate of 8% per year strikes me as onerous.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for reducing the rate of inheritance tax, raising the level at which it kicks in or reducing the rate for interest on instalments.  Certainly, it strikes me as rather punitive.</p> <p>In any event, it is certainly worthy of debate.  The reduction in the tax-free thresholds has resulted in even modest properties, particularly in Dublin, where house prices are higher, being hit with big tax bills.  Many countries have recognised that estate and inheritance taxes are a poor source of revenue and some have eliminated these taxes altogether.  It is worth noting that 13 countries have repealed inheritance tax, including Norway, which is hardly regarded as a tax haven.  I would welcome a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

I know we have had a number of debates with the Minister before, but not specifically on children.  There have been a number of reports in recent weeks about a lack of speech, language and occupational therapists.  A number of campaign groups have sprung up throughout the State in places where, unfortunately, families of children with different forms of disabilities are engaged in battles with the State to get services for their children.</p> <p>There are a number of problems, but the first problem is the absence sufficient therapists.  As we know, therapists sit on diagnostic teams and assessment teams within the HSE.  In the absence of enough therapists, especially senior speech and language therapists and child psychologists, the diagnostic teams are not in a position to provide the diagnoses and assessments as quickly as they should.  In fact, while the HSE policy is that all children should be assessed within three months, we now know from replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister with responsibility for this area that many children are waiting longer than 12 months.  We all accept that this is completely unacceptable.</p> <p>I can give an example in my city of Waterford, where the senior child psychologist post is not filled.  It is vacant.  I was in discussions with senior management in the HSE.  They are concerned about it because it is a specialised area and not a post that can be filled easily.  They now have to look at buying in some of the services simply to carry on with the diagnostic assessments.  I am fearful that children will have to wait longer for these assessments because of a vacuum in respect of these posts.</p> <p>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for that debate, specifically on children with disabilities?  We have had a number of debates with the Minister of State.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she has been very good at coming in to the Seanad to discuss issues in respect of her brief.  This is now a national story.  It was covered in a number of national radio stations, some of which have worked with families, made freedom of information requests and obtained information in respect of the long waiting times.  I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange for that debate as soon as possible.</p></speech>

According to the Eating Disorder Association of Ireland, Bodywhys, up to 200,000 people in Ireland may be affected by eating disorders.  An estimated 400 new cases occur each year and there are up to 80 related deaths annually.  These illnesses affect women and men of all ages and from all walks of life.  In light of these figures, it seems shocking to me that there is no dedicated eating disorder specialist unit in this country.</p> <p>In 2006, A Vision for Change emphasised the need to establish a national centre for eating disorders.  At the time it was proposed to be included in the new children's hospital.  The report also recommended the development of four specialist multidisciplinary teams nationally to deal with eating disorders, one per HSE region, and the provision of 24 public eating disorder beds nationally.  Nine years on from A Vision for Change, there is still no national centre for eating disorders nor have any specialised localised services been developed.  Given the scale of the problem, why is this not being prioritised?  It is clearly a big issue if 80 people are dying annually as a result of eating disorders.</p> <p>Constituents to whom I have spoken and who work with those suffering from eating disorders or who have family members who suffer have made it clear to me how desperately the services are needed.  I have raised the matter with the Minister of Health in the hope that movement can occur to get these services established for the benefit of the thousands of people affected as well as their families.  We need a debate in this House because it is an issue of priority and we need to give it the time it deserves.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister, Deputy White, yesterday launched some type of policy guide or initiative.  I repeat the need to have an urgent debate on media ownership and the desirability of having a balance of ownership in Irish media.  I do so in the context of the recent pronouncement from the Competition Authority in respect of Ryanair's supposed dominance of the Irish market and the view of the Competition Authority that, from an air travel perspective, competition is not only desirable but necessary.  What is good for free trade and free travel should also not only be good but also necessary for the media.  The need for a fair and balanced media presentation is vital in our democracy and media ownership is central to that debate.</p> <p>The disappointing thing about the pronouncement yesterday from the Minister, Deputy White, is that any proposals that would stem from his policy document will not be retrospective.  This means not only that any current dominance in the media will not be challenged but also that it will be literally copper-fastened in law.  It is some since the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, spoke about what she described as the possible Berlusconi media complex in Ireland.  At least in the case of Mr. Berlusconi, while he had a particular agenda, he stood for election.</p></speech>

As she said, it is a particularly punitive tax and the thresholds need to be reviewed in the light of rising property and land prices.  This tax is causing hardship for families who in many cases have to come up with large amounts of cash to pay the taxman following the death of a loved one.  The matter needs to be addressed because we are certainly out of kilter with other countries in Europe on this tax.</p><p>I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 will come into force on 1 July.  The primary purpose of the Act is to make provision for a broad range of health services free of charge to those who had been in the Magdalen laundries.  These women were treated very badly by the State in the past and it is good to see that some efforts are now being made to redress the injustices inflicted on them.</p><p>The services to be provided include general practitioner, medical and surgical services; drugs, medicines and surgical appliances; nursing services; home-help services; dental and ophthalmic services; counselling services; chiropody services; and physiotherapy services.  The Act also provides these women with exemptions from charges for acute inpatient services.  These services are being provided in addition to the other suite of services announced earlier which include <i>ex gratia</i>payments and pension top-ups.  I welcome that this issue, which was never dealt with by any previous Administration, has been addressed by this Government.  A major injustice that was inflicted on many unfortunate women is at last being put to right.</p></speech>

The incidence of malignant melanoma in Ireland has skyrocketed in recent years.  This is a cancer which in its earliest stages should be cured if it is removed with a simple excision of the affected area of the skin, but in many cases it is not cured.  It is a disease that can present with a more advanced disease or which has propensity for relapse.  The scary thing is that historically, this disease when it comes back has been very difficult to treat and is usually fatal.</p> <p>The incidence of the disease has skyrocketed in Ireland in recent years.  This is totally due to increased sun exposure.  As a national group we are not well endowed with defences against the sun.  We were designed for spending our time in the grey misty skies of north-western Europe.  Now that we have more opportunities to access the sun through travel we are seeing a colossal increase.  This is not just some visitation from God.  This is something we do to ourselves and we can do something about it.</p> <p>I will now give the good news.  Last week in Chicago, at the conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, extraordinary data were presented about newer immune system treatments for the minority of patients who have advanced secondary malignant melanoma.  Without boring Members with all the details, this was a large 1,000-patient study.  I am very proud to say approximately 20 members, who were recruited through the All-Ireland Co-operative Oncology Research Group, an organisation which I, along with my colleague John Armstrong founded 17 years ago, were part of this trial and contributed to the data.  More than 50% of patients with this advanced, usually incurable cancer had major remissions of their cancer.  Approximately 20% to 25% of them had a complete disappearance of the cancer.  We believe it is likely that many of those patients will be cured.  So this is a stunning event.</p> <p>The problem is that it will be extraordinarily costly.  The other information that came from Chicago last week is that these types of new immune system treatments, which were of use principally in relatively uncommon cancers, may work in lung cancer, some types of bowel cancer, possibly in bladder cancer and in a variety of other diseases.  So a torrent of data may become available to us over the next year or two that these new and very expensive drugs have life-saving potential.</p> <p>We need to do some forward planning.  There is no doubt that we will be spending a bit more on drugs if we approve these drugs.  I make a specific suggestion to the Government party leadership because we cannot initiate money Bills here or make specific financial proposals.  I would like if somebody in the Government would take on board as a project a plan for the next budget to impose an additional &euro;5 tax on a pack of cigarettes which would be ring-fenced for one purpose only, which would be the provision of expensive drugs and medications for people who get smoking-related diseases.  I would not be so sectarian as to deny my colleagues in cardiology access to this as well.  The money should be designated for the treatment of diseases caused by smoking.</p> <p>This would have the twin effects of raising revenue and disincentivising people from smoking.  I believe this should be done.  We have talked about it in the past.  This country is not good at ring-fencing taxes and the reality is that tax gets a bad rap.  We know what has happened in the past with tax money being frittered away in the financial sector and on things that were completely non-productive.</p> <p>We should take this on board as a policy and ring-fence the &euro;5 additional tax.  We should also put a tax on sunbeds to be used to address the same issue.  We should then completely remove all VAT from sun-protection products, which should be considered as medicinal agents.  Otherwise not only will we have the tragedy of many people - many of them young - getting incurable cancer, but we will also have the financial consequences of paying for the treatments we will not be able to afford, some of which will costs hundreds of thousands of euro.</p></speech>

It purports to provide angel therapy, a non-denominational spiritual healing system.  It may seem like a funny subject until one realises that people are paying &euro;50 or &euro;60 per session to talk to the angels.  Some of the people who have contacted me have other illness, including psychological illnesses.</p> <p>I have done some research into the matter.  It has been in existence since 1958.  Nonetheless, there is no proven benefit to people.  People are entitled to do what they like with their money and people are entitled to provide whatever services they like.  I want the Deputy Leader to inquire from the Revenue and the Minister for Finance as to whether this operation, which is spreading across the country at a rate that only angels could do, is tax compliant and that there is some regulation of it.</p> <p>In the world I live in there is one Lord, one God, but everybody is entitled to believe whatever they want to believe.  Given that this organisation and its workshops are extracting &euro;50 or &euro;60 for an afternoon sitting in a room in the belief that one is being put in contact with angels, some regulation needs to be applied to it.</p></speech>

It was a case I would have raised had I not been acting as Leader today.  It is a matter of grave concern.  I am very happy to seek a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in this House.  I know others are also concerned about it.  Like other Senators, I read the text of the hand-written letter, written by Mr. Ibrahim Halawa in prison.  It is on the record that his family is very concerned about his state of mind as evidenced by the letter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I did ask for a briefing on the case.  I understand Ibrahim's father and sisters met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, last Thursday evening and that his mother is in Egypt.  The two objectives of the Irish Government are to see this Irish citizen being released by the Egyptian authorities in order that he can return to his family and studies in Ireland and to provide consular support to ensure his welfare while he remains in detention.  The matter of immediate concern is the further adjournment of his trial.  As I understand there has been a request from defence lawyers that hearings not take place during Ramadan, the next hearing is scheduled for 2 August.  Ibrahim has received over 40 consular visits since he was first detained, the most recent of which was on Monday, 8 June.  Irish Embassy officials attended the most recent hearing on 3 June and will attend the next hearing on 2 August.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and Cairo continue to provide strong consular support for Ibrahim and his family.  His bail application on 26 April was supported by the Irish Government but was refused, with all of the other bail applications in the case.  The Minister met his Egyptian counterpart following the bail application refusal and discussed the case with him in some detail.  There are ongoing contacts.  However, I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House to address us on the matter and discuss if there is anything further the Irish Government could be doing.  That the matter is before an Egyptian judge and not directly in the purview of the Egyptian Government is a difficulty.  There is immense concern about the conditions in which Ibrahim is being kept, the legality of his detention and the nature of his case.  I take issue with Senator Mark Daly's outrageous statement that there might be a difference in treatment if this Irish citizen was of a different religion.  I take exception to that statement, as addressed by Senator John Gilroy.  We should request the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the matter and I will do so.<br/><br/>Senator Mark Daly also referred non-Government motion No. 16 on the Order Paper on the closure of the Rosalie Unit in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  As it deals with a very specific matter, I suggest it would be more appropriate to raise it by way of a Commencement Matter.  <br/><br/>Senator Paul Coghlan also referred to the case of Ibrahim Halawa and the grave humanitarian concerns raised.  He also welcomed the establishment of the commission of investigation and the appointment of Judge Daniel O'Keeffe.  I echo his views in that regard.  He also spoke about the tremendous work being done by the <i>Le Eithne</i>and the Irish Naval Service in the Mediterranean.  I understand that to date it has saved the lives of 1,153 migrants, which is an amazing achievement.  I join the Senator in sending our commendations to the crew of the <i>Le Eithne</i>.<br/><br/>Senator David Norris called for a debate on the city of Dublin.  I disagree with his remarks in that regard.  It is important that we emphasise the need to facilitate cyclists and pedestrians in the inner city.  For far too long, the car has been king in the inner city, but that is about to change.  I speak as a resident who lives in an area between the canals, as does the Senator, and a regular cyclist.  This is not about climate conditions, as those who are all-weather cyclists wear waterproof clothing.  We need to do more for cyclists and pedestrians.  I am very excited about Dublin City Council's plan under which it is not proposed to ban cars from the city centre but to make College Green, in particular, much more pedestrian and cyclist friendly.  I do agree with the Senator, however, that the council must make provision for those who live in the city and support his proposal on the use of different coloured plates in that regard.<br/><br/>Senator John Gilroy spoke about the bandwagon effect.  I agree with his remarks on the issue, on which I have commented.  I also agree with his comment that the appropriate time to make points in that regard was during the debate last night on the motion on IBRC.  The Senator also referred to the case of Ibrahim Halawa, an issue I have addressed.  He also sought a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on public transport pricing policy.  I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that issue.<br/><br/>Senator Terry Leyden also raised the Roscommon issue.  I have dealt with it.  <br/><br/>Senator Catherine Noone supported Senator David Norris's call for a debate on the city of Dublin.  As I said, I will undertake to arrange such a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  <br/><br/>Senator Catherine Noone also called for a debate with the Minister for Finance on inheritance tax.  It might be better to have that debate prior to the budget.  I will endeavour to arrange it.  <br/><br/>Senator David Cullinane called for a debate on services for children with disabilities.  I remind the Senator that two weeks ago, on 27 May, we had a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on health services for people with intellectual disabilities, during which a number of Senators raised the points raised today by him, including those about waiting lists and the delays encountered by children, in particular.  I will, however, endeavour to arrange a further debate on disability services.  As stated by the Senator, the Minister of State has been proactive in coming to the Seanad for debates.  I am sure she will be happy to do so again.  However, it may not be possible to arrange such a debate bearing in mind that we have a very heavy schedule and that the Minister of State was only recently in the House to discuss a related issue.<br/><br/>Senator Lorraine Higgins spoke about the need for an eating disorder specialist unit.  I agree with her that there is a need to prioritise this issue.  The House is scheduled to hear statements on tackling obesity on Wednesday next, from 3 p.m. until 5 p.m., in the presence of the Minister for Health.  That would be an appropriate time for the Senator to express her concerns.  <br/><br/>Senator Paul Bradford called for a debate on media guidelines, a debate I have previously sought to arrange.  I will, however, endeavour to arrange it.  I agree with the Senator's comments in that regard.  The media merger guidelines published yesterday by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, set out the procedures to be followed when a media merger takes place or is proposed and give guidance on what the Minister will take into account when assessing whether a merger would or would not be in the public interest.  Recent events have caused the issue to be of much greater political significance.</p></speech>

It is under that Act that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has the power to determine whether a proposed media merger would be in the public interest.  I am happy to seek a debate on the matter in the light of recent events.</p> <p>Senator Michael Mullins also called for a debate on inheritance tax.  I will endeavour to arrange such a debate.  The Senator also welcomed the commencement, from 1 July, of the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015.  The Minister's announcement on the commencement of the Act is welcome.  The Senator outlined the purpose of the legislation.  That the survivors of the Magdalen institutions, in particular, are to be adequately provided for is hugely welcome.  As the Senator said, this is a legacy issue.  This is the first Government to deal with what has been a long-standing injustice for the women concerned.</p> <p>Senator John Crown spoke about the skyrocketing increase in the incidence of malignant melanoma.  As stated by him, it is a source of huge concern.  I am sure everybody welcomes the new treatments being trialled which show some positive advances.  I liked the three specific proposals made by the Senator.  Perhaps we might put together a cross-party motion on positive steps that could be taken to deal with this issue, to include a tax on cigarette packages, a tax on sunbeds and the removal of VAT on sun protection products.  I recently had to purchase sun protection creams for children.  It costs a minimum of &euro;10 to buy a small bottle which does not last very long in providing protection for a child exposed to the sun every day while on a sun holiday.  The aforementioned proposals represent practical and useful measures.  We should consider how we might advance them.</p> <p>Senator Denis Landy referred to angel workshops and the issue of divine intervention.  I agree with him that it is a serious matter if people are being exploited.  It raises issues not only on the tax side but also on the trade description side.  There are a number of options we could examine in terms of regulation to ensure there is no exploitation.  I will discuss with the Senator how we might approach the issue.</p></speech>

It was a necessary response to that atrocity and the loss of 29 innocent lives.  The bombing and those murders represented a direct attack also on the fragile peace process and indeed on this State.  It demanded a resolute response from the State and a clear statement that the morally bankrupt culture of death adopted by these murderers would not prevail over the will of the majority on this island who wished to live in peace.  There was a clear necessity to provide strong legislative powers to ensure that the Garda and the courts were in a position to meet the challenges laid down by the opponents of peace.  In that regard, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 provided that response.</p> <p>It is right at the outset that I pay tribute to the excellent work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, in counteracting the threat from the paramilitary organisations.  Their ongoing seamless co-operation has foiled many attacks and saved the lives, to this day, of innocent people.</p> <p>The Act contains a series of amendments to the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1985 to make them more responsive to the threat from certain groups.  Principally, these amendments concern the following: changes in the rules of evidence for certain offences under the Acts, including the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances; the creation of new offences, such as directing an unlawful organisation, possession of certain articles and collecting information; and extending the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the 1939 Act to 72 hours.</p> <p>Section 18 of the 1998 Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, provides that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12,14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force.  By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2014, these sections continued in force for a period of 12 months.</p> <p>Prior to moving any motion for renewal, the Act requires that I lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions.  The present report covers the period from 1 June 2014 to 31 May 2015.  The report was laid before the House on 10 June 2015.  It also includes, following a commitment given previously, a table showing the figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The table helps to show the importance of the Act in equipping the Garda to detect and prevent terrorist actions.</p><p>It is the fervent wish of the Government and, no doubt this House, that the time will come when these provisions will no longer be required.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I must take into account the reality of the situation.  In that regard, the Garda assessment, which is shared by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, of the terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland is that it is regarded as severe.  We all know that those groups are vehemently opposed to peace and seek to attack the institutions of Northern Ireland and destabilise the peace process.  I wish to tell them that they will never succeed.</p><p>While the direct threat level in this jurisdiction may be different, it is imperative that our laws and our police are properly equipped to deal with the threat, whether it is in this jurisdiction or Northern Ireland.  Let no one be under any illusion that these groups do not represent a threat to this State, as well as to Northern Ireland.  It is a clearly established fact that these groups operate hand in hand with organised criminals and, in their behaviour, are indistinguishable from such elements.  Any ideology, if it was ever possessed by them, has long ago been eroded by a culture of extortion, kidnappings, beatings and drug dealings.</p></speech>

The powers available under the 1998 Act are considered paramount in maintaining effective preventative action against these terrorist groups.  Consequently, there is a need for the continuance of these provisions.</p> <p>North-South co-operation in the area of security is vital and I can assure the House that it has never been better.  As was the case with my predecessors, I maintain close contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner maintains close and frequent contact with her counterpart in the PSNI and this relationship is mirrored by contacts between the two forces at every level.</p> <p>While countering the threat posed by terrorist groups is very important, it is necessary not to lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  The 1998 Act grew out of our own domestic troubles.  However, its provisions form an essential element of the State's response to the threat of terrorism from any source.  As seen with events in Paris and Belgium, and the continuing conflict in Syria, we cannot ignore the growth in recent years of the international terrorist threat.  In co-operation with our EU partners, we must continue to counteract any threat from such sources.  The 1998 Act forms part of the response to that threat also, as does the recently commenced Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2015 which came into force on 8 June this year.  I thank Members of this House for facilitating the passage of that legislation earlier.</p> <p>It is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Act continues to be a most important tool in its ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report that I have laid before the House.  It is essential that the Act's provisions should continue in force to support the ongoing investigation and disruption of terrorist activity.</p> <p>I shall turn to the provisions of the 1998 Act, which are the subject of the resolution.  The report I have mentioned demonstrates the value of the relevant sections to the Garda, and the necessity for their continued availability in tackling the terrorist threat.  </p> <p>Section 2 allows a court, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, to draw appropriate inferences where an accused person fails to answer or gives false or misleading answers to questions.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on the basis of such an inference.  There must be some other evidence which points towards a person's guilt.   The section was used on 42 occasions in the period covered by the report.</p> <p>Section 3 requires an accused, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, to give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf.  This section was not used in the period in question.</p> <p>Section 4 provides that evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation can be inferred from certain conduct, including matters such as movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused.  This section was used once in the period covered by the report.</p> <p>Section 6 was used once.  Section 7 was used on 21 occasions.  Section 8 was not used in the reporting period in question and section 9 used on 10 occasions.</p> <p>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court, following an application by a Garda of at least Superintendent rank.  An extension was applied for in 20 cases and was granted in 19 cases.</p> <p>During the period under the report, section 11 was used on 18 occasions, section 12 was not used and section 14 was used on nine occasions.  Section 17 was not used in the reporting period in question.</p> <p>As the report indicates, a number of sections, namely, section 3 on the notification of witnesses, section 8 which refers to the unlawful collection of information, section 12 which refers to training persons in the making or use of firearms, and section 17 which refers to the forfeiture of property, were not utilised during the reporting period in question.  It should not be inferred from the lack of use of these provisions that they are in some way redundant or unnecessary as the usage of the different sections can vary, as Senators will understand, from year to year.</p> <p>The existence of the provisions means that members of terrorist groups are aware that the State remains resolute in its determination to use every lawful means to defeat them.  I wish to point out that section 12 has,  in effect, been strengthened by a provision in the legislation that I mentioned earlier.  I refer to the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015.  It creates the three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences carry sentences for imprisonment of up to ten years on conviction on indictment.</p> <p>As I have already stated, terrorist groups remain a threat to the peaceful lives of people on this island.  Such terrorists oppose the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine same.  The State must retain, in its laws, the capacity to defeat them.</p> <p>On the basis of the information set out in the report, and on the advice of the Garda authorities, I ask the House to approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act in order for them to remain in operation for a further 12 months, commencing on 30 June 2015.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

We brought that in at a time of terrible strife in this country.  It was done at a time when we thought we would have uninterrupted peace but, sadly, peace did not last.  Unfortunately, there are still people who do not accept the message, who are not with the programme and are intent on killing, maiming and kidnapping.  These people are very much involved in oil laundering, diesel laundering and smuggling.  They conduct so-called businesses all along the Border area between this State and the North of Ireland.  </p> <p>We introduced the Act in response to the Omagh bombing.  The State must remain vigilant in the face of a continuous threat posed by dissident republicans who refuse to recognise the legality of this State which is provided for in the Constitution.  My party supports the motion.  The Minister has outlined the various sections that have been used.  As one can see, they have used on many occasions and, therefore, it is important that this legislation is maintained.  We should consider permanently keeping the provisions in legislation.  I do not consider many of the provisions to be extraordinary when one must deal with terrorists.  We should not have to return here every year to renew them.  It feels like we must almost apologise for doing so, but I make no apology.  We are here to pass the legislation and long may it last.  Long may the garda&iacute; and their colleagues in the Police Service of Northern Ireland continue to do their job.  </p></speech>

If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deems that it needs further additional powers, we in the Oireachtas should not be found wanting in facilitating the force with those powers.</p><p>Senator Byrne is quite correct when he states that we feel as if we are apologising for coming into the House annually to review this legislation.

It is very important we review this legislation every year.  The Act contains infringements of human and civil rights, and although they are understandable in the circumstances, I think it is absolutely necessary that every year we review them.  I am moved by the Minister's invocation of Omagh.  I remember that day; it was an appalling situation - utterly inhuman.  Among the lives lost was a child in the womb.  It was a barbarous, inexplicable and unforgivable outrage.  I am rather surprised and a bit alarmed that the Minister demonstrates the importance and significance of the Act to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly when she states that the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland is regarded as severe.  I think we in the South often do not recollect this or realise the pressures that are still upon the fragile peace process in Northern Ireland.  There is no doubt, of course, that there are hardened criminals involved.  They migrate very easily into the drugs trade.  Not only in Northern Ireland but in Dublin, and in my area, they were involved very early in the drugs trade.  This is appalling.</p> <p>The Minister recites other activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, torture and beatings, which need to be stamped out.  I welcome the strong evidence of co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is excellent.  This is the way in a sense in which the island becomes united behind the forces of law and order.</p> <p>There is a balance in the legislation, which I welcome because the drawing of inferences from an accused person refusing to give information is delicate.  It infringes the right to silence but I am glad to see it is balanced by the fact that a person cannot be convicted solely on the evidence of refusing to give an answer.  This is what we really need to watch in terms of human rights.  The right to silence is an ingrained and appropriate part of the law.  It requires serious justification to infringe it.</p> <p>Section 4 covers the evidence of membership of certain unlawful organisations being inferred from certain conduct, including matters such as movement, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused.  I understand this but it needs to be monitored because this is getting quite close to guilt by attainder.  It is important we monitor and keep these things under review.</p> <p>The remaining provisions, such as making it an offence for people to train in the use of or have possession of firearms and so on is perfectly normal.  It would be extraordinary if the State did not arm itself to defend itself against people who are setting up private armies and training them.</p> <p>To repeat, this exercise is a useful reminder of the threat under which the peace process continues.  I am quite prepared on this occasion to support the Minister in continuing these provisions, but I think it is important we review them every year.  I make no apology for that.  I know I am possibly in a minority of one, although I see that I am not.</p></speech>

I echo Senator Norris's comments on the appalling atrocity of Omagh.  I think it is important we put that on the record and the reason for the implementation of the 1998 Act.  I absolutely agree with Senator Norris that these provisions deserve annual scrutiny by Parliament.  That is a very important mechanism and safeguard and I would not agree with the idea of making the provisions permanent without having the capacity to come back.  I have been here every year since 2008, in various capacities, to speak on this issue.  It is really important we review the use of these provisions.  They depart from our normal values of due process.  I should declare an interest as someone who practised in the Special Criminal Court and operated these provisions as a defence lawyer.  They depart from normal principles of due process.  Section 3 requires an accused to give notice of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf when charged with membership of an unlawful organisation.  Senator Norris rightly referred to section 4 as potentially giving rise to guilt by association because it allows inferences to be drawn from conduct such as associations on the part of the accused concerning evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation, a very serious offence.</p></speech>

I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on their really important and valuable work in monitoring and challenging terrorist threats.  I know we are all conscious of the severe nature of the terrorist threat, but there is a balance and it is useful we have this scrutiny.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for providing this table in her report, which very helpfully gives us a 15-year pattern of usage of the provisions.  I have said before that where a provision has not been used for years, we should specifically consider repealing it, even if we are keeping the remaining provisions in force.  I would have thought section 4 could be repealed but I see it has been used in the period under review.  It was previously only used in 2008.  I am conscious, as the Minister has said, that just because a provision has not been used in one year, usage may vary from year to year, and particular instances may give rise to that.  Section 12 has not been used since 2002, so again we should keep this matter under review.</p> <p>I am happy to support the motion this time.  I absolutely support the Minister in saying that it is the fervent wish of the Government and all Members that a time will come when these provisions will no longer be required, but for the time being I agree that they be kept in force.  I think we should keep them under annual scrutiny.</p></speech>

Is d&oacute;igh linn gur cheart breathn&uacute; ar&iacute;s air.</p> <p>We all know the background of the Offence Against the State Act.  Senators need to consider the disruptive effect of this legislation on human rights, civil liberties and on democratic life in the State.  We are living in a new political reality and the Government has an onus to live up to its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to remove obstacles that hinder the normalisation of security.  In this context the scrapping of the Offences against the State Act is a must.  The provisions up for renewal and indeed the Act in its entirety have no place in a modern democracy and have nothing to contribute to the future of peace on the island.</p> <p>The apparent apathy of other Opposition Members on this issue and the ill-advised enthusiasm of others for specific aspects of the Act have obvious negative implications for all of society.  The Minister referred to upholding and implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement because it is the democratic wish of the people.  This means, therefore, that there is an onus on us to bring about as quickly as possible the normalisation of policing and justice on the island.  In this context the Government has obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to work towards the normalisation of security in the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes the legislation is counter-productive in the long run.  The retention of these provisions is an admission of the failure of this and previous Government.  The challenge for us is to prove we have a normal society and that normal policing will convict those who seek to undermine it.  Draconian legislation can never be a substitute for sound law and good accountable policing.  The continuation of the Act erodes the human rights ethos in which the State's legislation should be grounded.  We are a normal society and our existing laws are strong enough if properly resourced.</p> <p>Is d&oacute;igh linn go bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ag dul thar f&oacute;ir.

These offences are subject to trial in court and any accused person has recourse to legal representation and the protection of the legal process.</p><p>I thank Senator Byrne for the support he has shown for the motion and note the point he made about permanence.  These are robust measures which, as Senator Bacik noted, are not used in the normal course of criminal law.

The annual review of provisions is part of the process of achieving a balance in the legislation.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#S00300"><p>This resolution will provide for the continuation in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for a 12-month period beginning on 30 June 2015.  The 2009 Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act was enacted as a response to a number of difficulties being experienced and where the entire justice system was under serious threat.  At that time, Senators may remember that organised criminal gangs were behaving as though they were untouchable by the Garda and the courts and that could not be allowed to continue.  The House will also recall certain dreadful crimes where the gangs involved acted in a way that betrayed their willingness to undermine the very operation of our criminal justice system, if not society itself.</p><p>Hand in hand with the disregard for human life was the intimidation of whole communities to prevent people co-operating with the forces of law and order to bring these people to justice. There was also significant evidence of intimidation of witnesses and it was clear that these people were prepared to go to any lengths to thwart the operation of the justice system.  Clearly, these gangs had no regard for the rights of others or for our societal values.  Garda&iacute; were, at that time, encountering difficulties in persuading people to give assistance in their investigations. In the circumstances, it was imperative that the Government and the Oireachtas took the necessary steps to ensure that the criminal justice system was robust enough to withstand the assault launched upon it through intimidation of and violence towards witnesses and jurors.</p><p>The measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 were designed to tilt the balance firmly in favour of the rule of law and justice and instil confidence in that criminal gangs were not going to be permitted to frustrate criminal investigations or prosecutions of their activities.  In view of the very real threat which these gangs posed, the Act provided for a limited number of specific &quot;organised crime&quot; offences to be prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court.  The proposal to use the Special Criminal Court for a limited number of organised crime offences removed the possibility of jury tampering or intimidation of jurors.  The purpose of section 8, therefore, is to ensure that organised criminal gangs cannot interfere with the criminal process to determine the outcome of cases.  To this end, the section declares that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order with respect to certain offences.  The offences in question are the organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</p><p>Briefly, the offences in question are directing the activities of a criminal organisation, participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation, committing a serious offence for a criminal organisation and liability for offences committed by a body corporate.  Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 makes these scheduled<i></i>offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  This means that the Special Criminal Court will hear prosecutions for the offences in question but the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, may still exercise her power to direct that the offences should be tried in the ordinary courts.  Permitting the DPP this discretion maintains the fundamental balance in deciding which cases are appropriate to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.</p><p>A further bulwark in maintaining this balance is provided in section 8(4) of the 2009 Act.  It provides that the section shall cease to be in operation unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas, resolving that it should continue in operation for a further period to be decided by the Oireachtas.  That, as I have said, is the purpose of moving today's resolution.  A report on this, as on the other motion we discussed, has been laid before the Houses.</p><p>The reasons for which the Government and I, as Minister, are seeking the renewal of section 8 are clear.  Organised crime continues to present a significant law enforcement issue, with a number of criminal gangs continuing to engage in serious crimes.  There is, unfortunately, stark evidence of the willingness of these gangs to engage in murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, counterfeiting and other serious offences.  We are also faced with the reality that there are growing links between paramilitary groups and organised crime.  Given the nature of organised crime, the investigation and prosecution process can be lengthy and difficult.  This is particularly so given the level of intimidation carried out by the criminal gangs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The 2009 Act has been in operation for at most six years and while there have been arrests under the relevant sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, no cases have yet come before the Special Criminal Court in accordance with section 8.  However, this does not invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use in appropriate circumstances.  Let us be clear.  If criminals are prepared to take human life, then they are quite prepared to subvert the system of justice.  Accordingly, there is a necessity for legislation that anticipates this possibility to be in place.  There is a responsibility on me as Minister, on the Government and on the House to ensure that our criminal law contains appropriate provisions to ensure that investigations are not hampered, and the effective administration of justice by the courts.  In my view section 8 is necessary in this regard.</p><p>The use of the Act to date also serves to highlight the considered approach of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  It vindicates the way in which the provision is constructed, allowing her to exercise her discretion to direct that cases would be tried in the ordinary courts where there is considered to be no threat to their proper functioning.</p><p>In the report to me on the operation of section 8, the Garda Commissioner is of the clear view that the requirement for this provision remains.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I must have the utmost regard for the views of the Garda authorities in matters such as this.  It is absolutely essential to ensure that the garda&iacute; have at their disposal the best possible range of powers to face up to organised criminal gangs.</p><p>In the period under report, there have been a total of 25 arrests under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  These relate to arrests made under section 72, participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation - and section 73, committing an offence for a criminal organisation.  Section 71A and 76 was not used in the reporting period in question.  Since its inception on 23 July 2009 there have been to date a total of 259 arrests under section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.</p><p>The Garda authorities devote considerable resources from across the Garda organisation to tackling organised crime and they deserve our praise for the successes they have had.  The Commissioner has the Government's full support in tackling these issues.  Those involved in organised crime are ruthless people who will stop at nothing to avoid being brought to account for their crimes.  Violence and intimidation are a way of life for these people.  We, that is, the Government and the Oireachtas, have a duty to make sure that the criminal justice system is equipped to prevent them undermining our core values.  To that end, we must ensure that in the most serious of cases, where jury intimidation is a real possibility, the law has a means available to it to bring serious criminals to account.</p><p>In all the circumstances I consider it necessary to continue section 8 in operation for a further period.  The period now proposed will run for 12 months beginning on 30 June 2015.  I commend the motion to the House and ask for its support.</p></speech>

I confirm that Fianna F&aacute;il supports the continuance in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which is a vital legislative tool in the battle against organised crime.  This Act was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in government and has led to a significant reduction in gangland activity.  Section 8 allows for the prosecution of individuals before the Special Criminal Court without a jury for directing a criminal organisation, participating in or contributing to the activity of a criminal organisation for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of a serious offence and-or committing an offence for a criminal organisation.  This is a necessary legislative provision to rebalance the justice system approach in favour of the garda&iacute; in the fight against organised crime.</p> <p>The Criminal Justice Bill was enacted by Fianna F&aacute;il in July 2009 to put in place certain additional legislative measures to tackle organised crime.  Among those measures was section 8, which provides that certain organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 are scheduled offences for the purpose of Part 5 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.</p> <p>The number of arrests under this section is encouraging.  It is the proper utilisation by the State of the Special Criminal Courts, non-jury courts, in those situations.  The Garda Commissioner and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be commended on their courageous attack on organised crime throughout the country, particularly in the city of Dublin and Limerick, which I believe has brought peace to that region.</p> <p>Any person would be terrified to sit on a jury which is open to inspection and because of the easy access to information now, through the Internet and other methods, it is very easy to trace members of a jury, and those members would be putting their lives at risk in certain cases.  That is why I fully support this motion and the fact that we have strong, independent and courageous members of our Judiciary who are prepared to sit in the Special Criminal Court and decide on cases based on the evidence given fairly by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This section is very worthwhile.</p> <p>I avail of this opportunity to inform the Minister that deep concern has been expressed by the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and others about the recent release of an individual, whom I will not name, who was responsible for the tragic death of a young garda.  He served a very short time.  He finished up in Loughan House, in Cavan, from which he escaped for a period.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the public, are very concerned about this situation and I ask the Minister to consider examining the legislation in this regard.  Garda&iacute; need special provision and anyone who is responsible for the death of a garda on duty should be sent to prison for a far longer period.  The individual about whom I speak had 91 previous convictions.  The Minister may be meeting the members of the GRA to discuss this matter and I know that as an effective Minister for Justice and Equality she will do her utmost, in consultation with her senior officials, the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General and others, to determine where she can strengthen the law in this regard.</p></speech>

I support the motion, as does my party, and I commend the Minister, and the garda&iacute;, on their work, particularly in my neighbouring city of Limerick where a phenomenal amount of work has been done.  The people in Limerick are no longer in fear of their lives when they open their doors.  I say "well done" in that regard, and it is essential that we agree to this motion.  I could not be more brief.</p></speech>

Nothing like this was heard of when I was a young person.  People are now prepared to go out and murder.  Nice looking young men are hired, and they think nothing of going out, putting a gun to somebody's head, pulling the trigger and blowing the head off the individual.  That is a routine activity now.  There seems to be no reticence about engaging in this kind of activity.  It is horrendous, and I do not know what can be done about it.  How can people be sensitised to that?  Taking another human being's life is the most arrogant act one can possibly perpetrate.</p> <p>The question of jury tampering and intimidation is another very good point.  We have had a number of examples of that and for that reason it is a regrettable necessity that we have to have this kind of legislation involving criminal cases being heard in the Special Criminal Court.</p> <p>The Minister said that the Garda Commissioner, in his report, stated that this is necessary.  What else would she expect?  The garda&iacute; will hold on to every power they possibly can so I do not necessarily regard that as an argument.  The Minister made some substantial arguments but while one treats the opinion of the Garda Commissioner with respect, it is what one would anticipate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a regrettable necessity that this legislation is in place.

In that context, I am happy to support the motion but I also welcome the opportunity to review the operation of the legislation every 12 months.  Jury trial is a fundamental right and a fundamental part of our criminal justice system, but section 8 provides for it to be bypassed or sidestepped by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I welcome that in the period under review, no cases were sent forward to the Special Criminal Court by the DPP in exercising her power under that section, nor indeed was that power exercised in the previous 24 months.  That is useful as it indicates the sensible exercise of discretion by the DPP and I am happy to support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#U00300"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar&iacute;s.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that it is a sad reflection on a government or a state when it has to admit that the courts are unable to deal with individuals who are involved in organised criminal activity.  In such circumstances, the state in question has failed to deal with issues like jury intimidation and witness protection.  If we are serious about dealing with organised criminal gangs, we need to put more resources in place.  For instance, we should not be closing rural Garda stations and reducing the resources available to them.  The Minister has said this legislation is just one aspect of the issue.  If we are serious about tackling organised crime, however, we must ensure financial resources are invested in front line services and manpower.</p> <p>I have no doubt people involved in organised criminal activity see the introduction of legislation to ensure they are tried before a special court as an admission of failure.  In other words, it means the State has failed to provide protections and safeguards to people who serve on juries.  The Special Criminal Court is the wrong way to go.  This is not flippantly to disregard the activities of the criminal gangs - far from it - because we understand they cause misery and hardship.  We know they destroy whole communities, murder and maim and have no regard for law and order.  If we examine best international practice, however, we see that other countries have found more effective ways of dealing with organised criminal gangs that do not involve draconian institutions like the Special Criminal Court.  There are better ways of dealing with this issue that do not contravene basic human rights, such as the right to a trial by jury, and which are far more effective in the real and ideological struggle against organised crime.

I commend this motion and wish to put my support for it on the record of the House.  I understand it is a tough task trying to deal with organised crime.  My own city of Limerick has been plagued by criminal gangs for a long time.  I would argue, however, that one of the biggest criminal gangs operating in this country is the Provisional IRA.  It is raising large sums of money through fuel laundering, protection rackets and so forth and has absolutely destroyed communities in the Border area.  It rules those communities through fear and intimidation.  One only needs to look at the case of young Paul Quinn to see the savagery these animals inflict.  The only way that any court could possibly deal with people like that is through the methods provided for in this legislation and for that reason I commend the motion.</p></speech>

I reassure the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved, with particular emphasis on the linked areas of organised, gun and drug related crime.  None of us, as public representatives, can be blind to the pernicious impact that organised crime, especially the drugs trade, has on communities throughout the State.  I thank Senators for their support for the legislation.</p> <p>Homicide rates and related gun crime continue to be monitored very closely by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a view to putting in place appropriate initiatives and operations to target this type of crime and criminality.  Operations are ongoing to tackle and dismantle serious and organised crime.  These investigations continue to be progressed actively under the daily supervision of local and national Garda management.  The decision I took as Minister for Justice and Equality recently to increase recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to approximately 550, with 250 new recruits starting in the next few months, will help, as will the investment of additional resources, for example, the sum of &euro;27 million for new Garda vehicles.  These additional resources will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing effectively with criminal gangs and organised crime.</p></speech>

It merely seeks to change the Title of the legislation to reflect the fact that if the Government was serious about dealing with the issue of law pay and in-work poverty, addressing the minimum wage is not enough.  The issue concerns the Low Pay Commission dealing with some of the statistics which show Ireland is a low wage economy in comparison with other 15 European Union countries.</p></speech>

The principal function of the commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage with a view to ensuring the national minimum wage, when adjusted, will be adjusted incrementally over time, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  Of course, the remit of the commission will involve it exploring many other factors associated with the issue of low pay.</p> <p>The Bill replaces the previous means by which the national minimum wage was adjusted and will replace them with an annual analysis and recommendations by the Low Pay Commission.  These means were set out in sections 11 to 13, inclusive, of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 which are now being repealed by section 9 of the Bill.  Clearly, the role of the commission is firmly set within the national minium wage legislation of the State.  This does not mean, despite the advice of some representatives in this House, that its remit is narrow.  I am disappointed that this view seems to be consistently expressed by Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular.  As previously stated, the commission is certainly doing much more than setting the rate of the national minimum wage and should be taken very seriously, as it has been by trade unions and employers.  I expect representatives in this House to take it seriously, too.  </p> <p>Section 5 also provides that the Commission on Low Pay may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on matters related generally to its functions under legislation.  That request will be made not later than two months after the start of each year and will form part of the work programme of the commission for that year.  That will allow me and future Ministers to each year ask the commission to address areas about which we are all concerned and advise the Government in an expert and evidence based way on the best approach to take.  This is a very significant institutional change in Irish society.  I hope all Members can support this, but for the reasons outlined I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</p></speech>

The growth in the numbers of the working poor has a detrimental effect on families, children in particular, and entire communities.

The national minimum wage should be designed to assist as many low paid workers as is reasonably practicable; should be set at a rate that is both fair and sustainable and, where adjustment is appropriate, adjusted incrementally and over time progressively increased, without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I have no hesitation in stating yet again what I have said publicly time and again in this House and in other fora.

The Low Pay Commission can and will assist in providing an important institutional framework to ensure this happens.  The objective of ensuring workers are entitled to just and favourable remuneration is clearly built into the criteria that will guide the commission in making a recommendation to me on the appropriate level of the national minimum wage.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Any measure below the median does not reflect the prevalence of low pay in the economy.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 is an attempt truly to address the issue of low pay, but to do so we need to deal with the issue on a sectoral basis.  While low pay pervades all sectors of the economy, it is especially widespread in the hospitality, retail and services sector.  It is also present in other sectors.  The point is that sectors will vary and it is important to take a sectoral approach to deal specifically with low pay each of the various sectors.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 proposes to insert text to the effect that the aim of the commission should be to move incrementally towards a living wage.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 serves to ensure the minimum wage is established on the basis of current costs and the minimum expenditure levels incurred by the employee.  It need not be as high as it is currently if costs were contained or even reduced.  For example, if policies were implemented to control housing rents, the living wage would then fall.  Other examples include various interventions in public transport.  The Low Pay Commission should highlight the high cost of poor public services that low-paid workers experience, and it should do this as a first step in conducting a more detailed analysis of such costs and how they impact on workers' living standards.</p><p>Amendment No. 8 servers to ensure that when we discuss job creation, decent work is at the heart of the debate.  This must be about more than simply fair pay and a living wage, which are only one part of the overall picture.  We need to ensure employers are compelled to treat workers with respect and dignity.  They should not be able to harass, intimidate or victimise vulnerable workers, as we have seen in some current industrial disputes.  We have seen some workers having their hours cut while others have been let go in one particular dispute.  We should remember these workers are already vulnerable and in or at risk of poverty and deprivation.  That employers operate on the basis of controlling workers through a culture of fear or a system of retribution is unacceptable and should not be legally permissible.  We need to ensure workers have security of employment and certainty around their hours.</p><p>Amendment No. 14 attempts to address the serious problem in terms a widening gender pay gap.  We know that women make up the bulk of workers in the low-paid sectors.  They make up approximately 60% of precarious workers, for example.  Decent wages would stimulate economic growth as workers would have more spending power.  They would also increase what the State receives in terms of tax receipts.  We need to ensure income inequality, particularly gender income inequality, is reduced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#X00700"><p>I have a number of amendments tabled and I will take them one by one.  As the Minister of State is aware, I have welcomed the legislation and I acknowledge his innovation in this area.  The amendments I have tabled aim to ensure the Low Pay Commission delivers on its mission as designed.  The Minister of State referred to several issues in his Second Stage speech, including references to making work pay, balancing fair and sustainable pay rates and yet allowing employers to continue to create quality jobs.  He also said that the low-paid would share in the economic recovery.  To achieve that end, the commission needs to consider all the relevant factors when making its recommendations.  Many of my amendments highlight that other factors ought to be considered before making any recommendations while others should be considered subsequent to putting forward the proposals.</p> <p>I and Senator van Turnhout have tabled amendment No. 7.  The Bill refers to the need for "job creation" but we propose that this be amended to refer to the need for "quality job creation".  It amounts to adding the word "quality".  As it stands, the reference in the Bill to the need for job creation could be interpreted to imply a potential trade-off between job creation and fair wages and I am concerned about embedding that assumption into the legislation.  Fair wages should never be sacrificed for the creation of jobs that are exploitative and unsustainable.  This would be counter-productive to the social and economic goals of the legislation.  I expect the Minister of State shares these views, regardless of whether he shares them in terms of this amendment.  This is why I am suggesting the wording should be changed to read the need for "quality job creation".  It is to ensure this assumption becomes explicit within the context of the legislation.</p> <p>Amendment No. 9 proposes to add certain text.  This section has to do with what the commission should have regard to when making a recommendation to the Minister.  Several measures have been included in the Bill but we suggest more should be included, including a reference to the cost of living.  This is a really important amendment to me and I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting it.  It is essential that the commission would be expected to consider the cost of living as experienced by workers when making its recommendations regarding the minimum rate of pay.  The question of adequacy of income from employment is central to the issue and should be given more weight in the legislation.  I note that in the Bill, as it stands, the proposed section 10C(3)(g) stipulates that the commission should consider the likely effect of its proposal on the cost of living, but this means the commission is not being asked to consider how the cost of living impacts on the minimum wage.  The commission should consider this as it thinks about how it ought to influence the establishment of the minimum wage.  As it stands in the Bill, if the Government sets the minimum wage at another level, it may not take cognisance of what impact it would have on the cost of living and I do not believe that is sufficient.  This amendment, which has been endorsed by the National Women's Council of Ireland, is essential to ensure the cost of living is considered prior to making recommendations.</p> <p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to ensure the commission would have regard to equality and gender equality.  Senator Reilly referred to this already in her comments.  This has to do with promoting equality and gender equality.  As the Minister of State is aware, low pay affects women especially.  Over 60% of workers on low pay are women and predominantly female employment sectors, such as hospitality and retail, have been at the forefront of the aggressive casualisation of the labour market through zero-hour contracts - I realise the Minister of State is looking at that in another context - and the erosion of sustainable and secure employment earnings.  As a result, the gender pay gap is widening.  How can we intentionally narrow that gap - I presume that is a policy objective of the Government - if is not explicitly targeted in our legislation?  The crisis of low pay is alarmingly gendered.  It is crucial, therefore, that the Low Pay Commission reflects a strong gender perspective in its analysis and recommendation, but I do not see that in the Bill as it stands.  The amendment proposes that the Low Pay Commission would be mandated to consider gender equality and other equality factors when making its recommendation.  Another point in favour of the amendment is that it could be considered appropriate in light of the new positive-duty obligation on public bodies to ensure a regard for promoting equality and human rights in all their work.</p> <p>Amendment No. 11 proposes to add the text "in-work poverty levels".  Again, Senator Reilly referred to this idea in her contribution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Katherine Zappone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2392"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Should the commission have regard to in-work poverty levels before it makes recommendations on a change to the minimum wage?  It must be recognised that there is a serious issue of in-work poverty in Ireland.  In 2014, 16% of those living below the poverty line were in employment, which is unacceptable.  Work needs to pay, as the Minister of State said in his opening remarks, and those who work should not need to rely on continual State support to supplement their income from employment.  Again, I know that is an objective the Minister of State would share.  The Low Pay Commission will have the capacity and expertise to advise the Minister on best practice to ensure work pays adequately, and that is why I propose we include in the Bill the consideration of in-work poverty before the commission makes recommendations.</p><p>Amendment No. 12 refers to the social and economic impact of minimum wage levels and provides that the associated cost or benefit to the State be taken into consideration by the commission.  This would allow the commission to make a more comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits to the Exchequer associated with higher or lower wage levels.  Again, as the Minister of State is aware, there is a considerable cost to the Exchequer from low pay.  It results in reduced tax revenues and increased social protection spending through payments like the family income supplement, for example.  As we know, a growing number of workers qualify for FIS, and while is it an important payment which provides essential income support to families on low pay, it comes at a considerable cost to the State.  Essentially, it is often assumed that wage increases must wait for the economic recovery.  However, economic growth occurs because of wage increases, especially in the lower income brackets, as spending is more likely to stimulate local growth.  I ask the Minister of State to consider including these considerations in the Bill.</p><p>The last amendment in this grouping provides that the commission would consider the likely effect of the proposed order.  I have argued that many issues should be looked at in the process of shaping any proposal on the minimum wage level.  Once the proposal has been formulated, the commission should then look at the potential impact of that proposal, examining what would happen down the line if changes were made.  We are arguing that additional considerations should be added to the list of components already in the Bill in terms of generating a proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#Y00200"><p>I wish to speak on amendment No. 5, subsection (dc) which refers to "the Living Wage as set for the relevant period" but before doing so, I commend the Minister of State on the work he has done in this area since coming into office.  A great deal of work has been done and high standards are being achieved, but the Labour Party does not intend to stop at the minimum wage.  Our intention is to have a living wage and that should be acknowledged in the House today.</p> <p>I wish to speak in particular about 949 councillors throughout this country who are expected to live on &euro;16,200 per annum.  That is not even the minimum wage.  I have conducted a survey on this and between one fifth and one quarter of serving councillors are full-time public representatives.  The previous speaker, Senator Zappone, spoke about FIS and those councillors qualify for FIS by virtue of their low basic pay.  I have always said that democracy is for everyone, not just for those who can afford to participate as public representatives.  What is happening now, and I know this from my ongoing contact with councillors, is that many can no longer afford to be public representatives.  They cannot raise their families or pay their bills, and that is wrong in a democracy.</p> <p>I acknowledge the review, Putting People First, initiated by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, which introduced reforms to local government last June following the local elections.  However, that document did not address, in any shape or form, the basic living standard that councillors should have by way of their earnings.  While approximately 75% of councillors have another source of income, 25% or more do not and those people must be respected and must be able to live.  I ask that as part of the review of Putting People First, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, would intervene on the issue of councillors' income.  Deputy Nash, as a former councillor in County Louth for many years, knows what I am talking about in this regard.  Indeed, we often spoke about it when we were both serving as councillors.  Will the Minister of State comment on this issue today because it is extremely important?  I know good people of all parties and none who say openly to their communities that they cannot represent them any more because they cannot afford to do so on the pay they receive.  Will the Minister of State comment and use his office to ensure the review that is taking place also considers the wages and expenses of councillors?  There has been much media derision of this issue.  Indeed, when I told a two-person deputation earlier today that I would be raising this issue in the House, they told me that they thought that councillors were earning approximately &euro;30,000 per annum but councillors are earning only &euro;16,200.  The Acting Chairman was also a councillor and knows what I am talking about.  We have often discussed this issue.  Democracy is for everyone, not just for the rich.  Public representation should also be for everyone, not just the rich.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I listened very carefully to Senator Landy's comments.  I believe it was 100 or 150 years ago when Members of Parliament in Britain were first paid, but many members of the Conservative Party did not want to be paid.  However, under-privileged Members of Parliament argued that they had to be paid or they would not be able to afford to represent their constituents.  That is Senator Landy's basic point.  To the extent that it applies in the case of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it also applies in the case of local councillors.  While very few councillors are full-time public representatives, a number of them are full-time.  In our democracy we need people of varied views and experience and we do not want to find that people can only be politicians if they have sufficient income from other sources.  I urge the Minister of State to give some consideration to the point made by Senator Landy.</p> <p>I also listened very carefully to Senator Zappone and could not disagree with her objectives and what she is seeking to achieve.  However, I must question if it is wise to introduce phrases like "quality job creation" and "decent work".  These terms are vague and what constitutes "quality job creation" or "decent work" is debatable.  When I started in business, there were no self-service shops here, only counter-service shops.  When we opened our first self-service shop, a number of people said that it was not good for the economy or for our employees.  They argued that we would have fewer employees than would be the case with counter-service shops and, on that basis, there was quite a strong movement against the development of self-service shops.  That would have been a huge mistake but the argument being made at the time was that people need "decent" work and "quality" jobs and that we should not be depriving people of work.  I would have doubts about the wisdom of including terms such as "quality job creation" and "decent work" in the legislation and believe the Bill is better as currently drafted.  I say that reluctantly because Senator Zappone made a very strong and understandable case for the inclusion of such phrases.  However, if the legislation is to work and achieve its objectives, it should not be vague.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are to have legislation that works and achieves its objectives, we must be careful not to be vague.</p></speech>

In every survey that has been done on equal pay, women fare much poorer than men when doing exactly the same work.  Could the Minister of State comment on which aspect of his review will be accounting for this?  Will there be surveys in this country?  There have been many carried out before.  It has been well borne out that gender is a definite factor.  The issue can arise when a woman is doing exactly the same work as a man, and in certain places of employment.  It does not occur in every workplace, such as in government.  That is recognised.  It arises particularly in the private sector.</p><p>I support Senator Landy's comment on councillors.  Having been a member of a council for 20 years, I realise the paying of stamps by councillors is absolutely useless.  People give up work to become councillors.  When I was elected mayor, I gave up teaching and lost money.  One could go back to one's job but one wants to give service to the community and give it well.</p><p>The council is now so busy.  Twenty years ago, there was half as much work as there is now.  One learns this when one meets councillors coming back from meetings.  Many councillors in the country now have to travel long distances, which is time consuming.  Only those who can afford to become councillors will become councillors.  That is not right either.  In every job, there ought to be a level playing pitch.  The whole issue must be examined.  I have asked for a debate on this subject, as has Senator Landy.  The sooner we have it, the better.  We want the debate before the actual decisions are made because that is what the Seanad is for.  It is for generating ideas and sowing seeds as well as listing to a decision when it is made.  It is too late to close the door when the horse has bolted.  I know we are close to this.</p><p>This issue has been ongoing <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The Local Authority Members Association has raised it.  Local authorities have been amalgamated.  We have been singing from the same hymn sheet for years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#Z00300"><p>A number of very interesting points have been made.  I would not have had the opportunity to become a councillor had I not had a very understanding employer when I first entered public life in the late 1990s.  I am sure this experience will chime with that of many in this Chamber this afternoon.  The issue needs to be taken very seriously.  Over recent weeks, I noted that some people are very reluctant even to take on the responsibility of being mayor of the local authority.  This is a great honour and privilege that I once had.  The reluctance is due to the time commitments and various other commitments that need to be made on taking on the role while also trying to maintain busy a working life.</p> <p>There is a range of issues wrapped up in Senator Landy's remarks.  I will bring them to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as I acknowledge the Senator has done on many occasions.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is very supportive of local government and who recognises the importance of local representation, will pay serious attention to it.  The Senator can be assured that I will discuss this with him directly.</p> <p>I am very taken with Senator Landy's remark that the opportunity to enter public office, as a member of a local authority, the Seanad or the D&aacute;il, should not be restricted to particular sectors of society.  That would not be democratic.  This Chamber and others needs to be democratic, and we must insist that all our democratic chambers across the country are, reflective of the population in general in so far as that is possible.</p> <p>When I first became a member of a local authority, there were no salaries, as such, in place.  They were introduced in the early 2000s.  That was a step in the right direction.  A general principle I apply, including to my political views, is that people should be paid for the job they do, regardless of their position.  It is not popular to say that.  With pay comes respect.  Of course, the role of the councillor has evolved significantly over the past 20 years.  It is a very onerous responsibility.  Many of the reforms introduced by the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, and the review the current Minister, Deputy Kelly, is undertaking in regard to the policy document must be taken into account.  There is no doubt about that.</p> <p>On Senator Keane's point on gender equality, I do not believe we need any more reports to tell us what we already know, namely, that there is a significant pay gap based on gender.  This is and will be of concern to the Low Pay Commission, and it will always need to be mindful of that.  As Senator Zappone stated, women are unfortunately only too well represented in sectors of the economy that are synonymous with and associated with low pay.  I am anxious to see the Low Pay Commission addressing these issues.  The figures and anecdotal experience indicate to us that a very significant number of people who are merely existing on the minimum wage are women.</p> <p>I will speak to the amendments proposed in the grouping.  Section 5 sets out a very comprehensive and challenging set of factors that the commission must take into account in any year in coming to a recommendation on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive, provide for the addition of a wide range of factors that the commission would be required to take into account when making a recommendation.  I thank Senators for the thought they have given to the additional factors that could be considered.  I thank them also for the spirit in which they put their ideas forward.  There are many amendments I would not disagree with in principle, but their application may be very difficult administratively.  I will address this now in more detail.</p> <p>To add further wide-ranging lists of factors to be taken into account, as set out in amendments Nos. 3 to 14, would mean the commission could not possibly undertake analysis at the level required.  It would find it difficult to produce an agreed recommendation, or perhaps any recommendation at all, by a set date on an annual basis.  I am establishing a set date in primary legislation by which the Low Pay Commission will need to respond to the Government each year.  I have given significant consideration to the criteria laid down with Government colleagues in the drafting of the Bill over many months.  Many of them have stood the test of time in that they were previously incorporated into national minimum wage legislation dating from 2000.</p> <p>Some of the additional factors proposed this afternoon concern issues such as decent work, as referred to by colleagues and responded to by Senator Quinn.  The factors are part of a wider decent work and dignity at work agenda I am pursuing.  This includes the issues of zero-hour and low-hour contracts, the reform of collective bargaining legislation, the reintroduction of a system of registered employment agreements, a new mechanism for setting sectoral employment orders and the system we now have in place for joint labour committees.</p> <p>Previous references to changes in earnings have served us well.  I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings changes, as proposed by Senator Reilly, or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings.  There is significant expertise on and available to the Low Pay Commission.  It has resources by which to gain access to information, including new research, if required, in order to interpret properly changes in earnings data.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Low Pay Commission will be and is utilising these kinds of data to allow it to arrive at a recommendation in the case of the current review.</p> <p>Other proposals are more difficult to interpret and may not be of particular relevance to the concept of the national minimum wage.  For example, it would be a very significant requirement to have the Low Pay Commission differentiate between every sector's business model and performance on an annual basis or to carry out an assessment of innovation changes in each sector.  If I were to accept that proposal, I would be obviating the need for registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and other arrangements.  Sometimes the only group of people looking for the national minimum wage to be divided out a little comprises employers who in some cases believe we should have different rates for different sectors of the economy or for different regions.  We have a national minimum wage, a statutory floor beneath which no wage should be allowed to fall.  That should remain the case.  In this regard, the minimum wage does set a floor for earnings, and different sectoral models and different levels of innovation may very well differentiate between pay levels above the national minimum wage.  Equally, aggregate demand in the economy and tax receipts are valuable background conditions to which the commission will be attuned, but I do not believe they should be criteria for a recommendation laid out in primary legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Gerald Nash:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have spoken in the past of my support for the development of the concept of a living wage in Ireland but I differentiate the application of a mandatory national minimum wage and a civil society movement that would see employers volunteer and be proud to pay a living wage.  I intend to host a forum on the living wage in the autumn with employers, trade unions and civil society representatives.  Employers are the one key group absent from discussions to date.  I have never seen any trade union or any individual manage to get a pay rise, or any class of a pay increase, if they did not engage respectfully with their employers.  In regard to comparisons with Northern Ireland, or any other jurisdiction which has a national minimum wage, it is fair to say that these are compared by looking at the absolute values and the purchasing power parity.  I believe the commission has sufficient expertise available to it to make these distinctions.  It would not be appropriate to specifically require the commission, on an annual basis, to analyse different welfare supports, health care provisions, child care and social housing across different jurisdictions.  The interaction, or the nexus, between the national minimum wage and the tax and social welfare systems will be the fundamental focus of the Low Pay Commission, particularly in the context of the role of the national minimum wage and what the rate should be.  </p><p>In regard to the promotion of equality and gender equality it is important to note that the national minimum wage applies to all workers irrespective of gender - it is the epitome of a measure that it eliminates gender inequality in its application.  However, as minimum wage workers tend to be predominantly female, by its very nature a national minimum wage is more beneficial to female workers.  The comprehensive list of factors to be taken into account is essentially the same as those in  the current National Minimum Wage Act and they have already stood the test of time since 2000 when the National Minimum Wage Act was introduced and first enacted.  Accordingly I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive.</p></speech>

In addition to making an annual recommendation report to the Minister on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, new section 10C(4) provides that the commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on such matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the act.  In this context, subsection 4B(1) provides that such requests be made not later than two months after the start of each year.  This would mean that the Minister would not be able to request the commission to examine an issue until early 2016 at the earliest.  Therefore it is considered appropriate to make  provision to allow the Minister to request the commission to examine a particular matter within two months of its establishment in 2015.  In future years such requests will be made to the commission by the end of February of each year.</p> <p>Amendment No. 16 introduces a number of specific tasks which the commission will be required to undertake as part of its functions - to monitor the incidences of low pay by examining the prevalence of pay two thirds below median earnings; key patterns in paid and unpaid open market internships; and, the effectiveness of existing policies to enforce the national minimum wage.  Section 5 of the Bill introduces a new section 10C(4) which provides that the commission may be requested by the Minister to examine a report on social matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  The published Bill provides that requests should be made not later than the first two months of each year and will be part of the commission's work programme.  I believe that the legislative provision covering the commission's work programme each year shouldn't be proscriptive and inflexible.  Amendment 16 would tie the hands of the commission regarding its annual work programme.  For specific issues related to the work of the commission a request can be made to the commission to examine and report on the matter.  The specific topics raised in the amendment may be worthy of examination at some point, but I do not believe it is appropriate to set them down in legislation.  Accordingly I cannot accept the recommendation.</p> <p>Amendment No. 17 requires further consideration regarding the matter of laying reports before both Houses and I will be giving it further consideration.  I will revert to the House on the issue at Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have written to the Minister and I have brought it up in this House before asking if the child care element and the low pay which is involved in child care - and again it is mostly women involved in preschool and child care - will be specifically included in the Low Pay Commission?  They are currently falling between every stool that is mentioned - the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills.  They are not teachers or doctors or anything else, but they are professionals - they are psychologists, they are people with vocations - which is not recognised in their pay.  I have written to his Department but I would appreciate a categoric assurance today from the Minister that their pay will be examined.  It needs to be looked at in detail and the Low Pay Commission is the best place possible.  We have had this group here and they need the examination done.  The Minister and his own Department are best placed to talk about this.  It is low pay but it is the most important job that anybody can do.  I have said it to Minister Reilly that if every department put a little percentage of their budgets towards childcare then childcare workers could be paid properly.  It is a false economy now but money could be saved in the long run.  I would appreciate assurance from the Minister that this can be included in the Low Pay Commission.</p></speech>

The child care sector is an extremely important one for society.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, is reviewing the operation of the child care sector.  We should all aim to ensure we have not only a good private child care system but also a good public community child care system.  Child care is all too expensive for working families and acts as a barrier for many parents in terms of accessing the workplace or further education.  I accept that a discussion on salaries and the nature of work in the child care profession is needed.  It could be examined in tandem with the review being carried out by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  However, I will not be prescriptive at this point about the work programme of the Low Pay Commission because, as I hope the legislation and terms of reference make clear, that would require consultation and deliberation at Government level between all Ministers who wish to have an input into the work programme of the Low Pay Commission.</p><p>The legislation envisages that the Low Pay Commission would be provided with its mandate for the year in February of each year, and if amendment No. 15 is accepted, which I hope will be the case, we will be able to do initial work this year.  We will be able to identify areas of concern on which reports could be drawn up.  That is a matter for the whole of Government.  I have my views on the matter but it would be unwise to put on the record today any specific sector or element of the economy to be examined by the Low Pay Commission at this point.  Its primary focus only a week after its establishment on an interim basis is to examine the next rate of the national minimum wage and it is currently using all the resources at its disposal to do that.</p></speech>

In these circumstances it is considered more appropriate to use the term &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;may&quot; to make it clear that the Minister must take one of the actions specified.</p><p>Amendment No. 19 provides that in addition to an allowance for board and lodgings, the national minimum wage shall provide for a prohibition or restriction on charges or reductions on fair hours of employment rules.  I have considered the proposed amendment and concluded that it is not necessary.  The Payment of Wages Act already provides a redress mechanism for unlawful deductions from wages, while the Organisation of Working Time Act regulates working hours.</p><p>Section 5(1) of the Payment of Wages Act allows an employer to make deductions required or authorised by law, for example, PAYE or PRSI, that is required or authorised by a term of the employee's contract, such as occupational pension schemes, for example, or indeed any deduction agreed to in writing and advanced by the employee such as trade union subscriptions or health insurance premia.</p><p>Section 5(2) of the Act places significant restrictions on employers in relation to deductions on the receipt of payments from wages of employees.  Senators will also be aware that I have commissioned a study into zero and low-hour contracts, which is being undertaken by the University of Limerick.  The study is expected to be completed in the autumn of this year.  I look forward to considering its findings, and where the evidence points to some adjustments being required to the protections in place under employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by the Government.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 seeks to ensure businesses will be allowed sufficient time to plan for any adjustment proposed in the national minimum wage.  During Second Stage, Senator White stated she is supportive of the minimum wage but that it must be done in a planned way in order that companies can plan their business.  I fully agree with that.</p><p>Senators may be aware that the ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the previous Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis with lengthy gaps between increases, as has happened in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than regular, smaller and fairly predictable upratings.  A significant benefit of the establishment of the Low Pay Commission concept is that in the future the national minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and, therefore, where they occur, any adjustments in the future will be incremental and less destructive for businesses rather than the step changes we witnessed in the past that have been criticised by the ESRI in the review.</p><p>Moreover, the deadline of 15 July for submission of the commission's recommendations was designed specifically to allow time for consideration of the issue in the context of that year's budgetary considerations and to provide for any adjustment in a planned way.  Consequently, this very structure achieves what the Senator is trying to achieve by the amendment.</p><p>The commission will also ensure any advice or recommendations it makes to Government is evidence-based and utilises agreed data, that it carries out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives, and it will, as has been the case in recent weeks, take written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  That is to ensure any suggested changes to the national minimum wage will have a minimum adverse effect on employment and competitiveness.  The commission will consult people - workers and employers who are directly affected by the minimum wage, and the commission has been doing that for the past couple of months.  The real lived experience, both of workers who are on the minimum wage and businesses which are operating in sectors associated with the minimum wage and low pay, will be vital for the commissioners when they are deciding on their recommendation to me on the rate of the national minimum wage.  While I recognise the intent of the proposed amendment, I cannot accept it as I do not consider it necessary because of the structures that are being put in place.</p></speech>

It states:<blockquote><br /><br />In page 6, line 27, to delete &ldquo;pay.&rdquo;.&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;pay.<br /><br />(5) Where the Minister declares an order for any increase to the national minimum wage, a sufficient lead-in period should be made available for this new rate to be met in a planned way.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote>From my experience as co-founder of Lir Chocolates, small to medium sized businesses plan their budgets one year in advance.  It is therefore imperative they are given enough time to plan for any increase in the national minimum wage.  Caution needs to be taken in assessing any proposed changes to ensure any new measures introduced are sustainable from the employers' point of view while also ensuring a meaningful quality of life for employees, which I totally support.</p><p>The sentiments of the Minister of State are honourable.  He has stated the Low Pay Commission will advise the Government on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage every year.  However, that assessment must be done carefully.  Our economy's ethos must be to provide sustainable jobs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M.

There is a need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair with one that is sustainable and allows employers to continue to create quality jobs.  The minimum wage should be adjusted incrementally over time having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact that any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. </p></speech>

I will not vote for it because I am on this side of the House but I would like an explanation from him.  All legislation should be done in a planned way and one cannot hoist change on an employer just like that.  Looking at the way the amendment is put, it seems reasonable, but I am sure that the Minister of State has a good reason for not accepting it.  I was an employer at one stage and one cannot do today what one will not do tomorrow.  Employers need to know where their budgets are coming from because if they do not have the money they will not be able to pay the minimum wage so they would need to plan for that as well.  Will the Minister of State make a statement on how his ideas can be implemented?</p></speech>

The ESRI report pointed out in 2006 that there was a danger and a fear, certainly in the business community, about infrequent large step-changes in the national minimum wage.  We are modelling this system very closely on the model that has been applied in the UK since the late 1990s, with some changes.  If one looks at that model, one will see that the frequency of the annual review certainly assisted in business planning.  It is a matter of record that it has been adjusted incrementally, and annually, upwards in the UK without having any adverse effect on competitiveness, job creation, or on the operation of businesses.  The process is very clear in the legislation as to what happens, how it happens, and the function of the commission.  The commission has very strong representation from those who have an interest in the interests of employers and those who have an interest in the interest of employees.  I think everybody brings something positive to the table in that regard.  They will look at evidence-based data and information to allow them to make recommendations.</p> <p>This is a much stronger, more evidence-based, and objective system than has been in place previously.  Members of the House will be aware that under the current legislation it is open to me, as Minister with responsibility for this area, to simply make a recommendation to Government colleagues without consulting anybody and to unilaterally decide what the rate of the national minimum wage will be.  Most people in this House are fair minded and reasonable people and while we might have views on what the rate of the national minimum wage should be, I do not think that anybody would want to impose anything on anybody without having consulted them in a democratic fashion and using evidence, because best practice and policy making requires us to collate the evidence and discuss the issues concerned with those who are most widely affected.  We are doing this.</p> <p>This is an important institutional change for this country and I think it is a very important step change in how we do business and should be seen, as I said earlier, as one of a suite of measures to address issues to do with dignity of work and dignity at work.  I hope that all of these measures will outlive all of us.  This approach, broadly speaking can, will, and does have the support of the business community.  We are ensuring that we will have a recommendation in time to allow, for example, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Protection to prepare for any adjustments that would need to be made to the rate of the national minimum wage well in advance of the budget.  I envisage that it will be a matter of months before the Government will introduce the rate because there is a process set down in terms of the period from which the recommendation is made to me and bringing it to Government.  That recommendation needs to be made, to the best of my recollection, within three months, so that there will be a sufficient period for planning and for the Government system to react and adopt any recommended change and to take account of that change and how it will interact with the tax and social welfare system, which is very important for people who are existing on low pay.</p></speech>

In addition, the 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from the dispute.  </p><p>A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and these protections, as the House may be aware, will be further enhanced by me in the context of provisions in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 dealing with the Government's commitment on collective bargaining, which this House will have an opportunity to consider over the next few weeks.

It is imperative that at least one member of the Low Pay Commission should have a precise understanding of the interests and needs of small to medium sized businesses and a strong knowledge of the issues faced by these businesses on a day-to-day basis.  The rebuilding of the Irish economy over the coming year will depend heavily on the small and medium enterprise sector.  These companies are the backbone of the economy, constituting 99% of all businesses in Ireland and employing more than 800,000 people.  Their ability to succeed and grow underpins Ireland's future potential for jobs, growth and prosperity.  Despite the wide diversity within the small and medium enterprise sector, the issues facing the sector are very similar.  The Taoiseach has expressed a desire that Ireland would become the best small country in the world in which to do business.  The reality for many small business owners is far from this truth.  Given the very challenging and changing environment still facing all small businesses and the fragile nature of Ireland's economic recovery, it is imperative that at least one member of the Low Pay Commission has first-hand experience of managing a small to medium sized enterprise.</p></speech>

We discussed it on Second Stage, as the Minister of State will be aware. and I know he took a particular view on it.  However, we believe that it is vitally important.  We are not at all convinced that the current representational nature of the proposed Low Pay Commission addresses convincingly the argument that has been put forward by Senator White.  I am not sure whether anything can be done to change it at this stage but we certainly would like to press the view that one member of the commission should be a person who knows what it is like to run a business and to hire workers to manage a business particularly in the small and medium enterprise sector.  I suggest one of the weaknesses of successive Administrations in this country, particularly in the modern era during the past 20 or 30 years, has been the lack of business expertise at Cabinet level, and I point to my own party in that regard as much as anything else.  That is no reflection on the decent honourable committed people who took up public life, many of them at the expense of family and lifestyle, as was pointed out in an earlier debate by Senator Landy who spoke about the life of councillors.  The lifestyle of a Deputy or a Minister when set against the modern norm is horrendous given the manner in which they are imposed upon on a 24-7 basis.</p> <p>This argument in this respect that was made on Second Stage should again be made on Committee Stage.  I would be interested to get the Minister of State's response to it not because I anticipate he will accept the amendment but I hope he will go beyond justifying the existing nominations on the basis that they have experience.  Having considered them at the time, I am not in any way suggesting they are not capable of the task that they will be asked to perform.  We believe that there should be an extra dimension to this commission and that extra dimension should be recognisable in acknowledging the small and medium sized sector, and that a business person with hands-on experience of business should be included among its membership.</p></speech>

The figures are stark in that an overwhelming majority of business in this country is in the small and medium enterprise sector.  It seems reasonable to have a specifically designated member from that group on the commission.  On a related matter, the Minister of State might consider this point and take it back to his Cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>The treatment of people in this area is lamentable.  People who start up businesses and run them are not covered by social welfare.  That is outrageous.  They give employment to other people down the line who get protection but if the business goes wallop the person who took the courageous step to start it and invest in it is not covered.  I ask the Minister of State to examine if something can be done about that.  I have been talking about this issue for a number of years.   It is morally wrong that people who create employment are left out of the scheme although their employees are covered.</p></speech>

It states, under membership at paragraph (2)(b): &quot;3 shall be appointed from among persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have an understanding of the interests of employers, particularly small to medium-sized employers and those operating in traditionally low pay sectors&quot;.<b></b>The Minister of State's heart is in the right place.  However, the amendment moved by Senator White is much stronger and proposes the inclusion of a person who has the experience of running a small business.  In response to a reference to the Minister for Finance some years ago, when I said I had a very high regard for him, I recall a very successful businessman saying that he was always worried about any Minister for Finance who never had to worry about where they would get the money to pay the wages at the end of the week. Lying awake at night wondering where one will get the money to pay the wages at the end of the week is a huge discipline, experience and education.  The wording proposed by Senators White and Mooney is a much stronger than the wording in the Schedule.  The Minister of State's heart is in the right place and he has the right objective but I believe that somebody who has had the experience of running a small business is worthy of consideration.</p></speech>

It will also comprise three members, as Senator Quinn outlined, who have a deep understanding of the interests of employers, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and those operating in the traditional low-pay sector, and who possess a good knowledge and understanding of the particular issues faced by businesses.  It will also comprise two members who will have relevant knowledge or expertise in labour market economics, statistics or employment law.</p><p>All the commission members were appointed by me on an interim basis in February last to allow them commence their work and make recommendations to me on the rate of the national minimum wage by mid-July.  My expressed intention was that members would then be appointed on a statutory basis once the necessary legislation was enacted.  In this context, it was decided by the Government, quite correctly, to engage the services of the Public Appointments Service to hold an open and transparent competition for members of the commission.  The employer and worker representatives, as well as the academic members, were all selected on that basis and on the basis of the criteria set out in the Bill on which I reflected earlier.  Accordingly, it would be unwise to introduce new eligibility criteria at this point.</p><p>I am satisfied those members representing employers' interests selected through the public process have much experience representing the business community and the SME sector and owners.  The provisions on the qualifications of the employer representatives of the commission are already comprehensive enough to ensure the interests of business, particularly SMEs and traditional low-pay sectors of the economy, will be well articulated in the commission&rsquo;s deliberations.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 24.</p><p>On amendment No. 25, I am satisfied the expertise requirements for the academic experts will ensure the commission will have the necessary and relevant academic supports and expertise to assist it in undertaking this work.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment either.</p><p>On amendment No. 26, the Bill provides that worker representatives on the commission will have an understanding of the interests of low-paid workers, as well as good knowledge and experience of working on behalf of workers&rsquo; interests and representing workers, particularly low-paid workers, with a proven track record in advocacy.  We can say with some certainty that the members selected by the Public Appointments Service such as Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Gerry Light, assistant general secretary, Mandate, and Edel McGinley, director, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland-----</p></speech>

I was privileged to be a member of Bord Bia when I worked full-time with Connie Doody and all our staff in L&iacute;r Chocolates.  Having the hands-on experience of a start-up food company without a pen or pencil when we started, I was able to contribute and suggest changes at Bord Bia&rsquo;s board level.  I could not have done that if I have not had first-hand experience.  Going around talking to company people is no comparison.  I agree with Senator Quinn that one does not know about being at the coalface of being an entrepreneur until one lies awake at night worrying if one will get the sales to pay the wages that week.  The commission needs manufacturing people, those who grow their companies and create more jobs, not those appointed by the Civil Service commission or whatever it is.</p> <p>I still have the highest regard for the Minister of State, however.  I had a go at his colleague yesterday evening because he was looking at his laptop during the debate on the 1916 commemoration and the Moore Street area renewal Bill.</p></speech>

It has gone to the extreme of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater if a Minister, elected by the people and subsequently ratified by the D&aacute;il, is accused of not following the correct procedures adopted for the nomination of people to State appointments.  Everything has been taken away from central government and the Minister of the day, and given to an appointments commission.</p> <p>The appointments commission, with respect, is made up of civil servants.  In this particular instance, with all due respect, those civil servants will operate under the criteria set down by the Government.  That does not take account of what the Minister of State has heard from Senators Quinn and White.  What do civil servants know about being at the coalface of business?  With respect, horses for courses.  They are excellent civil servants and superb at their job.  That is the core of this argument.  If it were a Minister who had exclusive responsibility for the appointment of the Low Pay Commission, I have no doubt it would have been a much broader church than what we have seen with this legislation.  The Minister of the day would have known exactly what was required.  Now, that has been given to a third party which is operating under paper requirements, criteria, recognition and acknowledgement, without the personal input or experience a Minister would bring to it.</p> <p>I know it is a separate issue and argument but to me it is an example of how sad it is that such was the push by the media that one side of the argument has been lost.  The only power the Minister of State has is one of ratification.  He will not oppose whatever recommendations come before him, not just in this instance but for any other group of appointments.  If he did, politically, he would be dead in the water.  The system is flawed.  Unfortunately, we are where we are.  There is nothing any of us can do about it.  At the same time, we feel it was important to make the argument.</p></speech>

Section 3(2)(c) provides that the Minister may remove a member of the commission from office if, in the opinion of the Minister, the member has not complied with section 14 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 in the performance of his or her functions as a member of the commission.  Section 14 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 refers to officeholder obligations.  As members of the commission do not fall under the definition of officeholder in the meaning of the 1995 Act, it is not appropriate to include a reference to section 14 of the Act in the Bill.  Accordingly, it is necessary to amend this reference in the Bill.  The new proposed provision repeats similar provisions regarding members of the Fiscal Advisory Council in the Schedule to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.</p> <p>With regard to amendment No. 28, the Schedule to the Bill already provides the Minister with the possibility of removing a member of the Low Pay Commission from office if the member has committed stated misbehaviour, or the removal of the member appears to be necessary for the effective performance by the commission of its functions.  I expect an employer member who commits an offence under the National Minimum Wage Act to fall within these categories.  Moreover, a member could be found to have committed an offence under the full range of employment rights legislation which could make his or her membership of the commission untenable.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill will provide for a universal GP service to be made available to all persons aged 70 years and older.  This is the second phase of introducing a universal GP service in Ireland which builds on the under-sixes first phase.  Together with the under-sixes phase, the second phase will see more than 300,000 children and senior citizens who currently must pay to see their GP no longer having to decide whether they should spend &euro;50 to visit their GP.  This phased extension of universal coverage will come as a relief to many young families and pensioners.  Under the new legislation, access to a GP service will be provided for all persons over the age of 70 years on a universal basis.  This will replace the existing GP service arrangement for those over 70 years where their income must be assessed before they can access a GP without charge.  Their dependants, including spouses or partners, under the age of 70 years will continue to have access to a GP service without fees where they meet the existing income limits. </p> <p>The Government remains committed to the introduction of a universal GP service for the entire population in line with the programme for Government.  As set out in its statement of priorities 2014&ndash; 16, it prioritised those over 70 years in the next phase of the roll-out of free access to GP care.  It is now living up to that commitment. </p> <p>General or family practice is often viewed as the core of primary care.  The GP plays a crucial role as gatekeeper for the whole health system.  The generalist and patient-centred GP approach guides the patient through the referral process and the health care system.  It is widely considered that a well developed system of primary care has beneficial effects on the health care system as a whole.  As previously announced, the Government decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by first providing all children under six years and, second, persons over 70 years with access to a universal GP service.  The decision to prioritise those aged over 70 years next for the roll-out of a universal GP service had regard to the significant prevalence and co-morbidity of chronic diseases in this population cohort.  Therefore, there is a significant benefit to be achieved from improved GP access in terms of health and well-being. </p> <p>There are approximately 400,000 people in Ireland over the age of 70 years.  It is estimated that about 36,000 people over the age of 70 years must pay to attend a GP because they are not covered by a medical card or a GP visit card.  Medical evidence suggests there is a significantly greater incidence of multiple chronic conditions among persons over the age of 70 years.  This emphasises the benefit of access to GP care without fees for persons in this age category.  It is important to be clear that nothing will change for people over 70 years of age who have or who are eligible for a medical card.  They will continue to receive all of their other medical card entitlements as normal. </p> <p>We must move towards a health system based on universality of access which must be sustainably funded to enable the provision of services to meet health needs.  While we recognise that a move from a means-based eligibility system to a universal-based system of health coverage is challenging, the Government is in the process of reorienting the health system from one that only treats sick people to one that keeps people well.  That is why we believe a universal system is the best option.  It can be argued that the existing eligibility system has become overly complex which has resulted in people focusing on the assessment process rather than the provision of services.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the key issue is that an ill person should be able to receive primary health services.  At the same time, we must stay committed to completing the most radical reform of the system in the history of the State to develop a universal system that will treat all according to their health needs, not their means.</p> <p>I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 amends section 58 of the Health Act, 1970 to remove all individuals aged over 70 years from the scope of the means-tested service based on holding a medical card or a GP visit card.  Instead, all persons over 70 years will automatically qualify for a GP service and it will not be necessary to hold a means-tested medical or GP visit card.  </p> <p>Section 3 amends section 58A of the Health Act, 1970 which sets out the existing GP service arrangements for those over 70 years to provide access to a GP service for all persons over the age of 70 on a universal basis.  Section 58A(1) establishes a new universal arrangement for the HSE to provide a GP service without fees for all persons aged 70 years and over who are ordinarily resident in the State.  The HSE will also provide a GP service for the dependants of such persons where the existing income criteria are met.  </p> <p>Subsections (2) and (3) outline the income conditions that the person over 70 years must meet for his or her dependants who are under 70 years to qualify for a GP service without fees.  The dependants of a single person over 70 years will qualify if the income of the person over 70 does not exceed &euro;700 per week.  Alternatively, the dependants of a married person aged over 70 years will qualify if the combined income of the couple does not exceed &euro;1,400 per week. </p> <p>In general, the remaining subsections maintain the existing administrative practices of the GP service for those over 70 years.  Subsections (4) to (7), inclusive, deal with the application process, the decision-making process and the provision of information.  In line with current arrangements, subsection (8) requires the HSE to provide assistance for persons over 70 years in making an application, if needed.  Subsections (9) to (12), inclusive, address the income limits and the calculation of gross income.  Subsection (13) provides that the HSE, in so far as practicable, will offer a choice of GP to an individual.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In conclusion, this legislation will deliver universal GP care to a second age cohort.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss the Health (General Practitioner Services) Bill 2015.  The general effect of this Bill is to give back to the over-70s what has been taken from them, partially by the previous Government but mainly by this Government when it massively reduced the threshold on the over-70s medical card.  The taking away of the automatic over-70s medical card was a major mishap by the previous Government in October 2008 and Fianna F&aacute;il never fully recovered from that event, never mind the other events that followed.  Following the public reaction to that measure, an extremely high threshold was put in place which effectively meant that everybody except the super-wealthy got a medical card at that time.  There were probably too many people getting the card at that time and they included some very wealthy people.  However, the threshold has been reduced dramatically since then, meaning many people over 70 on low to average incomes do not qualify for a medical card and did not qualify for a GP card before this Bill.  Many of them have lost medical cards since the thresholds were brought in.  Now they will all, including the super-wealthy, get free GP care.  That is important for many people.  We will not oppose this Bill but one has to question the logic of giving free doctor visits to some very wealthy people while some middle-income people with no children under six do not qualify for doctor's cards or medical cards, even in the case of extreme medical need.  They are being left in the lurch because of this.</p> <p>With the Minister of State present, we have an opportunity to look at what is happening in terms of the contracts that have been signed for the over-70s and the under-sixes.  In my county of Meath, there has been a 29% uptake on the part of GPs with respect to under-sixes, and I am sure the figure is the same for the over-70s, and in Louth, it is 22%.  In some other counties, it is very low while in others, there has been a high uptake, such as Donegal, Carlow and Kilkenny.  Does that correlate with the fact that those counties already have a high number of medical cards?  If a doctor already has a large GMS practice they are incentivised to provide the new services.  If, however, a doctor does not fully depend on that, the incentive to do this does not seem to be very strong.  I am very concerned that only 20 contracts have been signed in County Meath for the under-sixes and I presume it also applies to the over-70s.  What will happen to those parents who need free GP care?  Will they have to pay after July if they want to go to the doctor of their choice but who has not signed up?  Will the Government fulfil its promise to them that they will get GP care free of charge?</p> <p>The priorities have been wrong and we have not learned the lessons of the past.  Fianna F&aacute;il probably should not have given a medical card to everyone over 70 and should have put in a much higher threshold than the standard medical card threshold.  Families with children would probably have benefitted more than the very wealthy over-70s.  My family always seem to be at the doctor's but while we have been waiting for the Government to deliver on its promise to the under-sixes, two of them have gone past the age of six.  We only have a year left and my own doctor has actually told me he will not be signing up anyway.  </p></speech>

The treatment is not available here, so the child has to go to America for treatment.  I had another case last year but that child seems to have recovered.  There are a lot of problems with the health service and it is wrong to suggest this will change things.  It will not.</p><p>Does the Minister of State have the up to date county by county figures?  Figures given in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>show a wide divergence in take-up.  Is it because of the existing level of medical cards?  It is very worrying that a large number of doctors, particularly those in the National Association of General Practitioners, do not want to be part of it and are worried about the huge burden being put on them.  The extra work they will have to do does not appear to be fully funded.</p><p>Is it intended to roll out the provision for asthma across all age groups?  At the moment, it is only intended for the under-sixes but somebody asked me about it last week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#NN01100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for bringing forward this Bill to introduce GP cards for the over-70s who are beneath a certain income level, which is &euro;36,400 per annum.  That is substantial income and the threshold for a couple would be &euro;72,000.  Some 36,000 people will benefit from the introduction of this Bill.  The scheme will also be rolled out for the under-sixes and the number of people with GP cards will increase from 164,000 to over 412,000, which is a substantial increase meaning that over 46% of the population will have either medical cards or GP cards.  We gave a commitment to try to introduce a universal health care system and this is only part of the process because we cannot do it all overnight.  The argument has been made, particularly in respect of the under-sixes, that there should be a means assessment but that would have an administrative cost.  We are removing administrative costs to a large extent in the way we are rolling this out.</p> <p>As the Minister said, when the scheme is up and running it will benefit over 800,000 people who are either under six or over 70.  There is a cost to this and while we would love to roll out free GP care for everyone, it is not financially possible and we have to use the budget of the Department of Health with care, as the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, do.  We have given a commitment to roll it out for everyone in the long term but it will depend on income and on the taxation coming into Revenue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It is also important that the number of discretionary cards has increased quite substantially.  I understand that the total figure is now over 126,000 between GP cards and medical cards, which is a substantial number.  In fairness to the Department and the HSE, each case in which a person is over the income limits is being examined and discretion is being applied in a careful manner.  While I accept that not all cases which one would expect to go through do so, if a strong case is presented, all of the issues are taken on board.  I like it when people raise a medical services issue with me and ask, "Why can we not do this?"  It is all about having the finance available.  We are spending over &euro;13.2 billion in the health budget, which is a huge budget providing a huge level of services.</p><p>The one major challenge we will face over the next 10 or 15 years is the increase in the number of people over 65.  At present we have over 585,000 people over 65, which I understand will increase by about 20,000 per annum so that, by 2030, we will have 990,000 people over 65.  It is not only about medical care, it is also about pensions and a whole lot of issues we will need to keep in mind in forward planning.  Whatever parties are in government - I hope it will be Fine Gael and Labour the next time around - we will have to be mindful of planning expenditure.  An additional 20,000 people over 65 means that, by the time the next Government finishes its term in 2021, there will be an extra 100,000 pensions to be paid out.  There will also be a certain percentage of people who will need additional support, for example home care, nursing home care or medical care. </p><p>While I am talking about elderly care, it is appropriate to bring up the issue of home care and the need to further develop that service.  While we have put additional money into nursing home care over the last six months - a welcome development in respect of freeing up hospital beds - in the long term, we also need to plan carefully home care for those who do not want to go into a nursing home.  The overall cost in real terms is less than one third of the cost of nursing home care.  We must make sure not only that we have an adequate number of people available to provide home care, but also that adequate facilities and training are available.  We need to start focusing on this issue and to develop it over the next two to three years.  The figure of 580,000 to 650,000 people will not be long growing.  In the last six years, I understand that the number of people over 85 has gone up by 20%, which is a significant increase in a very short period.  We currently have an average of 3.5 people working for every retired person.  If we want to have the same ratio in 2030, we will need to have 2.7 million people working.  That is a huge challenge for which we need to start planning.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward the Bill, which I fully support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#OO00200"><p>I welcome the extension of the provisions to the over-70s.  It is overdue and while it is, as the Minister of State has said, a step along the road, it is a very long road and a lot needs to be done.  I am not happy that the basic tenet on which the Government was elected, namely fundamental reform of the health service, is not being honoured.  I do not wish the Minister of State to take that personally.  The Minister for Health made a public commitment to making those fundamental reforms, yet soon after assuming office he stated that they would not happen within the first term of Government but in the second term.  It then became apparent that there were major administrative impediments, and it looked like the Government was swimming through treacle.</p> <p>The Bill provides for a restoration of something that was there previously, in what was generally recognised to be a fairly bad health service.  I understand this is a step along the way and do not want the Minister of State to think I am being unduly critical.  The Bill is bringing the service back from a real nadir of deprivation to where it partially was prior to the economic decline.</p> <p>We need to keep our eyes on the prize.  A lot of very good things are happening at the scientific end of medical research right now.  We are going to face incredible challenges in paying for new treatments and will have patients who are living long enough to get them.  We will also have patients living longer as a result of receiving those new treatments.  Unless we do some proper forward planning of how we are going to structure the health service, we are not going to make much progress.</p> <p>With regard to this legislation, I know from dealing with many patients that it was a cause of pain and anguish to people that they thought they were losing and, in many cases, did lose, their medical cards.  It was a source of extreme annoyance and worry to people who had other things to worry about at their age, including their health.  I am glad they are at least being relieved of this one little worry.  With the co-operation of our very fine body of general practitioners, who keep the whole system ticking over in difficult circumstances, I hope the Bill will have other spin-off effects, such as decreasing the pressure on the emergency rooms.</p> <p>Without seeking to be too dramatic about it, the situation in emergency rooms around the country in this last week has been terrible.  I had occasion to visit one of them several times and to speak to doctors working in another.  It is as bad as it has ever been.  I am not sure the metrics the Minister of State is getting are reflecting the reality of what we are seeing.  One or two of my own cancer patients had to engage with the emergency services and, despite what they acknowledged were truly heroic efforts by the staff, they did not get a standard of care appropriate for a modern western country.  I have to be careful how I say this.  I was in one emergency department during the week that I thought would have trouble passing a fire inspection.  What should have been walkways through the department were blocked by doubled-up trolleys.  There was not just one trolley against the wall but a trolley against the wall and another trolley against that one.  Moving one trolley from one part of the department to another involved moving someone else's trolley as well.  </p> <p>There has been a little step along the way today and a little box ticked for an election promise but we have a long way to go.  Somebody else once said, "A lot done, more to do".  In this case, it is a little done and an awful lot to do.  Let us do it.</p></speech>

Universal GP services for citizens over 70 are most welcome.  It is a very good day for our health service as we put in place the legislative underpinnings for this.  It represents the second phase of our reform of the health service, following on from free GP care for the under-sixes.</p> <p>The small step to which Senator Crown referred directly affects 300,000 people who, at the moment, are paying their GPs for a visit and, in many cases, are deciding whether they should spend the &euro;50 or &euro;60 on a GP or on food for their family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Gilroy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2367"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2367&amp;amp;pid=JohnGilroy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a small step but a significant one.  While in the grand scheme of things I would probably take Senator John Crown's point, to downplay or minimise the effect of it is a little ungenerous.</p><p>The universal basis of the provision for the over-70s with no income assessment is a fundamental principle of the Labour Party.  The Minister of State will remember that the Labour Party ran its entire 2007 general election campaign on the provision of universal health care, which was rejected at a time when former Deputy Bertie Ahern announced a tax reduction of a couple of pence in the pound.  Nobody was more surprised than we were.</p></speech>

Let us not enter into a blame game.  This is part of the programme for Government.  Senator John Crown is correct to remind us that the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, told us that it would take two terms to deliver universal health care.  It is a reasonable timeframe.  While many of our critics say we have abandoned universal health care, we have not abandoned it in any sense.  We are realistic enough to know and accept the challenge it presents in realistic terms and plan accordingly.  To say we have abandoned our position on universal health care is dishonest.</p> <p>GPs are crucial to the provision of universal health care.  Not only are they crucial to the provision of primary health care, they are also the gatekeepers to all facets of the health service.  Senator Thomas Byrne has chosen to highlight the most minimal figures rather than being more rounded in his analysis, which is the job of the Opposition.  However, more than 50% of GPs across the country have signed up to the scheme, which is very promising.  It was said it could not be done and it was argued ferociously in this Chamber that nobody at all would sign up to it.  However, 50% of GPs signed up in the early phase, which is a decent start, although there is much more to be done.  The Minister referred to universality of access, which is the key to delivering what I consider to be a fair health service.  The health service is not fair, but we cannot change it in the space of four years.  It will take much longer than four years to achieve real and lasting results based on health promotion in the first instance, disease prevention, early detection and treatment delivered as close to home as possible, with the lowest level of complexity and in the most efficient and sustainable way.  Nobody can argue with this.</p> <p>Senator John Crown referred to the crisis in the accident and emergency service.  It is an appalling crisis, but I hope it will pass with the good weather, although the evidence is mixed.  We will see a reduction in the necessity for people who might not be able to afford to go to their GP to take their children to an accident and emergency department instead, despite the &euro;100 charge.  People who come to my clinics have told me that in a situation where they cannot afford &euro;50 for the GP, they will bring their children to an accident and emergency department, given that the &euro;100 charge will be deferred and they might be able to save &euro;20 here and there towards it in the meantime.  Perhaps, this measure mightl alleviate the pressure on accident and emergency departments to some extent, although I am not suggesting it will solve the problem.  Much more needs to be done in that regard.</p> <p>The period of transition and change the health service is going through is very difficult.  Senator Colm Burke referred to a budget of &euro;13 billion.  While finance is very important, the human resources within the health service are equally and perhaps more important.  Medics, nurses and all health professionals and staff are working above and beyond the call of duty to provide a service in very strained conditions, for which we commend them.  Managing the change is the most important thing we can do.</p> <p>When this scheme is in place, 800,000 people aged over 70 years and under six will be able to attend a GP at no charge.  This represents one fifth of the population and is a good start by any standard.  Taking into account the significant overlap between the 800,000 people concerned and the 43% of the population who have medical cards, I hazard a guess that over 50% of the population will be in receipt of free medical care.</p></speech>

We have discussed the first and second steps.  Presumably, a third step will be taken shortly.  Will it involve free GP care based on an age cohort or another model?  Will it be, perhaps, in blocks of six years, up to the age of 12 and later up to the age of 18 when resources and finances become available?  While it is a small step, it is more than the minimal step that some have portrayed it as and will continue to portray it as until the Opposition finds some other Government measure to minimise.  It is a good day for the Minister of State, the Department and the people of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#PP00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  While I missed her initial contribution, I listened to some of it in my office and also listened with interest to the contributions of Senators John Crown and John Gilroy.  I would not describe the measure as a small or big step backwards or forwards.  It will regularise the position for the over-70s who, for a short period, had an automatic entitlement to a medical card before it was withdrawn and a means test system introduced.  At least, we are back to a position of certainty for those aged over 70 years, which is to be welcomed.  It is interesting that it is happening at approximately the same time as we are receiving the first strong projections on the take-up by GPs of the scheme for those aged under six years at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Some of the difficulties in the scheme can be ironed out.  Obviously, if the figure remains at 50%, it will be unsatisfactory. I hope further time and negotiations will help to resolve the issue.</p> <p>Everybody appears to be at one in attempting to move towards some degree of universal health care provision.  I have been here long enough to have heard all of the debates and proposals on the Canadian, Australian and Dutch models and sometimes one would think we were talking about a Miss World contest.  There is general political agreement that we want every citizen to be fully covered by the provision of at least very basic health care.  It has always struck me as unusual when we have had the great political debates on and divides about health care that, since the foundation of the State, whether due to political decision making or the scheme of administration we inherited from the British, we have had, for all its faults, a very basic but effective scheme of universal education.  Every child has access, in the broad sense of the word, to free education at primary, secondary and now third level.  If we can do it in education, we should be able to do it in the health care system.  However, we have a long way to go.</p> <p>Reading the briefing notes on progress in providing for universal health care and what has and has not happened since 2011, I appreciate that there have been many road blocks and that the final product may be very different from what was initially proposed a number of years ago.  All of us together must try to ensure that, to use the phrase often used, the state of citizens' health should not depend on the size of their wealth.  That should be our starting principle.  I have never engaged very much in the debate on public versus private health care.  As long as health care is provided, the provider does not concern me greatly.</p> <p>Where does the scheme fit in in the move towards universal health care?  Is it a component or a separate part?  Senator John Gilroy also raised this question.  Is it expected that in the next stage it will be rolled out to those aged under 12 years and over 60, for example?  It would still be a welcome stand-alone solution to a problem.  Part of the problem has been that the over-70s, for a limited period, had a so-called free medical card which was then withdrawn.  That problem needed to be solved and this measure will solve it.  Is it a separate resolution of that issue or an integral part of a universal health care model?  I welcome it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we can do it for over-70s and get GP buy-in, which appears to have been obtained, we can, I hope, manage it at the other end of the spectrum as well.</p><p>Many GPs have expressed to me in a fair and balanced way their strong concerns about some of the implications of the under-sixes scheme.  Some feel simply that it is not fair that children, regardless of income, have access to care, while others fear the knock-on effects in their surgeries with the number of people arriving under the scheme.  I hope the Minister and Minister of State are at least taking their concerns seriously.  We must all recognise that if only 50% of GPs have signed up to a proposed national scheme, it is not a protest but rather a sign of problems which need to be addressed on an ongoing basis.  As such, I welcome the legislation and look forward to the Minister of State's response to our observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#QQ00200"><p>I thank everyone who made a contribution to the debate.  It is such a small Bill that it is difficult to take it apart and analyse it.  I have always listened to and respected what Senator John Crown has to say as anyone who works within the system must be listened to, but in my view this is an incredible step in relation to the circumstances of the country.  I am not talking about the economic circumstances now, but about where we find ourselves and the type of access we have had to primary care in the main in the past.  Once one has a means-tested system, one will always have someone who is just outside of it.  There is always the hard case in that scenario.  We would love to be able to introduce a system of universality right across the population but we cannot, unfortunately, afford that right now.</p> <p>There are issues around the principles attached to this.  As Senator Bradford rightly points out, we do not ask people to pay for the education of their children no matter what their income is.  We take it as a given.  It is a benefit to the country that people are educated and, therefore, we find that investment is good for both the population and the country.  Good health is equally important and as beneficial to the country as a whole as it is to the individual, which is hugely important.  This is a significant step.  For the first time ever, we are rolling out universality to a particular block of people and that will progress.  The promise in the programme for Government is that it will extend to 12 year olds, which is what Senator Gilroy asked about.  That is to say children of primary school age will be covered and then it will progress to 18 year olds.  There is no commitment beyond that.  However, it is hoped it will move on to a different cohort under the next Government, which, again it is hoped, will be composed of the parties to the current Administration.  I hope it will move to the group of people who are the wealth producers and who should be the healthiest within the community.  That is a significant step forward.  Other countries looking in at us will probably say: "What is the big deal?  We have always had this."  That simply indicates how far behind we have been in terms of how we have provided access to health care to people.</p> <p>I note to Senator Crown that, thankfully, this is one of the few areas for which I do not have direct responsibility even though I have a huge interest in what happens in our accident and emergency units and acute hospitals.  I hope the changes we are making in primary care will have an impact on the acute hospitals.  They should.  Another programme we are about to roll out very shortly is the minor surgeries programme for which we have earmarked 20 sites nationally.  At these, minor surgery will be carried out in the GP surgery setting.  That should have an impact on our accident and emergency units and attendance at our acute hospitals.  The building up of the primary care sector should relieve the pressure on our acute hospitals.  I will not say here and now that it will, nor will Senator Crown, as we cannot be certain.  However, I cannot think of any other way to do it other than to ensure people who have a difficulty with their health go to the most appropriate place.  That is rarely an accident and emergency unit, which should be reserved for exactly what is indicated in the protocol.</p> <p>The asthma checks are simply for the under-six cohort.  We already have dedicated specialist nurses in place in certain primary care settings.  I note to Senator Thomas Byrne that, as we all know, asthma is about control and management and we hope this will benefit children into the future.  As such, this will naturally continue along in the process of the roll-out of the medical card to under-12s and under-18s.  I am hopeful about that.</p> <p>I heard recently on "Morning Ireland" something that comes up time and again, which is that we are giving medical cards to the children of wealthy people while sick children are not getting it.  The number of discretionary medical cards has increased since January 2015 from 50,000 to more than 80,000.  It is a better and more sensible and sensitive way of doing things.  Any child in those circumstances who makes the right case to the PCRS will get a very good hearing.  The discretionary element of the scheme is how it should be handled as no one wants to see a family with a child in distress having to go through the trauma of trying to get the services they need.  That is one way of dealing with it.</p> <p>I have already noted that we are rolling out minor surgery at 20 sites nationally.  If the project is seen to work, we will roll it out further.  All of these things coming together should provide greater access to primary care at local level.  At the end of the day, the last place most people want to be is in hospital unless there is no other alternative.  We all want to be treated near our own homes and in the most appropriate setting possible.</p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House.  It is a good piece of work for the country and while it is a fulfilled promise and commitment of the Government, every politician should be able to take pride in it.  It is something we will look back on and ask why we did not do this sooner.</p></speech>
