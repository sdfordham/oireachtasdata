I am raising the issue of the ongoing ISIS threat because I am seriously concerned that, from an international perspective, neither the European Union nor, in particular, the United States is taking with sufficient seriousness the profound threat to what I would deem to be civilisation being posed by ISIS.  When we hear of a group which brings along a body of six year old children to watch a beheading for educational purposes, we are starkly reminded of that with which it is we are dealing.  Over the past number of years, the ISIS group has ploughed with alarming and frightening effect through Syria and Iraq to gain a major stronghold in these geographical areas.</p> <p>During the course of the 20th century, the world had to deal with and eventually prevailed over threats from fascism, nazism and communism.  In ISIS, we are dealing with a group which is just as dangerous, deranged and ideologically driven as those other groupings.  There has been a campaign of terror, cultural vandalism and religious fundamentalism which is of such sufficient concern to us that we have to ensure there is a much stronger international response to ISIS.  The group poses a threat to civilisation and to a peaceful world order.  It is posing an immediate threat to the broader middle Eastern area of the world.  In the medium to long term, it is a threat to the Western world and western civilisation.  I am, therefore, both concerned and disappointed with the apparent total lack of a response by the broader international community.</p> <p>The G7 group of countries met during the week.  They had many pressing matters to consider but I did not read any great reports of progress on tackling the ISIS threat.  The Administration of President Obama - a wonderful Administration which was to bring about hope and change - is now of such irrelevant import, it does not even appear to have a policy.  The European Union presumably has a policy but we are not seeing any action.  I am not sure what is the Irish involvement in the EU policy and I would like to hear from the Minister in that regard.  Above all, I want the Minister to assure me that he, his officials, the Government and the Department are taking this matter seriously and that there will be a ramping up by the EU of action and of whatever type of intervention to which we can commit ourselves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Bradford:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=73"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=73&amp;amp;pid=PaulBradford&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Without abusing the words of a former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, the world's civilisation cannot stand idly by.  It is depressing, culturally, to see monuments thousands of years old being destroyed and cities and a civilisation being buried in ashes.  That is bad, but we have also seen beheadings and other forms of execution, terror and the displacement of entire populations.  That is not only a profound human rights issue but must also concern everybody interested in world peace and order.  It is not a question of seeing if ISIS can be contained, as there is no place in the world's civilisation for a group like it.  It must be tackled and removed from the map, politically and militarily.  We must see the start of a substantive campaign against it in the near future.  I would like to hear the Minister's observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015061100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senator for facilitating this debate in the Seanad.  As he stated, it is an important issue.  </p> <p>The barbaric violence and culture of hatred which fuel the ISIS campaign of terror are utterly unacceptable to Ireland and the wider world and a threat to the values of freedom and human dignity which we fundamentally espouse.  ISIS's actions are harmful, first and foremost, to the people of the Middle East region, especially women and girls; ethnic and religious minorities such as Christians and Yazidis; members of the gay community; and other vulnerable groups that are the principal victims of its inhumane actions.  I also condemn the wilful destruction of cultural artefacts and ancient buildings in the Middle East, the cradle of civilisation, as it constitutes irreplaceable losses to the history of humankind.</p> <p>The ideology of ISIS is based on totalitarianism, denying all freedoms and rights to the people of the region in pursuit of a perverted interpretation and extremist implementation of religious doctrine.  ISIS is a radical group which is seeking to consolidate its power across much of the Middle East and expand its territorial control, widening the threat to the lives and human rights of millions of people across the region.  It poses a limited threat to the European Union, including Ireland, but there can be little doubt about its ambitions to export Its violence and terror to Europe.  We are working closely with our partners in the European Union and through the United Nations to co-ordinate our efforts and strengthen the tools at our disposal.</p> <p>The February Foreign Affairs Council conclusions set out five priorities in combating terrorism internationally.  They are the strengthening of partnerships with key countries, supporting capacity building, countering radicalisation and violent extremism, promoting international co-operation and addressing underlying factors and crises.  Following a special meeting of the European Council, EU Heads of State and Government set out a range of priorities to guide further work by the Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils.  These priorities were set out under three headings - ensuring the security of citizens, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values and co-operating with our international partners.  The approach being taken by the European Union is consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2178 on foreign terrorist fighters which was adopted unanimously on 24 September 2014.  Ireland co-sponsored the resolution, with 103 other states, including all other EU member states.  The resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights-compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy in the resolution is in line with Ireland's approach to the issue.</p> <p>Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  An attack on Ireland is possible, but it is assessed as not likely.  There is no specific information on a threat to this country.  There are a small number of people based here who support extremism.  Their activities are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which also keeps the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in the light of ongoing developments and continues to take appropriate measures to counteract it.  In this, it has the full support of the Government.  In tandem with this, the Garda operates a progressive community relations programme in engaging with all minority communities in the State through the racial, intercultural and diversity office.</p> <p>Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been very active in this area.  With regard to preventive measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movement of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour.  With regard to the capacity to prosecute, existing legislation, dating from 2005, provides for the offences of terrorist bombing and terrorist financing.  We recently passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015 which created the three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.</p> <p>A comprehensive solution to the challenge posed by ISIS must also embrace efforts to promote a political settlement in Syria based on the Geneva Principles, as well as international support for the new unity government in Iraq, encouraging the Iraqi Government to pursue inclusivity and reconciliation.  We also recognise the immense humanitarian impact of the current conflict and have committed over &euro;41 million to humanitarian relief since the beginning of the Syrian conflict.</p></speech>

When the ISIS media watchers take note of his answer, they will be reminded of <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i>in keeping its eye on Russia.  That will be the impact of the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The media watchers may read about our support for capacity building and our co-sponsoring of UN resolutions and ask, &quot;So what?&quot;  The Minister has stated ISIS poses a limited threat to the European Union, which is a fair statement of fact.  Does he concede that the current campaign and the geographical advancement of ISIS into Syria bring it within a short plane journey of the Italian border?  Does he concede that, as we are thinking about the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union in the medium to long term, the border of the European Union could be within a short hop of ISIS-dominated territory?  What are we going to do in that regard?  The Minister did not mention any engagement with the United States.  Is there active engagement by the European Union with the United States and the Obama Administration to see if this threat can be taken more seriously?</p></speech>

There is an ongoing programme of interaction between the European Union and the United States.  Only recently the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, visited the United States and she has been particularly active on this issue since assuming office in November.  Our position, notwithstanding the Senator's exhortation that Ireland should do more, is, as I outlined, that we consider matters from a domestic perspective.  We also have influence within the 28 member European Union bloc.  Later this month the European Council will review progress in the implementation of the European Union's counter-terrorism agenda.  It includes a number of strands, including tackling the phenomenon that is foreign terrorist fighters, countering terrorist content on the Internet, improving international co-operation and information sharing, including through the adoption of the EU passenger name records directive.  Other elements include constructive engagement with third states.  In this context, I refer particularly to the Senator's comments on Turkey.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am anxious to ensure there is constructive engagement between the EU states and Turkey which, as Senator Bradford will recognise, is the main gateway for foreign fighters into Syria.</p><p>On the domestic front, Senator Bradford is familiar with the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act which was debated here before Christmas and I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, would be happy to address the House again on the domestic approach to this important issue.  We have a two-pronged approach, domestic and international.  As Senator Bradford has urged, the European Union regards this issue as a high priority in terms of its engagement on the international stage.</p></speech>

After 15 years, numerous Ministers with responsibility for education and countless false starts, the Holy Family school in Cootehill remains very much in limbo in regard to the provision of new accommodation.</p> <p>As can be attested by many, the school is an outstanding facility, with a committed staff, a supportive board of management and an active parents association.  On a visit I paid to the school, I was very impressed by the dedication of the staff and the commitment of the parents, particularly when we take into consideration the premises and existing resources.  The urgent need for the provision of a new school is obvious to any visitor to the school or to anyone who speaks to parents or staff who have experienced at first hand the cramped conditions pupils and staff must contend with.</p> <p>As of the start of this month, the new school is at the architectural planning stage, but it is not part of the five-year programme for investment in infrastructure or jobs package.  When I looked at recent parliamentary questions on school funding, this school was on the last status list of school building projects.  Unfortunately, since I came to this House and since this issue has been raised by me and other public representatives and members of the community, we have been receiving the same reply to our questions in regard to this school.  There seems to be no commitment to make financial provision for the project.</p> <p>The Minister may not be aware that the Holy Family school in Cootehill caters for people with severe and profound learning disabilities and moderate and multiple learning disabilities and for people with autism.  Reports forecast that in the coming September the student population will increase from 143 to in excess of 150 for the first time ever, with 21 new children expected to start in the autumn.  The school and board of management do not want to turn children away because of the need to bus students to another premises.  They do not want to turn students away because there is a need for this vital service.</p> <p>What needs to happen in order that this project can progress to the funding stage?  What is the cause of the delay and how can we overcome that?  It is not acceptable that accommodation must be rented to cater for the number of pupils.  This is not an issue that has just arisen.  The issue has been on the departmental, ministerial and local representative agendas for well over a decade and has cropped up frequently in parliamentary questions over recent years, but there has been little progress.  We hear a great deal of talk about the importance of education, cherishing all the children of the nation equally and ensuring those with special educational needs are not disadvantaged in our system, but the reality tells a different story.  The test is delivery in the classroom.</p> <p>The premises in Cootehill are not fit for purpose and are too cramped.  The teachers and the staff are doing sterling work.  Without their dedication and without the tireless work and campaigning of parents and the community, the situation would be even worse.  I am sure that, due to the extensive lobbying on the issue, the Minister for Education and Skills is aware the premises are not fit for purpose.  We need to deal with bottlenecks in the system as a priority.  This is an essential spend rather than a discretionary one, so we need to deal with the problems and overcome them as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by almost 37,000 pupils by 2016 and are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak in 2019.  To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools and extend or replace a number of existing schools in areas where population growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p> <p>Holy Family school, Cootehill, is a multi-denominational special needs school.  The school is co-educational and caters for pupils from four to 18 years. The school caters for pupils with moderate learning disabilities, severe or profound learning disabilities and pupils with autism.  Enrolments at Holy Family school for the school year 2014-2015 were 136 pupils, an increase of 16% over the past five years.</p> <p>The brief for the major building project for Holy Family school, Cootehill is to provide a new 21-classroom special school and appropriate ancillary accommodation, with associated car parking, a bus drop-off, a sports pitch, play areas, a sensory garden and site boundary treatment.  The project to provide the permanent accommodation for Holy Family special school is currently at stage 2a, development design, of the architectural planning process.  In order to complete stage 2a design, it recently became necessary to appoint a replacement consultant mechanical and electrical engineer to the design team.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 May 2015 and the appointment of the new engineer will be concluded shortly.  The replacement engineer will be involved with the existing design team members in the completion of the mechanical and engineering elements of the design.  Thereafter, subject to no further issues arising, the project will progress to the conclusion of stage 2b, with the completion of tender documents.  Planning permission, fire safety certification and disability access certification have already been obtained for the project.</p> <p>School building projects, including the new school for the Holy Family special school, which have not been scheduled for construction in the current five-year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stage in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being made available to the Department in future years.  The project for Holy Family special school remains available to be considered for further progress in that context.</p></speech>

The response mentioned that the appointment of a new engineer will be concluded shortly.  I hope this is a priority and that it happens as soon as possible without any further delay.  The Department stresses that demographic growth is a priority when it comes to extending or replacing schools.  I must stress the serious issues relating to the cramped conditions in this school.  For example, there are serious issues for children in wheelchairs and the logistics of getting into and out of cramped rooms.  These conditions are no way ideal and the education of some children is being disrupted.  I ask the Minister to relay that to his colleague.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-06-11a.23" nospeaker="true" time="10:30:00" ><p>Annaghdown is on the shores of Lough Corrib.  It is a beautiful location but along with that comes comes national heritage area, NHA, and special area of conservation, SAC, restrictions.  It is about 12 miles from Galway.  This is a matter of public interest as only one burial plot remains.  The local community set up the Annaghdown cemetery committee in May 2013 - just over two years ago - and it has exhausted every avenue.  It worked with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht's office to extend the current graveyard and to explore other suitable sites.  It identified another nearby site of 3.4 or 3.5 acres but that would cost &euro;100,000.  The entire budget for Galway County Council for cemeteries for the year is &euro;100,000.  This is not viable.  The maximum amount of money Galway County Council will pay is &euro;10,000 an acre.</p><p>When the committee surveyed the local community, everyone in Annaghdown, some 200 people in total, was looking to buy burial plots.  It struck me quite forcefully that the people who were most exercised about this were young people.  They felt it absolutely essential that within their parish they would have available to them a burial plot.  Last Monday morning I met a delegation from Annaghdown cemetery committee at a meeting facilitated by the good cathaoirleach of Galway County Council, Councillor Mary Hoade.  In attendance were all other Deputies and public representatives.  That was the first time I realised the absolute impending crisis and seriousness of this matter.  One woman said that if she was buried in another cemetery, be it Killachunna, Creggs or Claregalway, she would personally come back to haunt those present.  Such is the depth of feeling and worry about the fact that there is only one site left.  Where will people go when they need to be buried?  This is a crisis.  My request, which I am asking the Minister to relay to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is to have her use her discretion, as has been done in the past and I have the precedents, to give permission to extend Annaghdown cemetery.</p><p>The cemetery is within the shadow of a national monument.  There have been extensive digs and so forth and all that has been found - listen to this - is iron ore and some buttons.  When the National Library was contacted, it said it was not interested and to store them in a garage.  That does not sound hectic to me, but the public need and the public good is very important in this situation.  I spoke to the previous Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.  He granted an extension to Clogheen graveyard in Tipperary and I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, this morning who said that it has been very successful.  Other exceptions are on the record, including exceptions for Kerry, Cork, Athlone Castle, Athlone Art Gallery, the Medieval Walls of Athenry and Turoe Stone in Galway.  I have a list of a number of other areas.  I think the Minister gets the picture.  It is of impending public interest locally in Annaghdown and I ask the Minister to facilitate this request for an extension to Annaghdown graveyard.</p></speech>

Reconciling reasonable and understandable aspirations of local communities to continue the tradition of burial in or near their local historic burial ground with the need to preserve and protect the archaeological heritage is always a difficult task.  On behalf of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the efforts her Department has been making to achieve this in the case of Annaghdown graveyard over the past number of years.</p> <p>I listened with intent to the threat of one of Senator Healy Eames constituents to come back and haunt everyone.  I am wondering if the Minister for Foreign Affairs is included in that threat or is it the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht who will be primarily the subject matter of the haunting. </p> <p>I would like to first explain briefly the major archaeological and historical importance of Annaghdown.  The ruined ecclesiastical buildings at Annaghdown were among the very first such structures to come into State care as national monuments.  They represent the site of a major early historic monastery, one which was of such importance that it became a diocesan centre when dioceses were first established in Ireland as part of the great 12th century church reform.  It has long been established by archaeological research that the core of an important early historic monastery was very likely to have been surrounded by an extensive settlement, the surviving buried remains of which are today of great archaeological interest.  The importance of the site at Annaghdown is reflected in the strong legal protection afforded it under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004, which legal protection the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is charged with implementing.  The ruins of the ancient monastery are in the ownership of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the graveyard is in the ownership of the local authority.  Section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 as amended by the 2004 Act makes works affecting national monuments of which the Minister or local authority are owners subject to a requirement of the consent from the Minister.  This requirement also extends to any ground disturbance in proximity to such a national monument.</p> <p>I will now set out for the House the dealings the Department has had with the local community group at Annaghdown in respect of the proposed extension to the graveyard.  In 2013, the national monuments service of the Department had extensive discussions with the local graveyard committee with regard to a proposed graveyard extension.  This resulted in an agreement to assess the possibility of a small extension to the north of the graveyard.  Following initial examination, which indicated a high probability of archaeological finds in the area, the local committee decided to look for other potential sites and did not proceed with the detailed assessment.  In 2014, the local community found a landowner who was willing to sell a plot of ground across the road to the east of the existing graveyard.  However, following archaeological test excavation in January 2014, carried out in accordance with a consent granted by the Minister, it was established that this site was, on the grounds of importance of archaeological features there, unsuitable for any development.</p> <p>The local committee then approached the Department again about a site immediately to the north of the existing graveyard and applied for permission to carry out archaeological test excavation.  The Minister granted consent for this and it was carried out in December 2014.  The results indicated that very important archaeological features are present there and, in particular, confirming that the monastery at Annaghdown was surrounded by a substantial enclosure, a very important archaeological find which adds considerably to the interest and national importance of Annaghdown.  On that basis, the site must be considered unsuitable for development.</p> <p>In March of this year, a professional archaeologist made inquiries with the Department on behalf of the local graveyard committee about the possibility of developing a different site for a graveyard extension.  This site, as currently proposed, would require a new entrance on to the public road.  The entrance and access route proposed would cross through the field where the important archaeological features were uncovered in January 2014.  The Department has advised that archaeological investigation of the site would be appropriate given its size and proximity to the site of the ancient monastery.  Such investigations would again require the consent of the Minister but the Department has not yet received any application for this.  The Department has also advised that the proposed entrance and access road should be relocated to the north western boundary of the site in order to avoid the areas of archaeological significance.  As is evident, the Department has sought and continues to seek to work with the local community to achieve a solution to the question of how to protect the nationally important archaeological heritage at Annaghdown while facilitating as far as possible the desire of the local community for a new burial ground in the vicinity.  This will continue to be the approach taken by officials of the Department and they will be happy to discuss the matter further with representatives of the local community and public representatives.</p></speech>

Everything he said has been documented to me as well in a list of 22 actions taken by the local committee.  We are gravely aware of the situation.  With respect to the Minister, the answer is disappointing and he will appreciate why.  My question to the Minister was whereto next after one more death in the community.  Where will the local people be buried?  Given their desire and, I think, right to be buried locally and given that Galway County Council does not have the money to purchase a site for &euro;100,000, I am wondering, at a human level, what news or consolation can I bring to the community?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Minister outlined, the people have done and exhausted every option.</p></speech>

The Department worked closely with the local community group in Annaghdown to resolve what was a difficult and complex issue.  It required the reconciliation of the aspirations of the local community with the highly important and appropriate protection of the nationally important heritage site.  I am sure the local community is justifiably proud of the national heritage site in the area.  Officials of the Department have met the local community and will continue to do so.  In the past there was no difficulty in the receipt of the appropriate legal consent.  It will enable the assessment to take place of the suitability of the proposed new location of the burial ground.  It is important that there be an ongoing process of interaction between the local community group, the local authority and local public representatives.  Working closely together, the Department and the local community will arrive at a decision which will take appropriate account of the competing-----</p></speech>

I commend her for the work she has done on the issue of rural development since her appointment and the work that has been done to date on the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  This Commencement matter relates to that issue and it is extremely important that we have clarity on it.</p> <p>I understand the process so far is based on a model being used across Europe for the allocation of funding.  European funds comprise 65% of the funding available, while Exchequer funds comprise the remaining 35%.  I also understand expressions of interest were sought from community groups across the country.  The closing date for the receipt of expressions of interest was 15 May.  How many of the applications have been decided by virtue of the fact that there was just one in each county area?  In how many are there multi applications and how will it finally be decided which group will receive funding?</p> <p>The second issue is the role of local councillors, which is extremely important.  In each local community development company, LCDC, there are four elected representatives among the 17 members of the LCDC in each administrative area.  I have been contacted by many councillors to seek clarity on what role they should play.  As the closing date for the receipt of applications was 15 May, not much work has yet been done as they are awaiting the allocation of funding.  They are in limbo as they do not know what they are supposed to be doing.  They are also anxious to understand and be informed about the governance procedures in the administration of this funding.  Is it the responsibility of the local authority and how will the system operate?</p> <p>Has any training been provided for the new development companies as entities?  I was a member of the first enterprise board set up in County Tipperary in 1991 and there was extensive training provided for the members of the board which was composed of a number of pillars from industry, the community and elected representatives.  As there was extensive training provided, we could understand our role and positions as directors of a company.  Perhaps the Minister of State might provide clarity on that issue also.  These are the questions councillors have been asking me about the process.  This is part of the Minister of State's functions in rural development and very important.</p> <p>In the past five years, in respect of development companies, 4,000 jobs have been created in rural Ireland, a massive amount.  I realise unemployment is decreasing, including in rural areas.  Councillors are chomping at the bit to get their hands on this money in order that they can play an effective role in the task we all face of bringing down unemployment and creating sustainable jobs.  In many cases, they are jobs in small companies, but they last a long time.  I have experience of this as a former member of an enterprise board for many years.  Many of the jobs created in the early 1990s were sustained throughout the recession.  This is proof positive that the money the Exchequer expends on this initiative - &euro;65 million, with a further &euro;153 million coming from the European Union - is money very well spent and gives value for money for the taxpayer.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

In the process we are trying to carry out with Leader funding and the LCDC as the implementer of the funding available, my main objective is not to get too caught up in the process in order that it becomes an entity in itself but to get the money to those on the ground.  That is my first priority.  I will outline the current position on the process.  </p> <p>The selection process for Leader local development strategies is not yet complete, which means that I cannot comment on the final outcome.  In this context, no contract has yet been awarded to any entity to deliver the Leader elements of the rural development programme 2014-20.  My Department is working to ensure the selection process will be completed as soon as possible and I am optimistic that the first contracts will be awarded and the strategies operational in the autumn.  That is my main priority.  I am aware that people are preparing their local development strategies.  In cases where the local development strategies are approved by the independent evaluation committee there is no reason for delay.  There will be a period in which contracts will have to be awarded, but my priority is to get the money to where it needs to be spent to support communities.</p> <p>Ireland is conducting a two-stage process for the selection of Leader local development strategies and both stages will be assessed by an independent selection committee.  The first stage, expressions of interest, was open to any local group with an interest in supporting the delivery of Leader funding at a local level.  A total of 45 expressions of interest were submitted by the closing date in respect of the 28 sub-regional areas specified in the expressions of interest documentation.  In areas where multiple expressions of interest were received my Department has given an undertaking to facilitate discussions between the relevant entities with a view to engaging all parties and, if possible, reaching an agreement to develop one coherent local development strategy for their area.  These meetings commenced last week and will continue for as long as is required.  In the meantime, I expect all expressions of interest to be presented to the independent selection committee for assessment and decision by late June.  Following this, preparatory support will be made available to all local action groups selected by the committee.  That is where the support will be provided.</p> <p>Entities successful on stage 1 will be invited to move to stage 2, the local development strategy, LDS, development phase.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ann Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They will be allowed a minimum of six months to develop their strategies but some of them will have their strategies completed much earlier because they are all working at getting them in place.</p><p>Technical support for the process of selection of local development strategies will be provided to the selection committee by Pobal.  That is another area where there will be support.  The system of governance and management in place for the new programme will be documented in the Department's Operating Rules for the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  These rules are influenced by the EU regulations governing the programme, with all the checks and balances in the EU regulations incorporated into the operating rules.  My Department is currently drafting these rules with a view to having an outline version available for stage 2 of the selection process.</p><p>I assure the Deputy that I do not see any reason for delay.  Some counties may not have their strategy developed as quickly as others but this Leader process is quite different from the previous one.  It was only when everything was ready that the last Leader roll-out could go ahead.  In this case, counties that are ready to go will be allowed to go.  If somebody has their strategy developed there is no reason they cannot get up and running with it.</p></speech>

In that regard I hope people can come together, not hold up the process and reach a compromise.  I spoke to councillors across the country in recent days in preparation for this and in some counties they have one application.  Limerick is an example where three different groups came together and made one application, and they will be ready to draw down the funding.  It is important that people are sensible about this and as the Minister of State said, everybody wants to get this process up and running.  I hope common sense will prevail to ensure that the applications will be submitted.</p> <p>In terms of rules, etc., I am pleased that there will be an application in regard to governance because that is extremely important.  In the early 1990s, governance was a major issue in an area not too far from me in respect of a similar type of enterprise.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State.  I wish her the best of luck with the continuing work she is doing in rural development.  She came up through that process, as did I, and it is critical that we continue that work.  I look forward to working with her on this and other issues.</p></speech>

It is an open and transparent process, and that is what everybody would want.</p> <p>I take the point about governance.  Governance is very important and under the local government process, and the new alignment process, increased powers have been given to county councillors.  It is very important that the councillors are at a level that is close to the community in terms of how they represent their areas and draw down funding for those areas, albeit that they are in the local development strategy.  The Department will be providing training.</p> <p>The moneys for each county have already been decided on, and the Senator's common sense approach would be welcome.  I hope that common sense will prevail.  My interest lies in helping communities that need this rural development money get it in the smoothest and quickest way because it is very important that disadvantaged areas get their slice of the cake in that regard.</p></speech>

We lost that vote 17 to 24.  Now the Government is acting but it is after the horse has bolted.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, who is in prison in Egypt.  Amnesty International has said he is entirely innocent of all the charges he is facing.  He has been in prison for 666 days - one year, nine months, 28 days.  No trial has been held to date.  A new trial date, the sixth, has been set for August but that could also be postponed.  In a note he smuggled out from prison, he said that he wakes up to the screams of people being tortured and wonders whether he will be next.</p> <p>The Government needs to act.  The Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade has asked that these Houses send out a delegation.  If Members opposite would like to visit this Irish citizen in prison in Egypt, they should join that committee delegation if it receives permission from the Government to go.  The Government needs to act as well and the Taoiseach needs to get involved in the same way the Prime Ministers of Canada and Australia got involved in similar situations where their citizens were being held in prison in Egypt under President Sisi.  The Government has not acted to date.  If Ibrahim Halawa was a Catholic from Mayo rather than a Muslim from Dublin there might be more action.  He was born in Ireland, was 17 years of age when he was arrested and has been in prison for two years.</p> <p>The Government's policy on Roscommon and its mental health services is a matter of concern.  It involves the most vulnerable people in our society - those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and mental health issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Daly: :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To quote Dr. Kelly: "The Government's policy in Roscommon re ... the Rosalie unit in Castlerea in tantamount to elderly abuse."

For many years I have spoken about the situation of Dublin on a non-partisan basis and some weeks, or a couple of months ago, I referred to the dereliction of the Georgian core, which I have repeatedly drawn to the attention of the city authorities.  One of the houses I mentioned in North Frederick Street collapsed.  There is a whole series of situations where people are discriminated against.  In the living city initiative, Dublin was excluded and now there is a square footage limit which deliberately and specifically excludes Georgian restoration, so there is no incentive.</p> <p>Finally, there is the Dublin City traffic management plan which is absolutely asinine.  I rode a bicycle for many years and was knocked off three times on O'Connell Street.  Now we have cyclists who are gone absolutely mad.  Apparently they are not required to wear helmets, although it is the law that they should.  They cycle the wrong way up streets, they cycle on the footpaths, they cycle against red lights and so on and meanwhile cars are going to be banned.  My journey from North Great George's Street to this House will be impossible.  Suffolk Street is going to be closed and the College Green gate is going to be implemented.  Why is it that people in the inner city were never given recognition for living in the inner city?  Nothing is done to facilitate them.  I suggest we recommend to the authorities that, just as in Jerusalem which has a different coloured place for people who live in the old city, we should introduce that system here to allow people who live in the city not to be imprisoned in their houses but to get in and out in their motor cars.  There is a terrible prejudice against the private motor car in the city.  It is just asinine.  One has only to look at the back gate of Trinity College where metal spikes have been erected and a path built, resulting in larceny, crashes and traffic jams.  It is deliberately using the infrastructure of the city in a manner that is dangerous to the users of cars and pedestrians.  I call for a debate on the city of Dublin with particular emphasis on the Dublin traffic plan.</p></speech>

The advances we have made when it comes to cycling and walking in this city are fantastic.  At the same time, I agree entirely with Senator Norris.  We do not have the climate, first and foremost, to be constantly on foot or bicycle in this country.  While the ideal is that we would have people on foot and reduce congestion, we need to remember the motorist in the context of the overall debate on how we move around our city.  I support Senator Norris in his call.</p> <p>An issue I wish to raise briefly is that of inheritance tax.  This is a matter we could usefully debate in the House.  It has come to light recently that the rate at which the tax is imposed is the seventh highest among countries that are members of the OECD.  The tax kicks in here at a much lower value than other western countries.  By way of example, in Britain the exemption from the tax is set at almost &pound;450,000 for one category while in Germany it is &euro;380,000.  This report shows that compared with the United Kingdom, a person here will pay far more when she inherits.  In Ireland, the capital acquisitions tax is imposed at a rate of 33% on amounts over &euro;225,000 for a son or daughter.  The rate has soared from 20% in 2008 and the tax-free threshold has been cut in half.</p> <p>This makes it all quite onerous on people if they inherit even a modest house.  Families are suddenly being hit with serious inheritance tax bills this year as rising property prices push them over exemption limits.  Revenue currently allows people to pay over a period but at an interest rate of 8% per year if families choose to pay by instalments.  Given the sums involved, this can sometimes be quite large.  A rate of 8% per year strikes me as onerous.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for reducing the rate of inheritance tax, raising the level at which it kicks in or reducing the rate for interest on instalments.  Certainly, it strikes me as rather punitive.</p> <p>In any event, it is certainly worthy of debate.  The reduction in the tax-free thresholds has resulted in even modest properties, particularly in Dublin, where house prices are higher, being hit with big tax bills.  Many countries have recognised that estate and inheritance taxes are a poor source of revenue and some have eliminated these taxes altogether.  It is worth noting that 13 countries have repealed inheritance tax, including Norway, which is hardly regarded as a tax haven.  I would welcome a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

I know we have had a number of debates with the Minister before, but not specifically on children.  There have been a number of reports in recent weeks about a lack of speech, language and occupational therapists.  A number of campaign groups have sprung up throughout the State in places where, unfortunately, families of children with different forms of disabilities are engaged in battles with the State to get services for their children.</p> <p>There are a number of problems, but the first problem is the absence sufficient therapists.  As we know, therapists sit on diagnostic teams and assessment teams within the HSE.  In the absence of enough therapists, especially senior speech and language therapists and child psychologists, the diagnostic teams are not in a position to provide the diagnoses and assessments as quickly as they should.  In fact, while the HSE policy is that all children should be assessed within three months, we now know from replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister with responsibility for this area that many children are waiting longer than 12 months.  We all accept that this is completely unacceptable.</p> <p>I can give an example in my city of Waterford, where the senior child psychologist post is not filled.  It is vacant.  I was in discussions with senior management in the HSE.  They are concerned about it because it is a specialised area and not a post that can be filled easily.  They now have to look at buying in some of the services simply to carry on with the diagnostic assessments.  I am fearful that children will have to wait longer for these assessments because of a vacuum in respect of these posts.</p> <p>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for that debate, specifically on children with disabilities?  We have had a number of debates with the Minister of State.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she has been very good at coming in to the Seanad to discuss issues in respect of her brief.  This is now a national story.  It was covered in a number of national radio stations, some of which have worked with families, made freedom of information requests and obtained information in respect of the long waiting times.  I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange for that debate as soon as possible.</p></speech>

According to the Eating Disorder Association of Ireland, Bodywhys, up to 200,000 people in Ireland may be affected by eating disorders.  An estimated 400 new cases occur each year and there are up to 80 related deaths annually.  These illnesses affect women and men of all ages and from all walks of life.  In light of these figures, it seems shocking to me that there is no dedicated eating disorder specialist unit in this country.</p> <p>In 2006, A Vision for Change emphasised the need to establish a national centre for eating disorders.  At the time it was proposed to be included in the new children's hospital.  The report also recommended the development of four specialist multidisciplinary teams nationally to deal with eating disorders, one per HSE region, and the provision of 24 public eating disorder beds nationally.  Nine years on from A Vision for Change, there is still no national centre for eating disorders nor have any specialised localised services been developed.  Given the scale of the problem, why is this not being prioritised?  It is clearly a big issue if 80 people are dying annually as a result of eating disorders.</p> <p>Constituents to whom I have spoken and who work with those suffering from eating disorders or who have family members who suffer have made it clear to me how desperately the services are needed.  I have raised the matter with the Minister of Health in the hope that movement can occur to get these services established for the benefit of the thousands of people affected as well as their families.  We need a debate in this House because it is an issue of priority and we need to give it the time it deserves.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister, Deputy White, yesterday launched some type of policy guide or initiative.  I repeat the need to have an urgent debate on media ownership and the desirability of having a balance of ownership in Irish media.  I do so in the context of the recent pronouncement from the Competition Authority in respect of Ryanair's supposed dominance of the Irish market and the view of the Competition Authority that, from an air travel perspective, competition is not only desirable but necessary.  What is good for free trade and free travel should also not only be good but also necessary for the media.  The need for a fair and balanced media presentation is vital in our democracy and media ownership is central to that debate.</p> <p>The disappointing thing about the pronouncement yesterday from the Minister, Deputy White, is that any proposals that would stem from his policy document will not be retrospective.  This means not only that any current dominance in the media will not be challenged but also that it will be literally copper-fastened in law.  It is some since the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, spoke about what she described as the possible Berlusconi media complex in Ireland.  At least in the case of Mr. Berlusconi, while he had a particular agenda, he stood for election.</p></speech>

As she said, it is a particularly punitive tax and the thresholds need to be reviewed in the light of rising property and land prices.  This tax is causing hardship for families who in many cases have to come up with large amounts of cash to pay the taxman following the death of a loved one.  The matter needs to be addressed because we are certainly out of kilter with other countries in Europe on this tax.</p><p>I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 will come into force on 1 July.  The primary purpose of the Act is to make provision for a broad range of health services free of charge to those who had been in the Magdalen laundries.  These women were treated very badly by the State in the past and it is good to see that some efforts are now being made to redress the injustices inflicted on them.</p><p>The services to be provided include general practitioner, medical and surgical services; drugs, medicines and surgical appliances; nursing services; home-help services; dental and ophthalmic services; counselling services; chiropody services; and physiotherapy services.  The Act also provides these women with exemptions from charges for acute inpatient services.  These services are being provided in addition to the other suite of services announced earlier which include <i>ex gratia</i>payments and pension top-ups.  I welcome that this issue, which was never dealt with by any previous Administration, has been addressed by this Government.  A major injustice that was inflicted on many unfortunate women is at last being put to right.</p></speech>

The incidence of malignant melanoma in Ireland has skyrocketed in recent years.  This is a cancer which in its earliest stages should be cured if it is removed with a simple excision of the affected area of the skin, but in many cases it is not cured.  It is a disease that can present with a more advanced disease or which has propensity for relapse.  The scary thing is that historically, this disease when it comes back has been very difficult to treat and is usually fatal.</p> <p>The incidence of the disease has skyrocketed in Ireland in recent years.  This is totally due to increased sun exposure.  As a national group we are not well endowed with defences against the sun.  We were designed for spending our time in the grey misty skies of north-western Europe.  Now that we have more opportunities to access the sun through travel we are seeing a colossal increase.  This is not just some visitation from God.  This is something we do to ourselves and we can do something about it.</p> <p>I will now give the good news.  Last week in Chicago, at the conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, extraordinary data were presented about newer immune system treatments for the minority of patients who have advanced secondary malignant melanoma.  Without boring Members with all the details, this was a large 1,000-patient study.  I am very proud to say approximately 20 members, who were recruited through the All-Ireland Co-operative Oncology Research Group, an organisation which I, along with my colleague John Armstrong founded 17 years ago, were part of this trial and contributed to the data.  More than 50% of patients with this advanced, usually incurable cancer had major remissions of their cancer.  Approximately 20% to 25% of them had a complete disappearance of the cancer.  We believe it is likely that many of those patients will be cured.  So this is a stunning event.</p> <p>The problem is that it will be extraordinarily costly.  The other information that came from Chicago last week is that these types of new immune system treatments, which were of use principally in relatively uncommon cancers, may work in lung cancer, some types of bowel cancer, possibly in bladder cancer and in a variety of other diseases.  So a torrent of data may become available to us over the next year or two that these new and very expensive drugs have life-saving potential.</p> <p>We need to do some forward planning.  There is no doubt that we will be spending a bit more on drugs if we approve these drugs.  I make a specific suggestion to the Government party leadership because we cannot initiate money Bills here or make specific financial proposals.  I would like if somebody in the Government would take on board as a project a plan for the next budget to impose an additional &euro;5 tax on a pack of cigarettes which would be ring-fenced for one purpose only, which would be the provision of expensive drugs and medications for people who get smoking-related diseases.  I would not be so sectarian as to deny my colleagues in cardiology access to this as well.  The money should be designated for the treatment of diseases caused by smoking.</p> <p>This would have the twin effects of raising revenue and disincentivising people from smoking.  I believe this should be done.  We have talked about it in the past.  This country is not good at ring-fencing taxes and the reality is that tax gets a bad rap.  We know what has happened in the past with tax money being frittered away in the financial sector and on things that were completely non-productive.</p> <p>We should take this on board as a policy and ring-fence the &euro;5 additional tax.  We should also put a tax on sunbeds to be used to address the same issue.  We should then completely remove all VAT from sun-protection products, which should be considered as medicinal agents.  Otherwise not only will we have the tragedy of many people - many of them young - getting incurable cancer, but we will also have the financial consequences of paying for the treatments we will not be able to afford, some of which will costs hundreds of thousands of euro.</p></speech>

It purports to provide angel therapy, a non-denominational spiritual healing system.  It may seem like a funny subject until one realises that people are paying &euro;50 or &euro;60 per session to talk to the angels.  Some of the people who have contacted me have other illness, including psychological illnesses.</p> <p>I have done some research into the matter.  It has been in existence since 1958.  Nonetheless, there is no proven benefit to people.  People are entitled to do what they like with their money and people are entitled to provide whatever services they like.  I want the Deputy Leader to inquire from the Revenue and the Minister for Finance as to whether this operation, which is spreading across the country at a rate that only angels could do, is tax compliant and that there is some regulation of it.</p> <p>In the world I live in there is one Lord, one God, but everybody is entitled to believe whatever they want to believe.  Given that this organisation and its workshops are extracting &euro;50 or &euro;60 for an afternoon sitting in a room in the belief that one is being put in contact with angels, some regulation needs to be applied to it.</p></speech>

It was a case I would have raised had I not been acting as Leader today.  It is a matter of grave concern.  I am very happy to seek a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in this House.  I know others are also concerned about it.  Like other Senators, I read the text of the hand-written letter, written by Mr. Ibrahim Halawa in prison.  It is on the record that his family is very concerned about his state of mind as evidenced by the letter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I did ask for a briefing on the case.  I understand Ibrahim's father and sisters met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, last Thursday evening and that his mother is in Egypt.  The two objectives of the Irish Government are to see this Irish citizen being released by the Egyptian authorities in order that he can return to his family and studies in Ireland and to provide consular support to ensure his welfare while he remains in detention.  The matter of immediate concern is the further adjournment of his trial.  As I understand there has been a request from defence lawyers that hearings not take place during Ramadan, the next hearing is scheduled for 2 August.  Ibrahim has received over 40 consular visits since he was first detained, the most recent of which was on Monday, 8 June.  Irish Embassy officials attended the most recent hearing on 3 June and will attend the next hearing on 2 August.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and Cairo continue to provide strong consular support for Ibrahim and his family.  His bail application on 26 April was supported by the Irish Government but was refused, with all of the other bail applications in the case.  The Minister met his Egyptian counterpart following the bail application refusal and discussed the case with him in some detail.  There are ongoing contacts.  However, I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House to address us on the matter and discuss if there is anything further the Irish Government could be doing.  That the matter is before an Egyptian judge and not directly in the purview of the Egyptian Government is a difficulty.  There is immense concern about the conditions in which Ibrahim is being kept, the legality of his detention and the nature of his case.  I take issue with Senator Mark Daly's outrageous statement that there might be a difference in treatment if this Irish citizen was of a different religion.  I take exception to that statement, as addressed by Senator John Gilroy.  We should request the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the matter and I will do so.<br/><br/>Senator Mark Daly also referred non-Government motion No. 16 on the Order Paper on the closure of the Rosalie Unit in Castlerea, County Roscommon.  As it deals with a very specific matter, I suggest it would be more appropriate to raise it by way of a Commencement Matter.  <br/><br/>Senator Paul Coghlan also referred to the case of Ibrahim Halawa and the grave humanitarian concerns raised.  He also welcomed the establishment of the commission of investigation and the appointment of Judge Daniel O'Keeffe.  I echo his views in that regard.  He also spoke about the tremendous work being done by the <i>Le Eithne</i>and the Irish Naval Service in the Mediterranean.  I understand that to date it has saved the lives of 1,153 migrants, which is an amazing achievement.  I join the Senator in sending our commendations to the crew of the <i>Le Eithne</i>.<br/><br/>Senator David Norris called for a debate on the city of Dublin.  I disagree with his remarks in that regard.  It is important that we emphasise the need to facilitate cyclists and pedestrians in the inner city.  For far too long, the car has been king in the inner city, but that is about to change.  I speak as a resident who lives in an area between the canals, as does the Senator, and a regular cyclist.  This is not about climate conditions, as those who are all-weather cyclists wear waterproof clothing.  We need to do more for cyclists and pedestrians.  I am very excited about Dublin City Council's plan under which it is not proposed to ban cars from the city centre but to make College Green, in particular, much more pedestrian and cyclist friendly.  I do agree with the Senator, however, that the council must make provision for those who live in the city and support his proposal on the use of different coloured plates in that regard.<br/><br/>Senator John Gilroy spoke about the bandwagon effect.  I agree with his remarks on the issue, on which I have commented.  I also agree with his comment that the appropriate time to make points in that regard was during the debate last night on the motion on IBRC.  The Senator also referred to the case of Ibrahim Halawa, an issue I have addressed.  He also sought a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on public transport pricing policy.  I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that issue.<br/><br/>Senator Terry Leyden also raised the Roscommon issue.  I have dealt with it.  <br/><br/>Senator Catherine Noone supported Senator David Norris's call for a debate on the city of Dublin.  As I said, I will undertake to arrange such a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  <br/><br/>Senator Catherine Noone also called for a debate with the Minister for Finance on inheritance tax.  It might be better to have that debate prior to the budget.  I will endeavour to arrange it.  <br/><br/>Senator David Cullinane called for a debate on services for children with disabilities.  I remind the Senator that two weeks ago, on 27 May, we had a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on health services for people with intellectual disabilities, during which a number of Senators raised the points raised today by him, including those about waiting lists and the delays encountered by children, in particular.  I will, however, endeavour to arrange a further debate on disability services.  As stated by the Senator, the Minister of State has been proactive in coming to the Seanad for debates.  I am sure she will be happy to do so again.  However, it may not be possible to arrange such a debate bearing in mind that we have a very heavy schedule and that the Minister of State was only recently in the House to discuss a related issue.<br/><br/>Senator Lorraine Higgins spoke about the need for an eating disorder specialist unit.  I agree with her that there is a need to prioritise this issue.  The House is scheduled to hear statements on tackling obesity on Wednesday next, from 3 p.m. until 5 p.m., in the presence of the Minister for Health.  That would be an appropriate time for the Senator to express her concerns.  <br/><br/>Senator Paul Bradford called for a debate on media guidelines, a debate I have previously sought to arrange.  I will, however, endeavour to arrange it.  I agree with the Senator's comments in that regard.  The media merger guidelines published yesterday by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, set out the procedures to be followed when a media merger takes place or is proposed and give guidance on what the Minister will take into account when assessing whether a merger would or would not be in the public interest.  Recent events have caused the issue to be of much greater political significance.</p></speech>

It is under that Act that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has the power to determine whether a proposed media merger would be in the public interest.  I am happy to seek a debate on the matter in the light of recent events.</p> <p>Senator Michael Mullins also called for a debate on inheritance tax.  I will endeavour to arrange such a debate.  The Senator also welcomed the commencement, from 1 July, of the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015.  The Minister's announcement on the commencement of the Act is welcome.  The Senator outlined the purpose of the legislation.  That the survivors of the Magdalen institutions, in particular, are to be adequately provided for is hugely welcome.  As the Senator said, this is a legacy issue.  This is the first Government to deal with what has been a long-standing injustice for the women concerned.</p> <p>Senator John Crown spoke about the skyrocketing increase in the incidence of malignant melanoma.  As stated by him, it is a source of huge concern.  I am sure everybody welcomes the new treatments being trialled which show some positive advances.  I liked the three specific proposals made by the Senator.  Perhaps we might put together a cross-party motion on positive steps that could be taken to deal with this issue, to include a tax on cigarette packages, a tax on sunbeds and the removal of VAT on sun protection products.  I recently had to purchase sun protection creams for children.  It costs a minimum of &euro;10 to buy a small bottle which does not last very long in providing protection for a child exposed to the sun every day while on a sun holiday.  The aforementioned proposals represent practical and useful measures.  We should consider how we might advance them.</p> <p>Senator Denis Landy referred to angel workshops and the issue of divine intervention.  I agree with him that it is a serious matter if people are being exploited.  It raises issues not only on the tax side but also on the trade description side.  There are a number of options we could examine in terms of regulation to ensure there is no exploitation.  I will discuss with the Senator how we might approach the issue.</p></speech>
