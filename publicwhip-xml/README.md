New commits here will happen to individual files *after* their have reached a level of completeness at oireachtas.ie 
which is likely to remain stable.

Warning!
--------

We are able only to release information which has actually been published by the Debates Office at Leinster House. 
They are VERY BAD AT THEIR JOB -- the contents of oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie are often unintelligably-corrupt, 
very incomplete, and sometimes downright incorrect. Therefore we make *no assurances* that contents are complete.

The text in these files is (c) Oireachtas Copyright, each file to its original year of transcription.  The Copyright

in an unbiased fashion.  If that is not your intention, you may be violating copyright by using this material. 
In which case you're totally on your own.
